1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
Staying up late is the best time to watch the heart-pounding moment.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,680
I thought I would never see you again.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,640
Didn't you invite me to drink with you?

4
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,280
Go!

5
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,920
Go!

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,720
Go!

7
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,320
Go!

8
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:33,840
Go!

9
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,520
Go!

10
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,920
Go!

11
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:36,960
Go!

12
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,680
Go!

13
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,920
Go!

14
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,220
Mahjong

15
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,800
I, Lord of Fire, would like to start the vegetable banquetQu trace

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,960
The

17
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,960
The

18
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,960
The

19
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,960
The

20
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,960
The

21
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,960
The

22
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,960
The

23
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,960
The

24
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,960
The

25
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,960
The

26
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,920
The

27
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,920
The

28
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,920
The

29
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,920
The

30
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,720
You are the most beautiful woman in the world.

31
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,160
You are the most beautiful woman in the world.

32
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,520
You are the most beautiful woman in the world.

33
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,720
You are the most beautiful woman in the world.

34
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,640
I heard that Princess Chizu

35
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
doesn't want to marry him.

36
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,600
She already has someone in her heart.

37
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,200
But the wedding

38
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,840
is the only marriage of His Majesty.

39
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,000
If she doesn't marry him,

40
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,480
it's a great risk.

41
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,720
The whole system will be involved.

42
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,800
My Lady,

43
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,520
it's not too late to tell me.

44
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
My Lady,

45
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,920
once you step out of this tent,

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,560
you will never be able to get back.

47
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,160
The Prince and Princess are old.

48
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,680
You are the only daughter.

49
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,600
Can you really give them up?

50
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,360
Even if I stay here,

51
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,560
I won't see them again in my life.

52
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,560
What's the difference between death and life?

53
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,720
The wedding ceremony

54
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,160
is about to start.

55
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,560
I will never marry a man I don't love.

56
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,960
But My Lady,

57
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,920
the person you love

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,480
will never marry you in this life.

59
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,120
My Lady.

60
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,960
Shut up.

61
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,400
Please accept the bride's gift.

62
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,560
Thank you.

63
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,520
Thank you.

64
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,400
Thank you.

65
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Thank you.

66
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,920
Please accept the bride's gift.

67
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,600
Bravo!

68
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,880
First bow.

69
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,720
Second bow.

70
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,880
Third bow.

71
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,200
May the King bless you.

72
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,200
May you live a long life.

73
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,480
Bravo!

74
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,200
Drink.

75
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,560
Drink the wine.

76
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,080
Don't kill me.

77
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,400
Don't kill me.

78
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,560
Don't kill me.

79
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,480
Hurry.

80
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Don't kill me.

81
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
In this life,

82
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,840
no one will force me to marry again.

83
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Who is it?

84
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,920
Cailated's Residence

85
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,220
Master!

86
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,620
How dare you treat you gift

87
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,900
for the things I gave you.

88
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,300
Master,

89
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,140
why are you here all of a sudden?

90
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:32,940
I...

91
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,980
I thought

92
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,500
I would never see you again

93
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,260
in this life.

94
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,660
Didn't you invite me

95
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,260
to drink with you?

96
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,620
Chief?

97
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,260
?

98
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,620
The flower still remains in my palm

99
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,620
It's your words

100
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,620
The moon shines in this life

101
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,620
How I wish to be with you

102
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Give me a life of shining beauty

103
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,620
I am just a piece of jade

104
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,620
How much I don't care about the sky

105
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:05,620
But I don't want to lose the courage to be with you

106
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,620
I am just a piece of jade

107
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,620
But how can you be with me

108
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,620
The first encounter with you and me

109
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:24,620
Is engraved in my heart

110
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,620
Between the six rivers

111
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,260
There are the

112
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,620
Xianzhou, Mingyun Desert, Kongsang, Jiao Ren, and Bingzu

113
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,620
They are all here

114
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,620
Seven thousand years ago

115
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,620
Kongsang Langgan, a piece of Yunhuang

116
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,620
But there are the destroyers Xu Yao, Shanji, and Enie

117
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,620
They are all here

118
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,620
The destroyers have captured Kongsang

119
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,620
There are the King of Yue, An Dou

120
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,620
There are the Jiao Ren, Hai Guo Jun and Bingzu, Shi Wu

121
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,620
They are all here

122
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,620
Yunhuang is about to fall into the trap again

123
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,620
But if God sees the people's happiness

124
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,620
How can he be admired by the world

125
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,620
The mortal is God, the ancient throne has knowledge

126
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,620
Then start from my ten shadows

127
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:53,620
The wind rises as a diap magnesium

128
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,620
and the 저는es fall as snow

129
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,620
The snow in my palace is really anyway

130
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,620
So beautiful

131
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,620
The wind and the flowers are like snow.

132
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,420
The snow in the Jialan Palace is so beautiful.

133
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,620
This is the most beautiful one.

134
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,020
It's the most suitable for His Highness.

135
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,220
Young Master, you helped me.

136
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,020
You said you wanted to give the flowers to the Crown Prince.

137
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,220
Do you know the Crown Prince?

138
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,820
When I give this flower to him,

139
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,220
he'll recognize me.

140
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,420
You want to see him? Why?

141
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
As the Princess of the Chis,

142
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,420
I should learn some powerful ways

143
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,020
to protect the West Desert.

144
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,220
But Father always forbids me

145
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,820
to say that I'm a girl.

146
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,620
I should have a cup of tea with the other little princesses

147
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,220
and have a cup of tea with them.

148
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,820
I'm afraid I can't do that.

149
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,220
I'm afraid I can't do that.

150
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,420
I'm afraid I can't do that.

151
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,620
I can have a cup of tea and do some female work.

152
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,020
It's enough to learn some defense skills.

153
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,220
So, I want to find the Crown Prince

154
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,020
and let him allow me to learn some skills.

155
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,620
Then Father won't forbid me to do that.

156
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,820
Why don't you ask His Majesty for permission?

157
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,420
His Majesty must be like Father.

158
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,820
He's afraid that all girls

159
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,020
should be treated as equals.

160
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,420
But the Crown Prince is different.

161
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,820
He's a gentleman.

162
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,420
He's as handsome as the sun and the moon.

163
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,220
He must understand my feelings.

164
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,820
Her Highness the Queen is here.

165
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
Young Master,

166
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,220
I'll make a move first.

167
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,020
See you.

168
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,020
The sun and the moon are the best.

169
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,620
The spring is beautiful.

170
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,020
Mother.

171
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,620
Chin'er.

172
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Go and get them up.

173
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,220
Okay, I will go, Mother.

174
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,020
Let's go.

175
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,620
Your Highness.

176
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,220
Please allow us to leave first.

177
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,620
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

178
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,620
It's all my fault.

179
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,580
The Imperial Hospital has told me repeatedly

180
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,140
that the fetus is unstable in the womb.

181
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,940
It's not good to be too pregnant.

182
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,460
Please forgive me for not letting you give it to you.

183
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,380
Let me.

184
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,420
Let's go this way.

185
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,700
The Imperial Hospital

186
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,060
But a Jiao people

187
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,860
is just a slave of Kong Sanren.

188
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,380
He's been favored a few times

189
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,900
and forgot his identity.

190
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,180
Shut up.

191
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,820
Jiao people are all people of the Yunhuang.

192
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,060
In the future,

193
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,980
don't make any more prejudice.

194
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,860
Otherwise, you will only cause trouble.

195
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,300
Yunhuang

196
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,940
is our final JASON round!

197
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,900
How can we stop him?

198
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,700
There's an assassin!

199
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,860
No. I'm not an assassin!

200
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,740
I pushed Вы apart.

201
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,860
Her Highness is pregnant.

202
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,380
If anything bad happens to you,

203
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,300
and the daughter of the Chiyu clan.

204
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,260
Is it because your father

205
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,380
doesn't like me to be in the Long Temple

206
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,860
and sent you to offend me on purpose?

207
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,860
No!

208
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,660
Your Highness,

209
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,260
my father knows everything.

210
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,060
I'm doing my job alone.

211
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,140
Please

212
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,060
punish me alone.

213
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,700
How dare you talk back to me?

214
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,660
Give me back my flower!

215
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,700
This flower

216
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,860
is the evidence that you, the Chiyu clan

217
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,700
have harmed me.

218
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,300
Let go of me!

219
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,300
My flower!

220
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,500
Give it back to me!

221
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,100
My flower!

222
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,820
You...

223
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:04,820
You...

224
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,540
Why did you frame my father?

225
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,300
You're so beautiful

226
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,020
but you're so vicious!

227
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,260
Say it again!

228
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:14,900
Stop!

229
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,700
Greetings, Your Highness.

230
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,820
Why are you here, my dear?

231
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,500
You're here to make trouble.

232
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,100
I'm doing my job.

233
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,700
Do you want to

234
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,300
interfere with the harem?

235
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,140
Your Highness?

236
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,580
So he's the Crown Prince.

237
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,220
I've said so many offensive words.

238
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,900
I won't interfere.

239
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,780
But according to the ancestral teachings of Kong Sang,

240
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,340
you need to teach all princes.

241
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,700
It's true.

242
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,020
Are you here to help me?

243
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,900
Since I have my father's blood,

244
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,660
I have to do my duty

245
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,180
to teach the Emperor of Fuzhong.

246
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,620
His Majesty likes to do good deeds.

247
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,980
He'll be the best one to rule the world.

248
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,660
He's a poor and evil man.

249
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,460
He can be exempt from punishment.

250
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,620
Besides, he's a wise man.

251
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,380
Do you agree with me?

252
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,140
Okay.

253
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,140
Since you're here to help me,

254
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,060
let her go.

255
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,700
Let's go.

256
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,980
Yes.

257
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,060
Wait.

258
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,820
What else do you want?

259
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,020
There's an ancestral teaching in Kong Sang Valley.

260
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,500
On the Emperor's birthday,

261
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,740
all princes need to copy ten books

262
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,060
and recite the Emperor's words.

263
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,420
Now the young emperor is still in the palace.

264
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,580
He can only ask his wife to help him

265
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,700
and ask her to go home to copy the books.

266
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,580
You...

267
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,180
You think I'm a Jiao,

268
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,300
so you're so stingy

269
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,620
and make things difficult for me.

270
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,100
The people of Kong Sang Valley are all Jiao.

271
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,580
They're all Yunhuang people.

272
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,900
They're all the same.

273
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,500
But you're so stingy

274
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,140
that you want to punish

275
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,940
the ladies of Kong Sang Valley

276
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,140
and the young prince of Kong Sang Valley.

277
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,100
I just slapped this little girl.

278
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,220
But you made such a big trouble.

279
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,460
Okay.

280
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,380
Forget it.

281
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,220
I think you

282
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,260
can be so magical for a few hours.

283
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:17,540
It's okay.

284
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,860
Your Highness.

285
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,620
That Imperial Doctor

286
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,100
is standing there.

287
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,620
Please forgive me

288
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,060
It's a pity that this Snow-Cold Wei

289
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,180
was meant to be given to you.

290
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,340
What kind of magic is this?

291
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,060
It's so powerful.

292
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,820
The Spring Tree of the Dying Wood.

293
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,220
If you practice magic,

294
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,900
you will be able to do it one day.

295
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,180
This Snow-Cold Wei

296
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,580
is the evidence I gave you.

297
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,540
You can take it

298
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,740
to your father.

299
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,180
Can I have it with my child?

300
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,060
When you protect your country,

301
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,580
you can't separate between men and women.

302
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,260
I will not let you down.

303
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,900
Episode 2

304
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,780
The King's Valley is heavily guarded.

305
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,580
How can you break in?

306
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,180
The troupe will go to the sand.

307
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,380
Go to the beauty troupe.

308
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,660
You will save a lot of money.

309
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,460
Sir,

310
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,740
do you need some help?

311
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,780
The troupe will go to the beauty troupe.

312
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,820
Go to the beauty troupe.

313
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,060
You will save a lot of money.

314
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,460
The scenery here is very good.

315
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,820
It's not as bad as the Mount Jiuli.

316
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,020
Sir,

317
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,460
your guest room service...

318
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,780
The beauty troupe will book a hotel.

319
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,420
Mr. Zhou, play!

320
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,980
Your Majesty,

321
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,020
I've been brought up for a few years,

322
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,700
but I still remember

323
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:57,280
five of the royal family

324
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,640
including the missus.

325
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,380
The two of them

326
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,320
also동ed us.

327
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,500
The six of the family

328
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,660
was in a bad quarrel.

329
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,820
The Fallen R sixties have been an int extract.

332

�

333
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,940
You're charmer.

334
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,900
But your driving skills aren't over even in one session.

335
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,460
You're the emperor and are buried under a holy wreath.

336
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,760
Your presence

337
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,000
is really my lucky charm.

338
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,860
Great!

339
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,660
Great.

340
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,660
Great.

341
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,660
Great.

342
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,660
Great.

343
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,660
Great.

344
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,660
Here comes the Empress.

345
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,660
Don't say anything.

346
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
Qiu Shui.

347
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,660
Greetings, your Majesty.

348
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,660
Get up.

349
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,660
Why are you still here so late?

350
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,660
You missed the sword dance

351
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,660
that the Crown Prince danced for me.

352
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,660
Maybe you don't want me

353
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,660
to see the sword dance.

354
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,660
That's why you asked me to copy it ten times.

355
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,660
What?

356
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
How dare you?

357
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,700
to punish you?

358
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,340
I'm weak.

359
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,700
I've been unwell since I got here.

360
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,900
I can only come to congratulate you

361
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,500
on your longevity

362
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,580
and health.

363
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,980
I'll take my leave then.

364
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,020
Are you all right?

365
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,620
I'll stay with you.

366
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,900
Your Majesty,

367
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,420
the auspicious time has come.

368
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,180
The banquet is about to begin.

369
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,100
Let's go.

370
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,580
The banquet is important.

371
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,220
I'll go back on my own.

372
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,340
If you leave with me,

373
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,740
many people

374
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,300
will blame me

375
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,700
for something bad.

376
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,660
I'll wait for you at Qiu Shui Pavilion.

377
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:51,940
All right.

378
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,220
Today,

379
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,860
you made Qiu Shui suffer.

380
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,580
Do you know your mistake?

381
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,660
I know my mistake.

382
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,300
Since you've learned your lesson,

383
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,980
go to the pavilion

384
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,820
and count the nights for me.

385
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,180
Yes.

386
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,660
Mother,

387
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,740
brother hasn't come out yet.

388
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,740
Don't talk.

389
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,220
Your Highness, please help us.

390
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,380
What's the matter?

391
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,500
I'm a maid of Qiu Shui Pavilion.

392
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,020
I was ordered by the Crown Prince

393
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,100
to write the holy words

394
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,380
and make the maid angry.

395
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,020
My sister is about to be locked up.

396
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,980
I sneaked out to find the Crown Prince.

397
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,780
Please save her.

398
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,380
Please save us.

399
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,540
Your Highness,

400
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,860
please save her.

401
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,860
Your Highness,

402
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,020
please save her.

403
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,980
Your Highness,

404
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,220
please save her.

405
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,060
Your Highness,

406
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,180
please save her.

407
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,140
Your Highness,

408
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,340
please save her.

409
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,740
Please save us.

410
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,340
Where is the maid you said you were punished?

411
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,740
She's in there.

412
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,020
I dare not go in.

413
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,140
Gui Ji.

414
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,340
Gui Ji.

415
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,220
Gui Ji, what's wrong?

416
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,540
Gui Ji.

417
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,380
Gui Ji, where are you?

418
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,420
Gui Ji, where are you?

419
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,620
Gui Ji, where are you?

420
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,540
Your Highness.

421
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,620
Your Highness.

422
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,020
Gui Ji.

423
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,220
Gui Ji, please go back to her.

424
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,340
I'll go and change into a jade dress

425
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,660
to protect His Majesty.

426
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,100
Gui Ji.

427
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,500
Gui Ji, what are you doing?

428
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,140
Your Highness, you're finally here.

429
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,140
No.

430
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,100
His Majesty has arrived.

431
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,140
Gui Ji, you...

432
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,220
I know you hate me.

433
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:58,900
Your Highness.

434
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,100
Your Highness, please don't.

435
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,180
Qiu Shui.

436
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,500
Qiu Shui.

437
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,380
Qiu Shui.

438
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,100
Your Majesty.

439
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,500
Your Majesty.

440
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,220
I never thought

441
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,900
that you would do this to me.

442
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,740
It's not me.

443
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,860
Qiu Shui, I can't serve you anymore.

444
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,940
And...

445
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,100
And our child.

446
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,900
Your Majesty, please take care of yourself.

447
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,500
Qiu Shui.

448
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,540
Qiu Shui is going back to Biluohai.

449
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,220
It turns out that

450
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,740
he can still

451
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,380
wear the jade dress.

452
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,580
Qiu Shui.

453
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,820
Qiu Shui.

454
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,340
Qiu Shui.

455
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,020
Qiu Shui.

456
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,940
Qiu Shui.

457
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,940
Qiu Shui.

458
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,140
It's not me.

459
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,500
Father, it's not me.

460
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,380
It's all your fault.

461
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,380
No.

462
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,020
It's not me.

463
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,020
It's all your fault.

464
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,060
I know it's because I punished you.

465
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,340
You killed Qiu Shui.

466
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,500
You're so guilty, right?

467
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,980
Father, please understand.

468
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,460
As for why he used death to slander me,

469
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,900
I don't know.

470
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,100
You're still talking nonsense, aren't you?

471
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,140
I'm going to uphold justice for Qiu Shui now.

472
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,740
Mother.

473
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,420
Ying.

474
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,420
Ying.

475
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,820
Mother.

476
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,900
Ying, are you okay?

477
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,540
Get up.

478
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,260
Your Majesty, I didn't kill anyone.

479
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,820
Please don't mind the strange things.

480
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,620
What?

481
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,420
You slandered Qiu Shui?

482
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,420
Aren't you tired?

483
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,700
You don't have a relative who doesn't care about you.

484
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,020
You don't even believe in your own flesh and blood.

485
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,540
All these years, the Imperial Army has been

486
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,180
hiding many spies here.

487
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,020
Shut up. I'll kill you.

488
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,940
I'll kill you.

489
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,860
This has nothing to do with my mother.

490
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,340
I'm willing to take responsibility.

491
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,740
Ying.

492
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,500
You didn't do anything.

493
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,980
Why should you take responsibility?

494
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,020
Tell me.

495
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,260
You didn't do anything.

496
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,940
Did you hear that?

497
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,940
He admitted it.

498
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,100
He actually killed my Qiu Shui.

499
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,500
Your Majesty.

500
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,940
You used such a cruel means

501
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,980
to force your own child

502
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,740
to admit the false charge.

503
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,300
Because you're afraid that

504
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,260
if he didn't kill Ying,

505
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,900
it means that Qiu Shui was trying to sow discord

506
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,860
and you were sincere to him.

507
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,780
So you're saying Ying killed him.

508
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,780
You bitch.

509
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,420
Are you crazy?

510
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,740
You're a lunatic.

511
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,220
Mother.

512
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,260
You're a lunatic.

513
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,460
Yes.

514
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,860
I'm crazy.

515
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,420
I'm crazy.

516
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,140
Mother.

517
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,780
The Imperial Army doesn't need anyone to curse.

518
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,060
I've been sent away

519
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,580
by a bitch like you.

520
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,540
Mother.

521
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,300
Protect the family.

522
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,660
Protect the family.

523
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,300
Mother.

524
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,340
Mother.

525
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,700
Mother.

526
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,660
What are you doing?

527
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,020
Mother, let go.

528
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,740
No.

529
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,980
Let go, mother.

530
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,980
Mother.

531
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,340
Mother.

532
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,380
Mother.

533
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,620
Mother, what's wrong with you?

534
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,620
Mother, wake up.

535
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,980
Mother.

536
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,980
It's frozen.

537
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,420
It's frozen.

538
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,620
It's frozen.

539
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:30,980
Hurry.

540
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,500
Hurry.

541
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,060
Yan.

542
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,940
My Lady.

543
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,020
Yan.

544
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,700
Father.

545
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,100
Yan, go.

546
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
What's wrong?

547
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,700
I heard that

548
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,740
the crown prince died because of the rain.

549
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,620
The Empress died

550
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,260
in Kunyuan Palace with the crown prince.

551
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,780
Yan.

552
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,100
Don't be afraid.

553
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,020
I'm here.

554
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,980
Mother.

555
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,420
Yan.

556
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,820
Where are you going?

557
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,820
Father.

558
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,140
You don't know

559
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,500
that I ran into the river today.

560
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,940
It's the crown prince

561
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,860
who stopped me.

562
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,300
That's it?

563
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,620
Yan.

564
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,500
Yan.

565
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,420
Mother.

566
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,500
Mother.

567
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,820
It must be because of me

568
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,980
that the crown prince

569
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,620
was killed by the princess.

570
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,700
You don't want to live.

571
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,700
Go back with me.

572
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,860
Yan.

573
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,980
The crown prince died.

574
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,820
Yan.

575
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,420
Yan, listen to me.

576
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,380
The crown prince died.

577
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,460
Yan.

578
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,220
Yan.

579
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,100
Listen to me, Yan.

580
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,420
The crown prince died.

581
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,220
Yan.

582
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,260
Don't go.

583
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,100
Let go of me.

584
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,380
Your Majesty.

585
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,780
The water

586
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
was indeed done by the Empress.

587
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,420
Although the Empress died,

588
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,900
she was still alive.

589
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,500
Her throat was also burnt.

590
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,180
The crown prince

591
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,620
only found a poem

592
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,380
about the crown prince.

593
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,260
It's hard to find a good person.

594
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,060
Just bury her outside the city.

595
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,460
No funerals will be allowed.

596
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,500
No code of sitting in charge.

597
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,580
No tomb drawn.

598
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,500
Or cannot be disowned.

599
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,980
Everyone in the country

600
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,580
will be felled a этого

601
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:58,300
and be sl MultiMUSIC

602
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,220
Take it and put it in the cold palace!

603
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,980
Yes.

604
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,300
I lost the last piece

605
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,260
you left me.

606
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:19,940
Your Highness,

607
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,340
are you looking forặt?

608
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,140
I'm sorry.

609
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,660
Princess Meng has been calling for Xue Hanwei.

610
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,820
I think

611
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,180
this is what she loves.

612
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,460
She wants the one who cleans the carriage to stay.

613
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,540
Thank you, Chief Steward Yuan.

614
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,100
We're colleagues,

615
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,260
but we have a connection.

616
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,700
If Qiu Shui and Ge Ji

617
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,180
are as kind as you,

618
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,820
he won't die in vain.

619
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,660
Now that the crown prince is dead,

620
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,500
no one dares to worship him.

621
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,580
His Majesty has given the imperial edict.

622
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,500
The crown prince of the temple has committed a grave crime.

623
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,220
No.

624
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,980
Even if it's against the edict,

625
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,700
I still want to worship him.

626
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,420
I don't believe he's a wicked person.

627
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,460
Fine.

628
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,260
Since you want to worship the crown prince,

629
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,700
I'll accompany you.

630
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,300
Chief Steward Yuan,

631
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,780
if you're willing to go with me,

632
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,780
I'll go with you.

633
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,380
You also believe the crown prince is wronged?

634
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,620
I'm a Jiao.

635
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,300
I don't know what kind of person he is.

636
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,380
But as the chief steward of the Chifu,

637
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,140
it's my duty to protect the princess.

638
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,220
Worshiping the crown prince is what the princess wants to do.

639
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,860
Since I can't stop her,

640
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,660
I'll try to reduce the risk.

641
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,300
You don't know the face of a wise man.

642
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,340
Before,

643
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,860
everyone in the world said he was righteous.

644
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,980
I didn't expect

645
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,220
he could do such a wicked thing as killing people.

646
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,820
The crown is like sand.

647
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,980
The empress deliberately made it up.

648
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,500
What a bad luck.

649
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,220
I took this chance.

650
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,300
Is there any evil around here?

651
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,900
Stop talking.

652
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,300
Let's go.

653
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,220
When I was in trouble,

654
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,300
they praised me.

655
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,300
They didn't want to be my match.

656
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,580
They wanted to take my gold.

657
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,180
Actually, I didn't

658
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,940
care much about them.

659
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
When I was in trouble,

660
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,740
they ruined me and dragged me down.

661
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,300
They didn't want to step on the thousand-mars clan.

662
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,500
Even though I didn't hurt them,

663
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,860
Mother, let's go out.

664
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,060
You and I will escape from the palace together.

665
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,220
We'll hide ourselves

666
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,660
and hide ourselves for the rest of our lives.

667
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,580
Ying,

668
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,020
I'll take you out of the palace.

669
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,180
This is the ancient magic weapon

670
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,660
that the empress of Baiwei

671
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,300
passed down from the ancient jade valley.

672
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,580
Who are you?

673
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,020
Ying, don't be afraid.

674
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Ying Ying.

675
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,100
Have you remembered

676
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
This is the Minister of War, Da Siming,

677
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,420
on Mount Jiuyi.

678
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,140
He will be your master in the future.

679
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,260
A Yan,

680
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,820
do you insist on this?

681
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,420
A Yu,

682
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,180
I'll leave my Ying'er to you.

683
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,660
I owe you

684
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,940
in this life.

685
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,140
A Yan.

686
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,300
Mother,

687
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,420
I don't want it.

688
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,700
Ying'er,

689
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,300
don't worry.

690
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,340
I will

691
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,420
pray for you in the palace

692
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,340
day and night.

693
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,060
I won't ask for a short-term punishment

694
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,780
to make those who hurt us

695
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,140
feel good.

696
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,860
Ying'er,

697
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,260
lying to death is a crime of deceiving the emperor.

698
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,980
Don't come back

699
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,980
after you die.

700
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,940
Mother, let's go together.

701
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,340
Our love is over.

702
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,180
Remember,

703
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,940
no need to revenge

704
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,780
and no need to hate anyone.

705
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,900
As long as you're safe.

706
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,260
Mother, I don't want it.

707
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,940
Let's go together.

708
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,020
Ying'er.

709
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,500
Mother.

710
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,540
Mother.

711
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,060
This is the human heart.

712
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,700
Mother.

713
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,300
The sun and the moon are the same.

714
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,140
It's...

715
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,900
It's the crown prince.

716
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,260
Go. Go. Go.

717
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,020
I used magic

718
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,020
to cover your star.

719
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,980
The sun and the moon are the same.

720
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,500
The sun and the moon are the same.

721
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,740
I used magic

722
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,980
to cover your star.

723
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,580
Lord Wushuang

724
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,980
Lord Tao.

725
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,220
Died?

726
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,460
You were there for me

727
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,540
for a while.

728
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,900
Finally,

729
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,900
you're finally here.

730
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,420
You can take back

731
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,660
what you lost this time in the future.

732
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,100
Nice manners,

733
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,820
to clear my mother's name and take her away.

734
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,740
Your Highness.

735
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,740
I don't know

736
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,660
if I have the right to worship you.

737
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,420
They all say you're a bad person.

738
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,420
I believe you're wronged.

739
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,260
So,

740
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,260
I'm here to see you off.

741
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,340
How could this be?

742
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,460
Your star

743
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,100
is about to fall.

744
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,340
Someone has done something for you.

745
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,660
In the country,

746
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,700
they all scolded me and dragged me away.

747
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,220
When I was in the dark,

748
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,820
they did something for me.

749
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,100
Who is she?

750
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,340
You don't need to know who she is.

751
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,620
When you meet her,

752
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,380
you'll meet her in the shadow and leave a flower line.

753
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,860
We need to kill her.

754
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,380
Otherwise,

755
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,820
she'll become the one who killed you.

756
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,020
Imam Yuan,

757
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,660
Did you see

758
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,260
the beam that We first saw?

759
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,020
Yes.

760
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,140
I saw it.

761
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,900
I saw it.

762
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,820
He should be safe now.

763
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,660
What's this spell?

764
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,580
The Spring of the Withered Wood.

765
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,220
The Spring of the Withered Wood.

766
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,660
Since the flowers can come back to life,

767
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,580
can humans also...

768
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,660
Is there such a spell in the world?

769
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,580
The Kongsang Spell is as good as the ocean of smoke.

770
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,380
Among the people who have obtained it for thousands of years,

771
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,980
I'm sure there are also the Spring of the Withered Wood.

772
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,820
I, Zhu Yan, am here to make a vow.

773
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,020
I must learn this spell

774
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,140
and wish the Crown Prince a good luck.

775
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,380
Why are you here again?

776
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,660
I've already told you

777
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,220
that our superior is in seclusion.

778
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,900
He's not here. Go back.

779
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,180
How long do I have to wait?

780
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,740
There's always a head in seclusion.

781
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,300
If I don't see him today,

782
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,620
I won't go down the mountain.

783
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,740
You little girl.

784
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,900
Why are you so unreasonable?

785
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,380
Even if my superior ends his seclusion,

786
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,540
he won't see you.

787
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,860
Go down the mountain.

788
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,780
I've been waiting for seven days in the mountain.

789
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,380
How can I be unreasonable?

790
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,220
Since you said I was unreasonable,

791
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,700
I'll let you know

792
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,700
what is real insolence.

793
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:49,820
You little girl.

794
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:50,860
You're too much.

795
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,220
Hurry up and get him down the mountain.

796
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:02,940
Just tell me.

797
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,420
What is the matter with the master?

798
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,500
I don't know.

799
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,660
Just tell me.

800
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,220
Where is the master?

801
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,460
Little Princess.

802
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,860
I'm the one you're looking for.

803
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,540
Greetings, Master.

804
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,860
Greetings, Master.

805
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:22,140
Master, you know me?

806
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,980
Little Princess has been visiting the mountain

807
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,340
for years.

808
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,460
How can I not know you?

809
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,980
Then you must know my intentions.

810
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,700
When I was young,

811
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,700
I met a young man.

812
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,460
Unfortunately, he passed away.

813
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,820
So I want to beg Master

814
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,460
to let him come back to the mortal world.

815
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,540
It's just an accident.

816
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:49,020
Why are you still thinking about it?

817
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,420
Although I just met him by chance,

818
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,900
he helped me out,

819
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,900
treated me kindly,

820
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,220
and protected me.

821
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,660
And

822
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,260
I was the reason he was implicated.

823
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,340
So you're here to repay him.

824
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,220
But do you know

825
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,980
that the way to return to the mortal world

826
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,540
is the most against heaven in the world?

827
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,540
It's a huge loss.

828
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,580
I'm willing to do everything.

829
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,220
Please help me, Master.

830
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,020
I'm useless.

831
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,300
I'm afraid I can't help you.

832
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,500
But you're sincere.

833
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,460
Perhaps you can go to Mount Jiuyi.

834
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,940
Mount Jiuyi?

835
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,100
Mount Jiuyi is the highest place

836
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,020
where the air and the mulberry trees grow.

837
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,940
Only there

838
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,100
can you find the way to return to the mortal world.
