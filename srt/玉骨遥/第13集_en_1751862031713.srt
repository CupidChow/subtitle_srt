1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

2
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,200
I want to be with you

3
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,720
Please give me a life of shining fortune

4
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,400
I want to be with you

5
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
I want to be with you

6
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,600
But I can't help you

7
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,520
The courage to face it

8
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,200
I want to be with you

9
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,880
I want to be with you

10
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,480
I want to be with you

11
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,480
At the bottom of my heart

12
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,440
The journey to and from the old town

13
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,360
Don't worry about the net

14
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
Just do what you say

15
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,080
The travel card of Tongcheng

16
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,880
You watch the moment of heartache

17
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,320
What's wrong with Shao Siming

18
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,560
You sit by my side

19
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,000
My heart is more messy

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,160
I'll have the last sip

21
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,160
I must defeat Bai Xue Lu

22
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,080
Defeat Bai Xue Lu

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,000
Then I will stay

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,840
You are in the dream

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,920
You want to be my first disciple

26
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,840
I'm sorry

27
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
I'm sorry

28
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
I'm sorry

29
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
I'm sorry

30
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
I'm sorry

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
I'm sorry

32
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,840
I'm sorry

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
I'm sorry

34
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
I'm sorry

35
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm sorry

36
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
I'm sorry

37
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
I'm sorry

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm sorry

39
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
I'm sorry

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
I'm sorry

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,840
I'm sorry

42
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
I'm sorry

43
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
I'm sorry

44
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm sorry

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
I'm sorry

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
I'm sorry

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
I'm sorry

48
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm sorry

49
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
I'm sorry

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
I'm sorry

51
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
I'm sorry

52
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
I'm sorry

53
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm sorry

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm sorry

55
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
I'm sorry

56
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
I'm sorry

57
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm sorry

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm sorry

59
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
I'm sorry

60
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
I'm sorry

61
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
I'm sorry

62
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
I'm sorry

63
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
I'm sorry

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
How could I be tied up?

65
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Qingxiu Palace

66
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:52,660
I had aフter MassG lie final

67
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,760
What happened last night?

68
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,720
Master Bai,

69
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,800
just do it.

70
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,000
This is called kissing.

71
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,880
Ying.

72
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,400
Oh, no.

73
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,480
It's so embarrassing.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,480
Is he going to kill me?

75
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,080
No.

76
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
I have to run away.

77
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,680
All right, do it right.

78
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,600
Great.

79
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,760
Young... Young Minister.

80
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,160
Where are you going?

81
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,680
I...

82
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,000
I failed the exam yesterday.

83
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,440
I didn't attend the class.

84
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,240
I hurt my classmates.

85
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,840
I drank too much.

86
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,560
I...

87
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,560
I didn't obey you.

88
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,880
I'm the worst.

89
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,440
You can punish me as you like.

90
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,000
As long as you don't punish me for going down the mountain.

91
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,880
Punish you?

92
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,360
Of course I will.

93
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,320
Didn't you say last night

94
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,800
you wanted to be my apprentice?

95
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,040
No, no, no.

96
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,560
It's all my bad words.

97
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,080
I'm not good at it.

98
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:34,920
I...

99
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,800
I'm far from it.

100
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,080
I want you to look into my eyes.

101
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
Don't think about anything else.

102
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,760
Just follow your heart.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,040
Then tell me

104
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,480
you want to be my apprentice?

105
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,440
I...

106
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,360
want...

107
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,120
Good.

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,880
Since you want to,

109
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
give it a try.

110
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,440
Young Minister.

111
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,040
Are you encouraging me to be your apprentice?

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,120
I'm not encouraging you.

113
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
I'm reminding you

114
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,520
that you're far from Bai Xue Lu.

115
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,960
If you really want to be the next one,

116
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,720
the difficulty ahead is hard to imagine.

117
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280
And I won't give you any space.

118
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,440
I won't give you any space.

119
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,400
I'll only watch you,

120
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,280
test you and pick you.

121
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,880
Can you do it?

122
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,240
I'm willing to try.

123
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,960
Good.

124
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,720
It depends on your performance.

125
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Thank you, Young Minister.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,800
you've spend a whole night in the hall today.

127
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,760
Maybe it's because

128
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,280
you're too weak.

129
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,480
Listen to me.

130
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,480
It's like

131
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,200
you've been searching for more than a thousand years

132
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,480
and found nothing.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,640
If you even leave me alone in the palace,

134
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
I'll pay back this time.

135
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,040
Thank you, Young Minister.

136
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,760
to make him your apprentice?

137
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,280
There are four candidates now.

138
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,600
Qing Gang

139
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,280
has a mission.

140
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,720
Bai Xue Ying

141
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,040
doesn't want to go to school.

142
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,120
The only ones who really want to stay

143
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,320
are Zhu Yan and Bai Xue Lu.

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Bai Xue Lu

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,960
is the candidate in the plan of the Grand Minister.

146
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,840
The recruitment is just the first step of the Grand Minister.

147
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,120
He is moving step by step.

148
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,680
He wants Bai Xue Lu

149
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,080
to be close to the position of the apprentice

150
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,720
so that one day

151
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,160
he can force me to come back to Jialan.

152
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,200
I see.

153
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,560
So you have no choice

154
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,200
but to be forced by the Grand Minister

155
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,680
and only hope that

156
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,560
Zhu Yan can take the position of the apprentice?

157
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,800
I think the most important test

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,960
of the apprentice is the mind.

159
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,840
Most people here

160
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,640
use magic

161
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,040
to achieve other goals.

162
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,400
For example, Bai Xue Lu

163
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,560
wants power.

164
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,720
Only Zhu Yan

165
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,320
really wants to go to school.

166
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,440
I still think it's not right.

167
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,440
For you

168
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,600
and for him,

169
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,720
I've thought about it.

170
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,120
If in the future

171
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,080
all kinds of situations

172
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,480
that I'm worried about happen,

173
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,600
I'll face it with him.

174
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,800
Even so,

175
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,880
the possibility that Zhu Yan becomes your apprentice

176
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,800
is very small.

177
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,400
Although he has a weak foundation,

178
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,560
he is not afraid of setbacks.

179
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,280
He can always concentrate on his life

180
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
and overcome difficulties.

181
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,880
I think

182
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,760
there will be a miracle.

183
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I'll wait and see.

184
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,800
Go.

185
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,480
Dragon God.

186
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,680
Yuan.

187
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,400
One day,

188
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,800
Dragon God woke up

189
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,320
and was unable to control the dragon's tail.

190
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,400
You must keep him away.

191
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,160
Because

192
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,200
the blood of our Pang Zhi's blood

193
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,640
will be summoned by the正統龍血.

194
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,480
But it was suppressed by the正統龍血.

195
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,880
Then

196
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,200
there will be a life-threatening problem.

197
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,560
That means

198
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,240
it was cancelled retraining how can there be another trouble?

199
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,320
Her nationality and place last year

200
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,400
has become wounds in her skin.

201
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,800
It's said that

202
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,600
during the185 days of his life,

203
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,520
he met with great difficulties.

204
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,160
However,

205
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,560
It was delayed for many years a being 준� Es,

206
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,440
develop new knowledge upon these with us.

207
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,920
However,

208
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,080
it doesn't hold back

209
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,920
my new skills

210
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,440
to folks involved in the fight.

211
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,120
Hope

212
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,200
the strike will be Flying Stars

213
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,520
as if this demie will deliver me

214
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,700
from the

215
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,840
greatly Triple issue of车休

216
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,880
Thus it is said

217
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,520
great Forgeness

218
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,120
has experienced

219
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,520
I will ہ processors

220
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,820
草魔以变的治种

221
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,560
草舞亦变诚之地

222
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,120
Sir.

223
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,820
Sir!

224
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,500
Your Highness.

225
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,300
His Majesty hates the death of the Three-Dominated Man.

226
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,820
When he wakes up,

227
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,780
the world will be in chaos.

228
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,220
I'm afraid it's between the two of us.

229
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,140
It's not even the first time.

230
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,220
If that day comes,

231
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,220
I'm afraid only the blood of the dragon

232
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,540
can save His Highness.

233
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,940
How could I think that way?

234
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,380
Your Highness.

235
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,140
Your Highness.

236
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,660
I hope you can learn from Zuo Cheng

237
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,500
in Mount Jiuyi

238
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,020
and protect yourself in the future.

239
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,940
Sha Si Ming is going to be in Wangxing Square

240
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,500
until we reach the Tree of Wind.

241
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,820
We just learned the theory.

242
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,820
This is the first time we practice.

243
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,060
What a pity!

244
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,660
The one who did wrong

245
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,060
can only be punished here.

246
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:48,940
You!

247
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,020
Stop!

248
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,580
Yan.

249
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,740
Yan.

250
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,660
Let me stay and help you.

251
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,460
Me too.

252
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,140
No need.

253
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,340
You can go to class.

254
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,420
I'll help you after class.

255
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:04,980
Go.

256
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,940
Don't be late.

257
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,180
Although I can't catch up with

258
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,820
Shao Si Ming's way of teaching,

259
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,580
I can also

260
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,740
recite the curse words

261
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,820
a hundred times.

262
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,140
Come and go as you wish.

263
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,700
I'll follow your will.

264
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,780
Come and go as you wish.

265
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,460
I'll follow your will.

266
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,380
How about

267
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,660
I try the curse words

268
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,780
from the Tree of Wind?

269
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,820
Come and go as you wish.

270
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,500
I'll follow your will.

271
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,140
Come and go as you wish.

272
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,900
I'll follow your will.

273
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,700
Hey!

274
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,900
I'll follow your will.

275
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,340
I'll follow your will.

276
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,620
I'll follow your will.

277
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,740
You're indeed the most talented

278
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,900
Princess Zhu Yan.

279
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:41,940
She can even

280
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,580
cut a small leaf for you.

281
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,780
That's all

282
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,380
for today's

283
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:53,660
Tree of Wind.

284
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,980
Please go back

285
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,420
and practice more.

286
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,540
Thank you for your guidance, Shao Si Ming.

287
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,900
I'll take my leave.

288
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,660
Shao Si Ming,

289
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,060
I wrote it

290
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,620
with the same curse words,

291
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,740
but I couldn't do anything about it.

292
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,940
Why is that?

293
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,380
You've learned the theory.

294
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,420
Now,

295
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,900
it's time for the material form.

296
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,820
I'll show you

297
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,420
the Tree of Wind again.

298
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,380
Watch carefully.

299
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,860
Okay.

300
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,500
I lived in the bottom of the king's valley

301
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,500
and missed the Tree of Wind

302
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,140
in the daily cleaning.

303
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,420
Actually,

304
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,460
I couldn't control the Tree of Wind

305
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,540
by just observing the direction of the wind

306
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,060
and using the power of the wind.

307
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,860
You imitate my action just now

308
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,620
and observe it carefully.

309
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,980
Don't be too tight.

310
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,100
If you don't relax

311
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,100
in this state,

312
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,780
you won't feel the wind.

313
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,260
Again.

314
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,380
Stop.

315
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,860
Hands up.

316
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,580
The same for this side.

317
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,020
Don't be too tight.

318
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,180
Don't be too tight.

319
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,300
Don't be too tight.

320
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,260
Don't be too tight.

321
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,300
Don't be too tight.

322
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,380
Don't be too tight.

323
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,100
Yes.

324
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,340
Relax your shoulders.

325
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,340
Again.

326
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,340
Zhu Yan.

327
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,660
What are you thinking about?

328
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,220
I...

329
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,620
The feeling

330
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,020
is to use your

331
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
Martial Soul and the Six Sages

332
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,460
to experience it together.

333
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,860
Why don't you observe the wind?

334
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,140
Observe the wind?

335
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,900
Can I see the wind?

336
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,780
Remember.

337
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,940
The wind also has life.

338
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,540
It changes rapidly

339
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,140
but it can be used to find it.

340
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,700
When the fire is on,

341
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,420
you can see it naturally.

342
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,340
I seem to understand.

343
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,940
But I don't seem to understand.

344
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,900
You obviously don't understand.

345
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,380
OK.

346
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,540
Time is up.

347
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,220
I'll observe elsewhere

348
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:43,580
using as much time as you

349
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,820
uses using as long as others.

350
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,700
You

351
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,180
can do the rest.

352
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,140
So you are leaving now?

353
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,860
canshal.

354
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,420
I haven't learned it yet.

355
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,980
How can I observe the wind?

356
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,760
Come on, come on.

357
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,240
We victory.

358
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,140
Yan.

359
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,140
You're so good.

360
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,420
foreseeuffs

361
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,940
Gu Chen is coming.

362
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,780
the 287th student.

363
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,580
Yes.

364
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,460
After a month of listening,

365
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,740
the following four students

366
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,100
are qualified to compete.

367
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,220
Bai Xue Lu, 15 points.

368
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,060
Qing Gang, 12 points.

369
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,660
Zhu Yan, 8 points.

370
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,220
Bai Xue Ying, 5 points.

371
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,700
Please call the names

372
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,700
to have a competition.

373
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,700
Qing Gang.

374
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,420
Qing Gang.

375
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,380
I've received the order

376
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,740
to leave the mountain today.

377
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,100
I'll give up the competition

378
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,620
for Qing Gang.

379
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,100
Yes.

380
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,180
Bai Xue Lu.

381
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,660
Bai Xue Ying.

382
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,460
I'm not good at learning.

383
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,060
I can't take the responsibility.

384
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,180
I'm sorry that Xue Ying didn't participate in the competition.

385
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,620
Ran.

386
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,820
Zhu Yan.

387
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,300
Your Highness.

388
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,860
Princess Zhu Yan,

389
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,300
do you have anything to say?

390
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,020
No.

391
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,140
I'm willing to fight with Princess Xue Lu.

392
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,900
She doesn't know her place.

393
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,380
How can she do that?

394
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,860
Sister.

395
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,460
Didn't father ask us to leave the mountain

396
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,500
in advance and not compete for the victory?

397
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,180
I can't do anything now.

398
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,380
If I quit,

399
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,020
Zhu Yan will win the competition.

400
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,820
But...

401
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,920
If the

402
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,620
other people give up the competition

403
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,260
and the competition is over,

404
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,220
where will you put the reputation

405
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,940
of Jiu Yi Mountain and Shao Si Ming?

406
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,420
Ying is not your opponent.

407
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,700
Please be kind to her.

408
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,660
Don't hurt her.

409
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,940
Don't worry.

410
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,940
I have my own rules.

411
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,340
I won't hurt your good sister.

412
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,460
Princess Zhu Yan.

413
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,860
The rules are as follows.

414
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,340
Before the magic weapon rings,

415
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,580
the opponent is sent to the stage

416
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,380
or loses the ability to fight again

417
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
to win.

418
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,420
If you don't win the competition,

419
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,780
you will be the winner.

420
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,780
The competition starts now.

421
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,980
She's improving so fast.

422
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,660
No. I have to win.

423
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,580
Why won't the fire tegenhand work?

424
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,620
This is magic.

425
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,420
The inner power of frost

426
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,900
is precisely the Roman magical spells.

427
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,540
How did she do it?

428
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,260
What's wrong?

429
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,900
Could it be possible that

430
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,020
there are things going on in China?

431
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,820
The recovered soldiers

432
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,060
may have become created

433
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,420
places of shadow?

434
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,660
But only my scattering is the setting sun!

435
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
This way,

436
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,900
I'm absolutely certain that

437
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,460
the Big Dipper

438
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,780
Bad luck brought disaster.

439
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,700
Qianran,

440
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,580
promise me to light the candle until the end.

441
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,580
A Yan.

442
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,180
A Yan, give in!

443
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,460
Remember, wind is life.

444
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,460
It can be searched for in a moment.

445
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,460
When the time comes, you will see it.

446
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,460
Turn the Pressure Towards Tomb

447
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,460
No.

448
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,460
did not want

449
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,960
Enough, never mind.

450
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,900
Yunsh хочетсяdululauاء.

451
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,860
Ling Yunластu...

452
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,100
Bai Zhong was Essence Chained.

453
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,200
Princess Zhuhian learnt the skill of Ling Yun.

454
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,540
This is the best girls' arts in Fengxie.

455
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,980
Sir.

456
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,200
Please let this battle go smoothly

457
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:26,660
Xiao Cheng,

458
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:30,520
Why are you so Come on.

459
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,800
title

460
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,300
As an old chief ,

461
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,900
How to deal with firecrackers

462
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,600
You are the greetings of the rod

463
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,520
My Liberation

464
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,580
Why to sleep

465
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,720
You have to break good night

466
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,220
The second prince

467
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:54,620
You broke

468
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,520
It won't stop

469
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,500
The rest of you,

470
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,100
please pack up

471
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,380
and prepare to go down the mountain

472
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,860
after the break of the last period.

473
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,460
Yes, Your Highness.

474
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,300
Bai Xue Lu.

475
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,100
I don't need your sympathy.

476
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,580
Please grant me

477
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,340
another chance.

478
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,620
You said it before

479
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,860
that Zhu Yan is no match for you.

480
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,460
Since you can't do anything,

481
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,620
go back

482
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,500
and have a good time.

483
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,980
I disappointed you this time.

484
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,460
I'll reflect on myself when I go back.

485
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,740
I'll follow your order.

486
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,020
But

487
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,580
Zhu Yan

488
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,700
said it in public

489
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,340
at the Wangxing Square.

490
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,740
He's the leader

491
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,700
of Mount Jiuyi.

492
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,380
I'm afraid

493
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,820
he's not worth it.

494
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,060
You don't need

495
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,660
to worry about it.

496
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,140
Leave now.

497
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,180
Chief.

498
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,100
You said

499
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,380
you didn't want to go down the mountain,

500
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,300
right?

501
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,900
Chief, please forgive me.

502
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,780
I didn't see Mount Gao

503
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,180
and I said it out of pure madness.

504
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,740
Now I know the height of Mount Jiuyi

505
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,540
and I can't forget its back.

506
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,300
I'm a master of magic

507
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,740
and I'll never forget it.

508
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,140
I've decided to take a break here.

509
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,580
I hope you can

510
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,220
take care of me.

511
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,980
I'll be waiting for you.

512
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,220
Don't mind me.

513
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,740
Don't be so hard on yourself.

514
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,260
Since you've defeated all your opponents,

515
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,900
you're the leader of the Young Commander

516
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,340
without any regrets.

517
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,980
I just want to remind you

518
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,420
to be cautious in the future.

519
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,660
Yes.

520
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,300
But

521
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,620
you need to

522
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,500
memorize the rules of the disciples

523
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,780
written by the first generation of the Chief Commander

524
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,300
of Mount Jiuyi.

525
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,900
Yes.

526
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,100
Yes, Your Highness.

527
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,820
But I don't know where to find

528
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,660
the rules of the disciples.

529
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,900
Right here.

530
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,180
You need to find it yourself.

531
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,740
Of course,

532
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,940
you can't use any magic

533
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,180
to risk your life.

534
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,740
It's just that

535
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,020
you still have half an hour

536
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,420
before you can leave the Pavilion of Hidden Gold.

537
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,620
What's more important is

538
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,220
that the Book of Nine Ways

539
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,860
is like a mirror.

540
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,460
The past is already in the past.

541
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,260
You need to read a book

542
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,700
and then wipe it.

543
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,340
After wiping,

544
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,220
you need to change the water.

545
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,620
It's better to be

546
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,100
quiet and quiet here

547
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,820
until you find the rules.

548
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,020
I'm still not good enough

549
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,700
to learn magic.

550
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,220
It's hard to find a book

551
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,900
in such a short time.

552
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,940
And you need to wipe it

553
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,300
and change the water.

554
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,700
It's impossible to do that.

555
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,460
I won't force you

556
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,500
to find it.

557
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,300
Since you have no sincerity

558
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,660
and no courage,

559
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,020
even if you become

560
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,900
the first disciple of the Chief Commander,

561
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,980
you won't succeed in the future.

562
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,620
I can only

563
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,140
give you another title

564
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,700
for the Chief Commander.

565
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,740
You choose it yourself.

566
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,700
I'm willing to try.

567
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:46,140
Xie Taikai

568
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,420
to the new disciple.

569
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,780
I've never had a disciple

570
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,460
who asked me to find him personally.

571
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,380
For thousands of years,

572
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,620
who dared to insult the sect

573
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,100
and disobey the teacher?

574
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,860
Since he's out of the way,

575
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,380
I can't be the teacher

576
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,220
and teach him a lesson.

577
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,380
Why did you instigate Zhu Yan

578
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,860
with the failure of Snow White?

579
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,900
I don't know what you're talking about.

580
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,420
I know Snow White

581
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,180
is your disciple.

582
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,100
Who knows that you could kill Zhu Yan halfway?

583
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,140
So you chose to take Zhu Yan as your disciple

584
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,180
to fight against my loyal Snow White?

585
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,780
Even if Zhu Yan didn't find

586
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,820
the disciple's excuse,

587
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,580
I just announced to him

588
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,540
that I would abolish his right to be the first disciple.

589
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,980
I will never take Snow White

590
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,820
as the first disciple.

591
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,340
Good.

592
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,740
Very good.

593
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,380
You've grown up

594
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,740
and dared to speak up to the teacher.

595
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,540
I don't dare.

596
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,060
I just hope

597
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,460
you won't interfere with my decision.

598
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,300
Yes, sir.

599
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,500
Yes, sir.

600
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,140
I'll take my leave.

601
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:15,860
Master.

602
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,700
Master.

603
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,220
I wasn'togenic

604
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,380
to forget the first death

605
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,660
is a 끈.

606
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,300
So,

607
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,540
the謂discipleship rules

608
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,900
were not made by me.

609
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,940
They were drawn by me?

610
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,380
I'm not a teacher who is considerate of others.

611
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,740
It's hard for you to practice with me.

612
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,900
I'm not afraid of hardship.

613
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,620
You'll be lonely.

614
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,020
I won't.

615
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,140
In the past, only the dead were in the valley.

616
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,460
I would be lonely.

617
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,100
But from now on,

618
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,060
I'll be with you.

619
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,740
You're my disciple.

620
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,140
You're my teacher.

621
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,700
I'll be with you.

622
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,300
I'll be with you.

623
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,620
I'll be with you.

624
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,940
I'll be with you.

625
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,300
You're my disciple.

626
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,620
I'll ask you to do as I said.

627
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,740
If you're not good,

628
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,940
you'll be beaten up.

629
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,940
Don't be stubborn.

630
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:56,940
Okay.

631
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,300
From now on,

632
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,020
you're my teacher.

633
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,660
Teacher.

634
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,260
Teacher. Teacher.

635
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,660
Aren't you fighting with me?

636
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,940
Why are you here?

637
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,340
I know you're devoted to me.

638
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,100
You don't have any personal feelings.

639
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,620
How can I fight with you?

640
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,100
But my mother has passed away.

641
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,940
I really don't want to go back to Jialan.

642
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,020
Please allow me to be famous.

643
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,620
Okay.

644
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,700
Chief.

645
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,260
Stop playing dirty.

646
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,420
Chief Nikuhong.

647
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,380
In those years,

648
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,620
you were just an imperial hanging man.

649
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,580
You statues were high up there,

650
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,740
but you were still as a kid.

651
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,940
Now,

652
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,940
she would be very happy.

653
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,500
I can imagine

654
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,020
how she looked when she smiled.

655
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,380
You are her only blood.

656
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,820
She didn't fight

657
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,340
because she was kind.

658
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,580
But you,

659
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,380
me,

660
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,580
we didn't fight.

661
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,620
Who else

662
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,220
would help you

663
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,660
get back what you lost

664
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,540
because of her grievance?

665
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,500
But back then,

666
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,980
it was because of my own selfishness

667
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,860
that I was eager to return Jialan

668
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,060
and even gave the palace

669
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,300
a message.

670
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,700
That's why my mother...

671
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,740
My mother

672
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,740
is no longer here.

673
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,900
Now, doing anything

674
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,180
is meaningless.

675
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,740
And I have no feelings

676
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,420
for Jialan.

677
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,780
Your Majesty,

678
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,100
today is your birthday.

679
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,060
I'll give you a cup of tea.

680
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,780
Xue Weigao,

681
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,740
this is your mother's

682
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,300
favorite food.

683
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,740
Today

684
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,940
is my birthday.

685
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,500
Since my mother entrusted me with this,

686
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,940
you have put all your thoughts

687
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,700
on me.

688
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,740
You encouraged me to go to the capital

689
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,380
and planned for me.

690
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,300
You have completely forgotten about yourself.

691
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,140
But

692
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,220
you should also have your own life,

693
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,420
your own happiness,

694
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,780
and your own elegance.

695
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,700
I don't want to lose that person

696
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,420
because of me.

697
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,380
The one called Shi Yu.

698
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,340
I will never forget

699
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,180
your kindness to me.

700
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,860
You are not only my uncle

701
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,220
and my master.

702
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,300
You should

703
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,420
be yourself.

704
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,260
You still can't understand

705
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,700
the heart of a man who is a mayor.

706
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,980
If there is no one

707
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,020
who cares about you in this world,

708
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,820
what's the point

709
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,620
of living?

710
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,940
Let me

711
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,900
be alone.

712
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,620
Yes.

713
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,620
Yes.

714
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,620
Change it.

715
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,340
Do you know

716
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,900
where you made a mistake?

717
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,060
It hurts!

718
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,740
Can you be my girlfriend?

719
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,140
Be my girlfriend

720
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,380
You should like me

721
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,700
From now on

722
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:31,060
Forget me

723
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,980
If I don't like you

724
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,980
I can't do anything

725
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,980
I can't get out of this

726
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,980
I can't get out of this

727
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,980
I can't get out of this

728
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,980
I can't get out of this

729
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,980
I can't get out of this

730
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,980
I can't get out of this

731
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,980
I can't get out of this

732
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,980
I can't get out of this

733
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,980
I can't get out of this

734
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,980
I can't get out of this

735
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,980
I can't get out of this

736
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,980
I can't get out of this

737
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,980
I can't get out of this

738
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,980
I can't get out of this

739
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,980
I can't get out of this

740
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,980
I can't get out of this

741
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,980
I can't get out of this

742
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,980
I can't get out of this

743
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,980
I can't get out of this

744
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,980
I can't get out of this

745
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,980
I can't get out of this

746
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,980
I can't get out of this

747
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,980
I can't get out of this

748
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,980
I can't get out of this

749
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,980
I can't get out of this

750
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,980
I can't get out of this

751
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,980
I can't get out of this

752
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,980
I can't get out of this

753
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:47,340
You birth

754
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,980
mankind

755
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,980
You're the person inside the heart

756
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,980
I hate

757
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,980
You can't get it out

758
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,980
I hate
