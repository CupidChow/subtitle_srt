1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please give me a life of shining fortune

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want to be your rain

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to be your rain

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But I ask you to give me the courage

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to be your rain

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But I ask you to give me the courage

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Welcome to watch the ancient medicine

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yan'er

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Master, do you really want to take off the robe?

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes, I have made up my mind

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't you regret it?

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Never

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I understand

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Master, no matter what decision you make, I will support you

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yan'er, you understand

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is what you wanted to say to me the other day, right?

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I am looking forward to this day

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yan'er, you know my heart

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I will protect you forever

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yan'er

23
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What are you writing?

24
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I am writing a letter to Zhuyuan

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Tell him our location

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let him have time to come and see me

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ok, then invite him to drink our wedding wine

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Then I will write this

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Why are you writing my bad words?

30
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Where?

31
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hey, give it back to me

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Give it back to me

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Give it back to me

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Give it back to me

35
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Go

36
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Follow up

37
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Commander Shang

38
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The camp of the Navy has been taken down

39
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Our people can also be taken down today

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Finally done

41
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Do you miss your mother?

42
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I miss my mother

43
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I want to avenge her

44
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I have sugar in my mouth

45
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I won't cry anymore

46
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You told me this

47
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Su Mo, let me teach you a trick

48
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
When you teach people to leave the world, they will return to the sea

49
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let him go to your mother, ok?

50
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Thank you

51
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Sister

52
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why does the ghost blood star shine again?

53
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Look

54
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There is a star there

55
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I seem to have seen this before

56
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I have seen it before

57
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I have seen it before

58
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I have seen it before

59
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I have seen it before

60
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I have seen it before

61
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I seem to have seen this before

62
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I saw a star suddenly shine

63
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I remember

64
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I sent you and your mother to the cave

65
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Su Mo

66
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Su Mo, what's wrong with you?

67
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Su Mo

68
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What's wrong with you?

69
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Su Mo

70
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Su Mo

71
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Su Mo

72
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Su Mo

73
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Su Mo

74
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Doctor

75
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Take a look

76
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What are you doing?

77
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Ye Cheng is searching everywhere

78
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Take him out

79
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You should take a look

80
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I can make ten thousand gold pearls

81
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I will check

82
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,640
No.

83
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,440
The blood vessels are specially made for this.

84
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,120
This is the power of Dragon God.

85
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,840
Could this child be the Emperor of the Sea?

86
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,520
How could he be willing to give up

87
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,600
ten thousand gold beads?

88
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,640
Doctor, how is he?

89
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,840
He is wearing the Dragon Blood Ancient Jade.

90
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,400
This child is the Emperor of the Sea.

91
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,000
It turns out that he is the Emperor of the Sea

92
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,640
who practices the art of killing people.

93
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
He is really looking for his own death.

94
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,840
The art of killing people is unique.

95
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,400
I think Su Mo

96
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,520
stole my magic arts

97
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,720
because he wanted to avenge his mother.

98
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,800
Miss,

99
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
the one you are wearing

100
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,760
is the sacred thing of the Jiao clan.

101
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,800
You can try it on him.

102
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,600
You mean this?

103
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,400
Yes.

104
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,800
Put it on the child's chest.

105
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,680
Doctor,

106
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,080
what's going on?

107
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,240
The blood in the ancient jade

108
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,400
is sealed by the blood of the dragon.

109
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
It can save the Jiao clan.

110
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,600
Well, Miss,

111
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,040
I'll take the child to the second floor

112
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,400
to treat him carefully.

113
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,040
I'll do it.

114
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,080
No need.

115
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,200
I'll do it.

116
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
You guys stay here.

117
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,640
Don't disturb anyone.

118
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Do you understand?

119
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,680
Then,

120
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,200
I'll go to the second floor.

121
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
I'll go to the second floor.

122
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
I'll go to the second floor.

123
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
I'll go to the second floor.

124
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,400
Thank you, Doctor.

125
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
You're welcome.

126
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,800
What a good doctor.

127
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,000
Miss.

128
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,600
Miss.

129
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,400
The doctor said

130
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,200
no one is allowed to enter

131
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,000
the second floor.

132
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,600
Yes.

133
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,200
I always feel

134
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,800
a little worried.

135
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Don't worry.

136
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,000
I won't fight.

137
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,600
I just want to see if he wakes up.

138
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,800
OK.

139
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,400
Su Mo is missing.

140
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,200
Miss.

141
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,800
Miss.

142
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,200
Miss.

143
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,000
We must find Su Mo.

144
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,600
It's really the child.

145
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Yes.

146
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,400
His name is Su Mo.

147
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
I don't know why

148
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
he fell into the hands of Princess Chzu.

149
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,800
I saw it with my own eyes.

150
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,200
He absorbed the dragon blood

151
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,400
that Princess Chzu was wearing.

152
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,800
The blood of the real dragon.

153
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Only one in the world

154
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,400
can be absorbed by

155
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,200
Hai Huang who returned after seven thousand years.

156
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,400
Isn't that right?

157
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,400
Dragon blood only recognizes the dragon's pattern.

158
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
But Hai Huang

159
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,000
doesn't recognize his identity.

160
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,200
This dragon pattern will also be withdrawn.

161
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,600
In order to get there in a moment,

162
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,200
I made you see the dragon pattern.

163
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I tried my best.

164
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,600
You have to

165
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
take a good look.

166
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,200
You are Hai Huang.

167
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,000
Sister.

168
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Sister, where are you?

169
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,800
Sister, come and save me.

170
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,600
Sister?

171
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Save me.

172
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
It's Princess Chzu.

173
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,000
The fire and the spirit are two different things.

174
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,200
I'll go first.

175
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Goodbye.

176
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
An empty-sacred person

177
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,000
wants to make a deal with us Jiao people.

178
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,000
Where is this?

179
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Let me go.

180
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Let me go.

181
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,200
Keep the secret room well.

182
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,600
I want to change her hat.

183
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Yes.

184
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,800
I want to make a memory of Princess Chzu

185
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,600
and abandon her.

186
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
To deepen her hatred for the empty-sacred people.

187
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,600
So as to cover up her previous memories.

188
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,200
Our Haiguo Army

189
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,600
doesn't need a Hai Huang

190
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,200
who is a traitor.

191
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,600
What a great Zuo Quan Shi.

192
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
He put our Haiguo's hope

193
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
in the hands of an empty-sacred person.

194
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,600
And he lied to us to withdraw.

195
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,400
I'm afraid he is still immersed

196
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
in the fantasy of the peace and harmony of the two tribes.

197
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,600
Stay here and stop filming.

198
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,200
It's okayTER

199
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,720
We can work without principle

200
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,400
for a few more hours.

201
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Elder!

202
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,600
They asked us here for this just now.

203
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,120
Could it be

204
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,720
he was the one who sent Tianji Fengcheng

205
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,600
to kill the people?

206
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,440
Who is he?

207
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,440
How did he know so many secrets?

208
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,960
No matter who he is,

209
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,440
he used this poison to attack Jialan City.

210
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,440
He used it to stop the war

211
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,760
and set fire to Zhiyuan.

212
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,800
Then he used Shi Ying's hand

213
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,360
to get rid of this

214
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,120
person who is different from the heart and the people.

215
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,400
Title Consância

216
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,120
The Z fucked in game as it seems it's like.

217
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,240
Why did you wake up so suddenly?

218
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,600
As the moon nine Go Movement has taken effect,

219
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,040
but still, it isn't hurt as it is.

220
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,280
My Lord, there's nothing to worry.

221
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,160
This has been struggled as it seems that

222
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,560
the

223
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,040
I am worried

224
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,920
there will be something changed

225
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,520
unstripped

226
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,520
hybrid star Qing in a matter of seconds

227
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,660
become the brother

228
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,200
did this happen

229
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,960
and I will take control at that time

230
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,880
from discuss the gains of other designs.

231
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:51,820
Be it the

232
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,560
return of f doo not

233
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,680
or the future

234
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,760
or the future

235
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,600
of it in time for the future!...

236
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,160
If I fail to

237
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,360
Have you seen this child?

238
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,880
No.

239
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,520
Someone is killed.

240
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:06,960
Thank you.

241
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:29,740
The

242
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:49,100
Who are you?

243
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,940
Why did you hurt him?

244
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,940
Where is the Emperor of the Sea?

245
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,300
Let's go home.

246
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,780
Why?

247
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,300
Isn't it a war?

248
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Mother.

249
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,580
The people in the Zhao Mansion of the Emperor of the Sea

250
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,780
are now living in my old house.

251
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,780
No one can bother them.

252
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,340
You don't have to worry.

253
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,420
Mother.

254
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,420
Thank you, Master.

255
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,380
Please get up.

256
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:14,980
Thank you.

257
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,740
Let's go home.

258
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,660
Ning.

259
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,860
The blood has been transferred.

260
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,740
The army of the Sea is back.

261
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,740
It seems that the Emperor of the Sea has deceived us.

262
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,340
Please return to the palace immediately

263
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,260
to protect His Majesty.

264
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,700
Chong Ming.

265
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,700
Send the letter to Qing Gang and Bai Feng Ling as soon as possible.

266
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,660
Tell them to lead the army here immediately

267
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,020
to control the situation.

268
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,740
Okay.

269
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,460
These damn army of the Sea

270
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,300
are not our kind.

271
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,860
You have given them a chance.

272
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,860
I'll go to the Emperor of the Sea immediately.

273
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,340
Don't move, kid.

274
00:20:59,340 --> 00:20:59,740
Don't move.

275
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,980
Kid.

276
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,860
You are such a bunch of rascals.

277
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,060
You don't want to be trusted.

278
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,700
This is...

279
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,140
Mother.

280
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,660
Bastard.

281
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,380
Kill him.

282
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,540
No.

283
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,260
Mother.

284
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,780
Mother.

285
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,140
Stop.

286
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
Stop.

287
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,340
Why did you kill them?

288
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,260
I'm helping you, sir.

289
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,060
The Gui Xie Star has been transferred.

290
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,980
Then the Emperor of the Sea

291
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,860
must do something to help the poor.

292
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,180
Are you afraid of Su Mo?

293
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,540
Yes.

294
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,140
The Emperor of the Sea has been taken back by us from the Kong Sang people.

295
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,540
These people

296
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,740
and the people of Changli

297
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,740
died because of you.

298
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,940
You dream of peace.

299
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,340
Today, I'll use their blood

300
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,460
to destroy your alliance with Shi Ying.

301
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,540
These blind people have been unified by the Kong Sang people.

302
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,860
Those who are against the Sea Kingdom

303
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,340
will be killed.

304
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,940
Kill them.

305
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,940
No.

306
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,180
Kill them.

307
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,940
Elder.

308
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,580
Cheng Lang.

309
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,860
Cheng Lang.

310
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,140
Cheng Lang.

311
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,260
Cheng Lang.

312
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,580
Cheng Lang.

313
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,340
A'Xi.

314
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,500
The Supreme Commander is coming soon.

315
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,780
Take them away.

316
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,780
I'll take care of it.

317
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,860
Your Excellency.

318
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,460
You've been

319
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,580
doing nothing for us

320
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,020
all these days.

321
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,020
You just want us to

322
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,100
live a peaceful life.

323
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,820
But they

324
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,420
are cruel

325
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,220
and make us die for nothing.

326
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,740
The Han State

327
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,140
is in trouble.

328
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,740
They deserve to die.

329
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,220
Your Excellency,

330
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,980
please leave these scoundrels alone.

331
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,180
Yes.

332
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,700
Yes.

333
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,460
Leave them alone.

334
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,500
Granny.

335
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,460
I know.

336
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,180
But among the Jiao people,

337
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,980
there are thousands of

338
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,700
innocent people like you.

339
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,340
How can I abandon you?

340
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,220
The Han State

341
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,820
has been

342
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,980
deceived by the elders

343
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,260
and misled.

344
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,820
Now we can only unite

345
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,860
and return to Biluohai.

346
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,060
That's our only way out.

347
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,100
From now on,

348
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,260
I'll take over the Han State.

349
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,700
I'll protect the people.

350
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:29,980
You must

351
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,700
obey my orders.

352
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,500
We'll obey your orders.

353
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,500
Your Excellency.

354
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,260
The Jiao people are dying

355
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,500
because of the misdeeds of the elders.

356
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,180
The Han State is no match for the empty-handed army.

357
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,580
In the future,

358
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,900
all the Jiao people will suffer.

359
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,060
The Su people and the Su demons

360
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,540
are waiting for you to come back to take charge of the situation.

361
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,460
Your Excellency,

362
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,740
please take care of yourself.

363
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,940
Your Excellency.

364
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,940
Please take care of yourself.

365
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,780
Get up.

366
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,220
A'xi.

367
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,220
I'll leave them to you.

368
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,300
Brothers.

369
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,260
Take the people and leave with me.

370
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,300
Yes.

371
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Your Excellency, please take care of yourself.

372
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,300
Take care.

373
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,300
Your Excellency, please take care.

374
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,060
Your Excellency, please take care.

375
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,940
Your Excellency, please take care.

376
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,940
Your Excellency, please take care.

377
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,580
Please take care.

378
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,460
It's you.

379
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,900
You killed them.

380
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,300
They died because of me.

381
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,900
The Han State's military council was broken.

382
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,380
The evil spirits rose.

383
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,380
It's all because of you.

384
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,580
I can't let Shi Ying know about Su Mo's existence.

385
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,500
It's me.

386
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,260
Fine.

387
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,740
You can atone for your sin with your death.

388
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,620
The Su people and the Su demons are waiting for you to come back to take charge of the situation.

389
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,580
Your Excellency,

390
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,420
please take care of yourself.

391
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:14,900
No.

392
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,300
I can't die yet.

393
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,820
Because the Su dec diversion,

394
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,020
you and our people

395
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,860
are tubing into our hands

396
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,220
to silence our people.

397
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,340
Your Excellency,

398
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,740
please wait for our death stories.

399
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,140
Yes.

400
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,780
I..

401
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,420
I'll get it.

402
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,020
Is it perfect?

403
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,780
It's good.

404
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,780
If it's good,

405
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,860
God has repeated one time.

406
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,820
behavior of Hui Chen

407
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,220
is just like loving her.

408
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,380
If you later

409
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,180
have If you later

410
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,380
have things in your life,

411
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,540
you will regret.

412
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,620
Don't cry.

413
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,360
Sorry, Master.

414
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,140
Master,

415
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,160
who did this?

416
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,260
The pretense of being a traitor is to pass a fat chance.

417
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,520
Cunning!

418
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,580
Yan.

419
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,420
He's not the Candidaterett Yuan

420
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,900
whom you know anymore.

421
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,580
Now

422
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,620
When the two tribes had a conflict,

423
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,820
she stood on the side of the Navy.

424
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,700
Master,

425
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,300
there must be a misunderstanding.

426
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,340
A'Yuan might have some difficulties.

427
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,340
Stop talking.

428
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,180
Yan'er,

429
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
only today

430
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,580
I don't want to hear

431
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,460
any explanation about her.

432
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,340
I want to kill Kong Suo Ren.

433
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,260
Kill Kong Suo Ren.

434
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,180
No wonder his blood turned red.

435
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,500
The method of dream-changer

436
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,100
is very harmful to people.

437
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,220
If there is a slight error, he will die.

438
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,940
He is just a child

439
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,140
who is still immature.

440
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,700
Kill me.

441
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,460
Kill me.

442
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,700
I didn't expect that Elder Jian

443
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,700
would be so crazy and reckless.

444
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,340
He fell into a nightmare

445
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,980
that was made up for him.

446
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,420
I don't know when he will wake up.

447
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,540
If he takes the nightmare as a reality,

448
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,820
he will be full of hatred

449
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,700
for Kong Suo Ren even when he wakes up.

450
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,340
Father.

451
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,380
After the blood turned red,

452
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,540
the Master will not let the Sea Emperor go.

453
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,780
Now the war is on.

454
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,460
Kong Suo Ren is willing to fight.

455
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,740
All the Jiao people,

456
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,020
whether they are the Navy or not,

457
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,740
are not safe to walk outside.

458
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,900
During this time,

459
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,500
you stay and take care of Su Mo.

460
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,100
Okay, brother.

461
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,780
I am willing to fight.

462
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,620
I am willing to fight.

463
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,860
Yuan.

464
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,220
Yan.

465
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,100
Yuan.

466
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,740
I followed Zhi He

467
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,300
and finally found you.

468
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,780
I don't believe that you will fight with the Navy.

469
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,260
I don't believe that you will kill my master's old man.

470
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,020
All of this was done by that Master Jian

471
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,260
and then planted it on you.

472
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,580
Right?

473
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,060
Yan.

474
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,500
Everything has happened.

475
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,100
Everything is in vain.

476
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,660
The Navy picked up the fire.

477
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,260
I didn't obey the agreement with Shao Si Ming

478
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,780
and failed to trust him.

479
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,260
I have killed Master Jian.

480
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,060
I will try my best to stop the Navy.

481
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,300
Yuan.

482
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,020
That Master Jian

483
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,020
has been in power for hundreds of years.

484
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,460
His power has been changed.

485
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,020
His power is much stronger than before.

486
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,500
The Navy will listen to you.

487
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,300
I am the King of Sea.

488
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,260
They will listen to me sooner or later.

489
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,700
Yan.

490
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,300
I will try my best to solve everything.

491
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,700
You have to trust me.

492
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,380
I trust you.

493
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,260
By the way,

494
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,540
I took Su Mo to see a doctor a few days ago.

495
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,660
He was abducted by a man named Shen Tu.

496
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,180
I can't find him with Zhi He.

497
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,580
Right.

498
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,660
Zhi He can't enter the underground city of the merman.

499
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,900
Besides,

500
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,660
the dragon blood bone jade you gave me

501
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,380
was also absorbed by Su Mo.

502
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,020
So, Yan, Su Mo

503
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,100
and the dragon blood bone jade are related.

504
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,580
I can't let Yan know

505
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,980
Su Mo's current state.

506
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,300
Yuan.

507
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,700
I didn't expect so many things

508
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,180
to happen in such a short time.

509
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,180
It's a special situation.

510
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,340
That doctor

511
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,940
didn't want the merman's child

512
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,420
to fall into the hands of the merman.

513
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,020
So he brought her back.

514
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,940
It's a good intention.

515
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,260
Is Su Mo awake now?

516
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,900
Where is he?

517
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,620
Take me to see him.

518
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,220
He

519
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,020
has been sent back to the Bilo Sea by me.

520
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,380
The merman

521
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,860
is finally more comfortable in the water.

522
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,140
Actually,

523
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,540
I also want to explain something to my master.

524
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,620
But I can't see him now.

525
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,060
You don't have to explain.

526
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,980
You just have to believe

527
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,620
that I will handle everything well.

528
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,140
What's wrong with you and your master?

529
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,420
Nothing.

530
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,500
Brother.

531
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,620
Ruyi.

532
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,700
This is my sister Ruyi.

533
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,700
This is the Chzu Yanzhu

534
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,220
I've been talking about with you.

535
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,780
Ruyi.

536
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,980
It's great to see you guys together.

537
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,860
Princess Zhu Yan.

538
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,500
I often hear my brother mention you.

539
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,140
Thank you for taking care of my brother

540
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,180
all these years.

541
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,580
Yan.

542
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,180
No matter what's behind the war,

543
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,580
the relationship between the two tribes is in a mess now.

544
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,620
It's inconvenient for you to stay by my side.

545
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,700
In case someone who is interested in using you

546
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,980
will be in trouble.

547
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,020
I will be careful

548
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,820
and not let others know

549
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,580
that I used to be the housekeeper of Chifu.

550
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,420
Okay.

551
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,740
Now things are special.

552
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,500
You guys take care of yourselves.

553
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,140
Be careful.

554
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,260
Prince Shiyong is here.

555
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,340
Your Majesty.

556
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,780
You don't need to

557
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,860
be so formal with me.

558
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,900
Your Majesty.

559
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,700
I'm here to plead guilty.

560
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,500
The navy resumed the war

561
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,700
without any hesitation.

562
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,660
I listened to their words

563
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,820
and gave them time to start over.

564
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,460
Please punish me.

565
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,420
What's your plan

566
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,140
for this matter?

567
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,100
Without the navy of the navy of the Sea Emperor,

568
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,620
it's like a pile of sand.

569
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,180
I will do my best

570
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,260
to capture the Sea Emperor.

571
00:33:59,260 --> 00:33:59,900
No.

572
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,780
I want you

573
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,020
to kill the Sea Emperor

574
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,540
and destroy the navy of the Sea Emperor.

575
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,060
To end this war completely.

576
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,340
If the Sea Emperor is not dead,

577
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,420
there will be more navy of the Sea Emperor

578
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,020
to maintain the empty warehouse.

579
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,380
As long as the Sea Emperor is alive,

580
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,900
the mermaid will be

581
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,580
undead.

582
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,340
The turtle will threaten the empty warehouse.

583
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
No matter the Sea Emperor is a man or a woman,

584
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,420
old or young,

585
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,820
it doesn't matter what the difficulties are.

586
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,020
What matters is that

587
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,700
he must die

588
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:44,340
to solve the problem of the officials

589
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,140
and the people of the country.

590
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,980
To stop the chaos of the Jiao clan.

591
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,020
Your Majesty, you are right.

592
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,220
But now,

593
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,420
it's the only way

594
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,180
to solve the chaos of the navy of the Sea Emperor.

595
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,620
Yes.

596
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,020
I will kill the Sea Emperor myself.

597
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,300
I won't make any contribution.

598
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,380
I just want to atone for my wrongdoing.

599
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,700
People make mistakes.

600
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,500
If I can make up for it in time,

601
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,780
I will be able to make up for it.

602
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,500
If you want to make up for it,

603
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,140
you must admit your mistake before the world.

604
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,300
Moreover,

605
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,100
some mistakes

606
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,180
cannot be corrected.

607
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,180
I'm leaving.

608
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,260
All these years,

609
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,780
we have been living here

610
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,380
to wait

611
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,020
for the evil ghost to rise up

612
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,140
and the Sea Emperor to return.

613
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,340
Members,

614
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,780
our chance

615
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,660
has finally come.

616
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,020
This time,

617
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
we must defeat Kong Seng.

618
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,340
Defeat Kong Seng, Defeat Kong Seng, Defeat Kong Seng.

619
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,500
What is our objective?

620
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,020
To revive the country.

621
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:25,660
Father! Father!

622
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,780
Is it the summoning horse of Biluohai?

623
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,100
I've long wanted to go back to Biluohai.

624
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,340
Brothers!

625
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,900
Why should we bear the suffering of war?

626
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,540
Do you want to go back to Biluohai?

627
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,380
We don't want to fight!

628
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:52,980
What do you want?

629
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,580
What do you want?

630
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,580
We don't want to fight!

631
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,540
We don't want to fight!

632
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,140
Shut up!

633
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,100
We don't want to fight!

634
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,260
We don't want to fight!

635
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,860
You're disturbing the morale of the army.

636
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,820
Do you want to fight?

637
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,260
You're...

638
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,420
Argh.

639
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,660
I am Je Woah,

640
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,420
who CelsiusMusic parentage for a year earlier.

641
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,020
You are the sole hope

642
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,260
to dispel all my sorrows.

643
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,260
Whoever can backstory

644
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,260
to the ice and gulf sea,

645
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,780
I will do my best

646
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,300
to ease your worries.

647
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:45,940
Yes.

648
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,060
It's so amazing.

649
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,860
It's so great.

650
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,540
It's so great.

651
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,580
It's so great.

652
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,540
The merman was born on the Yenbo.

653
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,180
He will return to the sea of death.

654
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,500
We have been

655
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,420
wandering in the empty city for thousands of years.

656
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,260
It's time to go back to our own land.

657
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,660
Yes.

658
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,140
I will return to the sea of death.

659
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,180
We will return to the sea of death.

660
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,500
You are the God of God.

661
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,300
If you want to return to the sea of death,

662
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,060
follow me.

663
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,300
Yes.

664
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,340
Go.

665
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,900
Go.

666
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,520
Look, look

667
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,320
Make a turn

668
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,680
Close the door

669
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,520
Hurry

670
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,280
Very quick

671
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,720
Get close

672
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,120
Dump him

673
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,380
Hurry

674
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,080
來

675
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,560
Yes

676
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,320
General

677
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,280
ạ

678
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,460
important

679
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,100
This way.

680
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,700
Go.

681
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,900
Go up there.

682
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,780
General Qing,

683
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,900
did you find anything?

684
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,860
In the camp of the Navy,

685
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,100
we received information about what happened one day.

686
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,660
No wonder we've been fighting with the Navy

687
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,940
for a long time.

688
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,980
It seems that there's a spy

689
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,220
in our general's camp.

690
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,900
This is not a small matter.

691
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,780
We must find him.

692
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,860
We must kill him.

693
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,740
Go.

694
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,540
Why are you reading the military book so late at night?

695
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,940
As a woman,

696
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,780
do you want to lead the army to the battle?

697
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,660
I've never been to the Three Treasures Hall.

698
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,860
Please be frank.

699
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,820
Although our Bai Clan is the King of the stars,

700
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,900
the first one to be killed is you and me.

701
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,180
My father has passed the treasure of the tribe,

702
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,180
the Moon Ring, to me.

703
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,420
I can marry him,

704
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,780
which means I'm the one with the highest magic.

705
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,060
We're both of the same kind.

706
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,180
We're both of the same kind.

707
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,620
If something happens to you,

708
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,020
I'm sure you'll be there for me.

709
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,500
I have a military love letter

710
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,940
which I accidentally dropped in Qinggang.

711
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,060
I need to trouble you to get it back for me.

712
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,860
As a woman,

713
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,140
I can't lead the army to the battle.

714
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,500
Of course I won't get involved in military affairs.

715
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,180
Please allow me to do so.

716
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,860
Please go back.

717
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,260
What a coincidence.

718
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,900
I saw that your mother

719
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,120
had transferred her memorial tablet to the place of the

720
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,500
Mirror of the Dreadful.

721
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,980
I wanted to take her memorial tablet back

722
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,060
once the war was over.

723
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,500
Don't you want to do that?

724
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,580
Don't worry.

725
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,380
As long as you get what I want back,

726
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,900
I'll fulfill your filial duty.

727
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,700
What do you want?

728
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,380
It's not a big deal.

729
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,660
It's just that I accidentally dropped

730
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,180
a message in the West Spring Camp.

731
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,900
West Spring Camp?

732
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,500
You leaked the message to the Navy?

733
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,460
Why?

734
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,300
Because I don't want the war to end.

735
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,940
Only when the war is over,

736
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,940
I can use the violence of the Mirror of the Dreadful

737
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,020
to call for the storm.

738
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,660
Only when the war is over,

739
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,140
I can use the military power of the Dreadful

740
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,700
to threaten the people.

741
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,180
Are you crazy, Bai Feng Li?

742
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,180
You trusted me

743
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,660
to use the war as a bait

744
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,420
and committed such a big crime.

745
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,620
Sister,

746
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,140
we are both the same.

747
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,020
I'm the only son of Prince Bai.

748
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,980
If I'm to be punished for this,

749
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,220
do you think the Bai family can be kept in the dark?

750
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,060
Except for your mother's memorial tablet,

751
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,740
hundreds of lives of the Bai family

752
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,820
are all in your mind, sister.

753
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,940
I just need you to help me

754
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,420
get a thin piece of paper.

755
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,500
If I get the information back,

756
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,580
Qing Gang will immediately find out

757
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,900
that you did it.

758
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,740
It's unfair.

759
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,580
He has no evidence.

760
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,540
He can't do anything to me.

761
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,660
Xue Lu,

762
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,460
