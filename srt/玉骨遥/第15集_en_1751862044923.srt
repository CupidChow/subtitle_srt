1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,440
Please watch the moment of heartache.

2
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,720
It's him!

3
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,680
It's him!

4
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,040
My father was just

5
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,880
with a bruise on his face.

6
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
He was so awake.

7
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,520
But after he took the prescription,

8
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,520
he became like this.

9
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,840
Give my father back!

10
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,320
Give me a reason!

11
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,520
Give me a reason!

12
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,040
It's okay.

13
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,440
It's a good cause!

14
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,120
How could he do this?

15
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,040
Calm down, everyone.

16
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,960
He is my apprentice.

17
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,920
I made a mistake.

18
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,000
I should be blamed.

19
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,520
I'll take responsibility

20
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,960
for your father's illness.

21
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,360
Tell me everything

22
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,040
in detail.

23
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,160
Master.

24
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,720
In the afternoon,

25
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,000
I saw you were so busy

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,080
at the factory that you couldn't open your body.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,040
I think this old lady

28
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,520
is not that seriously ill.

29
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,960
So I took some medicine

30
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,560
according to the prescription

31
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,080
that Chong Ming told me.

32
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,080
Don't panic.

33
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,760
What kind of medicine did you take?

34
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,440
I took

35
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,040
the night autumn,

36
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,160
the sky,

37
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,120
the butterfly,

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,280
the stone,

39
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,320
and

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,960
the sheep.

41
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,120
Which sheep?

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,120
The sheep of Yin and Yang.

43
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,040
By the way,

44
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,840
the problem is

45
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,640
on this demon.

46
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,360
You only know the cause

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,440
but you don't know the meaning.

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,520
It's the wrong medicine.

49
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,000
The sheep in my prescription

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,360
is the sheep of Yang Chen.

51
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,040
It's far less than

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
the one you use.

53
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,440
Please

54
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,640
get some hot water.

55
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,240
Okay.

56
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,920
I'll go.

57
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,640
I'll go.

58
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,640
Master, please.

59
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,640
The demon is here.

60
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,480
The demon is here.

61
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,240
What's wrong?

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,720
Bye bye.

63
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,080
How many crimes will he be stemmed from.

64
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,360
He did not invest more in

65
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,640
Zhu Yan, have you learned female martial arts?

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,640
Yes, I have.

67
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Okay, use your true heart

68
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,640
to heal her wound.

69
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Master,

70
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,640
you still believe me?

71
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,640
Hurry up.

72
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Look at the wound.

73
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
It's so big.

74
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,640
It's so big.

75
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
It's so big.

76
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
It's so big.

77
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
It's so big.

78
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
It's so big.

79
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
It's so big.

80
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
So big.

81
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,280
We can't repay

82
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,840
the kindness of Young Master.

83
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,240
The villagers of Jiuyi Jun

84
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,640
are willing to be your slaves.

85
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,640
Thank you, Young Master.

86
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
Thank you, Young Master.

87
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Thank you, Young Master.

88
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,440
Please get up.

89
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,840
Get up.

90
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
Get up.

91
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Get up.

92
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Thank you, Young Master.

93
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Thank you, Young Master.

94
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
I don't need your repayment.

95
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
But

96
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
the hot night is coming.

97
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
It's indeed a bit strange.

98
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
I wonder if we have found the source.

99
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
I have already

100
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
checked it with someone.

101
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Who is the strange one?

102
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
The first person who suffered from this disease

103
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
lived in the east of the village.

104
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
He used the water of the East and West of Jiuyi.

105
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
Yes.

106
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Yes.

107
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Yes.

108
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
The East and West of Jiuyi.

109
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Well.

110
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
I will write down the prescription in detail

111
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
and ask the village chief

112
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,840
to give it to the person who needs it.

113
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
I hope the hot night

114
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
will pass soon.

115
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
Later,

116
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
please take me

117
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
to the East and West of Jiuyi.

118
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Yes.

119
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
It's just ahead.

120
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Come on.

121
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
How is it?

122
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Indeed.

123
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
The water quality has changed.

124
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
Let's go further.

125
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Your Majesty.

126
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
What do you want from me?

127
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
The disease of Jiuyi

128
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
broke out.

129
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
I went down the mountain to treat it.

130
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
But I found

131
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,840
something strange.

132
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
The source of the disease

133
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
should be the source of the water

134
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,840
of the East and West of Jiuyi.

135
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
I went to the upper reaches to check.

136
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
I found that

137
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
the source of the disease

138
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
was the water of the East and West of Jiuyi.

139
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
The source of the disease

140
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
is the source of the water

141
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
of the East and West of Jiuyi.

142
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,840
I went to the upper reaches to check.

143
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
I found that

144
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
there was a bubble in the water.

145
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,840
The water quality has changed.

146
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
The source of the disease

147
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
is the source of the water

148
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
of the East and West of Jiuyi.

149
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
The source of the disease

150
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
seems to be

151
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
the water of the East and West of Jiuyi.

152
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
But in fact,

153
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
the source of the disease

154
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
is the source of the water of the Cangwu.

155
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Judging from the shape of the bubble,

156
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
there seems to be

157
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
spiritual power in the water

158
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
that is stirring the source of the disease.

159
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Do you remember

160
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
that the dragon god was caught in the abyss

161
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,840
and the ice tribe was trapped in the wild?

162
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
You mean

163
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
the dragon god was trapped

164
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,840
in the abyss of Cangwu?

165
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
The dragon god woke up,

166
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
the evil spirit rose,

167
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
and the sea king returned.

168
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
This is the great thing

169
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
that the Jiao people expected.

170
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,840
The Jiao people's navy

171
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
has been in chaos

172
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
in the dark for years.

173
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
If the dragon god really wakes up,

174
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840
they will be even more uneasy.

175
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
The world will also be in chaos.

176
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Please allow me

177
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
to go to Cangwu

178
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
to investigate the truth.

179
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
If the world is in chaos,

180
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
it's not the best time

181
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
for Ying'er to go down the mountain.

182
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
No need for now.

183
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
The dragon god woke up

184
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
is just my guess.

185
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
It's even more bad

186
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
if it's a snake that's fighting grass.

187
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Let's wait and see.

188
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Yes.

189
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Let's go.

190
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Princesses, this way please.

191
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
They're really good at acting.

192
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
It's quite interesting.

193
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Please have your meal here.

194
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
I think both Princesses

195
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,840
are in the court.

196
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Why are only me and my sister

197
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
here?

198
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Did we make a mistake?

199
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Enough. Just sit down.

200
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
This must be arranged

201
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
by Consort Qing

202
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
especially for us.

203
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Princess Xue Lu is right.

204
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
I'm a servant

205
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
in His Highness Shiyu's palace.

206
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
I was transferred here

207
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
to serve you.

208
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
I'll go back now.

209
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
If you need anything,

210
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
you can tell the maids

211
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
outside the door at any time.

212
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
I'll take my leave.

213
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
Sister,

214
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
I want to go out

215
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
alone.

216
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
Go ahead.

217
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Guards.

218
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Yes.

219
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Please tell Consort Qing

220
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
that Bai Xue Lu has something important

221
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
to see you.

222
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
It's about the Mount Jiuyi.

223
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Yes.

224
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
These are all the best

225
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
desserts in the world.

226
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Try it.

227
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
It's indeed a chef's dish.

228
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
It smells sweet.

229
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Try this.

230
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
I haven't eaten this yet.

231
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
I can't eat it.

232
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
How can you?

233
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
You've been selling

234
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
so much in Mount Jiuyi for a month.

235
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
It's time to make up for it.

236
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
If you keep persuading me to eat,

237
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
I'll turn from Xue Ying

238
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
into a snow ball.

239
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
It's good.

240
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
I like both

241
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
Xue Ying and Snow Ball.

242
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
I like both.

243
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Then you should eat it too.

244
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
Xue Ying,

245
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
I didn't expect that

246
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
I would have to make you suffer

247
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
by setting up a feast.

248
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
It's okay.

249
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
I feel happy

250
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,840
whenever I see you.

251
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
But even if you've left,

252
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
it's not easy for me

253
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
to see you.

254
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
It's okay.

255
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
He's here to accompany me.

256
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
You've given him so many feathers.

257
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
I always think that

258
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
after this quick lesson,

259
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
by then,

260
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
Xue Ying will be with you

261
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
for a long time.

262
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Your Highness.

263
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Your Highness.

264
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Princess Snow Fall,

265
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
why are you here?

266
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
I have something important

267
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
to meet Consort Jing.

268
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Could it be...

269
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,840
I pay my respects to Your Highness.

270
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,840
You asked me to meet you.

271
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
What's the matter?

272
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
Why are you laughing?

273
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Are you trying to

274
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840
make a deal with me?

275
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
I dare not.

276
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
I'm willing to

277
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
make a deal with you

278
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
for the sake of the Snow Ball.

279
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
I'm willing to

280
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
help you

281
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
with the thing that you did

282
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
on the mountain.

283
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,840
But it's quite dangerous in the mountain.

284
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
I'm sure that

285
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
you can handle it.

286
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Don't worry.

287
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
I'm always

288
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
clear about what I should do.

289
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
You won't go there

290
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
for nothing

291
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
if you help me.

292
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
But as to

293
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
what rewards I can get,

294
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
it depends on

295
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,840
what kind of news you give me.

296
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

297
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Everything you want

298
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
is here.

299
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
What do you mean?

300
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
The Young Minister of the Nine-Yi Mountain

301
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
looks noble

302
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,840
and has a high level of magic.

303
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,840
But no one knows his past.

304
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,840
When I was listening to the snow in the mountain,

305
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
you called me several times

306
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
and encouraged me

307
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
to take the position of the leader.

308
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
For this,

309
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
you gave me

310
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
the key to the magic.

311
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840
You also said

312
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,840
something I don't understand.

313
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
You helped me to be the leader

314
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840
because of my surname.

315
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Why didn't you

316
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
become the leader?

317
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
It's because I'm not

318
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
in the mountain.

319
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
I'm here for you.

320
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
I came to the mountain

321
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
to help you

322
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,840
with your work.

323
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
So I lost to

324
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Princess Zhu Yan

325
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
in the competition.

326
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
If I hadn't been so determined

327
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
and used the Young Minister's power

328
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
to win people's hearts,

329
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
I would have been

330
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
defeated long ago.

331
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
He's so powerful.

332
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
Yes.

333
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Even General Qing Gang

334
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
admires Young Minister

335
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
and his family.

336
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
What else do you know?

337
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
Don't worry, Your Highness.

338
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
I know that

339
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
I'm not strict with you.

340
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
I'm not strict with you.

341
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
I just hope that

342
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,840
you can be careful.

343
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
Guards.

344
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Yes.

345
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Go to the kitchen

346
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
and call Yu'er out.

347
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
It's late.

348
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Why are you still

349
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
with that Bai Xueying

350
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
there?

351
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
Go.

352
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,840
Yes.

353
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
Xuelu,

354
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,840
this is the first reward

355
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,840
I give you.

356
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
If you continue

357
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
to know the situation,

358
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
and know the situation,

359
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
don't worry.

360
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
I'll give you

361
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,840
everything I promised.

362
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

363
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Go.

364
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Guards.

365
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
Prepare the carriage.

366
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Yes.

367
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Raise your right hand

368
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
to support me.

369
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
You've been watching

370
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
the settings of our store

371
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
for several days.

372
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,800
They're' wearing

373
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,820
neot philiaub 둥cao

374
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
gold.

375
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
So they were

376
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
wearing neot philiaub 둥cao.

377
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
It means they are

378
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
in good health.

379
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
What did you and Consort Qing say?

380
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,960
I saw her order someone to get the carriage ready to leave the palace.

381
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,920
I just told you the story of the mountain villa

382
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,000
and especially the story of the mysterious Shao Siming.

383
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,040
I told Her Highness the truth.

384
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,400
In order to be the first one,

385
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,920
the only thing I have

386
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,800
is the identity of Shao Siming.

387
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,960
I have to do everything I can.

388
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,360
General Qin,

389
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,400
I always do this.

390
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,080
You only ask about the benefits and not the disadvantages.

391
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,080
Didn't you see it earlier?

392
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,200
No.

393
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,200
Xue Luo,

394
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,960
you are not like this.

395
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,520
I was very touched

396
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,720
by what you said to me that night.

397
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,760
I thought about it for a long time after I went back.

398
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,520
If you want to get out of the palace,

399
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,480
it's not the only way to get into the palace.

400
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,560
General Qin,

401
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,720
do you have any misunderstanding

402
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,640
about our relationship?

403
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,440
You should think about yourself more.

404
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,880
Consort Qing already knows that you are lying to her.

405
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,680
She doesn't know how to deal with you.

406
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,360
General Qin,

407
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,440
Her Highness has an order

408
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,160
to order you to return to the Qingzu territory

409
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,880
and kneel in the ancestral hall to listen to the message.

410
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
I will obey the order.

411
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,640
Princess Xue Luo,

412
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,640
I will not give up on you.

413
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,640
Don't you stop my girly under the emperor.

414
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,680
Even after knowing that I will see no others,

415
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,400
I can't listen to any others.

416
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,360
I really don't want to have an affair with you all because

417
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,480
I really like the wife of His Majesty.

418
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,120
Are you happy now?

419
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,160
So maybe we

420
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,740
find our Take-all to

421
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,160
take away the title of Princess Xue Luo once.

422
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,200
I know you love me so much,

423
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,920
but I'm sorry

424
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,960
General Qin,

425
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,960
I can only blame you for being wronged.

426
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,800
After coming down from Mount Jiuyi,

427
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,920
I found my sister

428
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,520
was also pitiful.

429
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,120
It's the first time I don't recognize you.

430
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,520
I think your sister is just...

431
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,240
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

432
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,120
Yes.

433
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,760
Stop!

434
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,440
I'll go by myself.

435
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,920
Your Highness,

436
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,520
Princess Xueying of the White Tribe

437
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,920
is not a good person.

438
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,080
She is punished to go to the White Tribe

439
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,680
without going out

440
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,600
and communicating with Prince Shiyu.

441
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,720
According to Bai Xue Lu,

442
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,680
I can be sure that

443
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,640
the young minister of Mount Jiuyi

444
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,360
is that damn Shi Ying.

445
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,560
We can't be late.

446
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,200
Brother,

447
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,160
please send the people of the tribe

448
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,400
to Mount Jiuyi today

449
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,880
and kill her

450
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,240
before she is sealed.

451
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,520
She is still alive?

452
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,960
Your Highness,

453
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,480
the envoys of the Chess World are here.

454
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,560
Your Highness,

455
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,120
Your Highness.

456
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,680
What's the matter?

457
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,240
Chess World knows that Your Highness

458
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,800
is troubled by the order of the young minister of Mount Jiuyi.

459
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,880
They asked me to send a message.

460
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
The wise man said

461
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,920
everything is under his control.

462
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,480
Please be patient, Your Highness and Consort Qing.

463
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,680
Don't act hastily.

464
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,720
But Shi Ying has now

465
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,520
taken the Chess World's only daughter as her disciple.

466
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,240
And the other tribe's children

467
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,800
have been favored

468
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,400
and valued

469
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,920
and even Qing Gang was deceived by them.

470
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,280
If one day

471
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,320
Shi Ying Zhen's willful throne

472
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,600
is completely useless

473
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,320
in the future,

474
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,160
if we don't take this opportunity

475
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,320
and kill her,

476
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,800
will we really be a threat to the Chess World?

477
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,680
The wise man asked you and Consort Qing to be assured

478
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,400
that she is more anxious

479
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,640
to see the late crown prince

480
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,360
die in vain than you.

481
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,000
Consort Qing has guessed the identity of the young minister.

482
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
I'm afraid she will take the blame.

483
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,400
Please be very careful, Young Minister.

484
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,960
You sent me

485
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,880
the gift of Snow-white and the letter of Qing Gang.

486
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,000
You've been a master for a month.

487
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,360
You've done a lot for her.

488
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,280
By the way,

489
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,040
what did the letter say?

490
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,880
The letter said

491
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,760
Consort Qing might be unfavorable to me.

492
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,520
Then...

493
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,360
Then why are you so indifferent?

494
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,880
Since it's an early death,

495
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,280
why should I be anxious?

496
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,840
Then do you want to be useless

497
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:54,420
or libid into a

498
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,680
trying-hard attitude for debts?

499
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,600
I'm afraid

500
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,680
if you really want to be a smoothly collapsed council,

501
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,120
then your heart is exhausted.

502
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,800
Since your father cares for the young lady,

503
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,520
then take this.

504
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,080
Xueying, how are you?

505
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,240
I have a doctor for you.

506
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,520
He can treat you.

507
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,560
I'm not sick.

508
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,360
I don't need a doctor.

509
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
I told you

510
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,440
I don't need a doctor.

511
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,760
You really don't need a doctor?

512
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,200
Your Highness.

513
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,560
Your Highness.

514
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,120
I'm sorry to make you cry.

515
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,480
You've been wronged, Your Highness.

516
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,920
Sit down.

517
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,520
Your Highness, please go back.

518
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,600
If Consort Qin knows you're out,

519
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,040
she'll punish you.

520
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,280
My mother only said you can't leave the mansion.

521
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,080
She didn't say I can't come to see you.

522
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,560
Even if she knows,

523
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
I'm not against it.

524
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,120
But you'd better be careful.

525
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,040
I know.

526
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,040
I've thought about it.

527
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,160
Since your father agreed,

528
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,120
I can come to see you.

529
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
This time, it's a doctor.

530
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,800
Next time, it can be a private.

531
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,760
Next time, I can be a guard.

532
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,240
It must be fun.

533
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,520
I think you should eat something to make up for it.

534
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,840
I really WordPressed you.

535
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,800
I've made up more than what you said.

536
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,560
Your Highness.

537
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,600
You haven't had dance practice till now.

538
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,900
Stop nodding in front of your father.

539
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,840
Go and stay in your room.

540
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,180
My lady.

541
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,280
You are back.

542
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,280
How is he?

543
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,040
you'll be fine.

544
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,760
The Qing clan needs General Qing Gang

545
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,320
to fight for them.

546
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,840
He won't be punished.

547
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,360
General Qing even sent someone

548
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,800
to send a set of military tactics to Her Grace.

549
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,880
I don't want to see any military tactics.

550
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,420
Go!

551
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,820
You!

552
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,100
Go!

553
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,280
Boo!

554
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,980
Higher.

555
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,100
Go way.

556
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,420
My pear!

557
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,100
I'm like the moon when I'm young with you

558
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,100
The love in my eyes is like the moon when I'm young

559
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,100
I'm so busy that I can't even read the book

560
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,100
I'm so busy that I can't even read the book

561
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,100
I just hope that we can be together forever

562
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,100
I just hope that we can be together forever

563
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
I don't like it

564
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,100
I don't like it

565
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,100
Give it to me

566
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,100
I'll make another one

567
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,100
I don't like it

568
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
I like it

569
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
I don't like it

570
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
I don't like it

571
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,100
Zhou Yan

572
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,100
Zhou Yan

573
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,100
Zhuyi

574
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,740
Come here.

575
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,820
Come here.

576
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,860
Yes.

577
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,060
Master, please enjoy.

578
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:37,860
Wait.

579
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,360
The

580
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,220
Sit down.

581
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,260
Let's eat together.

582
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,780
Me?

583
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,140
Is there anyone else here?

584
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,580
You guys eat together often and be rich.

585
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,460
You don't have to be pale.

586
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,860
Is Master out now?

587
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,620
I'm about to go check on Master.

588
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,680
בס

589
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,340
��니

590
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,740
Don't waste your time.

591
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,260
You two enjoy the meal...

592
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,060
and keep seeing me?

593
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,540
I...

594
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,740
Don't speak!

595
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,900
I know what you mean.

596
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,180
Although you've changed the world of the plant

597
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,980
in just a day,

598
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,340
you haven't performed the best part of it.

599
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,500
School Kui Xiu-yuan can control the power

600
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,780
of constitution.

601
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,900
The experts themselves are as pure as via ftitial leaves.

602
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,780
While you are as blunt as stone,

603
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,420
shielded from heat,

604
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,780
dose your fire with your palm,

605
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,060
light silver in golden time Dragon Flute,

606
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,940
which all works as an entry attack.

607
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,060
Though you had the Self-sacrifice Power,

608
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,000
you still weren't skilled enough.

609
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,940
To practice voodoo really hard,

610
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,580
one would have to

611
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,380
arrive at the end.

612
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,540
You even had to practice hard.

613
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,780
For the last item,

614
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,180
you dreamt of being a monster

615
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,220
and was all that but a wolf.

616
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,020
Until all star�

617
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,620
but you turned into a sheep.

618
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,180
If you were in real life,

619
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,380
I'm afraid you would have been buried in the wolf's den.

620
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,780
I wonder

621
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,660
if I've learned

622
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,580
some of the techniques

623
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,020
that you usually use in class.

624
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,020
I do want to say that

625
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,140
when you were surrounded by wolves,

626
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,980
you tried to use the way of the tent

627
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:33,980
to fight them

628
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,620
instead of running away from them.

629
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,060
You have the courage.

630
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,020
Although I made a mistake,

631
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,580
I'm glad that you still

632
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,740
recognized my courage.

633
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,180
As a teacher,

634
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,420
you can't judge by the result.

635
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,740
You have to know

636
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,980
your shortcomings

637
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,540
and your light of defeat.

638
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:54,860
However,

639
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,140
with your cultivation,

640
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,380
it's too early to use the tent.

641
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,300
Even if you use it with no effort,

642
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,060
you will only make a mistake

643
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,300
like today.

644
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,500
You are in danger.

645
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,500
You must not

646
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,460
make the same mistake again.

647
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,660
You know me best.

648
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,980
I'll write a letter

649
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,060
and go back to Tianji City

650
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,700
to show off.

651
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,620
Stop.

652
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,820
What's the point of writing a letter?

653
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,860
I'm afraid that

654
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,500
in your usual letters,

655
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,980
I'm just a

656
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,220
young and handsome student.

657
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,500
When did you

658
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,540
start caring

659
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,460
about the eyes of others?

660
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,580
Don't make a scene.

661
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,780
Don't make a scene.

662
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,820
This is the rarest needle in the world.

663
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,100
If you like it,

664
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,620
choose one.

665
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,740
It's your first magic tool.

666
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,580
Come on.

667
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,380
This is not a skill

668
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,460
that you can't use.

669
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,620
I think you should

670
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,660
let it go.

671
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,580
Does it have a magic name?

672
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,260
This is a new item.

673
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,460
It has no name for now.

674
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,140
Why don't you

675
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,940
give it a name?

676
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:04,820
So,

677
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,380
after I learn it from someone,

678
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,660
I can marry it to my wife.

679
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,820
This item is beautiful,

680
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,860
and it's tried for yourself.

681
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,940
There's no better name than this.

682
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,380
اث.

683
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,220
I should ask my master

684
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,900
to give me more names.

685
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,240
Come.

686
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,480
Master.

687
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,080
What about this one?

688
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,360
This one.

689
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,480
And...

690
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,220
What about this one?

691
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:53,920
Nonsense.

692
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,800
The magic chips in thisru are many.

693
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,440
How can I take their names one by one?

694
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,620
Just choose the one you love.

695
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,800
Many?

696
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,520
Then I must choose well.

697
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,780
I always regret who I married.

698
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,580
But why can't I forgive him?

699
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,500
Alright, have some tea first.

700
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,700
It's all here you said!

701
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:33,980
You actually...

702
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,900
You're so beautiful, the child of an immortal.

I'm teued by fallingallingand night mask.

706
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,920
I can't get out of your heart

I can't get out of your heart

708
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,920
You are the only one

709
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,920
You can't be my flower

710
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,920
You are the only one

711
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,920
By your side

712
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,920
You are the only one

713
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,920
You can't be my flower

You can't be my flower

You can't be my flower

You can't be my flower

You are the only one

You can't be my flower
