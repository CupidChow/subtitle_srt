1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please give me a life of shining scenery

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am a piece of jade, a piece of jade

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I am not the heaven

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But I am the eternity of you

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I am the eternity of you

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I am the eternity of you

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I want to be the first person you met in my heart

9
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,380
In this true time, single говорят

10
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:17,320
Under the autumn sun, the petals withoutdirect junior

11
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,320
May the two worlds be happy for a hundred years.

12
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,480
May the two worlds be happy for a hundred years.

13
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,480
May the two worlds be happy for a hundred years.

14
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,320
I heard that the Princess of the Chis is not willing to marry him.

15
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,800
That princess has someone else in her heart.

16
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,600
But the wedding is the order of His Majesty.

17
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,720
If he doesn't marry,

18
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,440
the whole Chis will be involved in the anger.

19
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,600
The auspicious time has come.

20
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Please give the gift of the peace.

21
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,240
Miss, it's not too late to stop now.

22
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,680
Miss,

23
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,760
once you step out of this tent,

24
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,280
you can't go home anymore.

25
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,000
The Princess is old.

26
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,440
You're the only daughter.

27
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,280
Can you really give up on them?

28
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,000
Even if I stay here,

29
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,240
I can't see them for the rest of my life.

30
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,280
What's the difference with death?

31
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,680
Please give the gift of the peace.

32
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Your Highness, please give the gift of the peace.

33
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,820
Take care!

34
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,120
Sure.

35
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,060
West Keeps Huaiいた

36
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,180
Good!

37
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,040
Very good!

38
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,020
Very good!

39
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,100
Bow first.

40
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,700
Next

41
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,580
Let's draw it

42
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,420
Mark it

43
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,580
Second, bow

44
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,980
Third, bow

45
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,140
it was fake.

46
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,020
Drink the Zither.

47
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,100
This is great.

48
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,460
May the flag be raised and may the year of the Ox be blessed.

49
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,860
May the flag be raised and may the year of the Ox be blessed.

50
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,860
Great!

51
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,180
Ribbon Cross.

52
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
Whoseeta this?

53
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,460
The piece you wanted was the one I grabbed.

54
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,420
One hundred thousand coins for dois!

55
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,500
Gu-abetted!

56
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,700
The string of sages was hurt him,

57
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,220
but the sword is still close.

58
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,220
No!

59
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,220
It's ridiculous.

60
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,460
In this life and this world,

61
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,620
no one is forcing me to get married anymore.

62
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,220
No.

63
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
Father.

64
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,220
Mother.

65
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,220
I'm sorry.

66
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,220
We'll be apart for the rest of our lives.

67
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,220
I'm sorry.

68
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,220
I'm sorry.

69
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,220
Master.

70
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,220
You.

71
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,220
How dare you treat me like this

72
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,220
and give me the gift I gave you.

73
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,220
Master.

74
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,220
Why are you here all of a sudden?

75
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,220
I...

76
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,220
I thought

77
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,220
I would never see you again in this life and this world.

78
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,220
Didn't you invite me

79
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,220
to drink your wedding wine?

80
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
The great sorcerer of Huotu Tribe

81
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,220
has a powerful magic power

82
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,220
and is easy to control.

83
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,220
I'm afraid that you can't see me

84
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
in this life and this world.

85
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,220
The great sorcerer has a powerful magic power

86
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,220
and is easy to control.

87
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,220
The great sorcerer?

88
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,220
He has such a powerful magic power?

89
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,220
It seems that I underestimated him.

90
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,220
So,

91
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,220
you played this drama

92
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,220
of escaping from the wedding

93
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,220
under his nose?

94
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,220
You're really a fool.

95
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,220
Didn't you separate me from my master?

96
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,220
Why are you coming to teach me now?

97
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,220
In fact,

98
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,220
if it weren't for your sudden appearance,

99
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,220
I would have escaped long ago.

100
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,220
Escaped?

101
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,220
Yes.

102
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,220
This is also a trick of master.

103
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,220
Use the fake to trick me.

104
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,220
Use the gold to break the trap.

105
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,220
With your skills,

106
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,220
how can you trick me?

107
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,220
Even if they can't see it,

108
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,220
they won't find that the person who kicked you

109
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,220
is just your puppet.

110
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,220
But Su Da, the princess,

111
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,220
and the king of Khorke are not fools.

112
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,220
Won't they find that

113
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,220
the famous Jiang Zhu Feiyan

114
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,220
is a stupid person

115
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,220
who is just a wooden head?

116
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
You...

117
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,220
Okay.

118
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,220
My plan is out of the blue.

119
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,220
But as the Shaosi命 of Mount Jiuyi,

120
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,220
I'm busy with the Dragon Sword

121
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,220
and I can't see the end.

122
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,220
Is it because I came here

123
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,220
for the escape plan

124
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,220
of the disciple?

125
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,220
But now

126
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,220
the wedding ceremony is over.

127
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,220
Master has run away

128
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,220
for nothing.

129
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,220
It doesn't matter.

130
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,220
I can wait for the next time.

131
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,220
What?

132
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,220
Next time?

133
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,220
There will be no next time.

134
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,220
I've already told you once.

135
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,220
Master, please return the jade bone to me.

136
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,220
I was going to get it back.

137
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,220
Forget it.

138
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,220
It's no use explaining.

139
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,220
Anyway, I was wrong in everything I said.

140
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Go back with me

141
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,220
and see what you've done.

142
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,220
Don't worry.

143
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,220
We are hiding under the umbrella.

144
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,220
No one can see us.

145
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,220
Go.

146
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,220
Great!

147
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,220
Great!

148
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,220
Great!

149
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,220
Great!

150
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,220
How is he?

151
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,220
Her Highness.

152
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,220
Her Highness is badly injured.

153
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,220
We need to rescue her.

154
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,220
Bring her to the tent.

155
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,220
Yes.

156
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,220
Even if we can't see her,

157
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,220
we can figure it out with a pulse.

158
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,220
The family of Jia has already died.

159
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,220
What on earth are the Princess Consort

160
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,220
and Great Wushi planning to do?

161
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,220
What are they trying to do?

162
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,220
They're trying to help her.

163
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,220
What should we do?

164
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,220
What should we do?

165
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,220
What should we do?

166
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:30,980
It's a little difficult.

167
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,020
Thus...

168
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,340
Ke'er

169
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Could you step down first?

170
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,460
Have someone to control everything

171
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,140
해라고

172
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,940
No one is allowed to get close

173
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,180
If scenario ambassador suddenly gets turned down

174
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,900
You can tell Lord Yan

175
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,100
to help him

176
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,460
The sorcerer is trying to save Her Grace.

177
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,420
She can't go in at this critical moment.

178
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,300
Do you know that?

179
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,340
Go.

180
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,900
In such a miserable state,

181
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,580
the reaction of Prince of Khorke

182
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,060
is the usual.

183
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,860
But this consort is too calm.

184
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,260
She is not surprised

185
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,100
or sad about Er Xie's death.

186
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,900
Look at my body.

187
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,740
Master's thoughts

188
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,540
can still be used freely.

189
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,700
He is not an ordinary person.

190
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,460
Your Grace,

191
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,420
we can only use another method now.

192
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,060
Fortunately, the materials are ready.

193
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,820
I can do it now.

194
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,860
Go.

195
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,260
Why did they take so many salt pearls from the sorcerers?

196
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,820
It's too cruel.

197
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,300
The clue of the sorcerers

198
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,980
is indeed on her.

199
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,700
A'Yun.

200
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,860
Is A'Yun all right?

201
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,860
A'Yun.

202
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,100
It's our chief.

203
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,100
I just met her two days ago.

204
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,540
Ning Biju

205
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,900
will have such a strong color

206
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,980
after three days of being out of the mountain.

207
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,580
You just met her a few days ago.

208
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,340
So she must not be here.

209
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,340
What do they want on earth?

210
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,060
The above thing is normal.

211
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,380
But it is superfluous.

212
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,800
Who lives

213
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,400
will resign to the consequences if he dies.

214
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,100
Just be who you are.

215
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,940
Righteous?

216
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,820
Righteousness must be protected.

217
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,340
Therefore I

218
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,500
am willing

219
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,460
to risk my life

220
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:25,140
and give you power.

221
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,900
Ru Yan's heart is willing to help us.

222
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:29,940
Now,

223
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,460
it's much easier to

224
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,660
rebuild it with his ashes.

225
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
Congratulations, Your Highness.

226
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,900
We've already

227
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,380
controlled Princess Chizu.

228
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,700
The whole Chizu

229
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,380
is your treasure.

230
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,740
You can start the army when you see it.

231
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,780
The West Emperor

232
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,100
is your country.

233
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,900
He's begging for money.

234
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,620
He's so ungrateful.

235
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,860
He's been trusting and trusting

236
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,300
the West Emperor.

237
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,720
They're so

238
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,060
rebellious.

239
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,140
Although we're in a hurry to find the Emperor,

240
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,220
if I don't care about the rebellion,

241
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,940
the West Emperor will be destroyed.

242
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,540
I don't know how many innocent people will die.

243
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,780
They even want to make me a puppet.

244
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,740
It's a vicious plan.

245
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,700
Don't worry.

246
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,100
I won't let this happen.

247
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,540
No.

248
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,700
Why is this puppet so calm?

249
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,060
It just died.

250
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,300
Why is it so calm even when it's being bullied?

251
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,460
You mean...

252
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,220
This puppet is fake.

253
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,820
The princess is still alive.

254
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,860
Fake?

255
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,380
I'm the real Princess Chizu.

256
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,260
They...

257
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,620
Master.

258
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,460
That puppet is a fake.

259
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,700
You can't fool us.

260
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,540
Two princesses.

261
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,020
Which one do you want?

262
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,620
I can't keep the real one.

263
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:26,900
Master.

264
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,300
I knew you wouldn't abandon me.

265
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,660
I told you

266
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,340
you wouldn't become a puppet.

267
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,020
How often have I try it?

268
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,380
Once in a ten-ixel period of time,

269
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,060
you will die.

270
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,500
Once I'm dead,

271
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,380
you'll be the dead of your final days.

272
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,740
Be serious instead.

273
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,740
Save me the moment we meet in rookery.

274
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,460
Don't creator a habit of

275
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,260
having un armyiors İşteem.

276
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:52,660
I'll die soon.

277
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
In that case,

278
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,660
I honor you as my teacher.

279
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,820
Are you the one who killed Jiuyi God?

280
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,300
Yes.

281
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,020
You've been cultivating evil arts

282
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,460
and using the spirit as a sacrifice.

283
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,020
You're a sin.

284
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,300
You deserve to die.

285
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,100
You're just a god.

286
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,180
People outside the house can only do the magic.

287
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,380
But they can't do the household affairs of our Huotu Tribe.

288
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,980
They can't do the child marriage

289
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,620
of Qingli, the one who forgot to get married.

290
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,940
Today,

291
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,420
we can't let them

292
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,220
leave Su Saha Lu.

293
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,020
Don't stop them.

294
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,300
Mother.

295
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,260
What happened?

296
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,460
Your Highness.

297
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,260
Is this a rescue?

298
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,620
Your wife who didn't get married colluded with outsiders

299
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,220
and tried to kill us.

300
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,140
Jiuyi God and Chizi God

301
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,380
want to use this wedding to kill us.

302
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,860
This is their conspiracy.

303
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,620
The evil people are the first to report.

304
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,940
It's you who want to train me into a puppet

305
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,260
and control the West.

306
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,700
The Huotu Tribe has lost many people

307
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,620
for the cultivation of evil arts.

308
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,060
Don't you feel anything?

309
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,820
Everyone,

310
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,100
attack!

311
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,020
Master.

312
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,140
We didn't die together in the Abyss of Cangwu.

313
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,620
Today,

314
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,580
I'm afraid we'll die together in the desert.

315
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,220
Lan Shang.

316
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,620
You won't become a puppet,

317
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,100
and you won't die.

318
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,540
You have to trust me.

319
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,060
Attack!

320
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,460
Master's power

321
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,060
has been increased so much.

322
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,060
How is that possible?

323
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,060
He can control thousands of people

324
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,820
with one finger.

325
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,740
Isn't he

326
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,980
able to defeat thousands of people with one finger?

327
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,500
That's impossible.

328
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,020
Impossible.

329
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,660
Great Shaman.

330
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,860
Great Shaman.

331
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,180
Great Shaman.

332
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,020
Stop!

333
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,140
Great Shaman of Suda.

334
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,900
Do you admit your crime?

335
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,380
Princesses.

336
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,140
Which one do you want to keep?

337
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,660
I can't keep the real one.

338
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,300
You tried to kill the Princess of Chizu.

339
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,540
You tried to rebel and destroy the West.

340
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,940
You have many evidence.

341
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,100
Do you admit your crime?

342
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,220
So, all of this

343
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,020
was your plan.

344
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,220
Master left

345
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,820
to let Great Consort relax her vigilance

346
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,420
and get the words of rebellion she said.

347
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,500
Okay.

348
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,980
I admit my crime.

349
00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:11,120
Great Shaman of Ju

350
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:11,740
Master.

351
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,060
Are you all right?

352
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,500
Is anyone injured?

353
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,180
King of Kailhk.

354
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,340
Now

355
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,820
you should know the key cause and consequence of this incident.

356
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,940
Your mother

357
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,940
colluding with the demons to rebel.

358
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,300
And I'm afraid your father

359
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,900
died

360
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,940
under the spell of the Great Wus.

361
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,980
You and the soldiers here

362
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,580
are real warriors.

363
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,900
Are you going to rebel

364
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,180
with him?

365
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,540
In Kong San's laws,

366
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,060
he's always the first to commit evil

367
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,340
and follow the net.

368
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,180
If you really think for your people,

369
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,900
you'll be in trouble.

370
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
Since it happened,

371
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,860
it's all my fault.

372
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,180
As the King of the Wanderer Tribe,

373
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,300
I'm willing to take all the responsibility

374
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,900
and ask you not to involve the whole clan.

375
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,180
As long as you don't rebel,

376
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,700
I'll ask His Majesty

377
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,900
not to involve the innocent.

378
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,340
Ke'er,

379
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,940
thank you.

380
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,220
Mu Jian,

381
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,380
for the sake of the whole clan,

382
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,980
you must live on.

383
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,020
Ke'er!

384
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,500
Ke'er!

385
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,500
My son!

386
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,460
My son!

387
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,780
My son!

388
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,060
My son!

389
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,260
Ke'er!

390
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,100
Xiang Ying!

391
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,100
Yan!

392
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,580
How did I find out

393
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,300
the skills of Gu Wei City

394
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,500
and even fought with them?

395
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,260
Look,

396
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,220
I was away for a while,

397
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,220
and you guys are like this.

398
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,380
Yan,

399
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,220
it's been a long time since we last met.

400
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,380
Why are you so sad?

401
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,300
Did Xiao Yingzi

402
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,180
disturb your wedding

403
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,220
and make you unhappy?

404
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,900
The plan of the Su-Da Princess

405
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,300
is for Ke'er.

406
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,060
And Ke'er is also

407
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,140
self-abandoned because of her.

408
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
I think she's

409
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,100
also a man of great talent now.

410
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,220
Don't think about her.

411
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,380
Chong Ming,

412
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,100
take her away from the tent.

413
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,500
Ask her seriously.

414
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,500
You'll find out

415
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,700
where Gu Wei City is.

416
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,020
Take her back.

417
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,140
Master,

418
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,940
why didn't you save her just now?

419
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,820
Ke'er wanted to use her own blood

420
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,060
to clear the name of Huotu Tribe.

421
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,580
So that's all for now.

422
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,020
I'll just hand the Princess

423
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,460
to the envoy of Jialan

424
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,940
and take her back for trial.

425
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,700
I won't involve more people.

426
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,940
You could have saved her just now.

427
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,380
Why didn't you save her?

428
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,220
I...

429
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,660
I saved her

430
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,380
because I didn't have time.

431
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:17,980
No.

432
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,540
You have time.

433
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,820
When Su Da and Da Fei

434
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,060
stab me,

435
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,420
you have time.

436
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,460
Ying,

437
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,780
you're stronger than you think.

438
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,460
Remember,

439
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,500
as long as you're willing,

440
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,380
you'll have time forever.

441
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,020
You'll be able to do it forever.

442
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,060
Let's go.

443
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,460
She's still unmarried

444
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,940
and got caught again.

445
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,060
My Lady!

446
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,780
My Lady, you're back!

447
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,660
I'm glad you're safe.

448
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,900
It's such a big deal.

449
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,500
I was so scared that I only dared to hide.

450
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,020
I'm sorry.

451
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,340
I didn't mean to hurt you.

452
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,100
I'm sorry.

453
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,060
I'm sorry.

454
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,900
I'm sorry.

455
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,220
Who is this?

456
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,900
This is my master.

457
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,740
Young Minister!

458
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,980
Why are you here?

459
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,820
My Lady,

460
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,100
I told you

461
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,540
that Young Minister has you in his heart.

462
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:38,780
Yu Fei,

463
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,140
go and explain to the people of the Songqing Team.

464
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,140
I'm fine.

465
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,380
Don't worry.

466
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,260
I have something important to do.

467
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,900
I'll leave in a while.

468
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,420
I've sent a letter to your father

469
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,300
to take you back as soon as possible.

470
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,020
So, Master didn't come to Huotu部

471
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,300
for me.

472
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,180
He just happened to meet me

473
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,940
and we met.

474
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,140
Yes.

475
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,380
MasterSOUND

476
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,580
was so strange and courageous.

477
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,100
Besides,

478
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,060
he was just taking my son back.

479
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,300
There must be a reason

480
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,700
why he took you back.

481
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,380
But someone else

482
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,820
conducted the meeting instead of us.

483
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,780
Young Master is really busy.

484
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,140
Jinghong is going to leave them all bad.

485
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,660
I won't tell your father

486
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,420
about your running away from marriage,

487
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
and make a hole in the hole.

488
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,820
Stretch out your hand.

489
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,100
Master,

490
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,820
are you going to hit me?

491
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
In Mount Jiuyi,

492
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,900
I only teach you magic.

493
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,060
I never use rules to control you.

494
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,540
Since you're in the red dust,

495
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,420
I'll teach you

496
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,700
the rules of the royal clan.

497
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,620
Master, teach me.

498
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,420
Aren't you busy?

499
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,940
Why are you teaching me now?

500
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,820
Don't come over.

501
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,660
If you come over again,

502
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,420
I'll do anything to get you out.

503
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,980
What do you want?

504
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,100
I'm not a kid anymore.

505
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,860
I'm an adult now.

506
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,380
I've already lost my husband.

507
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,700
If you dare to hit me again,

508
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,300
I'll call the police.

509
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,780
There are so many people out there.

510
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,340
I'll call them all.

511
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,100
You dare to hit me in public.

512
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,060
Let go of me.

513
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:45,860
Or...

514
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,540
Or I'll call the police.

515
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,780
If you dare to hit me,

516
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,500
I'll...

517
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,140
You really hit me?

518
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,060
Hit me.

519
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,940
Hit me again.

520
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,780
I hit you

521
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,300
to remind you

522
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,100
that as the princess of the Red Clan,

523
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,620
you can't use your own

524
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,500
and the lives of your clan to take risks.

525
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,500
The marriage certificate

526
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,300
is just what I want.

527
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,540
It's not an order.

528
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,340
You can control

529
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,460
your own wishes.

530
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,380
Whether it's Qinggang

531
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,620
or Kerk,

532
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,060
you can marry whoever you want.

533
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,460
If you don't want to marry,

534
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,660
you can convince the King of Chihuahua and the Princess Consort.

535
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,780
If you marry and find out

536
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,220
that they are plotting against you,

537
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,700
you can send someone to tell your father

538
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,980
that you didn't use the marriage certificate.

539
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:42,980
What?

540
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,260
You don't agree?

541
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,660
What Master said is right.

542
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,780
But Master only knows how to reason.

543
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,620
He doesn't understand my difficulties.

544
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,500
If I don't marry,

545
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,060
the Princess Consort will use this to threaten my father.

546
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,740
I can only marry.

547
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,100
But I'm not willing to

548
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,020
and that's why I decided to use the marriage certificate.

549
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,140
I thought

550
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,060
after you left Mount Jiuyi,

551
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,420
the Qing clan wouldn't make things difficult for you

552
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,620
and your clan.

553
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,180
The Princess Consort made things difficult for us

554
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,500
not because of Master.

555
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,180
My father said

556
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,860
it's because my father didn't want to give up on the marriage.

557
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,660
That's why the Princess Consort

558
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,580
used this to force him.

559
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,780
You can tell me about the Princess Consort's revenge

560
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,540
by writing a letter.

561
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,980
Although I'm not in the palace,

562
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,420
if I want to enter the family,

563
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,620
I can do it.

564
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,300
I can't let you go.

565
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,500
I can't let you go.

566
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,420
It's not difficult for you

567
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,620
to get along with the Princess Consort

568
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,300
in the imperial city.

569
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,740
So,

570
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,220
you care about me,

571
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,740
right?

572
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,540
But you didn't tell me anything.

573
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,620
You didn't tell me your thoughts,

574
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,900
your plans,

575
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,940
your everything.

576
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,540
You treated me like an outsider.

577
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,500
I'm not your pet.

578
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,020
How could I guess it?

579
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,740
I know it in my heart.

580
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,420
I won't dream of going back to the Nine-Wearing Mountain.

581
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,300
Master doesn't have to remember the marriage plan.

582
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,060
He doesn't have to worry about me.

583
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,420
Actually,

584
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,300
it's all my fault for being rude

585
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,780
and not enough to protect my family.

586
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,500
If I had a strategy and ability like Master,

587
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,660
I wouldn't have been controlled by others.

588
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,380
It's a good thing if you think so.

589
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,820
You can only stay away from the Nine-Wearing Mountain and me

590
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,460
when you're in danger.

591
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,100
I hope this is the last time

592
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,420
you're involved because of me.

593
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,420
Master, why are you trapped again?

594
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,500
General Jiang Chen of the Kongji Camp

595
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,540
will temporarily take over the Huotu Tribe.

596
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,060
The rest

597
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,700
will wait for your father to come

598
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,860
and take over the Mountain.

599
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,980
Don't you want to have

600
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,660
the same ability as me?

601
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,740
Then, you should practice your magic here.

602
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,980
If you want to go out and kill him,

603
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,820
you can break my enchantment.

604
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,940
No one can stop you then.

605
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,540
Master.

606
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,060
What's wrong?

607
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,100
Master,

608
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,580
we're going to break up

609
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,300
so quickly.

610
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,140
I don't want to leave you.

611
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,860
Why don't you

612
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,780
take me with you?

613
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,260
I'll follow you

614
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,700
wherever you are.

615
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,620
You're just using you to protect me

616
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,740
and you want to escape

617
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,980
with this kind of tricks.

618
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,580
Instead of playing with this kind of tricks,

619
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,700
why don't you practice your magic

620
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,380
and get rid of your troubles?

621
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,740
Magic is so amazing!

622
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,660
I didn't say anything.

623
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,740
Master really ismashing me as an outcast

624
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,820
and refusing to teach me that being twists and turns can help me.

625
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,340
What's the problem then?

626
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,540
The technical level is so good.

627
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,820
There's nothing wrong about that.

628
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,340
You!

629
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,100
Come here to hell!

630
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,460
It seems like

631
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,420
the male teacher was trying to

632
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,060
interrupt you in the honour visit.

633
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,620
I...

634
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,300
When Her Grace was in trouble,

635
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,740
Young Master Si Ming came.

636
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,820
I think

637
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,500
they were in Mount Jiuyi

638
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,420
and were in love.

639
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,620
Isn't that right?

640
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,540
Have you talked to Zhu Yan?

641
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,500
What did you talk about?

642
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,940
Nothing.

643
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,820
After going down the mountain,

644
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,860
Zhu Yan was a criminal,

645
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,060
but she was mature.

646
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,860
Listen to your master's words.

647
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,780
Master is right.

648
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,620
But he only knows how to reason.

649
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,460
He doesn't understand my difficulties.

650
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,300
If I don't marry,

651
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,860
Consort Qing will use this to threaten my father.

652
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,460
I can only marry.

653
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,860
But I'm not willing to.

654
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,900
That's why I ran away from the wedding.

655
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,340
I was just her master.

656
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,500
Did you get any information

657
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,100
from Her Grace?

658
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,820
Her Grace committed suicide.

659
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,580
But before she died,

660
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,300
she told me where Guwei City was.

661
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,100
It's outside the Tianqian Pass.

662
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,540
There are many people imprisoned there.

663
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,220
There might be clues about the ghost.

664
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,180
It's not too late.

665
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,540
Let's go.

666
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,780
What are you doing here?

667
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,260
I've made up my mind

668
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,020
to calm the rebels of Huotu Tribe.

669
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,620
But Huotu Tribe is on the land of the Chis.

670
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,540
I'm afraid it will cause trouble for the Chis.

671
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,820
I asked the bird to

672
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,620
send the evidence of Consort Qing's rebellion

673
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,220
back to Tianji Peak.

674
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,740
Mount Jiuyi is an outskirts of the wind.

675
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,820
We shouldn't have been

676
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,140
involved in the rebellion.

677
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,340
It's better to give the credit

678
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,380
to the Chis.

679
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,380
You're outskirts of the wind,

680
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,840
but you're good at planning and

681
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,940
have the talent to do things.

682
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,260
In my opinion,

683
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,700
if you take off your robe and return to Jialan,

684
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,560
you can then

685
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,540
pacify the world and marry...

686
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,460
Aren't all these problems solved?

687
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,500
Second.

688
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,220
What?

689
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,740
You're being too much.

690
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,980
You once told me

691
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,580
in the God Hall that

692
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,940
if we can't solve the problem,

693
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,740
we won't see each other again

694
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,100
if we have to do it for the third time.

695
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,500
Don't be so serious, Shiyi.

696
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,900
I'm just kidding.

697
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,980
Then wait till I'm done.

698
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,660
Be gentle.

699
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,060
Young Commander is so cruel.

700
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,980
He's even blushing.

701
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,220
Nonsense.

702
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,180
With your skills,

703
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,100
if you want me to lose my soul,

704
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,980
it's just a matter of seconds.

705
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,780
If he's really cruel,

706
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,220
how can I only get hurt?

707
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,220
You're really protecting Young Commander.

708
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,220
No wonder...

709
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,460
No wonder...

710
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,060
Everyone said that you two...

711
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,140
This...

712
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,100
Nonsense!

713
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,300
Give me the order.

714
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,580
If anyone

715
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,380
tells my master Qingyun's words again,

716
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,540
I'll be killed immediately.

717
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,700
I'm the Princess of West Desert after all.

718
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,220
I can still do this.

719
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,580
Yes.

720
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,420
I'll go and tell him now.

721
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,180
It's all my fault.

722
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,500
I was rude.

723
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,060
I've got you into trouble.

724
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,700
As expected.

725
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,820
Master designed this barrier for me.

726
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,740
He only stopped me.

727
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,340
Boundary?

728
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,100
Oh no.

729
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,380
How did I forget Yuji and Mu Zi?

730
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:47,100
Your Hoof Air

731
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,500
The feelings can be broken into pieces

732
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:00,500
You and I just walk face to face

733
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,500
You walk on the bottom of the mountain

734
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:10,500
The wind is willing to be my soul

735
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,500
I walk on the path of my feet

736
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:20,500
I'm not by your side

737
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,500
The bottom of your heart

738
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,500
The wind is willing to be my soul

739
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,500
The feelings can be broken into pieces

740
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:40,500
You and I just walk face to face

741
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,500
How could we meet

742
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:51,500
How could we meet again
