1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

2
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,200
I want to be with you

3
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,720
Please give me a life of shining beauty

4
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,400
I want to be with you

5
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
I want to be with you

6
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,520
But I want to be with you

7
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,600
I want to be with you

8
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,280
I want to be with you

9
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,960
In the sea of love

10
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,560
I want to be with you

11
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,560
In my heart

12
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,260
~~

13
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,240
Stop.

14
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,080
If you keep going,

15
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,480
you'll die.

16
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,440
Then,

17
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,840
Master, take the medicine.

18
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,880
Here.

19
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,560
I don't need your feed.

20
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,680
Uncuff Zhou Yu.

21
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,280
With your power,

22
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,840
what if you meet

23
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,040
a large number of Haikuo Army?

24
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,960
I'm not afraid of Haikuo Army.

25
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,480
I'm just afraid that Master will run away.

26
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,560
So,

27
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,840
I'll let you

28
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,240
serve me.

29
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry for my bad words.

30
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,080
Stop.

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,800
I told you

32
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,200
if you keep going,

33
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:13,920
you'll...

34
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,400
I told you not to talk.

35
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,000
You...

36
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,640
It must be because the wind is too strong.

37
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,720
Don't be angry.

38
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Master, look.

39
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,480
He's interesting.

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,560
Instead of dying in the medicine,

41
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,360
why don't you die in clean clothes?

42
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,160
Stop.

43
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,200
Master,

44
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,680
you're really

45
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,120
dressed up.

46
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,480
So many clothes.

47
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,960
Aren't they hot?

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,360
As your master,

49
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,960
you should think carefully.

50
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,320
As your disciple,

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,840
you should also

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,040
think carefully.

53
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,120
Yes.

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,680
Come on.

55
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,000
Master.

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,000
You'd better take your medicine, Master.

57
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,880
What are you doing?

58
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,040
I'm visiting my relatives.

59
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,960
Let's go.

60
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,680
You!

61
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,600
What are you doing?

62
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,720
Xun Yi, please let me in.

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,240
There are wars everywhere.

64
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,440
My uncle will take care of them.

65
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,280
Get out.

66
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,760
Even beggars want to come to Xucheng.

67
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,360
Next one.

68
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,320
Please.

69
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,160
Master,

70
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,040
we're at the gate of Xucheng.

71
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,400
If you leave now,

72
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,960
we'll all be found.

73
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,080
So,

74
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,080
we'll do everything as I planned.

75
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,320
By then,

76
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,400
we'll be a pair of Chizu couple.

77
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,000
You don't have to say a word later.

78
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,400
Just listen to me.

79
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,200
Thank you.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,800
Listen.

81
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,080
Stop.

82
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,080
Where are you from?

83
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,200
What are you doing in the capital?

84
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,560
Master,

85
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,040
my husband and I are all Chizu people.

86
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,320
We're all Chizu people.

87
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,480
My husband was badly injured

88
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,000
on the way to the mountain.

89
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,200
I want to take him to the capital to see a doctor.

90
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,680
This is our driver.

91
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,720
Where is he?

92
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,280
Get him off the carriage.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,720
His cold is very serious.

94
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,240
It's not convenient to get off the carriage.

95
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,760
If you get off the carriage,

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,720
you can't get into the capital by horse-drawn carriage.

97
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,040
But...

98
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,000
No buts.

99
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,160
Get off the carriage now.

100
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,320
My dear.

101
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,520
My dear.

102
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,560
repaired motorbike

103
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,320
My dear,

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm all right.

105
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,760
Now let's

106
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,520
hurry to the city to find a doctor.

107
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,920
an old man

108
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,160
please see me off.

109
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,040
Please don't let me

110
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,040
Let's go.

112
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,720
My husband.

113
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,400
Let's go.

114
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,000
Thank you.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,560
Let's go.

116
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,320
Thank you.

117
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,880
Let's go.

118
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,120
Be careful.

119
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,760
Next one.

120
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,720
Don't turn around.

121
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
The ghost is suspicious.

122
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,640
What about Chuang Ming?

123
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,040
He's a bird.

124
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,240
He'll fly in at night.

125
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,160
He's a bird.

126
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,040
He's a bird.

127
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,240
He'll fly in at night.

128
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,280
This is the plan

129
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,240
you mentioned.

130
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,520
It's the plan to kill the ghost.

131
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,840
Who knew my master

132
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,720
was so capable?

133
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,400
He's wearing the clothes of our Chi Clan.

134
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,720
He looks good.

135
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,880
I've entered the city.

136
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,120
I can find the doctor.

137
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,480
You don't have to risk your life for me.

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,760
Let's split into two teams.

139
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,600
You...

140
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,600
I've told you

141
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,560
that my plan is perfect.

142
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,400
How can I let you go so easily?

143
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,200
Since you're wearing the clothes of our Chi Clan,

144
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,840
you should follow the rules of the Chi Clan.

145
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,640
In our Chi Clan,

146
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,920
you should listen to your wife.

147
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,880
I've asked Chuang Ming

148
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,280
about the hospital of Xu Shen Yi.

149
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,440
Come with me, my husband.

150
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,760
My husband.

151
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,680
What's wrong?

152
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,760
Are you embarrassed?

153
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,080
Remember to take the medicine on time.

154
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,640
Have a good rest.

155
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,320
Okay.

156
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,440
Master, we're here.

157
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,360
It's okay. Take care.

158
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,880
Are you here to see a doctor?

159
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,240
Brother,

160
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,000
we're here from the outside

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,640
to see a doctor.

162
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,000
It's so chaotic outside.

163
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,000
It's not easy for you two

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,080
to come here.

165
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
Please wait a moment.

166
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,880
Dr. Xu is looking for other patients.

167
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,640
It'll be done soon.

168
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,080
Please take a rest here.

169
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,320
Brother.

170
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,760
Wait.

171
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,520
Can you

172
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,360
prepare some food for us?

173
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,120
It's chaotic outside.

174
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
My husband and I

175
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,360
haven't eaten anything

176
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,120
in the past day.

177
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,320
I can see that

178
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,200
you two are really kind.

179
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,120
Okay.

180
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,320
I'll go to the kitchen

181
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,240
to check what's in there.

182
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,120
Please sit down.

183
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,480
Master,

184
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,280
please eat something.

185
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,400
I haven't had the energy

186
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,440
to be angry with my disciple.

187
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,160
You should eat something

188
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,680
to be able to keep angry.

189
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,040
I'm hungry.

190
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,240
I can't let him get hurt.

191
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,960
Aww.

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,960
Are you going to feed it to me?

193
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,280
Let me beglated theHYUNESTU's hunger.

194
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,080
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,280
Master,

196
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,320
I know

197
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,080
you rejected me

198
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
because you blamed me for being too risky.

199
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,080
You were in Mount Jiuyi

200
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,080
and I suffered from a severe injury.

201
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,760
I've always felt guilty towards you.

202
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,800
I didn't want to be a bad person

203
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,720
and feel guilty towards you.

204
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,720
Look at you.

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,840
You're here again.

206
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,960
You had to push me away

207
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,280
and you're happy now.

208
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,680
Have you forgotten

209
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,200
what you said to me

210
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,760
when we first met?

211
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,320
If you can practice magic,

212
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,800
you'll be able to do it one day.

213
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,480
This Snow-Cold Thread is the evidence I gave you.

214
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,720
You can take it to your father.

215
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,320
Can I take it to my daughter?

216
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,120
It's not up to the gender

217
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,560
to decide who protects the country.

218
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,080
Since you believe me,

219
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,320
you're not a girl of low class.

220
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,440
Don't look at me with a weak eye.

221
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,760
You don't owe me anything.

222
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,120
I'm doing this

223
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,120
to protect my original intention.

224
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,240
We learned magic

225
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,440
and saw others being in danger.

226
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,960
How can we ignore it?

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,600
Master told me this.

228
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,360
When did I say that?

229
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,960
On the fourth day I entered your house,

230
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,920
you ignored your own safety

231
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,440
and went to the Nine-Yi Army to treat the villagers.

232
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,960
Although you didn't say it,

233
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,920
you taught me the truth.

234
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,640
You didn't care about the difficulties and broke your original intention.

235
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,880
Untie the magic

236
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,160
and eat well.

237
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,800
I won't leave

238
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,440
until I get here.

239
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,640
Go.

240
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,340
Will you diapers?

241
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,220
No, thanks.

242
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,400
No problem.

243
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,680
I wonder if I can get some sleep for a bit.

244
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,900
No, thanks.

245
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:38,740
Then,

246
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,300
how is your exus器?

247
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,020
I have already broken up with him.

248
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,700
How is it?

249
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,420
You're from Mount Jiuyi.

250
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,500
How do you know?

251
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,020
This priest

252
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,540
is surrounded by

253
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,700
the lightness of the nine-divine Tao.

254
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,420
Only his left shoulder

255
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,460
is dark.

256
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,380
He must have been attacked by evil spirits.

257
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,820
More than 60 years ago,

258
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,620
I lived in Mount Jiuyi

259
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,940
to practice medicine.

260
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,940
There are countless magical herbs and magical bees.

261
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,060
The Cangjing Hall is the most popular place

262
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,340
for all the doctors in the world

263
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
to practice medicine.

264
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,660
As Chong Ming said,

265
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,580
you can cure my master.

266
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,980
Unwrap your clothes.

267
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,180
Let me see.

268
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,300
Fortunately, you arrived today.

269
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,380
If you come back late,

270
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,620
the evil spirit will enter the bone marrow with the meridians.

271
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,380
It will be too late to eat.

272
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,380
Doctor,

273
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,260
are you trying to use a knife?

274
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,660
Please wait outside.

275
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,380
Please give my master more herbs and magical herbs.

276
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,580
He was skilled in magic.

277
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,300
He has never been badly injured.

278
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,900
He will be afraid of pain.

279
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,540
Don't worry, miss.

280
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,700
Doctor,

281
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,060
please use the knife.

282
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,220
Yes.

283
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,220
This girl is so nice to you.

284
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,340
When I was practicing medicine in Mount Jiuyi,

285
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,060
I once met a god.

286
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,620
He was only a few years older than you.

287
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,580
He lived in the private space.

288
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,220
Everyone thought he could go one level higher.

289
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,780
But he insisted on going to the hell

290
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,380
and return to the mortal world

291
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,100
for a girl.

292
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,300
To the hell?

293
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,580
Yes.

294
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,300
I asked him the night before the ceremony.

295
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,620
For a girl,

296
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,300
you risked your life.

297
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,740
Even if you succeed,

298
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,420
you will spend your life's cultivation.

299
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,780
Is it worth it?

300
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,220
He said,

301
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,340
the hell is in the mountain.

302
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,060
What happened to him?

303
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,460
For hundreds of years,

304
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,340
no one has ever been through the hell.

305
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,900
He was like that.

306
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,140
After he was in the trial,

307
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,820
he died under the thunder.

308
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,740
He was just a dead body.

309
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,220
I witnessed his miserable state.

310
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,140
After the practice, he returned to the mortal world.

311
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,060
He was a man of love.

312
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,220
He was a man of love.

313
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,460
Since you are a man of love,

314
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,260
you shouldn't hide your love in the mortal world.

315
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,500
Bear with it.

316
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,140
THE bOND

317
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,700
I need to tell you an important thing.

318
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,540
Although it was virgin,

319
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,340
its blood remains.

320
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,300
It will be entendred in three days.

321
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,700
you can't use any power.

322
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,860
If you force yourself to use the power,

323
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,020
you will only reflect on yourself.

324
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,580
If you want to recover as soon as possible,

325
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,460
you can only use the true source of your body

326
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,140
to drive out evil spirits.

327
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,820
The true source is the one who practices the Tao.

328
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,340
It's the opportunity for everything.

329
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,180
I hope you won't make any trouble.

330
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,700
Thank you, God.

331
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,020
I'm sorry.

332
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,460
How is Yong?

333
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,340
Chong Ming.

334
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,140
Don't worry. He's recovering.

335
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,700
Now that you're here,

336
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,980
I can leave with no worries.

337
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,020
Where are you going?

338
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,300
To the clothing shop.

339
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,380
Yan, thank you.

340
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,940
Aren't you going to say goodbye to him?

341
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,620
No.

342
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,180
Let him recover with no worries.

343
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,660
He's a stubborn man.

344
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,180
Don't take it to heart.

345
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,460
I know.

346
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,780
My master always does it for my own good.

347
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,460
But the one who practices the Tao is not a good person.

348
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,060
As a commoner,

349
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,580
I won't bother him.

350
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,060
Goodbye.

351
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,060
Yan, it's not like that.

352
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,180
Actually, your master treats you...

353
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,980
Three!

354
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,300
What three?

355
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,900
Master.

356
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,940
The doctor has taken out the clothes.

357
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,660
I'll rest here for a few hours.

358
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,780
I'll be fine.

359
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,260
You can leave now.

360
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,580
Okay.

361
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,500
Rest in peace.

362
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,660
I'll leave now.

363
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,260
Yan. Yan.

364
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,940
Yan.

365
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,300
Why didn't you say thank you?

366
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,180
Why didn't you say it?

367
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,860
You're not as kind as this bird.

368
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,620
Yan, may I ask

369
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,860
if there's a food stall nearby?

370
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,740
Food stall?

371
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,740
Follow this path.

372
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,260
Turn left after passing the bridge.

373
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,220
You can see it.

374
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,980
Thank you.

375
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,020
It's okay.

376
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,860
I knew

377
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,620
Father would send me here.

378
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,100
I knew it.

379
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,300
And I knew my daughter.

380
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,860
When Young Minister ordered

381
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,540
to pacify the chaos in the Land of War,

382
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,220
Father could still do it.

383
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,900
Now he's sending a message

384
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,340
to the city of Xia.

385
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,180
Father must have an idea.

386
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,860
He's here to find

387
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,820
the daughter who has been in contact with

388
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,340
Mount Jiuyi.

389
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,060
It's my fault.

390
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,580
You've been confined

391
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,420
since you came back from Mount Jiuyi.

392
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,940
Now it seems

393
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,140
you're more well-prepared than Father.

394
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,700
What do you think

395
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,340
about it?

396
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,540
To be honest,

397
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,380
if Father

398
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,300
is punished by His Majesty

399
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,420
for his anger,

400
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,300
what should he do?

401
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,220
Most people

402
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,740
will only talk about

403
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,340
the past, right?

404
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,100
But people like Shao Siming

405
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,380
who's been hiding things

406
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,660
and re-establishing the order

407
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,220
can't find the other person.

408
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,140
He's a loyal man

409
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,580
who's devoted to the country.

410
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,500
But now it's like this.

411
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,420
Why is Father still hesitating?

412
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,500
If he's punished by his sister,

413
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,580
he'll be punished by his father.

414
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,660
What you said

415
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,340
is reasonable.

416
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,980
But we still need to wait and see.

417
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,340
Shao Siming

418
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,100
is a dead man after all.

419
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,020
And he's also guilty of deceiving His Majesty.

420
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,380
I don't want to lie to you.

421
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,140
The letter of the letter of credit

422
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,660
written by Zhu Gao to Shao Siming

423
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,580
has been sent to the Imperial Academy.

424
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,820
We'll see how His Majesty will react

425
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,980
in a few days.

426
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,420
Whether His Majesty will be deceived

427
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,500
depends on who His Majesty

428
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,660
listens to at this time.

429
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,860
Father,

430
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,020
wealth is always important.

431
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,820
Since Meng Hua's dynasty was established,

432
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,140
the Bai clan has always been superior.

433
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,220
They never valued the Qing clan.

434
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,940
You don't want to see

435
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,860
the rich and rich situation

436
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,780
be ruined by yourself, do you?

437
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,820
Mother,

438
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,140
I'll soon be able to

439
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,660
take your place in the Bai clan.

440
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,500
You're the one who's wise.

441
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,060
Last time,

442
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,900
I was used by you.

443
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,620
I was deceived so badly.

444
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,380
Last time,

445
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,300
I didn't ask for anything from you.

446
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,620
How could I help you?

447
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,620
Don't you know

448
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,020
that the one who's most reassuring

449
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,900
is the one who's the most powerful?

450
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,620
You're the one who's the most powerful.

451
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,100
You're the one who's the most powerful.

452
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,500
You're the one who's the most powerful.

453
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,660
I asked you to come here

454
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,820
to make a deal with you.

455
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,340
A deal?

456
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,700
I've been worried about Shi Yu

457
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,260
for many years

458
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,060
but Shi Ying took the credit.

459
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,260
I can't break Shi Ying into pieces.

460
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,540
If you can help me kill Shi Ying,

461
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,620
you can open your mouth

462
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,180
to whatever conditions you want.

463
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,740
Don't worry about it.

464
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
If you kill Shi Ying

465
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,820
with all your might,

466
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,140
the whole world will know

467
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,220
that you killed

468
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,340
the late prince

469
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,780
who was still alive

470
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,140
and had made a great contribution.

471
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,260
Then,

472
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,940
can Shi Yu's position

473
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,700
be kept?

474
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,780
It's a good chance.

475
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,540
So you mean...

476
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,780
Only war

477
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,020
can give you a chance to make a contribution.

478
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,820
Instead of killing Shi Ying,

479
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
why don't you report to the court

480
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,540
and fight the Haiguo Army?

481
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,380
Let Qing Gang

482
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,940
lead the troops to the battlefield.

483
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,140
Impossible.

484
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,780
Let Shi Yu lead the troops?

485
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,700
It's too risky.

486
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,140
We'll send troops to help him

487
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,340
and help Shi Yu completely destroy the Haiguo Army.

488
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,820
When the enemy comes,

489
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,340
the people will be scared

490
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,460
and will be impressed.

491
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:25,940
Here.

492
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,220
Have a taste.

493
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,140
I made this

494
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,460
for you.

495
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,140
You're so well-prepared.

496
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,300
Xueluo,

497
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,700
you're really a blessing to the Bai family.

498
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,780
You're a typical husband.

499
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,900
It seems

500
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,980
you're going to change.

501
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,340
Father,

502
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,260
Consort Jin said

503
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,700
I was going to visit Shi Yu

504
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,300
and told her not to let me in.

505
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,700
But I didn't mean that.

506
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,140
Father,

507
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,500
can you tell Consort Jin

508
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:06,740
about this?

509
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,260
What's there to say?

510
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,260
You're just thinking about it.

511
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,460
Bai Miao.

512
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,260
Yes.

513
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,900
Send Princess Xueying back.

514
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,780
Father.

515
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,780
Princess, please.

516
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,060
Sister.

517
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,620
Xueluo,

518
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,780
if you have any wishes,

519
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,740
just tell me.

520
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,900
I'll help you.

521
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,660
Wishes?

522
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,340
Then please

523
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,020
send a bowl of salt to my sister.

524
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,660
She's done her best

525
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,700
for the Bai family.

526
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,180
Of course.

527
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,300
I'll send someone to send it.

528
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,740
But this time,

529
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,180
I recommended Feng Lin

530
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,940
to deal with the Sea King.

531
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,540
I have to keep an eye on him.

532
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,300
I won't send you off then.

533
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,140
Your Highness,

534
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,900
you've been thinking about

535
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,820
Her Ladyship for a long time.

536
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,020
Why didn't you

537
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,700
tell His Highness about it?

538
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,620
If I were to enter the Eastern Palace,

539
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,180
I would have fulfilled my wish.

540
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,100
I wouldn't have to

541
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,300
be in someone else's hands.

542
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,060
It's just that Xueying

543
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,420
is not as cruel as I am.

544
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,740
She's not as tough as I am.

545
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,580
If I were to be in her hands,

546
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,100
I would be more cruel.

547
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,100
I'm not that kind of person.

548
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,940
I'm not that kind of person.

549
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,860
There's a three-way road between us.

550
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,260
Isn't it a bad omen?

551
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,140
MeunYang.

552
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,040
MeunYang

553
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,380
Someone is hideicing the Tech Schw지.

554
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:31,980
hardened.

555
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,900
Arrest them.

556
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:48,280
head to the

557
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,300
well

558
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,680
to

559
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,840
Xie

560
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,460
to

561
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:11,740
head

562
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,740
Go.

563
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,740
Go.

564
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,740
Go.

565
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
Go.

566
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,740
Go.

567
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,740
Go.

568
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,740
Go.

569
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
Go.

570
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,740
Go.

571
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
Go.

572
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
Go.

573
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,740
Go.

574
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
If you dare to fight,

575
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,740
I'll kill them right away.

576
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,740
Go.

577
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,740
Go.

578
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,740
Go.

579
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
Go.

580
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,740
Go.

581
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,740
Go.

582
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,740
Go.

583
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,740
Go.

584
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,740
You want them to die here?

585
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,740
Don't panic.

586
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,740
The white cannon is Tulek.

587
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,740
It's the Jiuyi Mountain Shao Si Ming

588
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,740
who killed countless people.

589
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,740
Don't be afraid.

590
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,740
We have the hostage.

591
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,740
Tulek can't do anything to us.

592
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
Master, what are you doing?

593
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,740
It's less than an hour.

594
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,740
Master's power hasn't recovered yet.

595
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,740
He can't use magic.

596
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,740
And he made the hand-holding so slow.

597
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Master is using the eye-catching skill

598
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,740
to attract the attention of the people.

599
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,740
Let me learn his way

600
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,740
to use magic

601
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,740
and attack from the side.

602
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,740
The whole world is upside down.

603
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,740
I can't do anything.

604
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,740
The whole world is upside down.

605
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,740
Archers, get ready.

606
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,740
The cloud is moving.

607
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,740
Put down the sword.

608
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,740
The whole world is upside down.

609
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,740
The cloud is moving.

610
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,740
The whole world is upside down.

611
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,740
The cloud is moving.

612
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,740
The cloud is moving.

613
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,740
The cloud is moving.

614
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,740
The cloud is moving.

615
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,740
The cloud is moving.

616
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,740
The cloud is moving.

617
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,740
The cloud is moving.

618
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,740
The cloud is moving.

619
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,740
The cloud is moving.

620
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,740
The cloud is moving.

621
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,740
The cloud is moving.

622
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,740
The cloud is moving.

623
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,740
The cloud is moving.

624
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,740
The cloud is moving.

625
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
The cloud is moving.

626
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,740
The cloud is moving.

627
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,740
The cloud is moving.

628
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,740
The cloud is moving.

629
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
The cloud is moving.

630
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,740
The cloud is moving.

631
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,740
The cloud is moving.

632
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
The cloud is moving.

633
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,740
The cloud is moving.

634
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,740
The cloud is moving.

635
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
The cloud is moving.

636
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,740
The cloud is moving.

637
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
The cloud is moving.

638
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
The cloud is moving.

639
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
The cloud is moving.

640
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,740
The cloud is moving.

641
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
The cloud is moving.

642
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
The cloud is moving.

643
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,740
The cloud is moving.

644
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
The cloud is moving.

645
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,740
The cloud is moving.

646
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,740
唐立哥

647
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,740
I'll kill him

648
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,740
Come out!

649
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,140
Your leader is dead.

650
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,220
Are you still going to resist?

651
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
This...

652
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,220
Hurry up!

653
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,220
Hurry up!

654
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,220
Your Highness, come here!

655
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
Are you scared?

656
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,220
No.

657
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,220
Are you okay?

658
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
Are you okay?

659
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,220
Are you okay?

660
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,220
Are you okay?

661
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,220
Come here.

662
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,220
Master, how is your injury?

663
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,220
Master, what's your excuse

664
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,220
to draw a line with me again?

665
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,220
Do you want to owe me a favor?

666
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,220
Please.

667
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,220
The ghost blood is bright again.

668
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,220
Princess Xue Lu!

669
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
Please wait.

670
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,220
Princess Xue Lu,

671
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,220
how are you doing recently?

672
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,220
Everything has been unfair lately.

673
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
You must take care of yourself.

674
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,220
Of course.

675
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,220
The unfairness that General Qin mentioned

676
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,220
is a conflict between you and me?

677
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,220
You worked for Consort Qing before.

678
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,220
Now you can't get her protection.

679
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,220
Shao Siming won't do anything to you.

680
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,220
But Grand Minister

681
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,220
will not let you go.

682
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,220
You're wrong.

683
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,220
I not only got the trust of Grand Minister

684
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,220
and became the Crown Prince again.

685
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,220
The woman he wants to marry is me.

686
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,220
But Grand Minister has no intention to be a member of his clan.

687
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,220
He doesn't want to interfere with the Huotu Tribe.

688
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,220
Gu Wei is a man of great power.

689
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,220
It's not his own decision

690
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,220
to become the Tulong Ke

691
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,220
of the Jiao people in Gu Wei City.

692
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,220
He's just a hero.

693
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,220
He has the ability to dominate the world.

694
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,220
He can't be helped.

695
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,220
Please take a look at him.

696
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,220
You're still so obsessed with that back-up.

697
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,220
No matter who is in that position,

698
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,220
will you marry him?

699
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,220
Don't say such a big and ungrateful thing.

700
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,220
I've made up my mind.

701
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,220
I won't regret it.

702
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,220
Please take care of yourself.

703
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,220
General Qing is going to battle soon.

704
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,220
My brother is good at sword fighting.

705
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,220
If he fights with you,

706
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,220
he won't be able to win.

707
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,220
If he drinks to you,

708
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,220
you'd better not fight at all.

709
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
I wish you a happy life.

710
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,220
Don't drink too much.

711
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,220
Don't drink too much.

712
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,220
Don't worry.

713
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,220
Uncle.

714
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,220
Drink more.

715
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,220
Okay.

716
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,220
I'm going to rest now.

717
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
Go to rest.

718
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,220
Okay.

719
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,220
Master.

720
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,220
I have good news for you.

721
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,220
My father wrote to me that

722
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,220
the problem of Xia City has been solved.

723
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,220
The military supplies are being transported.

724
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,220
The military morale is greatly increased.

725
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,220
Since Lan Ying sent troops to support us,

726
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,220
the problem of Tian Ji Feng City has been solved.

727
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,220
Tell us not to worry anymore.

728
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,220
I happen to have something to share with you.

729
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,220
Please go ahead, Master.

730
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,220
I have medicine with me.

731
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,220
I need to leave the West Desert.

732
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,220
And you happen to be going back to Tian Ji Feng City.

733
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,220
We've already decided

734
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,220
that we'll be going back here together.

735
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,220
I'm afraid that we'll be separating here.

736
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,220
I won't come

737
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,220
if you want to leave.

738
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,220
But is your injury

739
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,220
really healed?

740
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,220
Of course.

741
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,220
Really?

742
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,220
The activity is very hard.

743
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,220
Where are you going?

744
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,220
I'm going to follow a star cloud.

745
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,220
But I can't see its whereabouts.

746
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,220
I'm going to the top of the mountain

747
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,220
to watch the stars.

748
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,220
If Master's power is really restored,

749
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,220
I'll be able to see the stars.

750
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,220
I'm going to go to the top of the mountain

751
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,220
if my power is really restored.

752
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,220
But it's hard to say

753
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,220
that Master is just taking a walk.

754
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,220
No, I have to try.

755
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,220
Are you okay?

756
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,220
It hurts.

757
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,220
You didn't hurt your golden bone.

758
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,220
You should rest for a while.

759
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,220
How about this?

760
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,220
Wait for me here.

761
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,220
I'll be back in a while.

762
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,220
Master, even if your power is restored,

763
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,220
it's just a little bit.

764
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,220
I'm worried that you'll leave by yourself.

765
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,220
I'll carry you up the mountain.

766
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,220
I'm not dreaming, am I?

767
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
Hurry up.

768
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,220
Otherwise, you'll fall.

769
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,220
Master.

770
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,220
Master.

771
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,220
Master.

772
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,220
Master.

773
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,220
Master.

774
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,220
Master.

775
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,220
Master.

776
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,220
Master.

777
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,220
Master.

778
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,220
Master.

779
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,220
Master.

780
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,220
Master.

781
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,220
Master.

782
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,220
Master.

783
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,220
Master.

784
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,220
Master.

785
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,220
Master.

786
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,220
Master.

787
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,220
Master.

788
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,220
Master.

789
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,220
Master.

790
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,220
Master.

791
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,220
Master.

792
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,220
Master.

793
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,220
Master.

794
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Master.

795
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,220
Master.

796
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,220
Master.

797
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,220
Master.

798
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,220
Master.

799
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,220
Yin.

800
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,220
You used the skill of the hard-to-get.

801
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,140
Can I heal you

802
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,140
with my magic power?

803
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,460
Look at your feet.

804
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,300
Master,

805
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,820
did you make all these?

806
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,500
This is amazing.

807
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,420
You're so silly.

808
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,700
If I didn't really bend my feet,

809
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
I would have been afraid that Master

810
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,380
would expose me.

811
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,820
Master,

812
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,700
you really recovered?

813
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,260
Yes.

814
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,460
If you recovered,

815
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,540
you won't blame me.

816
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,420
Of course I will blame you.

817
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,580
So I won't give you any treatment.

818
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,660
I'll make you hurt for a while.

819
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,140
It's really beautiful.

820
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,780
Master, look over there.

821
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,740
It's amazing.

822
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,100
It's so beautiful.

823
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,060
Master, look.

824
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,940
She's great.

825
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,820
Thank God I'm here.

826
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,240
Otherwise, Xiuying's reputation

827
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,360
shall be ruined again.

828
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,420
Joyce ideas

829
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,100
Master.

830
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,180
Last time,

831
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,100
after Xia Cheng appeared,

832
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,860
he was still missing.

833
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,780
I don't know why.

834
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,380
Could it be

835
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,780
that he was hinting at the owner of the turtle?

836
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,420
He was always on the edge of death.

837
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,420
Master.

838
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,060
You came down the mountain

839
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,460
for the turtle?

840
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:24,980
Yes.

841
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,460
But

842
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,180
I came for you.

843
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,060
You are my first disciple.

844
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,180
I can't let you die in the Huotu Tribe

845
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,580
without a reason, right?

846
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,180
You are still the same as before.

847
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,380
You should admit your concern for me.

848
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,220
Anyway,

849
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,260
the appearance of the turtle

850
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,100
is related to the whole empty grave.

851
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,540
It's a defeat for the stars.

852
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,700
So,

853
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,460
I have to investigate it.

854
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,180
If

855
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,500
the star is really a star,

856
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,540
I have to take action

857
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,340
before the disaster comes.

858
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,580
I can't let the people

859
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,100
suffer because of it.

860
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,860
Actually,

861
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,220
the thing about the chicken-fighting in Qiushui

862
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,500
has always been unfair

863
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,860
to Master.

864
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,940
Why does Master

865
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,580
still care about the people?

866
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,020
Because you are the only one

867
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,460
in the world.

868
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,140
Master.

869
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,140
Your parents,

870
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,660
your friends,

871
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,540
and my old friends.

872
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,140
You are

873
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,340
all innocent.

874
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,300
So,

875
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,340
don't ask

876
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,020
such childish questions again.

877
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,780
I will continue

878
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,260
to investigate the whereabouts of the turtle blood.

879
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,300
But

880
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,060
I can't see the stars

881
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,100
with my naked eyes.

882
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,180
I have to go to the White Tower of Jialan to watch the stars.

883
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,780
Tomorrow,

884
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,140
we will part ways.

885
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,180
Master.

886
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,820
Yan,

887
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,540
you are a person of great affection.

888
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,140
I have said goodbye to you three times.

889
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,620
Every time,

890
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,340
I made you cry.

891
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,500
But this time,

892
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,420
I don't want to be like this.

893
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,500
How about this?

894
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,180
What else do you want to say?

895
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,180
Tell me.

896
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,780
I will try to satisfy you.

897
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,300
Master,

898
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,060
can you call me Xiao again?

899
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,940
Mingxiao?

900
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,220
Didn't you give me a jade flute before?

901
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,460
I thought

902
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,420
I would have a chance to hear it.

903
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,380
But

904
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,980
since the abyss of the sky,

905
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,260
we have been hurt

906
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,940
and got injured.

907
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,260
I didn't even have a chance

908
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,540
to talk to you.

909
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,420
So I left the mountain.

910
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,660
And

911
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,460
you promised me

912
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,020
that you would treat me to a drink

913
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,580
every time you care about me.

914
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,380
Although

915
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,980
I'm afraid

916
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,220
I can't drink this wine,

917
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,980
I still want you

918
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,500
to call me Xiao.

919
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:26,900
Sure.

920
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,100
But I didn't bring it with me.

921
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,700
I brought it.

922
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,980
The Abyss of the Sky

923
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,500
The doctor said

924
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,580
it will take three days to recover all the power.

925
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,940
Why don't we wait until tomorrow?

926
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:46,860
Look at you.

927
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,540
You can't even fly with me.

928
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,580
You need to ride a horse.

929
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,300
You just let that girl

930
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,300
take care of you for one more day.

931
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,300
What are you afraid of?

932
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,460
I don't want to waste time.

933
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,420
Master.

934
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,900
Take your time.

935
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,020
I'll go and make a plan.

936
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,300
Master.

937
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,620
You said

938
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,260
you didn't want to make me sad.

939
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,660
But this time,

940
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,060
you lied to me.

941
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:19,900
Those people

942
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,780
didn't know you were a Tualong Ke.

943
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,220
After you left the city,

944
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,180
you made yourself

945
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,780
a great leader of the Jiao people.

946
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:27,980
Now,

947
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,580
I'm afraid that all the Western Sea Army

948
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,820
is looking for you.

949
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,940
And you've lost your power.

950
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,620
What if you meet them?

951
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,980
I have to protect myself.

952
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,980
Miss Shang.

953
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:43,780
Ying.

954
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,360
Bride沒有!

955
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,740
Bride Guo!

956
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:09,500
Prosperous 맛있аю,

957
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,020
cards indeed.

958
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:19,580
There's still a lot of decency left in my heart,

959
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:24,900
How can I get up and go away

960
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,900
How can I not see you

961
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:34,900
The more I cry, the more tears I shed

962
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,900
The bottom line in your heart

963
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,900
A wind dare to touch my soul

964
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,900
The star in my corner

965
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:54,900
Not by your side

966
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,900
The bottom line in your heart

967
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,900
A wind dare to touch my soul

968
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,900
How can it be broken

969
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,900
You and I just walk together

970
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,900
The bottom line in your heart

971
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:24,900
A wind dare to touch my soul

972
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,900
The star in my corner

973
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,900
Not by your side

974
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:39,900
The bottom line in your heart

975
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,900
A wind dare to touch my soul

976
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,900
How can it be broken

977
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:54,900
You and I just walk together

978
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,900
How can you and I meet

979
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:04,900
How can this be tomorrow
