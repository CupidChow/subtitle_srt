Your friend is dead.

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Zhang Zhenhe's uncle, Zhong Lian,

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
is not his real master.

9
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He has no right to you.

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
From now on, they are both dead.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You are alone,

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and you are the only one who can command the army.

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Stop talking.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Stop talking.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't want to listen.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't want to listen.

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't want to listen.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Zhiyuan,

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
let's go back to the village.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I will turn you into a demon doctor.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I will turn you into a demon doctor.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will turn you into a demon doctor.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You just need to be sent to the other sea.

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You just need to be sent to the other sea.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Find me.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Xu Xiaohu,

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
even if I die,

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I won't let you destroy the clouds.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't panic.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't panic.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Zhiyuan, don't struggle.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I am the one who is greedy for money.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I am the one who is greedy for money.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You really think you can die?

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In this world,

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
any person and emotion can make you reject me.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
any person and emotion can make you reject me.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I am the one who is greedy for money.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I am the one who is greedy for money.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I am the one who is greedy for money.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You can only be with me.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You can only be with me.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hezuo,

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
take me back to the medicine room.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
take me back to the medicine room.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I will help you find the sea king.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I will help you find the sea king.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yan, are you ok?

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Come, have a rest.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,640
Come on.

53
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,000
Come on.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,400
Come on.

55
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:25,920
Come on.

56
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,520
Come on.

57
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,120
OK.

58
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,480
Waiter,

59
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
have you heard of it?

60
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,080
What?

61
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,280
The Chizu clan's leader,

62
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,120
Zhiyuan,

63
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,120
has been fighting for 200 years.

64
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,800
Zhiyuan

65
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
has been teaching the Imperial Army

66
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,000
to imitate the enemy.

67
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,280
Now,

68
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,200
he has become

69
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,120
the leader of the Ice Clan.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,600
I think he is determined

71
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
to fight against Kong Sang.

72
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,200
Isn't that right?

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
It's a great crime

74
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,800
to collude with Zhiyuan.

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
I heard that

76
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,200
the Chizu clan's leader,

77
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Zhiyuan,

78
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,600
has committed suicide for the crime.

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,800
What a shame!

80
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Exactly.

81
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
What did you say?

82
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Who committed suicide?

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,800
The Chiru clan and the Princess Consort.

84
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,200
If I were to say,

85
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,000
killing two people

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,200
is too easy for them.

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
If they commit such a crime,

88
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,000
the whole Chizu clan should...

89
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,000
Ying,

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,200
you will be executed,

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,800
right?

92
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Yes. Yes. Yes.

93
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
It's so horrible.

94
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Princess.

95
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Princess.

96
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,800
Please accept my condolences.

97
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Mother.

98
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Mother.

99
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
Wake up.

100
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Mother.

101
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Father.

102
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Wake up.

103
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,800
Father.

104
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Princess.

105
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
Please accept my condolences.

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,400
Father.

107
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,200
The Prince and the Princess Consort

108
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
are only blaming him.

109
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Even if I

110
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,000
have committed suicide,

111
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Father and Mother

112
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,600
can wait for me to come back.

113
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
They can also explain to His Majesty

114
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
that I have committed suicide.

115
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Father.

116
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Father.

117
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I know

118
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
why they didn't wait for me to come back.

119
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Did someone force them

120
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
to do so?

121
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Did someone force them

122
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
to do so?

123
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Tell me.

124
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Tell me!

125
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
It's because Zhiyuan...

126
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Zhiyuan wrote a war letter to Kong Sang.

127
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
If the letter is about...

128
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
About what?

129
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Tell me!

130
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
If the Princess of the Chis

131
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
gives it to him,

132
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
he will stop the war.

133
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Otherwise,

134
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
he will go straight to the palace

135
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
and attack Jialan.

136
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
If he gets one city,

137
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
he will take one city.

138
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
You need it

139
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
to use the humiliation

140
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
of the Chis

141
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
to force you to commit suicide.

142
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Yes.

143
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
It's this war letter

144
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
that the Chis

145
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
have been ordered by thousands of people.

146
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
The Prince and the Princess Consort

147
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
have to...

148
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
have to use their lives to make it clear.

149
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Zhiyuan's family is in danger.

150
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
They have to use their lives

151
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
to protect the whole family.

152
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
They are even more worried

153
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
that if they fall into Zhiyuan's hands,

154
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
then...

155
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
then you will be

156
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
punished by others.

157
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
You can't be free.

158
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Mother.

159
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Mother.

160
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Mother.

161
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Mother.

162
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Mother.

163
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Yin'er,

164
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
it's not your fault.

165
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Mother.

166
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Mother.

167
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Mother.

168
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Mother.

169
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Mother.

170
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Nichang,

171
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
you have to go!

172
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Father, Mother, you go home first.

173
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
After I've avenged you,

174
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,200
I'll go home and tell you all.

175
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Father, Mother,

176
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,200
I don't have you anymore.

183
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,200
When I first saw this villa,

184
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Father and Mother were worried that I wasn't used to it.

185
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
So they put up the house

186
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,200
exactly like the house.

187
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,200
But this is not a heaven-like city.

188
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,200
It can't be planted with the trees in the west.

189
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Mother personally took the lead

190
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,200
and finally sent the moon and the moon to the moon.

191
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
The fire and the shadow

192
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,200
were all born and dried in this villa.

193
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Now that Mother is gone,

194
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,200
these trees have also withered.

195
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
The trees have all withered.

196
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,200
These are all that Mother left for me.

197
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,200
I can't let go of everything here.

198
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Yan'er,

199
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I think

200
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
this should be your mother.

201
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Because she was afraid that you would be too sad,

202
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,200
she sent these leaves to look at you.

203
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
She hopes that you can live on like these

204
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,200
dried leaves in the west.

205
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Don't worry.

206
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
I won't fall.

207
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,200
There are still so many things waiting for me to do.

208
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Yan'er,

209
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
I will find a way to deal with the medicine as soon as possible.

210
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
You haven't slept for a few nights.

211
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Rest early.

212
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,200
It's a tearful day.

213
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
My sense of taste is back.

214
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
I'm back.

215
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Yan'er,

216
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
are you okay?

217
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
I'm fine.

218
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I might be too tired recently.

219
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I'll just sleep well.

220
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Come.

221
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Yan'er,

222
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
promise me

223
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
not to think too much.

224
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Is Xu Yao's words effective?

225
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Is he really going to turn me into Grandmother Gao?

226
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Your Majesty,

227
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Prince Ying wants to see you.

228
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

229
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Yan'er.

230
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Yan'er,

231
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
I'm sorry.

233
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Yan'er,

234
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
you're back.

235
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
The matter of Prince Zhi

236
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,200
is my emperor's incompetence.

237
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
I knew he was a loyal minister,

238
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,200
but I could only watch him sacrifice himself to be a man.

239
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
I...

240
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,200
can't help it.

241
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Your Majesty, please grant me the authority to lead the army.

242
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,200
I and Zhu Yan will fight against the rebels

243
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,200
and seek justice for Prince and Princess Consort.

244
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Then, Zhi Yuan

245
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
is just a Jiao.

246
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
How is he related to the soldiers?

247
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Zhi Yuan is not the one we knew before.

248
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,200
He's just a puppet controlled by the Destroying God.

249
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,200
What?

250
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Destroying God?

251
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
You mean...

252
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
That's right.

253
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
He's the God of Destruction

254
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
in Yunhuang's second body.

255
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Destroying God Xu Yao.

256
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Xu Yao has no power,

257
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
but he's good at using the evil thoughts in others

258
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
to do his best.

259
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,200
He was the one who drove the new emperor to the throne.

260
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,200
The new emperor?

261
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Your Majesty,

262
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Xu Yao used the new emperor

263
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
to make the new emperor

264
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,200
think about the Empress Bawei.

265
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,200
But he's fighting against the Destroying God.

266
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,200
The soldiers who came back said

267
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
he's not dead.

268
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,200
He led the army

269
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,200
like he's possessed by evil.

270
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
He's going to die.

271
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
This is the God Realm of the Heavenly Empress.

272
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
It's the power of Xu Yao's Gu-Po

273
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
that will make the soldiers

274
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,200
become the only ones who can fight.

275
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,200
God is going to destroy the empty tomb.

276
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Your Majesty,

277
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
so, I and Zhu Yan

278
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
must find the Emperor of the Sea

279
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
before Xu Yao does.

280
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Otherwise,

281
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
not only the empty tomb,

282
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
but even the clouds

283
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,200
may be in trouble.

284
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,200
You're even taking the initiative

285
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,200
to fight against the God.

286
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Aren't you afraid?

287
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
If God is happy

288
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
when he sees the people's happiness,

289
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
how can he be admired

290
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
and worshiped?

291
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
The mortal is God.

292
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
He hasn't been there since ancient times.

293
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Then I'll be the first one.

294
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
My child,

295
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
run away.

296
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
If I run away,

297
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,200
where should the people run to?

298
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
I won't run away.

299
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Xu Yao.

300
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Your Highness,

301
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Miss has gone to the White Tower.

302
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
She said she's waiting for you there.

303
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Why is she at the White Tower?

304
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Maybe Miss has something important

305
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
to tell you.

306
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Yan'er.

307
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Yan'er.

308
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Shi Ying,

309
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,200
you promised to marry me.

310
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Will you still keep your promise?

311
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Of course.

312
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Okay.

313
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Then we'll get married

314
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
here and now.

315
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
I'll wait for you.

316
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
I'll wait for you.

317
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,200
I have no other family now.

318
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Shi Ying,

319
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,200
I want you to be my only family in my life.

320
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Okay.

321
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
First, bow to the heaven and earth.

322
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,200
The star river is the proof.

323
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,200
The more the love is absent,

324
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,200
the star river can be seen forever.

325
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Second, bow to the high hall.

326
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
The ancestors are the evils.

327
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
The couple bow to each other.

328
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
The gods are above.

329
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
I, Shi Ying,

330
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,200
am willing to marry Zhu Yan.

331
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
I will love and protect her forever.

332
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
The gods are above.

333
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I, Zhu Yan,

334
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,200
am willing to marry Shi Ying.

335
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,200
I will love and protect her forever.

336
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
The gods are above.

337
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
I, Zhu Yan,

338
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,200
am willing to marry Shi Ying.

339
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
I will love and protect her forever.

340
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
I will love and protect her forever.

341
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,200
I don't drink anymore.

342
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Of course I want to drink.

343
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Yan'er, look.

344
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Those are the stars of the palace and the stars of the mountain.

345
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
These two stars

346
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
are the stars in the two cups of wine.

347
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
It seems that

348
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
the gods have invited

349
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
the guests specially for us.

350
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
I have no regrets.

351
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Yan'er, sorry.

352
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
I couldn't satisfy you.

353
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
The wish in Tianji Feng City that day

354
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
gave you a lively wedding.

355
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
I am sorry.

356
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
I am sorry.

357
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
I am sorry.

358
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
I am sorry.

359
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
I am sorry.

360
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
I am sorry.

361
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
I am sorry.

362
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
I am sorry.

363
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
I am sorry.

364
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
I thought

365
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
there would be a family,

366
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
a family of wine and wine,

367
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
and a fire of fire.

368
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
But

369
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I am so lucky

370
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
to be with you

371
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
in such a chaotic world.

372
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
After the crisis of Kong Sang is over,

373
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
I will definitely

374
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
arrange a wedding for you

375
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
that you like.

376
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
I have no regrets.

377
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
I will definitely

378
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
arrange a wedding for you.

379
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
I will definitely

380
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
arrange a wedding for you.

381
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
It's like

382
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
returning to the Longevity Lake

383
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
to have such a star

384
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
to take care of us.

385
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
It's like

386
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
returning to the Longevity Lake

387
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
to take care of us.

388
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
This is the happiest

389
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,200
I wish the love is not over

390
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,200
and the love is not over

391
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Like a dream

392
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,200
I wish to see you in my dream

393
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
I miss you so much

394
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,200
like the moonlight

395
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,200
like the moonlight

396
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,200
like the moonlight

397
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,200
I want to spend my life with you

398
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
I want to spend my life with you

399
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,200
with your most beautiful necklace

400
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,200
I want to spend my life with you

401
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,200
with your most beautiful necklace

402
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:45,200
I miss you so much

403
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
I can't let the innocent die

404
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,200
If he wants me, I will go to him

405
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,200
and find a way to defeat him completely

406
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,200
But I have an appointment with you to plan a plan

407
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,200
I will definitely come back

408
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,200
The red robe in the dragon's mouth

409
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
is still in the blood

410
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,200
I used to wear the most important red robe

411
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
when I was a child

412
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
It's so beautiful

413
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,200
You just smiled and touched my head

414
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,200
and said that the chief of the female clan could wear it

415
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,200
and said that I would wear it to you in a few years

416
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Look

417
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Father, mother

418
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Did you see it in the sky?

419
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,200
I often think of the past

420
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,200
of Grandmother Gao and Zhiyuan

421
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
I'm actually afraid

422
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
I'm really afraid

423
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,200
that I will become another person because of magic

424
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
But it won't happen

425
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Father, mother

426
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,200
Because I'm your favorite daughter, Yan'er

427
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,200
You are watching me in the sky

428
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,200
I will definitely avenge you personally

429
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Please bless me

430
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Let me find a way to eliminate the need

431
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,200
I will definitely not lose myself

432
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Because I have you by my side

433
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:38,200
You give me a deep view

434
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,200
I will definitely not lose myself

435
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,200
I will definitely not lose myself

436
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,200
I will definitely not lose myself

437
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Your Highness

438
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Your Highness, I finally found you

439
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
The king's illness suddenly deteriorated yesterday

440
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
The imperial physicians were all out of control

441
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
What should we do?

442
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Your Highness, please go back and have a look

443
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,200
Your Highness, please go back to the palace

444
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Shi Yu

445
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,200
I'm leaving

446
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
It's enough

447
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:36,200
I will leave the country to you

448
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Father, don't go

449
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Father

450
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,200
Yan'er, you are here

451
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
I know

452
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Two important people in your life

453
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
One is because of me

454
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
I hate it

455
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:08,200
I can't get his family's authority

456
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Do you hate me?

457
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Yan'er

458
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,200
I am sorry for you all my life

459
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I don't want to beg you for forgiveness

460
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:44,200
But as a father, I beg you to take care of Shi Yu

461
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Take care of Shi Yu

462
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Protect the royal family

463
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Protect the people

464
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,200
I don't want to see the king's grudge

465
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Be destroyed like this

466
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Shi Yu

467
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Whether it's the king or my father

468
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,200
I failed

469
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,200
I'm sorry for you

470
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
You two brothers

471
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
You, you

472
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Be good

473
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,200
I, I will do it

474
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,200
Don't worry, father

475
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Father, father

476
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Father, father

477
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,200
The king's grudge is going to be destroyed

478
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,200
I want to rebuild the world with the help of the royal family

479
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,200
I want to rebuild the world with the help of the royal family

480
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
I want the world

481
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,200
I want him to be my friend

482
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Facing those who are not aware of their fatigue

483
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Not afraid of pain

484
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Not afraid of the lives of the soldiers

485
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
I am a soldier

486
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Fight day and night

487
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Although I try to kill the enemy

488
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Still exhausted

489
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,200
And this is just a pioneer soldier of the army

490
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
There are more soldiers on the way

491
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,200
The root is all because of the need for the seduction

492
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,200
But what we are going to solve now is the end of the family

493
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Then make other plans

494
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Yes

495
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Can we help you with anything?

496
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
I brought them to help you

497
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
The world is in chaos

498
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Jiuyi Mountain will never be a good place to fight

499
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
That's good

500
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Qinggang, Bai Xue Lu

501
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,200
I order you two as the chief and deputy generals of this battle

502
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Lead the whole army and support all parties at any time

503
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Yes

504
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Lan Xi Qiao, Zi Yao Guang, Zi Qian Qian, Xuan Shuang

505
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Yes, your majesty

506
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,200
You lead the army to each side

507
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
You lead the army to each side

508
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Fight with the army

509
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,200
Be careful not to let them attack the city

510
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Yes

511
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Four ministers

512
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Thank you for leading the officers to fight together

513
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,200
If you are not the enemy, you should be proud

514
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Yes

515
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
The country is in danger

516
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
The country is in danger

517
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,200
I will entrust it to everyone

518
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,200
We will do our best to serve our country

519
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Yuan

520
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Jiuyi

521
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
It's you

522
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,220
It hurts

523
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Zhi Yao

524
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Do you have a plan?

525
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
I have been thinking about it

526
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,360
It's great

527
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,160
It's created byrol

528
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
It was created byrol

529
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
So why not use the death of a son

530
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
to attack the son's shield?

531
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
It's the same in the world.

532
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
When did you become a doctor?

533
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
The day I returned to Ye City,

534
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
I saw the body of the Chirp King's husband.

535
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
I was so sad.

536
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
I was so disgusted

537
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
with Zhu Yan's identity.

538
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
I...

539
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Zhu Yan is a self-righteous person.

540
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
In fact, he can't do anything.

541
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
He only drags his parents into this.

542
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
It's because of this reason

543
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
that he sent you

544
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
to be buried in this body.

545
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
If so,

546
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
the person you hate should be me.

547
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
I forced them to die.

548
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
If I were still Zhu Yan,

549
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
I would hate you.

550
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
But now,

551
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
I'm also a doctor.

552
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
Although I can't forgive

553
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
your crimes against Kong Sang,

554
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
if you can stop it

555
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
in time,

556
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
you'll be able to get away.

557
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
You're going to do it again.

558
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
My magic trick didn't work.

559
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
You're still Zhu Yan.

560
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
You approached me

561
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
just to trick me

562
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
and achieve your goal.

563
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
You're not my friend at all.

564
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
What do you think?

565
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Am I right?

566
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
I'm not.

567
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
I'm not.

568
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
I'm not.

569
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
I'm not.

570
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
I'm not.

571
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
I'm not.

572
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
I'm not.

573
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
I'm not.

574
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
I'm not.

575
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
I'm not.

576
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
I'm not.

577
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
I'm not.

578
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
I'm not.

579
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,200
I'm not.

580
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
I'm not.

581
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
I'm not.

582
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
I'm not.

583
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
I'm not.

584
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
I'm not.

585
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
I'm not.

586
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
I'm not.

587
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
I'm not.

588
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
I'm not.

589
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
I'm not.

590
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
I'm not.

591
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
I'm not.

592
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
I'm not.

593
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
I'm not.

594
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
I'm not.

595
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
What would you like?

596
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I felt my heaven's power.

597
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
However, having a power

598
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
would give a better weight.

599
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,680
It should be Xu Yao who has been thinking about the curse of the heavens.

600
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,040
Then what?

601
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,800
I will try my best to use my strength to fight against her.

602
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,400
But I am not her opponent.

603
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,960
But Xu Yao also has to use more strength to stabilize the heavens.

604
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,160
She probably won't be able to use the strength of the Heavenly Empress' family

605
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,880
to frame the army for a while.

606
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,600
Who is it?

607
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,560
How dare you call the Heavens for me?

608
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,680
You caused me to lose control of the army.

609
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,280
He is the blood of the King.

610
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,600
He is the heir to the Heavens.

611
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,440
You still dare to defend me?

612
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,280
I know you are lying to me.

613
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,160
I want to win, of course.

614
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,400
But you...

615
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,440
You...

616
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,600
You...

617
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,240
But you...

618
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,600
You are not my An Yuan.

619
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,400
It will be lonely without you.

620
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,560
adasi,

621
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,160
I guess it's true.

622
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,400
The army of the Ice Tribe has recovered.

623
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,160
Chong Ming, let's go.

624
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,680
Let's take this opportunity to win.

625
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,280
But what about Zhu Yan?

626
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,600
Shi Yang, even if the Seven Poisons

627
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,920
can't take back the Heaven,

628
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,560
maybe we can save Zhu Yan.

629
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,960
We can't wait any longer.

630
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
What if he has a short-lived story?

631
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,520
Shi Yang,

632
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,360
we can't let him go.

633
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,760
We can't let him go.

634
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,160
We can't let him go.

635
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,160
Shi Yang, I'll give you a needle.

636
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,440
Let's try it.

637
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,360
No, I can't go.

638
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,160
Yan'er and I have made a promise.

639
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,280
We'll never leave each other.

640
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,520
He will come back.

641
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,720
No matter what decision he makes,

642
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,160
I will support him.

643
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,960
That's all.

644
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,960
What should we do now?

645
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,360
After we get Jialan Zhiwei,

646
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,560
I'll bring him back

647
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,560
no matter where he is.

648
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,960
Yao Yi, I made a deal with Xu Yao.

649
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,360
Now that you're back with me,

650
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,360
I'll take him to the Bilo Sea

651
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,760
to become the King of the Sea.

652
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,160
Find the King of the Sea?

653
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,960
What about after that?

654
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,960
Are you going to use the Twin Realms

655
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,960
to destroy the Heaven and Earth,

656
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,560
destroy the Clouds and Deserts?

657
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
Since I've already promised him,

658
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,560
I can't be a traitor.

659
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,160
Oh no.

660
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,960
It seems that when Yuan realized his obsession with Yao Yi,

661
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,360
he was already destroyed by Xu Yao.

662
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,160
I must hurry up and take Xu Yao to the Bilo Sea

663
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,760
to get the ring.

664
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,760
I'm doing this for you.

665
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,560
For me?

666
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,760
I want to create a new and equal Cloud Realm

667
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,160
so that you can love a merman with all your heart.

668
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,760
You won't be cornered by others.

669
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,360
But before that,

670
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,360
I want to destroy the Cloud Realm completely.

671
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,560
That makes sense.

672
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,360
Yao Yi, you've thought it through.

673
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,960
By then, we'll be in the world together

674
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,760
like the Star Lord and Bai Wei from 7,000 years ago.

675
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
But Yuan,

676
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,360
when we start the plan to destroy the Heaven and Earth,

677
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,160
you have the Heavenly Empress to protect you.

678
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,560
And I can only be a chicken powder.

679
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,160
Don't worry about that.

680
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,560
I'll protect you.

681
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,960
But you know that

682
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,760
I don't want to be a grass that can trample on others.

683
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,760
The two rings of the Heavenly Empress

684
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,760
were originally worn by the Star Lord and Bai Wei.

685
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,160
Now, I'll give you the ring

686
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,760
and teach you how to use it.

687
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,160
When the Cloud Realm is destroyed, you can protect yourself.

688
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,560
In the future, you can even be my equal

689
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,160
and be together with me.

690
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,560
I'll keep my promise and fulfill my wish.

691
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,560
I have no regrets in this life.

692
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,560
I have no boundaries in this sea of mountains.

693
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,560
I have no regrets in this life.

694
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,560
I have no boundaries in this sea of mountains.

695
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,160
Look.

696
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,160
Doesn't it look good on you?

697
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,360
Yuan,

698
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:50,560
the curse of the Heavenly Empress is so merciful.

699
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
I wonder

700
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,160
how the curse of the Heaven will be.

701
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,160
You'll know when the Cloud Realm is destroyed.

702
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,160
I'll protect you.

703
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,560
Then,

704
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,560
when are you going to find the Sea Emperor?

705
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
I...

706
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:24,560
You must wait until the night of the flowering night in the Eastern Hall.

707
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,160
Okay.

708
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,760
I promise you.

709
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,560
I will.

710
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,760
Fu Xian.

711
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,160
The armies of the Ice Tribe are dying.

712
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,640
Now, you and your neighbor

713
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,560
can't run away from me.

714
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,760
You can't stop me.

715
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,120
I have what you gave to me.

716
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,480
What is this?

717
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:12,560
At this time,

718
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,400
you can use my magic.

719
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,860
He still thinks that,

720
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,020
fear or stigma,

721
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,380
aspect of the man won't fix it?

722
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,040
I thought that

723
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,540
you'd hit him,

724
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,640
then what'd you do?

725
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,880
I actually

726
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,220
want to kill him.

727
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,020
Okay.

728
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,260
You're giving up?)

729
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,480
Chell

730
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,140
can't do that way.

731
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,160
But...

732
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:39,780
Take this.

733
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,860
Take it.</i enamacking me,

734
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,860
The King of Deception

735
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,860
Episode 16

736
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:57,860
Yin.

737
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,360
Shiyi.

738
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,860
You must have waited for me for a long time.

739
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,860
Come with me.

740
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:13,860
Yin.

741
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,860
Are you all right?

742
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,860
I'm fine.

743
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,860
I made my own decision.

744
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,860
But you understand what I'm thinking.

745
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,860
I'm very happy.

746
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,860
The Thief is in my hands.

747
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,860
But the Heaven is still with him.

748
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,860
But I think

749
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,860
as long as you can get the curse of the Heaven,

750
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,860
you can control it.

751
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,860
Just now, I also thought

752
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,860
that I could control the Heaven.

753
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:37,860
But I think

754
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,860
as long as you can get the curse of the Heaven,

755
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:39,860
you can control it.

756
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,860
But I think

757
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,860
as long as you can get the curse of the Heaven.

758
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,860
But I think

759
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:43,860
as long as you can get the curse of the Heaven.

760
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,860
Yao Yu.

761
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:46,860
Yao Yu.

762
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,860
Where are you?

763
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,860
Shiyi.

764
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,860
I'm so happy

765
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,860
to meet you.

766
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,860
Yin.

767
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,860
No.

768
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,860
I can't let Yin

769
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:13,860
shoot the blood alone.

770
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,860
Yao Yu.

771
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:17,860
Where are you?

772
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:19,860
Yuan.

773
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,860
Yuan.

774
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:30,860
Yin.

775
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:32,860
Yin.

776
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,860
Yin.

777
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,860
Yin.

778
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,860
Yin.

779
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,860
Yin.

780
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,860
I thought you left.

781
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:58,860
No.

782
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,860
Yin's magic power is more powerful.

783
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,860
Yuan.

784
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:04,860
How could I leave?

785
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,860
Yuan.

786
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,860
Yuan.

787
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,860
If you're so worried about me,

788
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,860
why don't you

789
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,860
use the magic of the master

790
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:14,860
to complete it

791
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:16,860
and turn me into your medicine?

792
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,860
What did you say?

793
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:21,860
For you,

794
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,860
I'm willing to

795
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,860
erase all memories

796
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,860
before Zhu Yan.

797
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,860
Yin.

798
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:31,860
Don't do stupid things.

799
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,860
Help me to use the magic

800
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,860
and turn me into your medicine.

801
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,860
Okay.

802
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,860
I'll help you to use the magic.

803
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,860
I'll never regret

804
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,860
and regret

805
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,860
in my life.

806
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,860
I'm willing to die.

807
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,860
No sword, no sword.

808
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:32,860
I'll die.

809
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,860
I'll never regret

810
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,860
and regret

811
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,860
in my life.

812
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,860
I'll die.

813
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:02,860
I'll die.

814
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:06,860
Why didn't you use the magic?

815
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,860
I'll never regret

816
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:10,860
and regret

817
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:12,860
in my life.

818
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:14,860
No sword, no sword.

819
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:17,860
Yuan.

820
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,860
The horn of the red monk is ringing.

821
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,860
Hurry up.

822
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,860
Use the magic to turn me into your medicine.

823
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:23,860
Let's kill them together.

824
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,860
I'll die.

825
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,860
No light, no lamp.

826
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,860
No light, no lamp.

827
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:09,860
You don't care about your life.

828
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,860
No head, no spirit.

829
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,860
No head,

830
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:18,860
no spirit.

831
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,860
I'll never regret

832
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,860
in my life.

833
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:25,860
In my life.

834
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,860
Let's see

835
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,860
if you can

836
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,460
I'll kill you.

837
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,700
I'll hurt you.

838
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,340
No.

839
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,220
No.

840
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,140
No.

841
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,300
No.

842
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:45,780
Luo Yu.

843
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:57,740
It's you.

844
00:51:59,140 --> 00:51:59,780
Yan'er.

845
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,700
How are you?

846
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,420
I was only relying on him.

847
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:07,860
Shi Yan.

848
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,260
I didn't expect that

849
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,100
at the last moment when he said the spell,

850
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,100
you'd miss the last word.

851
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,820
You lied to me again.

852
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,180
Now we have the whole world

853
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,460
in our hands.

854
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:22,780
Xi Yao.

855
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:23,940
We won't let you

856
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,100
protect Yunhuang again.

857
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,340
Today

858
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,780
is the final battle between us.

859
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,100
I'll kill you.

860
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,100
Xi Yao?

861
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:36,860
Where are you?

862
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:38,700
I'll kill you.

863
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:44,660
I'll temporal

864
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,700
kill you.

865
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,580
the

866
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,780
Eh?

867
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,140
Shi Ya.

868
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:12,760
Ref Difficulties

869
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,200
Is it you?

870
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,600
There is no one in this world left.

871
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,860
How could you break my lies?

872
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,460
Yan.

873
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,700
Yan.

874
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,060
Yan, don't come over.

875
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:31,980
No.

876
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,700
Let Xu Yao and I meet each other.

877
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:36,940
Yan.

878
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,180
You've suffered a lot.

879
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,380
It's all my fault.

880
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,380
I can't get over it until now.

881
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,460
I'm sorry.

882
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:27,860
Yan.

883
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:57,340
Yan'er.

884
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,140
Yan'er.

885
00:59:59,140 --> 00:59:59,700
Yan'er.

886
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:02,500
Yan'er.

887
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,340
It's Xu Yao.

888
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,420
It's Xu Yao who entered your body.

889
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,060
That merman

890
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,940
wanted to leave with me.

891
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,260
What?

892
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,940
I'm Xu Yao, the God of Death.

893
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,820
Zhu Yan.

894
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,620
Now

895
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,340
it's your turn.

896
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:51,340
Yan'er.

897
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,860
The person I love is right beside me.

898
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,780
I have no obsession.

899
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,260
You just want to seduce me.

900
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,100
Yan'er.

901
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:04,140
Your parents died for you.

902
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,420
And it's also Yan'er

903
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,020
who died once

904
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:10,580
because of your daughter.

905
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:12,860
Yan'er.

906
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,020
It's not your fault.

907
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,180
You think the one you love

908
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,500
can stay with you forever?

909
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,300
Only I deserve it.

910
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:25,940
Yan'er.

911
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:28,860
Don't listen to him.

912
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,700
He just wants to control you.

913
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:31,260
He wants to...

914
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:39,780
Yan'er.

915
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:40,340
Shi Yan.

916
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:41,620
No.

917
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,380
Good boy.

918
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,060
That's right.

919
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,020
Yan'er.

920
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:52,460
I'm here.

921
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,020
Do you remember?

922
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,260
You saved me

923
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:57,700
with your blood.

924
01:01:58,660 --> 01:01:59,700
Your parents

925
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,420
won't blame you.

926
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:02,460
No.

927
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,460
As long as they stay with me,

928
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,140
the rest

929
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,260
will die.

930
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:20,820
Yan'er.

931
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,180
Yan'er.

932
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:24,980
It's my fault.

933
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,780
I failed to protect you.

934
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:30,340
Yan'er.

935
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,740
But please remember

936
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:36,300
that I'm happy

937
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:38,380
to see you.

938
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:54,660
Yan'er.

939
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,460
Yan'er.

940
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,500
Yan'er.

941
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,100
Yan'er.

942
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:58,620
Yan'er.

943
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,220
Yan'er.

944
01:02:59,220 --> 01:02:59,980
Yan'er.

945
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:00,500
Yan'er.

946
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,020
Yan'er.

947
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:01,580
Yan'er.

948
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:02,100
Yan'er.

949
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:02,620
Yan'er.

950
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:03,220
Yan'er.

951
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:03,860
Yan'er.

952
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,460
Yan'er.

953
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:05,060
Yan'er.

954
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:05,660
Yan'er.

955
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:06,420
Yan'er.

956
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,140
Yan'er.

957
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:07,820
Yan'er.

958
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:08,420
Yan'er.

959
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,020
Yan'er.

960
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:09,620
Yan'er.

961
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,300
Yan'er.

962
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,020
Yan'er.

963
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:11,660
Yan'er.

964
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:12,260
Yan'er.

965
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,020
Yan'er.

966
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:13,620
Yan'er.

967
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,300
Yan'er.

968
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,020
Yan'er.

969
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,620
Yan'er.

970
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:16,300
Yan'er.

971
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,020
Yan'er.

972
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:17,820
Yan'er.

973
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:18,500
Yan'er.

974
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,140
Yan'er.

975
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,020
Yan'er.

976
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:56,020
Shi Yan.

977
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:56,620
You...

978
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:57,420
Don't come over.

979
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,020
Shi Yan.

980
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,020
You...

981
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:08,020
I didn't expect that.

982
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:09,620
Shi Yang.

983
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,820
Do you think you and Zhu Yan

984
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:14,620
can control me?

985
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:15,420
No.

986
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:16,420
Shi Yan.

987
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:18,620
No.

988
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,220
I will use my life

989
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,620
to seal your spirit.

990
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:22,620
No.

991
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,020
Shi Yan.

992
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:27,420
I will use my life

993
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,420
to seal your spirit.

994
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,020
Really?

995
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,420
Then I will try.

996
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:40,820
Shi Yan.

997
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:48,020
Yan'er.

998
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,020
Shi Yan.

999
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,820
The earth and the sky are equal.

1000
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:56,820
Zhu Yan.

1001
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:59,420
You will never be able to kill me.

1002
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,020
The whole world

1003
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,020
and the whole world

1004
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,420
are under my control.

1005
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:06,420
Shi Yan.

1006
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:07,820
You...

1007
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:11,020
You will never be able to kill me.

1008
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,020
There must be another way.

1009
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:14,020
Shi Yan.

1010
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:15,820
Another way?

1011
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,220
You will never be able to kill me.

1012
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,420
Don't come over.

1013
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,420
Shi Yan.

1014
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:36,620
Yan'er.

1015
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:39,620
You and I can

1016
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:41,620
make some use of it.

1017
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,020
Shi Yan.

1018
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,020
Yan'er.

1019
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,620
I told you.

1020
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:20,020
You will never be able to kill me.

1021
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:21,020
You...

1022
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:23,020
You are the one who killed him.

1023
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,420
No.

1024
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,220
Shi Yan.

1025
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,420
Shi Yan.

1026
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,620
I should do it.

1027
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,620
I should do it.

1028
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,020
Yan'er.

1029
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,420
Killing me

1030
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,020
means helping me.

1031
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,620
This way

1032
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,420
I can seal the spirit

1033
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,420
in my body forever.

1034
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:46,820
You two are still so naive.

1035
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:50,020
You will never be able to kill me.

1036
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:52,020
I am Xu Yao.

1037
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:55,420
The whole world and the whole world are under my control.

1038
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:56,820
Zhu Yan.

1039
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:00,420
Do you want to kill Shi Yan again?

1040
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:03,220
Do you want to kill your beloved?

1041
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,820
You...

1042
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:08,020
You...

1043
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:09,020
You...

1044
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,020
You...

1045
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:11,020
You...

1046
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,020
You...

1047
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,020
You...

1048
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,020
You...

1049
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,020
Yan'er.

1050
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:18,220
Yan'er.

1051
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:19,420
Do it.

1052
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:27,820
Do it.

1053
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,220
Stop.

1054
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,420
I can't do it.

1055
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,420
I...

1056
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,420
I really can't do it.

1057
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,420
Do you remember?

1058
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,420
As long as you're willing,

1059
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:30,420
you can do it forever.

1060
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:33,420
You can do it forever.

1061
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,420
Xu Ying!

1062
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,420
Zhu Yan,

1063
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:47,420
you're the daughter of Xu Ying's former emperor.

1064
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,420
Do you want to kill her again?

1065
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,420
Xu Ying!

1066
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,420
Xu Ying!

1067
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:43,420
Mother,

1068
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:46,420
kill me.

1069
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,420
Kill me.

1070
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:54,420
Kill me.

1071
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:59,420
Xu Ying!

1072
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:06,420
Zhu Yan.

1073
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:11,420
Xue Fa...

1074
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:14,420
Xue Fa, what have you done?

1075
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,420
I've done nothing wrong.

1076
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:41,420
Yan'er,

1077
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:43,420
every year,

1078
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:46,420
when the snow and frost

1079
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:49,420
melt,

1080
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:54,420
I'll come back to see you.

1081
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:03,420
I'll come back to see you.

1082
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,420
I'll come back to see you.

1083
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:07,420
I'll come back to see you.

1084
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,420
I'll come back to see you.

1085
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:13,420
I'll come back to see you.

1086
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:15,420
I'll come back to see you.

1087
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:17,420
I'll come back to see you.

1088
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:19,420
I'll come back to see you.

1089
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:21,420
I'll come back to see you.

1090
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,420
I'll come back to see you.

1091
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,420
I'll come back to see you.

1092
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,420
I'll come back to see you.

1093
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:29,420
I'll come back to see you.

1094
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,420
I'll come back to see you.

1095
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:33,420
I'll come back to see you.

1096
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,420
I'll come back to see you.

1097
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,420
I'll come back to see you.

1098
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,420
I'll come back to see you.

1099
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:41,420
I'll come back to see you.

1100
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,420
I'll come back to see you.

1101
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,420
It's you.

1102
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:08,420
It's you.

1103
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:13,100
Ever Night

1104
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:20,800
Muito

1105
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,860
so gently,

1106
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,440
softly.

1107
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,420
Don't move.

1108
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:34,220
Don't move

1109
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,540
and be so gentle.

1110
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:41,520
Don't let it escape from me.

1111
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,760
Don't let it get away from me.

1112
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,240
Don't let it stay now.

1113
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,700
Don't let it get away from me.

1114
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,180
Don't let it come to me,

1115
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,060
Really dare not

1116
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,340
Aid

1117
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,120
I damaged your support

1118
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,920
I used to knee down

1119
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,280
Sit tight

1120
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,560
Your hand is open

1121
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,700
It's too hard

1122
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:06,540
Really

1123
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:07,760
Whoæä½ 

1124
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:08,880
the same

1125
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:09,920
Titan

1126
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:10,820
and I

1127
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:11,800
Go to bed

1128
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:13,440
Still

1129
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,680
Help him

1130
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,960
Congratulatory

1131
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:17,980
Van However

1132
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:19,120
Are you here

1133
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:23,180
is that I'm back to see you.

1134
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,020
Your Highness,

1135
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:42,620
Prince Qing and Prince Bai want to see you.

1136
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,140
Greetings, Your Majesty.

1137
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:52,500
There are no outsiders here.

1138
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:53,500
You don't need to stand in line.

1139
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:55,860
Why are you here?

1140
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:57,540
I'm here to take the throne

1141
01:13:58,060 --> 01:13:59,340
and recommend Qing Yi

1142
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,020
to take the throne of Prince Qing.

1143
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:02,700
Why?

1144
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,420
The leaders of each clan

1145
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:06,260
need to guard the six regions.

1146
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,140
As the Prince of Qing,

1147
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:09,700
I'm Prince Bai.

1148
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,380
So after the wedding,

1149
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:13,340
I've been away from many people.

1150
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,420
I don't want to be alone in this.

1151
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:20,060
Xue Lu's talent and diligence

1152
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,300
are far better than mine.

1153
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,300
Then I'll fulfill her

1154
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,260
wish to restore Ye City.

1155
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:27,820
Okay.

1156
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:29,460
I'll do it.

1157
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,180
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1158
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,820
Luckily, I have you two to guard the city.

1159
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:37,620
Otherwise, the Ice Tribe will be destroyed.

1160
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,500
If we come back

1161
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:41,060
like a year ago...

1162
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:44,260
I saw Zhu Yan at the gate.

1163
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,500
He has been

1164
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:49,020
chasing the Ice Tribe and the rebels.

1165
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,780
Now that the war is over,

1166
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:52,740
he can finally take a break.

1167
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:55,660
It's a pity that he's killed.

1168
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:58,940
My brother's spirit

1169
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:00,940
will bless him

1170
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:02,620
and Kong Sang.

1171
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,340
Long'er,

1172
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,180
let's go see the King of Fu.

1173
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,420
Long'er, are you good today?

1174
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:14,940
Is there anyone who is angry with you?

1175
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,740
Your Majesty, don't joke.

1176
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,100
It's scary when the child can talk.

1177
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:19,780
Master, please come in.

1178
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,420
Long'er.

1179
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:21,500
Long'er.

1180
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,380
Yong Long is our first child.

1181
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:28,980
Even if he's not fully grown,

1182
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:30,060
it's not surprising.

1183
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:34,740
So many things have happened these years.

1184
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,620
He's so cute.

1185
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:36,740
I really hope

1186
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:39,460
our child can be like his name.

1187
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,140
Long'er.

1188
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:42,500
Kong Sang Yong Gu.

1189
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,140
Meng Hua Yong Long.

1190
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:44,660
Look.

1191
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:46,500
Long'er.

1192
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:48,140
Long'er.

1193
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,100
This is the place

1194
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,300
we first met.

1195
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:05,180
It's said that

1196
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,140
the wind rises like a bell

1197
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,100
and the flowers fall like snow.

1198
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,300
But where

1199
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:15,900
can I get you?

1200
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,060
I've done

1201
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,620
what I promised you.

1202
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,580
What about what you promised me?

1203
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:26,580
You promised

1204
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:29,100
to make up for a grand wedding

1205
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,300
and travel around the world.

1206
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,220
We'll be together forever

1207
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:35,580
like two stars in the sky.

1208
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,140
But all these years,

1209
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:40,860
you didn't even let me

1210
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:42,100
enter your dream.

1211
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,140
I'm sorry.

1212
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:45,940
I'm sorry.

1213
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:46,740
I'm sorry.

1214
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:47,540
I'm sorry.

1215
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:48,300
I'm sorry.

1216
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,140
I'm sorry.

1217
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:50,060
I'm sorry.

1218
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:51,100
I'm sorry.

1219
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,100
I'm sorry.

1220
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,100
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

1224
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,100
I'm sorry.

1225
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,100
I'm sorry.

1226
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,100
I'm sorry.

1227
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,100
I'm sorry.

1228
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,100
I'm sorry.

1229
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:02,100
I'm sorry.

1230
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,100
