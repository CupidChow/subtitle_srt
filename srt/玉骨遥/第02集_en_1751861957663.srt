1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want to be with you

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
for the rest of my life

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Please give me a life

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
of shining fortune

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want to be with you

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
for the rest of my life

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But I want to be with you

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
for the rest of my life

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I want to be with you

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
for the rest of my life

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to be with you

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
for the rest of my life

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I want to be with you

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
for the rest of my life

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It seems that this Qingying Lu Ling

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
needs to be trained

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, I need to train hard

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
before my mother's birthday

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I can give her this

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Your Highness, you are going further and further away

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's been ten days since you left home

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We have been hiding it for so long

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Luckily, you came back in time today

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Otherwise, we can't make it this time

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Why did you come to me today?

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is it because of some young master

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
who proposed to you?

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Now it's so windy

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No one dares to propose to me

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Every man who wants to marry a woman

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
will be married

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No one dares to propose to me

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Every man who wants to marry a woman

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
will be married

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
They are not young enough to get married

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I heard that the person who came this time

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
is from Jialan

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It seems that they are going to invite you

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
to attend some ceremony

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You mean the ceremony of the Nine-Ten Mountain

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
which is held every ten years?

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't know

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Your Highness, where are you going?

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Mammy, please have some tea

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Thank you, Your Highness

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I heard that the princess of the mansion

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
is getting old

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and is going to the ceremony

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You know that

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
according to the ancestral system

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the daughter of the Bai family

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
will be the star of the ceremony

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
of the martial arts

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But if the other ladies

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
who are performing the dance

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
can show their respect to the family

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The six noble ladies gather here

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's a good time to have a good marriage

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm afraid that Yan'er

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
has been wasted in dancing

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I want to go

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Father

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mother

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mammy

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to attend the ceremony

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But if you can't pass the dance

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
you can't go

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Please give me three days

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I will pass

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Grandpa

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Sir

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,880
As aound Y kept panicking and was drowning so I exponential took the river to experience,

73
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,880
This mysterious, heathen road is course.

74
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,900
I waited end ear earnestly,

75
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
He is still roaring.

76
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,000
No really.

77
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,440
combustible,

78
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,220
Does not split,

79
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:30,960
Ben evening,

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,400
Brother Jing and Brother Quan,

81
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,800
are you really a Zweckreal Send to me as an experiment?

82
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,000
To make you pulsated

83
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,680
in some way?

84
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,080
How come?

85
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes,

86
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,920
you're here.

87
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,860
Brother Wen 왜说Flowers in Time

88
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,720
is a pair of butterflies?

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,040
Brother Wen,

90
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,440
I can get closer to you.

91
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,280
I brought two daughters with me.

92
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,280
One of them

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,960
is the selection of the Wangxing Envoy

94
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,600
for this memorial ceremony.

95
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,120
Please pay attention to it.

96
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,640
Although I brought less memorials,

97
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,000
the purpose is to make the future

98
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,960
Crown Princess feel more comfortable.

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
Qingxian,

100
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,880
don't you think so?

101
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,800
You're wrong.

102
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,640
There's no Crown Prince.

103
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,280
Why do you say that?

104
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,480
If there's a Crown Princess,

105
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,760
there's a Crown Prince.

106
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,800
The Crown Prince

107
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,240
is the Crown Prince.

108
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,640
He's the Crown Prince.

109
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,960
He's the Crown Prince.

110
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,240
He's the Crown Prince.

111
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,640
He's the Crown Prince.

112
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,040
He's the Crown Prince.

113
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,480
He's the Crown Prince.

114
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,840
He's the Crown Prince.

115
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,240
He's the Crown Prince.

116
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,640
He's the Crown Prince.

117
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,040
He's the Crown Prince.

118
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,480
He's the Crown Prince.

119
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,880
He's the Crown Prince.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,400
He's the Crown Prince.

121
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,880
He's the Crown Prince.

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,360
He's the Crown Prince.

123
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,760
He's the Crown Prince.

124
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,280
He's the Crown Prince.

125
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,760
He's the Crown Prince.

126
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,240
He's the Crown Prince.

127
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,720
Your Highness.

128
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,680
She's the Crown Princess.

129
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,640
He's the Crown Prince.

130
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,360
Your insanity is worse?

131
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,600
Pay a storey of respect here.

132
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,160
It's better now.

133
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,520
What?

134
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,400
The Crown Prince has gone

135
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,920
for a walk and now he goes?

136
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,860
My lord,

137
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,560
you and the Crown Prince

138
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,840
are so greedy,

139
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,880
You like to play tricks?

140
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,960
You're good.

141
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,200
How dare you laugh at me?

142
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,040
You...

143
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,320
I didn't ruin your face, right?

144
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,040
I didn't ruin your face, right?

145
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
I didn't ruin your face, right?

146
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Oh no.

147
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Oh no.

148
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Oh no.

149
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Oh no.

150
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
Oh no.

151
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Oh no.

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh no.

153
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
It's okay.

154
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
It's not a big deal.

155
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
Do you know how hard it is

156
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,560
for me to get this face?

157
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,520
The king of the swans, Chong Ming,

158
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,800
has been practicing for ten thousand years,

159
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,320
and finally became a king.

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,280
But I haven't finished my training yet.

161
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,920
I haven't shown my beauty

162
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,120
to others.

163
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,320
I have to protect this face.

164
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Yes.

165
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,520
I forgot to show my beauty

166
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
to others.

167
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,520
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,880
You can't afford to bully me.

169
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
What's up?

170
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,800
Don't you know the Ninth Festival?

171
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,000
Come with me to see the festival.

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,320
The Ninth Mountain has been in this state for ten years.

173
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,720
Even the four priests

174
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,120
have gone to the mountain.

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No.

176
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,760
Are you worried that people will see you?

177
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,800
Although you couldn't leave the valley before you were eighteen,

178
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,720
I've prepared a magic pot for you.

179
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,760
We just need to go up the mountain

180
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,200
and take a look at it.

181
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,360
No one will notice us.

182
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
No need.

183
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,400
You just laughed at me.

184
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,200
If you don't hide,

185
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,320
how can I pretend to be a tree?

186
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Besides,

187
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,480
why should I pretend to be you?

188
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,880
I just want to distract you

189
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,480
and let you have a good rest.

190
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
But you treat me as a donkey.

191
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,440
I know you practice hard

192
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,920
to go out and pick up your mother.

193
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,360
But because of the rain,

194
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,880
you can't see any girl before eighteen.

195
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,640
You can only stay in the valley of the Ninth Mountain.

196
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,400
But it's still early.

197
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,600
Don't rush to make a move.

198
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,200
Take your time.

199
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Give it back to me.

200
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,040
You...

201
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,880
You can only say two words, right?

202
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,000
I knew you were a stupid.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,400
You saved my life three days ago.

204
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,480
I wouldn't have followed you.

205
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
It's too late.

206
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,240
You little servant.

207
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,280
I'll find a way to get back.

208
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,440
I don't believe I can't get you.

209
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,840
Chong Ming, thank you.

210
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,920
Your Grace,

211
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,440
I have a question.

212
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,480
Which of the nine mountains

213
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,240
has the highest magic of the divine official?

214
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,480
There are the divine official and the divine servant.

215
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm only a divine servant.

216
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,160
Only the divine official can practice magic.

217
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,560
The divine official is divided into four levels

218
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,040
with high magic power.

219
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,000
They are

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,360
the disciple, the horse,

221
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,240
the air, and the life.

222
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,400
The one with the highest magic power

223
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,880
is the chief priest of the ceremony.

224
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,600
How powerful is the chief priest?

225
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,640
No one has ever seen

226
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,440
how powerful the chief priest is.

227
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,680
It's said that he can control the wind and rain.

228
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,520
He can control the wind and rain?

229
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,040
He's so powerful.

230
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,920
Does he know the magic of re-establishing the body?

231
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,520
I've never heard of it.

232
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,720
How can there be such a magic

233
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,920
that can change the destiny?

234
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,160
These days,

235
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,840
I feel sorry for you and the little princess

236
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,280
to stay here for a while.

237
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,840
Thank you.

238
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,680
Chi Song,

239
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,520
ask them to move the things in.

240
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,640
Don't worry, Your Grace.

241
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,800
Your Grace,

242
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,400
I have a question.

243
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,320
The magic of the nine mountains

244
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,000
has been around for thousands of years.

245
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,840
Is there any ancient magic

246
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,480
that can break the secret of Yin and Yang?

247
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,880
Have you heard of it

248
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,000
when you practiced here?

249
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,240
The so-called life and death are predestined.

250
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,640
It means

251
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,000
that people's lives are predestined.

252
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,120
Greetings, Chief Priest.

253
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Go ahead.

254
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,760
Greetings, Chief Priest.

255
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,680
If you forcefully break the Yin and Yang

256
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,000
and break the heaven's law,

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,360
it's a great skill for a person who practices the magic.

258
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,480
How can there be anyone

259
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,280
who can practice such a magic?

260
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,320
Greetings, Chief Priest.

261
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,720
Why are you so sure?

262
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,640
You said that no one else can do it

263
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,040
if you can't do it.

264
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,560
My Lady,

265
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,640
can't you be modest?

266
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,720
Because of such a question,

267
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,680
I have answered it

268
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,760
more than a hundred times.

269
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,200
It seems that Princess Zhu Yan

270
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,000
is a curious person.

271
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,240
Then I will remind you

272
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,680
that the nine mountains are dangerous

273
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,440
except for the place where you live and the place where you worship.

274
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,680
You can't break in

275
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,640
anywhere else.

276
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Especially the Valley behind the mountain

277
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,760
is the spirit of the empress of the past generations.

278
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,400
It's the forbidden area.

279
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,960
There are the gods and beasts of the harem

280
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,920
of the Empress Bai Wei.

281
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,840
There are also the gods and beasts of the ten thousand bones

282
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,800
of the harem of the past generations.

283
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,680
Those who break in will never come back.

284
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,400
Chief Priest.

285
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,680
I'm here to see

286
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,880
if you are used to living here.

287
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,840
Yes, I am.

288
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,960
Chief Priest, please.

289
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,200
My Lady.

290
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,880
Forget it.

291
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,800
I'd better give up.

292
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,680
Is what Chief Priest said

293
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,760
really true?

294
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,880
No.

295
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,000
The highest-ranking people

296
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,840
are all living in seclusion.

297
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,720
Although

298
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,240
Chief Priest is the best in magic,

299
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,280
I don't think

300
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,360
there is anyone better than him.

301
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,840
My Lady.

302
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,320
Why don't you listen to anyone?

303
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,520
There must be some great people

304
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,720
in the Nine Mountain.

305
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,920
I will find them.

306
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
So that's it.

307
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,720
Although it's a water of no value,

308
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,400
if you want to succeed in magic,

309
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
you need to be quick-witted.

310
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,320
Please remove this object

311
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,720
from the water.

312
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Yes.

313
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
I will do it.

314
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
I will do it.

315
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
I will do it.

316
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
I will do it.

317
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
I will do it.

318
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
I will do it.

319
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Please send this object

320
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
to the Kunyun Palace of Jialan

321
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
and hand it over to the Queen of White Smoke.

322
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
I will consume this object.

323
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
The voice that was

324
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
echoed in the fire

325
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
will be repeated.

326
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Mother.

327
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,720
I really miss you.

328
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
I will definitely

329
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
come back to you

330
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
when I am eighteen.

331
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Something big happened!

332
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Something big happened!

333
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Something big happened!

334
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
I am ruined.

335
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
Look!

336
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Zhong Min.

337
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Your face...

338
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Is it very serious?

339
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
If you don't treat it,

340
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
it will heal.

341
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Yin Qing Ren.

342
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
What kind of attitude is this?

343
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Don't you know

344
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
that for thousands of years,

345
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
how many people have been

346
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
jealous of my face?

347
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
In the past,

348
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
which god

349
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
has been written by the gods?

350
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Which god has been

351
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
written by the gods?

352
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Which god has been

353
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
written by the gods?

354
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
None.

355
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
So,

356
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
the beauty of the sky

357
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,720
cannot have any flaws.

358
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
I understand.

359
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Then,

360
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
what should I do?

361
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
My wound

362
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
is caused by the tree branches.

363
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
So,

364
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
I need to take

365
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
one white ginseng,

366
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
one purple ginseng,

367
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
two half-wild grass,

368
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
half a piece of bright silk,

369
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
and then absorb it

370
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
to turn into blood.

371
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
I understand.

372
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
I will have it now.

373
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
And,

374
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
I will also

375
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
take three purple Hanye

376
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
and two jade flowers

377
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
and then absorb it

378
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
to turn into blood.

379
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Purple Hanye and jade flowers

380
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
are all grown

381
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:55,980
on the top of the

382
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,980
I don't know.

383
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,980
I don't know.

384
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,980
I don't know.

385
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,980
I don't know.

386
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,980
I don't know.

387
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,980
I don't know.

388
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,980
I don't know.

389
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,980
I don't know.

390
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,980
I don't know.

391
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,980
I don't know.

392
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
I don't know.

393
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,980
I don't know.

394
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,980
I don't know.

395
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,980
I don't know.

396
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,980
I don't know.

397
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,980
I don't know.

398
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,980
I don't know.

399
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,980
I don't know.

400
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
I don't know.

401
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,980
I don't know.

402
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,980
I don't know.

403
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,980
I don't know.

404
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,980
I don't know.

405
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,980
I don't know.

406
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,980
I don't know.

407
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
I don't know.

408
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,980
I don't know.

409
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,980
I don't know.

410
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,980
Miss,

411
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,980
the Wangxing Shi of the Lingwu

412
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,980
is the princess of the Bai family.

413
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,980
You two have been close since you were little.

414
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,980
This time we can

415
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,980
chat a little

416
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,980
and talk about the old and the new.

417
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,980
Look.

418
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,980
That's an ancient bird.

419
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,980
It's the Chongming that

420
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,980
Chief Disi told us about.

421
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,980
Chongming?

422
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
There seems to be

423
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,980
another person

424
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,980
on the back of Chongming.

425
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,980
Person?

426
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,980
What's wrong?

427
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,940
The person who can control the bedrock

428
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,540
must be an expert.

429
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,980
I must follow him.

430
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,540
My Lady, the medicine is going to be taken.

431
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,660
I can't go in.

432
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,740
My Lady, come back.

433
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,220
My Lady,

434
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,460
I'll wait for you.

435
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,460
Come back quickly.

436
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,980
It doesn't work.

437
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,540
King James is important.

438
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,260
How dare you barge through?

439
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,820
Bite the pretty girls with yourDOCK?

440
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,820
Sir, do you need some help?

441
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
Order a meal for the group.

442
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,820
You can have a taste.

443
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,820
The view is great.

444
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
It's not as good as the one in Jiuyi Mountain.

445
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
Sir,

446
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
your guest room service...

447
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,820
Order a hotel for the group.

448
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
You can have a good time.

449
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
Your throat hurts, it's itchy, it's itchy.

450
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
Your throat is not good.

451
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,820
The royal family wants to know.

452
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,820
The royal family wants to know.

453
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,820
They want you to continue watching the Yugu Yao.

454
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,820
I saw it flying up just now.

455
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,820
Where could it be?

456
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,820
Chong Ming and Gao Ren are gone.

457
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,820
Only you, little white bird.

458
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,820
Little white bird,

459
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
you're so cute.

460
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,820
Why are you hurt?

461
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
Let me help you.

462
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,820
Don't be afraid.

463
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,820
There are hundreds of little white birds like you

464
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,820
that I saved.

465
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,820
They can survive in the desert.

466
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,820
You're in Jiuyi Mountain.

467
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,820
You need to be stronger.

468
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,820
Come on.

469
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,820
Why are you so rude to me?

470
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,820
Come back.

471
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,820
Where are you going?

472
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,820
So you're not a little white bird.

473
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,820
You're a Chong Ming god bird.

474
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,820
You know I'm Chong Ming?

475
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,820
You're so smart.

476
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,820
Chong Ming god bird,

477
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,820
you're over 9000 years old.

478
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
It's written in Yunhuang Book of Wutang.

479
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,820
Chong Ming is known for its double-headed eyes and double-spirited body.

480
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,820
It's as strong as a phoenix and has a silver-like name.

481
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,820
It flies for nine days and falls down five hills.

482
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,820
It can take the world's white grass and return to spring with its beautiful hands.

483
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,820
It's as powerful as a tiger and has a fierce body.

484
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,820
It can take the world's white grass and has a fierce body.

485
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,820
You're so smart.

486
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,820
You're over 9000 years old.

487
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,820
You're so smart.

488
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,820
You're a Chong Ming god bird.

489
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,820
Mr. Chong Ming,

490
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,820
do you have a master?

491
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,820
I don't have a master.

492
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,820
Mr. Chong Ming,

493
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,820
I was just talking to you.

494
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,820
I was wondering if you have an immortal friend

495
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,820
who you've been training with.

496
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,820
So,

497
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,820
can you show me around?

498
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,580
Do you know her?

499
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,360
You never know your 15th year.

500
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,880
But you do say negative things with good eyes

501
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,640
as my practice

502
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,180
used to be.

503
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,100
You are hot-arthed and

504
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,740
still endure struggle?

505
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,080
Choumin,

506
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,420
you are so dirty!

507
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,840
Blow off the

508
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,580
mud.

509
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,960
Lord Chongming

510
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,380
what were you doing

511
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,900
killing the catfish

512
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,580
It's also mentioned on the Qiongución papayas

513
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,700
albumen

514
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,620
I believe you.

515
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,660
Your Highness, where are you?

516
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,300
Your Highness.

517
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,700
I'm here.

518
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,380
Your Highness, come back.

519
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,660
Madam Jiao Fang said

520
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,980
she would cancel your dance

521
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,700
if she didn't see you

522
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,860
within an hour.

523
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,940
It will be bad for His Highness.

524
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,340
Lord Chong Ming,

525
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,460
I'll take my leave.

526
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,940
See you next time.

527
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,100
Your Highness.

528
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,660
Your Highness.

529
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,780
That girl is so talkative.

530
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,740
She just left

531
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,460
after I gave her a test.

532
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,460
She's so insincere.

533
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,500
Who are you talking about?

534
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,180
She's just a girl

535
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,140
who doesn't know anything.

536
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,660
By the way,

537
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,180
she asked me about you.

538
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,660
Me?

539
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,900
It's so pretty.

540
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,980
Yeah.

541
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,340
Amazing.

542
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
So pretty.

543
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,860
She looks like a fairy.

544
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,180
She's so pretty.

545
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,300
Princess Jiao Fang is so pretty.

546
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,940
She should be Wang Xing Shi.

547
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,340
Yeah.

548
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,900
Wang Xing Shi.

549
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,900
Wang Xing Shi.

550
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,940
Wang Xing Shi.

551
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,980
Wang Xing Shi.

552
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,140
Wang Xing Shi.

553
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,260
So pretty.

554
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,500
So pretty.

555
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,460
Yeah.

556
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
So pretty.

557
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,460
Your Highness.

558
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,140
Your Highness.

559
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,380
This is a dance of the first year of the 10th year.

560
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,660
The princess of other families

561
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,420
wants to dress up

562
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,780
with ten fingers.

563
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,500
You're so...

564
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,700
The Wang Xing Shi of Lingwu

565
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,460
are said to be the legitimate daughter of the Bai family.

566
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,060
Xue Ying is the only legitimate daughter of the Bai family.

567
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,500
Why do they

568
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,460
call Bai Xue Lu Wang Xing Shi?

569
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,660
Princess Xue Lu is a virgin,

570
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,140
but everyone praises her for her talent.

571
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,620
They want her to perform a song

572
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,660
before Princess Xue Ying.

573
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,540
But when Princess Xue Lu jumped,

574
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,900
everyone was convinced.

575
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,340
What convinced?

576
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,740
I think

577
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,220
Bai Xue Lu scolded them

578
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,180
and made a fuss on purpose

579
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,460
to embarrass Xue Ying.

580
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,420
Xue Ying is my friend.

581
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,620
But she was bullied

582
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,980
by her sister

583
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,780
because of this.

584
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,340
Where is Xue Ying?

585
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,620
So pretty.

586
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,780
So pretty.

587
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,660
So pretty.

588
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,940
Wang Xing Shi.

589
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,860
Wang Xing Shi.

590
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,780
Xue Ying is Wang Xing Shi.

591
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,020
Wang Xing Shi.

592
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,460
Xue Ying is Wang Xing Shi.

593
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,380
My Lady.

594
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,940
You've been waiting for a long time.

595
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,820
I heard your warm calls.

596
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,500
Thank you, Bai Xue Lu,

597
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,020
for warming up the stage for Princess Xue Ying.

598
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,620
Xue Ying.

599
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,060
Come here.

600
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,620
A Yan.

601
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,260
Sit.

602
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,780
No.

603
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,660
It's okay.

604
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,460
A Yan.

605
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,540
Xue Ying.

606
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,420
Don't be afraid.

607
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,620
You can do it.

608
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,980
I believe you.

609
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,260
Come on.

610
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:51,980
Pros persecutor sent

611
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,060
The role of Lady Ne'er is so nice.

612
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,100
Great.

613
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,140
Innowat !!

614
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,820
Safe!

615
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,420
What is off,

616
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,020
is a ritual dance.

617
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,180
It's also called the ritual god dance.

618
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,220
A heart

619
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,020
needs to be lowered into the dust.

620
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,860
Only communicate with the gods

621
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,700
and not communicate with others.

622
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,500
With the intention of this,

623
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,020
the dance moves naturally flow.

624
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,460
Princess Xue Ying

625
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,780
has truly understood

626
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,460
the meaning of this dance.

627
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,340
It's really Xue Ying!

628
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,540
Xue Ying!

629
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,060
Great!

630
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,820
Yan, thank you!

631
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,380
Xue Ying!

632
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,100
Xue Ying, you're so cool!

633
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,700
Great!

634
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,860
Kong Sang fell to the ground.

635
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,140
Qinghai Dasi Pujang is preparing to forget the evil great enemy.

636
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,420
Your Excellency,

637
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,020
the human force has been gathered.

638
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,700
Great!

639
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,420
The most important thing is to defend the Jiuyi Mountain at this time.

640
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,860
You must use this opportunity to sneak into the Emperor's palace

641
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,220
and find the backland god realm for me.

642
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,180
Yes.

643
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,500
As long as I get the value of the backland god realm,

644
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,340
this will be your last ritual.

645
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,620
Ten years later,

646
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,180
the dance will be performed again.

647
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,300
Your Excellencies,

648
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,140
the next day problems started.

649
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,140
�

650
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,700
Happy new moon there.

651
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,020
What's this?

652
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,140
These are the unc discharge seals.

653
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,660
Look.

654
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,740
So beautiful!

655
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,820
My mother was still trying on it

656
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,220
that made her find Seungю

657
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,420
and then pressed me.

658
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,540
Bai Xue Lu,

659
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,740
what are you doing?

660
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,780
Yan,

661
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,380
don't be so petty.

662
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,620
You can finish

663
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,900
my sister's dance group.

664
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:36,980
I can't

665
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,460
touch my sister's dance group.

666
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,540
Princess Xue Lu,

667
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,420
don't call me Yan.

668
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,220
We're not close.

669
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,900
All right, Zhu Yan.

670
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,620
You don't have to

671
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,220
diss me.

672
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,140
I just saw

673
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,780
Xue Ying's dance.

674
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,700
I just realized that

675
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,580
I'm not as good as Xue Ying

676
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,420
in terms of dance.

677
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,980
I just want to see your dance group.

678
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:01,940
I want to see

679
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,500
how I look like in the dress.

680
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,540
Is that okay?

681
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:06,860
Yes.

682
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,940
Sister, please have a look.

683
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,820
I heard that when the sun

684
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,140
shines on this kind of chrysanthemum,

685
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,100
it will turn into a bright color.

686
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,580
Is it okay now?

687
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,660
It is,

688
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,860
I know.

689
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,620
Sister!

690
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,900
Your Highness.

691
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,500
Your Highness.

692
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,300
Are you all right?

693
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,940
Wu Jun.

694
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,980
My Wu Jun.

695
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
Wu Jun.

696
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,020
What should I do now?

697
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,220
Wu Jun.

698
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,020
Wu Jun.

699
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:36,980
Yan.

700
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,060
What should I do?

701
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,340
Bai Xun Luo.

702
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,940
You did it on purpose.

703
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,380
How could I do that?

704
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,180
I was about to fall.

705
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,580
Yan.

706
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,300
I was careless.

707
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,700
I was still

708
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,140
blaming myself for not keeping the crown and Wu Jun.

709
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,380
You...

710
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,780
There are many dead bodies under the mountain.

711
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,300
Those who break in will die.

712
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,500
If Wu Jun falls,

713
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,460
he will never be found again.

714
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,580
Even the Wu Jun is gone.

715
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,100
What should we wear then?

716
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,940
Wu Jun is hard to complete in a short time.

717
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,940
It's a joke to

718
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,540
just find a piece of clothes.

719
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,620
Besides,

720
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,180
it's not a big mistake

721
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,780
to lose Wu Jun.

722
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,900
We can't even finish the Wu Jun we gave him.

723
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,860
How can we trust him to be the Wu Jun?

724
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,420
Princess Xue Ying.

725
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,020
Mo Mo.

726
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,780
According to the rules,

727
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,620
you are indeed a Wang Xing Shi.

728
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,980
But they are not right.

729
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,940
According to the rules,

730
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,380
if you lose the Wu Jun of the Sheng family,

731
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,180
you will lose the right to show your dance to the gods.

732
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,860
If you can't think of a solution

733
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,220
before the ceremony starts,

734
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,180
then you will have to

735
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,620
change your position.

736
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,940
Okay.

737
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,300
Xue Ying.

738
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,860
Mother.

739
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,420
You wake up now.

740
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,420
I must help Xueying

741
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,420
find Wuju.

742
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,420
The star stone is already in the bag.

743
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,420
When it's time to attract the stone,

744
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,420
it's easy for you to take it.

745
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,420
Why don't you feel happy?

746
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,420
Is that girl Xueying stupid?

747
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,420
She really tried her best

748
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
to pull me out.

749
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,420
Are you soft-hearted?

750
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,420
Before going up the mountain,

751
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,420
you didn't even

752
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,420
let me go.

753
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,420
I didn't even let you go.

754
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,420
Before going up the mountain,

755
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,420
you must get it.

756
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,420
She is the legitimate daughter of the Bai family.

757
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,420
She was born to be the first choice

758
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,420
of the Crown Princess.

759
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,420
But you are...

760
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,420
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

761
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,420
I was wrong.

762
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,420
I won't be soft-hearted.

763
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,420
Get up.

764
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,420
Get up.

765
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,420
That girl has been in the palace for a long time.

766
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,420
Kong Sang's position is vacant.

767
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
Father is also worried

768
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,420
about the future of the Bai family.

769
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,420
If one day,

770
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,420
I become the Crown Princess Consort,

771
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,420
and I am the second one,

772
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
who will dare to

773
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,420
think about my background

774
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,420
at that time?

775
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,420
ώς

776
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,420
Consort Yu.

777
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,060
Consort Yu.

778
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,140
Consort Yu.

779
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,620
This ink is really useful.

780
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,780
This woman is not a good talker.

781
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,060
She is a secretive person.

782
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,420
She only knows how to talk.

783
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,460
She doesn't do anything.

784
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,220
She is really despicable.

785
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,380
Really?

786
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,820
But I think this woman

787
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,780
is quite capable.

788
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,300
She can make you think about it

789
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,220
from the moment.

790
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:42,820
Xiao Yin Za.

791
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,980
You sure

792
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,380
respect her?

793
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,700
None.

794
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,140
My beautyudding liquid!

795
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,580
Oh no, oh no.

796
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:54,860
Hurry up.

797
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,180
so...

798
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,660
The Dawaεται!

799
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,780
Magistrate Da once said

800
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,820
Especiael the Dawaitchens in the back mountain

801
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,940
are the spirit of empress in the past great generations.

802
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,020
Let whiteyyarch

803
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:58,500
lead the

804
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,920
liability of posturon

805
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,220
from the capital into

806
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,320
the country

807
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,020
without regret

808
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,500
I've been to the Underworld math送建场的。

809
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,820
How can it be this scary?

810
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,860
Also,

811
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,900
isn't the Walker of Rhy Carney

812
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,320
a guardian for the empty

813
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,060
room?

814
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,700
Any place in the world

815
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,080
that has its name can be created by using curse.

816
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,060
I don't believe

817
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,580
a eleven- citizen can die.

818
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,620
Please.

819
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,820
Please, my lords.

820
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,820
Who's there?

821
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,020
I can't see.

822
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,140
I can't see.

823
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,260
I can't see.

824
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,540
The flowers are so beautiful.

825
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,420
Madam,

826
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,380
what's wrong with the flower?

827
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:23,700
I heard the most magnificent

828
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,860
ENcircling River in please

829
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,740
was named convention star in the King of King's Valley.

830
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,020
As possible

831
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,740
it must be the river analyse.

832
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,500
Where is the centenal star

833
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,800
["eki o Konstane"]

834
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,400
Wu Quan.

835
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,040
What?

836
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,420
This is the Auspicious Fl spring Lake?

837
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,660
It's a jade seal's hair!

838
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,020
Dear immunity,

839
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:36,960
you live inside the

840
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,540
You must be the former friend of the Choumian Goddess.

841
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,300
I finally found you.

842
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,540
So she is the woman

843
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,540
mentioned by the Choumian Goddess.

844
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,900
I am Zhu Yan,

845
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,020
the princess of the Chis.

846
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,380
I am also a magic person.

847
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,620
I am your colleague.

848
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,180
Zhu Yan?

849
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,260
Didn't Zhu Yan meet the little princess

850
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,300
of the Chis in the River Garden?

851
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,620
I want to ask

852
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,780
if there is a magic

853
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,060
that can bring back the spirit

854
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,980
in this world?

855
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,140
Her love for magic

856
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,460
hasn't changed at all.

857
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,820
Why doesn't she talk?

858
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,260
Is she

859
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,500
not good at speaking?

860
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,220
I'm just confused.

861
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,380
How do you know this?

862
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,340
Gosh,

863
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,620
she can't listen to me.

864
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,500
Such a pity.

865
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,160
She looks so great

866
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,500
with aesthetics.

867
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,020
But the Crown Prince is different.

868
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,460
Everyone says, he is anadas milksская.

869
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,460
He will understand my thoughts.

870
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,460
You haven't changed.

871
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,460
Smart bird, you can become a human.

872
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,460
You meet a girl?

873
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,460
Is she yours?

874
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,460
What am I?

875
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,460
Kill her!

876
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,460
I am a human.

877
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,460
I am a human.

878
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,460
I am a human.

879
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,460
I am a human.

880
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,460
I am a human.

881
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,460
I am a human.

882
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,460
I am a human.

883
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,460
I am a human.

884
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,460
I am a human.

885
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,460
I am a human.

886
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,460
I am a human.

887
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,460
I am a human.

888
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,460
I am a human.

889
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,460
I am a human.

890
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,460
I am a human.

891
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,460
I am a human.

892
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,460
I am a human.

893
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,460
I am a human.

894
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,460
I am a human.

895
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,460
I am a human.

896
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,460
I am a human.

897
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,460
I am a human.

898
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,460
I am a human.

899
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,460
I am a human.

900
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,460
I am a human.

901
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,460
I am a human.

902
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,460
I am a human.

903
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,460
I am a human.

904
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,460
I am a human.

905
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:44,460
By your side

906
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:50,460
Your heart is like a flower

907
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,460
Your heart is like a flower

00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:04,460
Your heart is like a flower

00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,460
Your heart is like a flower

911
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:28,460
Your heart is like a flower

912

Your heart is like a flower

916
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,460
Your heart is like a flower
