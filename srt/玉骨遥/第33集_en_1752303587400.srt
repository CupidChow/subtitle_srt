1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,980
The

2
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,980
The

3
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,980
The

4
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,980
The

5
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,980
The

6
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,980
The

7
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,980
The

8
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,980
The

9
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,980
The

10
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,980
The

11
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,980
The

12
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,980
The

13
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,980
The

14
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:22,980
The

15
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,980
The

16
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,980
The

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,980
The

18
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:07,200
To avoid scattering fragments and

19
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:14,740
reminiscing old times

20
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,980
Juan Happy

21
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,700
Who is it?

22
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,780
Me!

23
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,100
What?

24
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,940
General Qin doesn't welcome me?

25
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,620
Of course not!

26
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,100
Well,

27
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,460
come on, Please.

28
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,980
I'm a princess of the Bai Clan.

29
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,900
I can't care about military affairs.

30
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,140
Didn't you tell me that

31
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,420
I should be persistent

32
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,580
in some matters?

33
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,820
I also want to help the war.

34
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,980
Do you think I'm a girl?

35
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,380
Of course not.

36
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,580
Didn't Zhu Yan also take the position of Xia Cheng?

37
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,460
He didn't live up to the name of the general, Zhu Feiyan,

38
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,260
and served the country as a girl.

39
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,980
Xue Luo, you can do it too.

40
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,980
I'm not afraid of anything.

41
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,540
I'm just a little afraid.

42
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,580
Zhu Yan, Zhu Yan.

43
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,220
You've been with him

44
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,620
on Mount Jiuyi.

45
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,980
You've already retired.

46
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,460
You still talk about him.

47
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,460
Are you really

48
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,020
thinking about him?

49
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,900
Actually, I...

50
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,660
Actually, I've been

51
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,500
reading the military books

52
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,260
whenever I think of what you said.

53
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,900
Can you tell me

54
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,220
about the war with the Jiao Clan?

55
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,860
What do you want to hear?

56
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,660
Let's start from here.

57
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,300
Why did you

58
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,620
set up the camp at Dragon King Temple?

59
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,380
The current

60
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,180
suddenly changed.

61
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,900
There must be something wrong

62
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,540
when you set up Dragon King Temple.

63
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,420
Everyone has it's reasons.

64
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,780
This is all because I don't want it to take over.

65
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,580
My family

66
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,180
ain't their houses.

67
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,300
Do you bare to

68
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,220
drag soldiers into

69
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,860
those cases of communism and Through All zones?

70
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,980
Especially you.

71
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,880
You haven't

72
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,340
when they attack you.

73
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,260
That's not true.

74
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,140
Xue Lu,

75
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,620
do you really want to do this?

76
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,380
Answer my question first.

77
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,300
Of course.

78
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,180
Of course I can.

79
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,660
Then,

80
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,100
if I did

81
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,460
a lot of wrong things before,

82
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,860
you don't mind?

83
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,980
No.

84
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,140
Then close your eyes.

85
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,540
Xue Lu.

86
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,460
I really cannot believe it.

87
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,420
Really a beauty.

88
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,620
General Qin,

89
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,460
you didn't check the body with Noble Consort Ling before?

90
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,700
Thank you.

91
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,380
I'll leave now.

92
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,140
Wait.

93
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,820
I have something for you.

94
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,420
This is my family's treasure.

95
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,020
Please take it.

96
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,780
Since it's an ancestral item,

97
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,180
General Qin

98
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,740
can't just hand it over to others.

99
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,580
You'd better be careful.

100
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,700
If I had been in the battlefield,

101
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,140
I would have been in trouble.

102
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,660
I hope you are the last master of this jade pendant.

103
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,860
General Qin,

104
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,860
there are military items in the temple.

105
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,900
Xun Luo,

106
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,180
when the war is over,

107
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,500
I'll go and ask your father for advice.

108
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,660
Thank you.

109
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,780
Shao Si Ming.

110
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,700
I'm leaving.

111
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,460
Looks like Xue Lu has done it.

112
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,180
This woman is a member of the Sea King.

113
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,820
Take this painting to Zhang Tian in the city.

114
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,500
If you can find her,

115
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,500
you can lure the ball

116
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,260
and find out where the Sea King is.

117
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,100
Okay.

118
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,620
Shao Si Ming,

119
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,900
didn't you sign the alliance with the Sea King

120
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,740
to start the war?

121
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,740
Why didn't you just draw the person who is the Sea King?

122
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,220
It seems that

123
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,860
Shi Yu doesn't want us to know

124
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,060
the appearance of the Sea King.

125
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,740
He must have some secrets to hide.

126
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,780
If I find out about this,

127
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,940
it will be a big problem.

128
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,780
You know her?

129
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,180
She is so bold.

130
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,540
If I find her,

131
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,460
I will not let her off easily.

132
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,660
Shao Si Ming,

133
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,740
I'll send someone to Zhang Tian

134
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,060
to search for her.

135
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,580
Okay.

136
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,860
But,

137
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,580
don't alert her.

138
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,980
I'll go and find her.

139
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,580
Okay.

140
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,060
I'll go and find her.

141
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,580
Okay.

142
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,180
I'll go and find her.

143
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,580
Okay.

144
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,580
I'll go and find her.

145
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:16,780
Okay.

146
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,580
I'll go and find her.

147
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,740
The person who broke the secret of the Iron Sleeve

148
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,100
is the subject of the Sea King.

149
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,580
If I catch the Sea King myself...

150
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,860
Why are you still here?

151
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,860
I'm telling you.

152
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,380
Master.

153
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,660
I'm going to meet Ruyi today.

154
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,360
Don't use these

155
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,380
to repudiate me.

156
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,020
Yes.

157
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,380
No matter how precious she is,

158
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,580
she is just a demon.

159
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,580
I have a lot of money.

160
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,020
Today,

161
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,580
don't argue with me.

162
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,580
I have to see what kind of

163
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,860
a man Ruyi is.

164
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,580
I'm going to see her.

165
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,580
I'm going to see her.

166
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,580
I'm going to see her.

167
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,580
I'm going to see her.

168
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,580
I'm going to see her.

169
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,580
I'm going to see her.

170
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,580
I'm going to see her.

171
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,580
I'm going to see her.

172
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,580
Qing.

173
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,580
Arrange for the members of the court

174
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,580
to leave my room immediately.

175
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
This is the first list.

176
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,580
These people have received

177
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,580
the most information

178
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,580
in the past years.

179
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,580
But it's the most dangerous here.

180
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,580
It's a total of twenty-seven people.

181
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
What about you?

182
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,580
After you all leave,

183
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
I'll leave.

184
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
After all, Ruyi is the

185
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,580
sign of the Star Sea Court.

186
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,580
If it disappears,

187
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,580
it will surely

188
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,580
cause the alarm of the Kongsang Army.

189
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,580
Go.

190
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,580
Yes.

191
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,580
Brother.

192
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,580
We can finally

193
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,580
go back to the Bilo Sea together.

194
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,580
Come and play.

195
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,580
Come and play.

196
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,580
Come and play.

197
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,580
Come and play.

198
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,580
Come on.

199
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,580
Come on.

200
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,580
Come and play.

201
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,580
Young Master.

202
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,580
Come and play.

203
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,580
Come on.

204
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,580
Come on.

205
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,580
Come on.

206
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,580
Young Master.

207
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,580
Come and play.

208
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,580
Come and play.

209
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,580
Isn't this Young Master Bai?

210
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,580
Bai... General Bai.

211
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,580
Young Master Bai.

212
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,580
You...

213
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,580
What are you doing here?

214
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,580
What do you think?

215
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,580
Young Master Bai.

216
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,580
What are you doing?

217
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,580
How dare you steal Ruyi from me?

218
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,580
Ruyi is a loser

219
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,580
who is a servant of the King of Chu.

220
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,580
I'll kill you.

221
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,580
Everyone, let's go.

222
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,580
Let's go.

223
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,580
Be careful.

224
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
I'm fine.

225
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,580
Let's go.

226
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,580
Come back safely.

227
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,580
Okay.

228
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
Let's go together.

229
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,580
Ruyi.

230
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,580
Be good.

231
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,580
Ruyi, Bai Feng Ling is here.

232
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,580
She sent someone to surround the Bilo Sea.

233
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
What should we do, sister?

234
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,580
It's okay.

235
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,580
You guys keep retreating.

236
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,580
Don't make a fuss.

237
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,580
Go.

238
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,580
Let's go.

239
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
Sister.

240
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
Ruyi, get up.

241
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,580
Hurry.

242
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,580
Ruyi is mine.

243
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,580
Yours?

244
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,580
What about me?

245
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,580
General Bai.

246
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,580
Is that enough?

247
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,580
Enough.

248
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,580
General Bai, please give us a minute.

249
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,580
I'll go and invite Ruyi to come.

250
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,580
You guys wait here.

251
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
Ruyi.

252
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,580
I'll go and invite Ruyi.

253
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,460
General Bai, please wait for a moment.

254
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,380
I'll go and get Miss Ruyi now.

255
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,300
No need. I know where she is.

256
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,420
General Bai, don't worry.

257
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,980
Miss Ruyi, she...

258
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,340
She...

259
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,180
She's not feeling well today.

260
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,300
Then I should go and see her.

261
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,580
Ruyi! Ruyi!

262
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,580
Ruyi! Ruyi!

263
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,580
Ruyi! Ruyi!

264
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,580
Ruyi, I'm fine.

265
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,580
Sorry to keep you waiting.

266
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,580
Ruyi,

267
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,580
there are too many people here.

268
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,580
Why don't we go to your room?

269
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,580
All the young masters here today

270
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,580
are all high-ranking officials.

271
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,580
They came from far away

272
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,580
and are willing to help Ruyi.

273
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,580
I want to give them a song

274
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,580
to express my gratitude.

275
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,580
As the General of Ye City,

276
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,580
you won't be willing to

277
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,580
leave this place to everyone, right?

278
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,580
Good! Good!

279
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,580
Good!

280
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,580
Doppler

281
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,060
Hurry up! Hurry up!

282
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,020
crowd

283
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,180
Quick

284
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,700
Hurry up.

285
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,220
Hurry up.

286
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,220
Hurry up.

287
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,100
Hurry up.

288
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,100
What's going on?

289
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,820
Hurry up.

290
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,820
Hurry up.

291
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,300
Hurry up.

292
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,100
Hurry up.

293
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,820
Hurry up.

294
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,980
Good.

295
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,340
Purple Cleaner Mountain is just perfect!

296
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,360
Good.

297
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,900
Ruyi is so talented.

298
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,740
Take this.

299
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,980
Wait, wait.

300
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,860
You can't possibly hirerate me.

301
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,500
Your Majesty.

302
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,500
Who are you?

303
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,820
The banner times.

304
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,980
How do you become a traitor?

305
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,920
Ru Yi.

306
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,880
As long as you let us know

307
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,900
where theお酒 peoples of Haihuang are,

308
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,300
I don't have the courage

309
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,380
to destroy it.

310
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,140
What is this love war

311
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,500
where you stick your heart out

312
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,220
every time you introduce it to me?

313
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,500
A secretly stung Haorong.

314
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,460
How dirty are you?

315
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,940
It楚minian.

316
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,860
Is it trying to use you

317
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,220
You're a coward!

318
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,380
Who do you think you are?

319
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,380
Bai Feng Lian,

320
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,820
if you don't kill me today,

321
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,380
I'll let everyone know

322
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,300
what you've done for all these years.

323
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,220
I'm sorry.

324
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,300
Ruyi,

325
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,540
you want to die now,

326
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,740
but I have a thousand ways

327
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,900
to make you live a life worse than death.

328
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,420
All these years,

329
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,380
you've been struggling in the mud

330
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,540
for your clan.

331
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,060
You're too tired.

332
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,740
Tell me all your secrets.

333
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,500
Let go of all this,

334
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,900
and you'll be free.

335
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,900
No!

336
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,940
Tell me!

337
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,620
Tell me!

338
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,460
Let her go!

339
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,620
equals the respond that rushes over.

340
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,980
Listen to me.

341
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,540
I'm a bit tired.

342
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,740
Remember your face,

343
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,340
or I'll predCL okay about it.

344
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:22,020
You're not the best at다고

345
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,500
You'll be alright.

346
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,180
I didn't confirm that he is Ruyi.

347
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,340
So I came here...

348
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,020
Leave.

349
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,940
Young Minister is a kind and generous person.

350
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,140
If the King of Kongsang has such a fierce mind like you,

351
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,380
how can he be so unruly with our clan?

352
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,980
How dare you mess with Consort Xiao?

353
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,740
It's your clan's treachery.

354
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,580
You don't know what to do.

355
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,220
Young Minister is an immortal.

356
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,260
How can he see a coward like Bai Fenglin

357
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,500
who dares to kill our clan?

358
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,820
I have nothing to say about this.

359
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,740
But Young Minister saved me today.

360
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,660
It's reasonable that Ruyi should be executed.

361
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,020
So,

362
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,220
I want to tell you a big secret.

363
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,780
Hurry up and tell me where the King of the Sea is hiding.

364
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,940
I want to tell you

365
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,340
the story of the cut of Qiushui.

366
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,220
Qiushui,

367
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,460
I have an important task for you.

368
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,660
The former King of Qin,

369
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,220
I ordered you to sneak into the North Emperors' Palace

370
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,860
and use your beauty

371
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,940
to capture his heart.

372
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,500
But you have to know that

373
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,580
you have to be with the King of the North Emperors for life

374
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
until you die

375
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,220
before you can return to the Bilo Sea.

376
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,780
Elder, don't worry.

377
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,540
Qiushui has been prepared

378
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,740
to do everything for the clan.

379
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,420
You can stay here.

380
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,500
The Star Sea Cloud Pond is the largest information network

381
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,380
of the Sea Kingdom in the Empty Cemetery.

382
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,300
It has also been providing us with

383
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,740
endless funds and information for our restoration.

384
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,020
The Empty Cemetery people made you lose your father,

385
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,780
brother and lover.

386
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,300
You are here

387
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,540
to take another way

388
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,300
to avenge them.

389
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,100
Can you do it?

390
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,380
Yes.

391
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,580
Okay.

392
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,180
Elder.

393
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,340
You reallyadiated

394
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,420
theáwhole years notice has been left on scheduleH's cuts.

395
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,420
Qiushui did not drop his mission

396
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,700
and obey me.

397
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,540
Good.

398
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,340
Then try to get rid of his legitimate son,

399
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,980
Shi Ying.

400
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,260
Well...

401
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,180
Why?

402
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,460
Shi Ying is a talented man.

403
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,740
If he succeeds in the future,

404
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,580
our Fu State will be in a more difficult situation.

405
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,380
So, take advantage of the situation

406
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,940
and get rid of him as soon as possible.

407
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,300
What are you hesitating about?

408
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,140
If you can't kill him,

409
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,660
you have to think of a way

410
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,420
to make the Northern Burmese Emperor lose his trust

411
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,980
and get rid of his legitimate son.

412
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,300
Remember,

413
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,140
this is a great achievement.

414
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,540
It can only be achieved.

415
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,180
Yes.

416
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,380
In this way,

417
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,100
Qiu Shui has been with the Northern Burmese Emperor for many years.

418
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,940
Finally,

419
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,940
he has completed his mission with his life.

420
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,260
So, Qiu Shui is the spy

421
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,660
of the Imperial Army.

422
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,260
Qiu Shui's sacrifice is worth it.

423
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,420
If you are still the Crown Prince,

424
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,500
then the Imperial Sangha

425
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,140
won't be so ungrateful as now.

426
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,860
If the Imperial Sangha hadn't been so cruel,

427
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,900
why would the Emperor of the Sea

428
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,540
come back to save the Imperial Kingdom?

429
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,420
I'll take you to the Emperor

430
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,180
and tell him everything.

431
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,220
You can guess

432
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,700
why I'm

433
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,780
mentioning this now.

434
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,260
Shao Siming,

435
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,700
when you were listening to me,

436
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,660
I covered my memory

437
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,900
with a dream.

438
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,980
Shao Siming,

439
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,100
I've forgotten

440
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,500
everything now.

441
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,140
If he can't wake up,

442
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,220
he'll be in danger.

443
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,500
What's the point of protecting his heart?

444
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,580
He has been willing to

445
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,940
hide in the mud for so many years

446
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,260
and collect intelligence.

447
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,300
He's just a hard-working man

448
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,980
used by the Imperial Army.

449
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,220
Besides,

450
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,500
he's just a piece of paper now.

451
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,140
If he can survive,

452
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,020
he'll be a piece of paper.

453
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,900
He's just a piece of paper.

454
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,580
He's just a piece of paper.

455
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,140
He's just a piece of paper.

456
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,260
Let him go.

457
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,500
You're always thinking for others.

458
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,420
But he's lost his memory.

459
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,860
Who else can prove

460
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,820
your mother's innocence in front of His Majesty?

461
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,340
Innocence?

462
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,180
In fact, he knew everything

463
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,100
in his heart.

464
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,460
But in order to maintain

465
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,140
his dignity and love

466
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,860
in front of the people,

467
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,100
he wronged us.

468
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,180
So,

469
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,220
the one who killed my mother

470
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,940
was not Qiu Shui,

471
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,860
but the Northern Burmese Emperor.

472
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,660
In front of such a father

473
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,380
and His Majesty,

474
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,900
even if I can find the evidence,

475
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,620
what can I do?

476
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,580
I've been working for thousands of years.

477
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,580
I've seen many people

478
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,780
who are so single

479
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,940
and care for the country.

480
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,100
But fortunately,

481
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,780
you're not like him at all.

482
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,540
I...

483
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,740
It's a pity that I'm not a woman.

484
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,980
Otherwise,

485
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,220
if I had competed with Qiu Shui in the palace,

486
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,660
I would have won the heart of the Northern Burmese Emperor

487
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,220
and asked him to take good care of you.

488
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,700
Chong Ming,

489
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,300
I'm not the child

490
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,300
who was emotional at that time.

491
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,380
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

492
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,700
Now the priority

493
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,140
is to catch Hai Huang.

494
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,420
Nothing is more important

495
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,060
than this.

496
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,820
But how can we catch him?

497
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,660
Hai Guojun of the Star Sea Cloud Pond

498
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,500
should not be alone.

499
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,540
And Ruyi is very important

500
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,860
among the Jiao people.

501
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,820
I think

502
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,900
someone should have notified Hai Huang

503
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,620
about our movements.

504
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,420
But Zhiyuan may not be willing to risk his life.

505
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,140
I've seen Zhiyuan

506
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,620
and saw his eyes.

507
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,140
Your Excellency Hai Huang.

508
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,620
I'm here for Hai Huang.

509
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,460
Okay.

510
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,620
Feel free sleep.

511
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,300
There is nothing good

512
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,020
fororum about Ruyi's court pass.

513
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,300
It may make her Toutai following them around.

514
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,540
His Excellency has wise words to don't do this to her.

515
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,460
What could happen

516
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,700
could happen?

517
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,660
Why does Gu several days ago

518
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,900
Why hasn't she come back yet?

519
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:50,820
My Lord.

520
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,540
Miss Ruyi was trapped

521
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,700
in the Star Sea Cloud Pavilion by the Kong Sang Army.

522
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Star Sea Cloud Pavilion?

523
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,780
Yes.

524
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,260
How did Ruyi...

525
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,180
My Lord.

526
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,220
Miss Ruyi has been

527
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,900
the person in charge of Sea Soul Spring for years.

528
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,220
She collected information about Kong Sang

529
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,380
in the Star Sea Cloud Pavilion.

530
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,700
Today,

531
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,860
she went to cover up for the members of Sea Soul Spring.

532
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,220
I failed to protect Miss Ruyi.

533
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,380
Please punish me.

534
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,660
In the end,

535
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,940
it's my fault as her brother.

536
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,820
I failed to take care of her

537
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,940
for so many years.

538
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
I'll bring her back.

539
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,780
My Lord, don't act on impulse.

540
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,060
My Lord.

541
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,820
There is a secret passage

542
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,740
under the Star Sea Cloud Pavilion.

543
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,380
It leads to Ruyi's room.

544
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,980
That secret passage

545
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,060
leads directly to

546
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,020
the entrance of the Bilo Sea,

547
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,820
Sea Soul Spring.

548
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,180
That's why

549
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,220
the Star Sea Cloud Pavilion

550
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,420
was selected to be there.

551
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,580
For a few days,

552
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,140
Master and I

553
00:29:52,300 --> 00:30:10,360
has been

554
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,500
crime-stricken for many years.

555
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,060
I wonder if it's solved.

556
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,980
My Lady,

557
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,100
you asked me to find out the news every day.

558
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,620
I got this today.

559
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,980
The army of Kong Sang is catching this person.

560
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,180
Isn't this...

561
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,060
Isn't this An Yuan's sister?

562
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,820
My Lady, do you know her?

563
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,220
Who wants to catch her?

564
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,860
The army of Kong Sang?

565
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,060
It should be Shao Si Ming.

566
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,980
It seems that

567
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,980
things are not getting better.

568
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,580
It's worse instead.

569
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,540
If I had been wronged in the battlefield,

570
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,300
I hope you would be the last master of Zhen Mei's jade pendant.

571
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,580
It's you.

572
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,340
Qing Gang.

573
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,060
He's such a fool.

574
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,060
If you knew that I lied to you,

575
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,060
you would have been in trouble.

576
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,260
Will you give it to me?

577
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,900
A woman like me

578
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,860
who is too busy to care about others,

579
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,260
I hope you won't look at me too much.

580
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:27,820
My Lady.

581
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,380
Princess Zhu Yan is here.

582
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,060
Let her in.

583
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,060
Xue Lu.

584
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,940
I have an urgent matter to see my master.

585
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,500
What urgent matter?

586
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,940
I'm here to see him

587
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,300
not for this matter.

588
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,700
It's about whether

589
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,460
this matter is related to the stoppage of the war.

590
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,060
If you know where he is,

591
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,260
please let me know.

592
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,180
Didn't Zhu Yan also take the position of subordinate?

593
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,820
He didn't live up to the name of the general of the Flying Eyes.

594
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,020
He didn't serve the country as a woman.

595
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,620
Xue Lu.

596
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,940
You can do it too.

597
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,260
He went to the star sea and the cloud pavilion

598
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,900
and pretended to be a sea king.

599
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,420
Star sea and cloud pavilion?

600
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:13,940
Okay.

601
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,060
Thank you.

602
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,700
The transparent noticed me!

603
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,060
A man in a real man's clothes

604
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,860
is wearing a expensive clothes.

605
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,040
Is he a soldier in an army

606
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,140
andare usually

607
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,060
wearing those high heels?

608
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,100
The guards' wife has a weird head.

609
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,620
Why is the Princess here?

610
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,980
Good.

611
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,740
Good.

612
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,060
Nice.

613
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,060
It seems that they are really soldiers.

614
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,660
This place has been controlled by the Kongsang Army.

615
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,660
Zhu Yan, why are you here?

616
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,460
Qing Gang, help me.

617
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,660
I have something important to see my master.

618
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,060
What is it?

619
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,660
I have something important to see my master.

620
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,460
Princess Zhu Yan likes to make

621
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,660
some requests that are hard for others.

622
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,460
The last commander is interrogating the flower ghost Ruyi here.

623
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,260
He specifically told me

624
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,660
not to disturb anyone.

625
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,460
Qing Gang,

626
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,860
I really have something important to see my master.

627
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,660
Please, I beg you.

628
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,060
I and General Qing

629
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,460
all want to help you.

630
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,460
But you don't know what interrogation is, do you?

631
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,860
This is a serious matter.

632
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,660
Usually, when an interrogation is done,

633
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,860
the prisoner is so angry.

634
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,460
In this situation,

635
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,060
can I let you go in easily?

636
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,460
My master

637
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,660
can't be so cruel.

638
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,860
Is it cruel?

639
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,660
I don't know.

640
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,860
It's not cruel.

641
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,060
It depends on how anxious the Minister of War is.

642
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,660
Now the Minister of War is anxious to know about the news of Hai Huang.

643
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,660
I'm afraid that this cruelty

644
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
is far above what I think.

645
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,660
You're talking nonsense.

646
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,060
If you don't let me in,

647
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,660
I'll break in.

648
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,860
Zhu Yan.

649
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,460
Don't be impulsive.

650
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,260
It's a big deal for the Minister of War.

651
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,060
General Bai,

652
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,860
the Minister of War really doesn't see anyone?

653
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,460
I've made it clear

654
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,660
what the Minister of War means.

655
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,860
Princess Zhu Yan is still entangled in this.

656
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,460
Do you think

657
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,460
you're different from the Minister of War?

658
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,460
Okay.

659
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,460
I'll go out.

660
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,660
Yan Er.

661
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,460
Come up.

662
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,460
We're not in Hai Huang.

663
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,260
But Zhu Yan is in a hurry to ask for an interview.

664
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,060
Is there anything between Hai Huang and Zhu Yan?

665
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,460
Shi Ying didn't show her appearance at that time.

666
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,460
Is it to protect Zhu Yan?

667
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,460
Master.

668
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,460
Where's Ruyi?

669
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,060
Did you catch her?

670
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,260
Yan Er.

671
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,660
You came here for this.

672
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,260
Last time in Xialan,

673
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,460
I told you not to care about it.

674
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,460
Master.

675
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,060
I can't watch you and Yuan fight.

676
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,860
Master.

677
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,060
Zhu, why are you here?

678
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,060
I'm watching you. I didn't see anyone.

679
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,060
Come.

680
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,060
Master.

681
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,660
Master.

682
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,060
I just saw someone.

683
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,860
All soldiers,

684
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,660
report to Qing Gang and Bai Peng Ling.

685
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,060
Hai Huang has appeared.

686
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,660
He's surrounded by the stars.

687
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,260
Zhu Yan.

688
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,660
Don't let him escape.

689
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,060
Ruyi.

690
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,260
It's my fault.

691
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,060
I didn't take good care of you.

692
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,860
I won't let you suffer anymore.

693
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,260
I'm here for Hai Huang.

694
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,860
Ruyi.

695
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,060
Yuan.

696
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,660
Yuan.

697
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,060
Are you okay?

698
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,260
Yan Er.

699
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,460
Why are you here?

700
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,060
Don't get involved.

701
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,660
Yuan, it's okay.

702
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,660
I'll explain to master.

703
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,660
Zhu Yan.

704
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,860
Do you know what you're doing?

705
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,260
Master.

706
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:40,660
Yuan.

707
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,260
I think you're too angry.

708
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,660
But you must have guessed

709
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,660
that it was Master Jian who did it last time.

710
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,460
Yuan has killed Master Jian.

711
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,460
He's trying to

712
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,460
get the Haikou Army to withdraw from everywhere.

713
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,860
So you're just

714
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,660
misunderstanding.

715
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,060
Misunderstanding?

716
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,460
You called the lives of so many people

717
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,060
a misunderstanding?

718
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,460
But

719
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,260
the culprit is not Yuan.

720
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,460
Okay.

721
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,860
Then I'll tell Hai Huang

722
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,460
why I want to kill him

723
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,860
in front of Hai Huang today.

724
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,060
So he won't die in vain

725
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,060
and you won't be mad at him.

726
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,060
In order to gather information,

727
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,060
Ruyi is willing to be in the place of firework

728
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:46,320
and be in the

729
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,520
Master.

730
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
Back then,

731
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,120
Qiu Shui was a singer.

732
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,720
But he heard that the Crown Prince

733
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,720
was the talented one of Kong Sang,

734
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,320
he wanted to enter the palace

735
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,120
and challenge the world.

736
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
In the end,

737
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,120
he killed himself to destroy the Crown Prince.

738
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,120
And at that time,

739
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,520
he was already eight months pregnant.

740
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,920
I'm telling you this

741
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,920
not because of personal grudges,

742
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,120
but because I want you to know

743
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,120
how strong these dead soldiers of the Navy

744
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,720
can be for the so-called restoration.

745
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,720
As long as Hai Huang is alive,

746
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,120
they won't give up on destroying Kong Sang.

747
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,120
And the agreement shows

748
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,520
Hai will destroy Kong Sang

749
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,320
within seventy years.

750
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,720
So Hai Huang must die.

751
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,120
Once the war starts,

752
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,920
if you want to stop,

753
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,320
it's not up to us.

754
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,320
It's a war between the two countries.

755
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,320
Someone must come out and take responsibility.

756
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,320
This person is me,

757
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,520
Hai Huang.

758
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,520
I and Young Commander's decision today

759
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,520
are my due responsibility.

760
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,520
You'd better leave now.

761
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,120
The prophecy says that the blood of the Ghost King will destroy Kong Sang.

762
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,520
But it's hard to predict.

763
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,520
The things in the prophecy

764
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,920
may not happen.

765
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,920
How can you kill an innocent person

766
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,920
with the blood of the Ghost King?

767
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
Master,

768
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,520
I know you're the one who's wronged.

769
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,520
You're innocent.

770
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,720
Even if the world doesn't understand,

771
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,920
you must understand.

772
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,920
Shut up.

773
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,920
How dare you

774
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,320
compare me to the Sea Emperor of the Jiaozu?

775
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,120
Zhu Yan,

776
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,520
do you know

777
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,720
what you've done

778
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,720
to the Chizu clan?

779
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Step aside.

780
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
Step aside.

781
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,920
No.

782
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,720
No.

783
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,720
Master,

784
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,320
don't kill Yan.

785
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,320
I'm begging you.

786
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,920
Step aside.

787
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,320
I won't.

788
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,520
Qing, leave now.

789
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,720
No.

790
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,320
Master,

791
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,720
as long as I'm here,

792
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,120
I'll protect you.

793
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,920
I won't let you kill Yan.

794
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:12,920
Zhu Yan,

795
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,520
did you listen to me?

796
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,720
I did.

797
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,720
Then why are you so stubborn?

798
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,920
Step aside.

799
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,720
Because...

800
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,120
Because...

801
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Because I like Yan.

802
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,320
So in Yan's heart,

803
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,120
the one he's always liked

804
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,120
is Zhiyuan.

805
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,920
What did you say?

806
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,720
So I'm the one

807
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,320
who did all these.

808
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,720
The thread at the end of your heart

809
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,520
has dared to lock my soul

810
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,520
Lock the chain of my feet

811
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,520
and stay by your side

812
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,920
The thread at the end of your heart

813
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,120
has dared to lock my soul

814
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,120
The thread at the end of your heart

815
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,720
has dared to lock my soul

816
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,120
The thread at the end of your heart

817
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,320
has dared to lock my soul

818
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,920
The thread at the end of your heart

819
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,520
has dared to lock my soul

820
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,920
The thread at the end of your heart

821
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,920
has dared to lock my soul

822
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,920
The thread at the end of your heart

823
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,920
has dared to lock my soul

824
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,920
How could we meet

825
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,920
How could we meet
