1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,060
owane restrictions.

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
I want to be with you

3
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,640
for the rest of my life

4
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,280
I want to be with you

5
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,920
for the rest of my life

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 16

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Princess

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yuan

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How dare you insult the princess?

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Father, it's not my fault

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's all my fault

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This marriage is a high-class marriage

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I didn't expect the princess

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
to be so shameless

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She is a slave

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let's call it a day

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Your highness

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Stop it

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You can't call me Yuan

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
In my eyes

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm a slave

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I heard that the leader of the Chis

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and a low-ranking Jiao man

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
went to the extreme

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Lord Chiwang

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You rejected our marriage

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
because of a low-ranking Jiao slave

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you kill her

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
we can save her

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and restore the good of our two tribes

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, your highness

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He's right

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Kill her

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Kill her, your highness

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Father

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Kill them, your highness

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I rejected the marriage

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
because I don't want to marry

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
someone I don't like

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It has nothing to do with Yuan

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So what if they are Jiao people?

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In my eyes

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Jiao people are more noble

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
than you, the arrogant people

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What are you talking about?

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What are you talking about?

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How can you say that?

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We are the most powerful

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
in the world

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's so ridiculous

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Jiao people are more powerful

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Your highness

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There must be some misunderstanding

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yuan

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I want to share this bead

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
for you

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Kong Saoran

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
has reincarnation

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
reincarnation

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You must wait for me here

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You must wait for my return

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
We looked up at the sky

73
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,680
with tearful eyes.

74
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,120
But when I audio this note,

75
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,120
I lost myself.

76
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
An milestone to be aniant?

77
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,440
We shallWait for us.

78
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,360
You must

79
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,840
take care of my members

80
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,400
and wait for me to come back.

81
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,040
Fine!

82
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,520
I'll wait until you turn around.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes.

84
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,480
The wine house is gone.

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,240
Yan'er is the reincarnation of the medicine doctor.

86
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,320
Yuan.

87
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,280
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,880
I don't know what happened.

89
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,400
The beads are gone.

90
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,120
You bitch!

91
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,360
Your Highness.

92
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,640
You...

93
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,320
Yan.

94
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,960
What did you do to my daughter?

95
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,640
Guards.

96
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,120
Tie her up.

97
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,200
Yes.

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Don't come.

99
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,520
Try to touch her.

100
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,560
Tie her up.

101
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,240
Tie me up first.

102
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,800
How dare you!

103
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,920
Xiaoxi.

104
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,000
You're finally back.

105
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,520
You've been

106
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,440
by my side all the time.

107
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,080
You're home.

108
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,280
I'll kill you today.

109
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,600
I don't want to!

110
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,320
It was all my fault.

111
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,000
I was too sad to give Yuan

112
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,360
such a confirms him

113
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,360
as a father figure.

114
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,200
It'll be so horrible if he sees it wrong.

115
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,960
How dare you to plead with him?

116
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,800
How dare he

117
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,120
bestow hisðŸ’¡ made to you?

118
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
How could you

119
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,280
make such a ridiculous idea

120
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,520
How could you do such a dirty thing?

121
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,760
Get out of my way!

122
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,000
Let me kill this bitch first

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,280
and then I'll discipline you!

124
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,880
A Yan!

125
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,120
A Yan!

126
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Mother, please save me!

127
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,600
A Yan!

128
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,840
Your Highness,

129
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,640
Chief Steward Yuan

130
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
is a man who has done great work for the Chis.

131
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,320
Father,

132
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,680
just let him be

133
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,760
taken care of by the Chis

134
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,440
and taken care of by generations.

135
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,840
That's all.

136
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,840
Let him leave the Chis' Mansion right now.

137
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,200
I'll spare his life!

138
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,160
No, father!

139
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,880
A Yan is badly injured now.

140
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
How could you drive him away now?

141
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,120
You...

142
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,760
Your Highness!

143
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,600
Yan,

144
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,280
are you trying to kill your father?

145
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,040
Father...

146
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,680
Don't you understand?

147
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,480
If you don't let him go,

148
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,560
how will things end up today?

149
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,040
Everyone blames you for

150
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:43,100
laboring and sweating for

151
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
your internal expenses.

152
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,680
I don't know what it is,

153
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,200
but it's definitely not a monster.

154
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Father.

155
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,520
Your Highness,

156
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,120
don't say anymore.

157
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,920
What happened today

158
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,960
must be settled.

159
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,600
A'Yu.

160
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,400
As the chief of Chifu,

161
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,960
I failed to protect you

162
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,040
and ruined your reputation.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,160
I failed to make you happy.

164
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,440
The marriage between the Chijing and Liang clan was ruined.

165
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,760
I failed to make Wang Yan happy.

166
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,160
I failed to make Chifu happy.

167
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,560
I...

168
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,280
I don't deserve to be the chief.

169
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,360
I was the chief of the Chizu clan for two hundred years.

170
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,400
But I didn't expect

171
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,760
I would cause a disaster for the Chizu clan.

172
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,080
I have no face to face with you.

173
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,800
I just hope after I leave,

174
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,120
you won't

175
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,240
make it hard for me anymore.

176
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,560
I

177
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,120
bid you farewell.

178
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,880
A'Yu.

179
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,640
Father.

180
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,520
Father.

181
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,720
I'll leave it to you.

182
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,920
A'Yu.

183
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,760
A'Yu.

184
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,360
Chifu.

185
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,280
Father.

186
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,000
Your Highness.

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,640
A'Yu.

188
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,400
A'Yu.

189
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:19,920
Father.

190
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,520
Let me go.

191
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,200
A'Yu.

192
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,240
Your Highness.

193
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,000
A'Yu.

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,680
It was a clear and clear proof

195
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,040
that the lover loved you.

196
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,000
She didn't forget her promise.

197
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,440
No matter if it was a lie.

198
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,320
A'Yu.

199
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,600
A'Yu.

200
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
A'Yu.

201
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,720
Your Highness.

202
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,720
Your Highness.

203
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,240
A'Yu.

204
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,720
Even if you're not happy,

205
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,480
you can still pursue your dream.

206
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,480
You'll be with her forever.

207
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
If the world is moving,

208
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,880
we'll fall in love again.

209
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:08,560
One day, we'll be in a dream.

210
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,420
Thank you, An tightly

211
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,500
likes lover.

212
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,860
Eh,

213
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,260
Please do it.

214
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,660
The five powers

215
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,500
have all given birth.

216
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,160
Didn't we listen your girlfriend's words?

217
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,800
I...

218
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,180
I still can't believe that

219
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,360
she would give him her heart.

220
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,100
She definitely

221
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,220
one day!

222
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,900
Never!

223
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,380
Serving Heaven's Will

224
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,020
Well, that was over two hundred years just now.

225
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,740
Everyone wanted me to be test by them

226
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,860
but they all kept staying by my side.

227
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,740
Now Jiuwu

228
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,940
has finally admitted you.

229
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,020
My demon spirit

230
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,340
is finally back.

231
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,940
Come on.

232
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,340
That way.

233
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,900
That way.

234
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,540
Get up.

235
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,100
Be careful.

236
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,180
Are you okay?

237
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,180
I'm scared.

238
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,860
I'm afraid you'll be late.

239
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,380
I'm so tired.

240
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,260
You can't die.

241
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,620
You're so badly injured.

242
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,900
Lie down.

243
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,620
What's your name?

244
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,380
I'm the City Leader of Tianji Peak.

245
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,740
I'm the Chizhu Feili.

246
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,780
You can call me Yaoyi.

247
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,620
What should I call you?

248
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,380
I remember someone called me Yuan.

249
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,180
I don't remember anything else.

250
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,260
Are you a demon?

251
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,340
Maybe.

252
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,060
Maybe not.

253
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,500
I don't remember.

254
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,140
Since you forgot your past

255
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,860
in the battlefield

256
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,820
and met me,

257
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,460
you won't do anything

258
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,500
evil in the next life.

259
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,100
From now on,

260
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,420
you can call me

261
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,220
Chiyuan.

262
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,700
How about that?

263
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,120
You want to tell me

264
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,660
about my most powerful emptyå„€.

265
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,420
If you call me master,

266
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,700
you'll know who I am.

267
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,500
Master.

268
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,900
Okay.

269
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,100
If you take me as your master,

270
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,260
remember my edict.

271
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,220
Those who break into Tianji Beating Sect

272
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,300
will be brought to hell

273
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,620
in the next life.

274
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,680
They'll die

275
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,140
of killing the empty limited infinity thunder

276
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,300
and the ice tribe.

277
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,260
ÐºÐ¾Ð½ sermon

278
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,700
Nocan topic

279
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,500
I'll avenge you.

280
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,420
and

281
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
take advantage of the situation.

282
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,860
The reason I refused

283
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,060
the proposal of the Xuan Clan

284
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,900
is because I don't want to marry

285
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,020
someone I don't like.

286
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,740
It has nothing to do with Yuan.

287
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,220
If you kill her,

288
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,940
our Xuan Clan can still

289
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,980
forget about it

290
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,980
and start over.

291
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,940
She's right.

292
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,940
Kill her.

293
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,140
Kill her, Your Highness.

294
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,820
She's just a lowly

295
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,940
and unknowing woman.

296
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,940
How can she be so unruly?

297
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,740
The poison that was put in her body

298
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,740
has been with her all the time.

299
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,860
Yuan,

300
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,700
are you all right?

301
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Yuan,

302
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,900
you've split up.

303
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,220
I brought you here today

304
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,020
to let you make a choice.

305
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,620
I secretly took it away.

306
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,380
I knew

307
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,100
you're not an ordinary Jiao.

308
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,940
When I first saw you,

309
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,940
I...

310
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,140
I took you as my disciple

311
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,940
and gave you a lucky star.

312
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,180
I did it to make you look kind

313
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,100
and to keep you by my side.

314
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,260
Yuan,

315
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,620
I really don't want to marry you.

316
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,620
I don't want to marry you.

317
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Yuan,

318
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,260
aren't you being too selfish?

319
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,660
I don't care

320
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,060
who you were in the past.

321
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,540
If you choose

322
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,700
to return to Chifu,

323
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,660
even if you have to go through

324
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,660
a lot of hardships,

325
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,180
I will accompany you.

326
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,980
But you know that

327
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,100
a person's life is more important than his life.

328
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,780
I'm destined to be with you forever.

329
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,260
If you can't let go of the past,

330
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,900
and want to return to your clan,

331
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,820
I won't stop you.

332
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,380
I know

333
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,380
that we will have a hard time in the future.

334
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,860
But I still want to be with you.

335
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,860
Since

336
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,900
you've made your choice,

337
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,140
I should do mine too.

338
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,060
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,420
I shouldn't have let you go.

340
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,020
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,260
I shouldn't have let you go.

342
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,980
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,980
I'm sorry.

345
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
I'm sorry.

346
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,980
I'm sorry.

347
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,980
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
I'm sorry.

349
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
I'm sorry.

351
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,140
Yaoyi.

352
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Yaoyi.

353
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,980
Yaoyi.

354
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,220
Yaoyi.

355
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,020
Promise me

356
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,420
to protect my clan

357
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,660
and wait for me to come back.

358
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,660
I'll wait for you to turn around.

359
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,220
Before we meet again,

360
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,060
A'Yuan,

361
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,700
please forget about me.

362
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,980
No!

363
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,140
God won't let me down.

364
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,660
I won't let you down.

365
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,180
Yaoyi,

366
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,180
from now on,

367
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,660
no matter how hard it is,

368
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,980
I'll always be by your side.

369
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,540
A'Yuan,

370
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,660
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,660
I'm sorry.

372
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,660
I'm sorry.

373
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,660
I'm sorry.

374
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,660
A'Yuan,

375
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,660
forgive me for lying to you.

376
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,660
The spell I cast on the Ice Tribe

377
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,060
can't be transferred.

378
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,960
I can only use this

379
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
to heal the wounds on this stone

380
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,660
and let it be with you.

381
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Because I can't bear to leave you

382
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
and I'm afraid you'll be lonely.

383
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,660
Even if you can't remember our past,

384
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,660
it's okay.

385
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,660
I'll wait for you to remember it

386
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,660
and tell you gradually.

387
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,660
It's been 200 years.

388
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,660
Finally, someone

389
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,660
can let you go

390
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,660
and let go of your obsession with me.

391
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,660
I've been lucky

392
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,660
to have been able to steal these 200 years.

393
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
Now that the spider is broken,

394
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,660
I should leave too.

395
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
One day,

396
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,660
when everything is calm,

397
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,660
we'll be like before,

398
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,660
together and never apart.

399
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,660
I hope this life

400
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,660
can be with you

401
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,660
forever.

402
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,660
I'm not going to sleep.

403
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,660
I'm tired.

404
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,660
I can't fly anymore.

405
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,660
Why don't we

406
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660
go to a hotel and get a night shift?

407
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,660
We'll sleep tomorrow.

408
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,660
I'm tired.

409
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,660
I'm tired.

410
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,660
I'm tired.

411
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,660
I'm tired.

412
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,660
I'm tired.

413
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,660
I'm tired.

414
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,660
I'm tired.

415
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
I'm tired.

416
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
I'm tired.

417
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
Let's have a fight at the inn.

418
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,660
Let's go outside the city tomorrow.

419
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,660
There's an abandoned station

420
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,660
an hour away from the city.

421
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,660
We'll rest there today.

422
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,660
So that we can get to the Sun and Moon Lake

423
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,660
before it gets dark tomorrow.

424
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,660
I'm hungry.

425
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,660
I can't walk anymore.

426
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,660
It's important to hurry.

427
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,660
Are you afraid that you'll run into...

428
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,660
run into her, right?

429
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,660
Princess Chizu is so embarrassing.

430
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,660
She's so shameless.

431
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,660
Since ancient times,

432
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,660
only Chizu refused

433
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,660
the proposal of other tribes.

434
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,660
This time,

435
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,660
it's Qing's turn to refuse the proposal.

436
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,660
We don't know

437
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,660
the reason.

438
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,660
I heard that

439
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,660
she and her steward...

440
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,660
Shiyang, wait, Lao Feng.

441
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,660
Didn't you hear what they said?

442
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,660
They said that Yan...

443
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,660
It has nothing to do with me.

444
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,660
No.

445
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,660
Why are you always like this?

446
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,660
You clearly have her in your heart.

447
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,660
Why don't you admit it?

448
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,660
You're not talking.

449
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,660
I'm going to recommend you

450
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,960
to the Gu ranked

451
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,740
Suä¸€å®š

452
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,740
Keep that in mind.

453
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,660
How is Su Mo

454
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,660
these few days?

455
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,660
Queen Link Ðºoward.

456
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,660
Su Mo and I

457
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,660
have been doing well

458
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,660
in Hotubo.

459
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,500
I'm sorry.

460
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,820
Everything is fine.

461
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,380
Don't think that I don't know

462
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,540
that I've been bullying you

463
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,380
for so many years.

464
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,660
Sometimes, I've stopped you.

465
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,980
But sometimes, I still can't understand.

466
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,940
I've made you two suffer.

467
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,700
Your Highness, please don't say that.

468
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,660
We can have a peaceful life.

469
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,540
I'm already satisfied.

470
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,900
There's nothing to feel wronged about.

471
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,980
Su Mo should be

472
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,780
at the age to go to school by now.

473
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,780
Don't worry.

474
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,300
I'll arrange it well.

475
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,220
Let him study with the Royal Descendants of Huotu Tribe

476
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,780
and learn chess together.

477
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,540
There are many people

478
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,700
who are doing meritorious deeds in Kongcang.

479
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,940
As long as he can make a good start,

480
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,860
even if I'm gone one day,

481
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,100
you can rely on me

482
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,980
for the rest of your life.

483
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,020
Your Highness, you're old.

484
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,180
Why do you say such things?

485
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,220
What old?

486
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,540
People

487
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,420
are living well today.

488
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,460
Maybe tomorrow...

489
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,300
Your Highness!

490
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,020
Your Highness!

491
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,500
Your Highness!

492
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,220
Your Highness!

493
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,460
Yu Ji, you're really a bitch.

494
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,540
In order to please the old prince,

495
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,940
you ignored his age and physical weakness

496
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,020
and seduced him to be greedy

497
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,340
and died in a sudden.

498
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,300
You even said that it was a shadow killing.

499
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,220
There's no such thing as a shadow killing.

500
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,740
Guards!

501
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,180
Take him to the cellar!

502
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:27,940
Yes.

503
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:28,900
Wait!

504
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,700
This is the death-saving gold medal

505
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,380
that His Highness left me.

506
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,420
Death-saving gold medal?

507
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,660
Why didn't I see it?

508
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,900
Give it back to me!

509
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,180
Guards!

510
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,380
Let go of my mother!

511
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,300
Give it back to me!

512
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,860
Shut up!

513
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,620
Let go of me!

514
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:57,940
What's wrong?

515
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:58,740
Guards!

516
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,220
It's okay.

517
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,260
Take them away!

518
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,180
Let go of me!

519
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,100
Who dares to come up?

520
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,380
Go away!

521
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,260
I'll kill you!

522
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,860
Who dares to touch my mother?

523
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,940
I'll kill you!

524
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,900
Go away!

525
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,540
Don't touch my mother!

526
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,900
Who dares to come up?

527
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,700
Stop!

528
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,140
Tell us the truth.

529
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,300
You can go back now.

530
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,500
Alles.

531
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,220
There's no way out.

532
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,020
urokas.

533
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,140
Alliance harvest foundation.

534
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,820
é‚£ä¸ª recuerå½•çš„

535
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
trusting me!

536
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,740
That's it.

537
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,180
I'll go to find meeting you.

538
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,060
Hurry!

539
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,780
But

540
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,660
I have to tell you.

541
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,660
I can, this time.

542
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,700
Your Majesty is kind and reasonable.

543
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,300
Why don't you just follow

544
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,940
the King's filial piety?

545
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,620
Fine.

546
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,620
I'll agree to it.

547
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,180
But death is a sin.

548
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,540
Living is a sin.

549
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,620
Don't say a word

550
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,180
about this rumor.

551
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,260
Ke'er,

552
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,380
you don't have to beg for mercy.

553
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,060
Guards, take them away.

554
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:12,900
Yes.

555
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,700
Let go of me.

556
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,420
Let go of me.

557
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,180
Let go of me.

558
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,180
Let go of me.

559
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,060
It's not me.

560
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,780
Let go of me.

561
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,340
Let go of me.

562
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,460
Let go of me.

563
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,460
Great Wu Shi,

564
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,740
how are those Jiao people

565
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,660
being arrested?

566
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,900
Everything is ready.

567
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,140
They are just

568
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,180
in cahoots with Princess Chizu.

569
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,340
Prince of Chizu, take the imperial edict.

570
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,260
got it.

571
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,580
His Majesty,

572
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,060
the Emperor ofquar ships

573
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,180
is here to see

574
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,060
hoggles from the royal examination

575
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,700
Heyian of Shangshan.

576
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,580
Yellow-winged secured her royal throne.

577
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,460
Might is fair in Crystal and

578
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:12,400
full of rites and following

579
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,840
for deceiving His Majesty.

580
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,560
That's all.

581
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,280
I will obey.

582
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,880
My Lady.

583
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,440
My Lady.

584
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,680
His Majesty ordered you to marry into the Huotu Tribe.

585
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,880
My Lady.

586
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,200
Don't look at it anymore.

587
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,520
I'm so anxious.

588
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,680
If I knew it,

589
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,120
I would have married into the Qing Tribe.

590
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,840
That's the Huotu Tribe

591
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,640
that's in the desert,

592
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,120
surrounded by mountains and rivers.

593
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,880
Huotu Tribe?

594
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,680
Yes.

595
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,440
My Lady.

596
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,640
My Lady.

597
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,200
My Lady.

598
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,440
Consort Qing is a woman of her word.

599
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,160
She insisted on suppressing me.

600
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,200
She has already asked for the imperial decree.

601
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,800
If she doesn't obey,

602
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,680
it's a crime of deceiving His Majesty.

603
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,840
Yan'er.

604
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,160
How can you marry into that desert?

605
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,440
Is there no other way?

606
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,480
I will marry.

607
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,880
Father.

608
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,360
Mother.

609
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,040
I think

610
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,120
this marriage

611
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,480
is just my wish.

612
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,480
It suits me better than marrying into the Qing Tribe.

613
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,160
Huotu Tribe is my father's place of control.

614
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,760
If I marry into it,

615
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,440
I will be respected and honored.

616
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,480
Besides,

617
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,040
I've heard that

618
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,200
this King of Cork

619
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
really objects to what I say.

620
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,480
is more suitable for me.

621
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,600
You really want to marry me?

622
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,400
Mother,

623
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,040
if I really want to marry someone,

624
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,720
it's the most suitable one for me.

625
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,640
Besides,

626
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,080
I've been loved by my father and mother since I was a child.

627
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,760
In this world,

628
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,680
I can live without worries and be happy.

629
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,000
Now, the Chis is being destroyed.

630
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,280
My parents have worked hard.

631
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,560
As the princess of the Chis,

632
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,240
I should help my parents

633
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,600
and the Chis to separate and solve the problem.

634
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,400
My Yan has grown up.

635
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,560
You're beautiful.

636
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,120
Isn't my father beautiful too?

637
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,680
Please.

638
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,480
Nyahya Bunya Team.

639
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,400
Precious and distinguished.

640
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,440
Thanks, Leader.

641
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,000
Leader.

642
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,160
Have you found the records of does the Deity of Dem royal family?

643
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,400
The country of Cangliu will be under the control of the people.

644
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,440
You know the identity of the ruler.

645
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,480
Who is he to you?

646
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,440
We have the secret recipe given by the ruler.

647
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,680
We only need to use the blood of the child.

648
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,760
You are so heartless.

649
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,320
You can't stop the ruler.

650
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,920
No one can stop him.

651
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,400
He will be destroyed by his own hands

652
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,000
when he is in power.

653
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,280
He will never be able to stop it.

654
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,880
There is a evil spell

655
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,160
that can make the Immortal Immortality Pill.

656
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,880
Maybe he didn't become an immortal at all.

657
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,320
But...

658
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,080
Ying.

659
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,040
Shen Yan.

660
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,800
Don't forget your ancestors.

661
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,880
He is the founder of Kong Sang.

662
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,600
I hope I'm wrong.

663
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,920
I know you have a lot of doubts about the movement of the Ice Tribe.

664
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,800
But you can't be careless about the prophecy of the Jiao Tribe.

665
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:05,840
Yes.

666
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,280
The blood of the child is not yet ready.

667
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,080
We need to plan.

668
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,080
I found it in the file.

669
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,680
If the Sea Emperor and the Holy Mother of the Sea Kingdom

670
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,120
get along with the Dragon Blood Valley,

671
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
there will be a reaction.

672
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,280
If we can find the whereabouts of the Dragon Blood Valley,

673
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,360
we can definitely defeat the Valley of the Unrivaled.

674
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,040
Yufei.

675
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,800
I don't want that.

676
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,760
You don't need to bring it.

677
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,120
But isn't this what you use every day?

678
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,720
I usually use

679
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,840
something small, light and valuable.

680
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,720
I don't want to bring anything else.

681
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,640
But we have a whole team.

682
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,920
What's there to be afraid of?

683
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,240
If you don't bring anything else,

684
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
I'm afraid you'll suffer a lot when you get there.

685
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,600
Then...

686
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,040
You won't bring this either?

687
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,240
No.

688
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,120
Yufei.

689
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,640
I remember your hometown is also in the Huotu Tribe.

690
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,240
You've been away from home for so many years.

691
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,560
Do you miss home?

692
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,600
Maybe you can go back to your hometown

693
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,440
after you go to Huotu Tribe.

694
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,360
Miss.

695
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,400
Are you mad?

696
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,160
Why are you talking nonsense?

697
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,920
It's a pity that the map is too old.

698
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,640
The defense of the Huotu Tribe

699
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,560
has changed

700
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,400
for so many years.

701
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,240
Xueying.

702
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,880
I brought you here

703
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,280
to give you a thank you gift.

704
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,680
Thank you for not running away halfway.

705
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,440
Thank you for

706
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,240
always being with me.

707
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,920
Actually,

708
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,400
rather than saying that I'm with His Highness,

709
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,360
it's better to say that His Highness is with me.

710
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,240
No matter how difficult the future is,

711
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,640
I'm willing to try it with His Highness

712
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,160
if I don't experience hardships.

713
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,360
How can I know

714
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,760
that the scenery here is so good?

715
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,240
Since the scenery here is so good,

716
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,680
why don't you change your name?

717
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,320
It's...

718
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,880
It's Finko.

719
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,320
You're so beautiful.

720
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,280
I wrote this for you.

721
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,280
spontaneously.

722
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,760
Thank you.

723
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,680
So Jengyu,

724
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,040
Did you prepare this for me?

725
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,920
Your Highness.

726
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,680
Why did you call me Your Highness again?

727
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,440
Are you angry?

728
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,320
I'm sorry.

729
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,600
I was too nervous just now.

730
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,480
Next time, I will...

731
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,800
I will ask you first.

732
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,760
Next time?

733
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,280
When?

734
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,080
Your Highness, have a taste.

735
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,520
These are the dishes I've just developed.

736
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,520
I guarantee you will like them.

737
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,120
A while ago,

738
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,200
after Chief Steward Yuan left,

739
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,480
you stopped visiting our shop.

740
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,800
Otherwise, you would have been a fairy.

741
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,840
It's okay.

742
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,440
These dishes are all full of color, aroma and taste.

743
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,720
I like them very much.

744
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,520
It's a pity that

745
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,400
I won't be able to eat them anymore.

746
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
So it was true.

747
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:49,120
Her Ladyship is about to

748
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,400
marry Huo Tu Bu?

749
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,800
Then I'll offer myäº‹ to you first.

750
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,200
More pa...

751
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,200
More wine.

752
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,960
Here.

753
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,420
Since we are still in theager rumors,

754
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,740
anyone should go become a priest.

755
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,000
Xuan Ying.

756
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,320
Qingge.

757
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,020
Thank you for coming

758
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,100
this long to see me

759
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,580
as yourBLEB.

760
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,720
Xueying,

761
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,840
don't say that.

762
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,200
But Huotu is not far from here.

763
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,080
You don't have any relatives there.

764
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,000
I'm afraid you'll bully me.

765
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,960
Don't worry.

766
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,000
King Khorke is a good man.

767
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,840
Don't worry about me.

768
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,840
Take good care of yourself.

769
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,640
You're a righteous man.

770
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,040
You always look like a gentleman.

771
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,120
He's actually the most sincere man.

772
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,440
But he fell into Bai Xue Lu's hands.

773
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,680
I think

774
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,720
you should be more careful.

775
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,320
I'm afraid

776
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
he's lying to you and trying to kill you for him.

777
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,280
This is what I can't do.

778
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,160
Actually,

779
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,640
you're the one I'm most worried about.

780
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,640
You're soft-hearted

781
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,600
and easy to be bullied.

782
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,800
If you marry into the palace in the future,

783
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,880
you'll have a hard time.

784
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,760
If Consort Qing is hard on you,

785
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,520
don't hold back.

786
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,720
Tell Prince Shiyu

787
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,360
to help you.

788
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,160
What I'm telling you today,

789
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,840
you must promise me.

790
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,640
Okay?

791
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:43,960
Okay.

792
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,360
A Yan,

793
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,760
what are you doing?

794
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,800
You sound like we'll never see each other again.

795
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,040
How could it be?

796
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,160
I'm happy for you.

797
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,280
Look at you.

798
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,280
You have someone to love you with all your heart.

799
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,200
You have someone

800
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,840
to think about.

801
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,160
You're both happy.

802
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,960
Aren't you happy?

803
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,760
I'm happy.

804
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,760
I'm happy with you.

805
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,160
I'm happy with you.

806
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,960
By the way,

807
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,720
you can tell Shao Siming

808
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,600
about the marriage.

809
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,640
It doesn't matter

810
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,760
if I tell him or not.

811
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,920
I've sent him a wedding invitation

812
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,640
and invited him to drink with me.

813
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,360
It's a gift

814
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,160
for his wedding.

815
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,680
Okay.

816
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,680
Don't worry about me.

817
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,040
Come on.

818
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,880
Don't let down the good wine.

819
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,200
Fill it up.

820
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,800
Come on.

821
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,320
I should be happy on my wedding day.

822
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,600
Cheers.

823
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,360
A Yan.

824
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:09,640
Cheers.

825
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,880
You'll be happy.

826
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,000
Master.

827
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,840
Is that you?

828
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,840
When we got drunk that year,

829
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,240
your harem sent us back.

830
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,320
Now,

831
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,840
you won't come back

832
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,000
if you drink again.

833
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,800
You tell me.

834
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,240
You can't

835
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,080
do anything to me.

836
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,800
One,

837
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,880
We are never going to meet again.

838
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,880
But we still pretend to

839
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,040
say goodbye.

840
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,040
A'Yuan.

841
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,200
Is that you?

842
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,760
If I were to come back,

843
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,320
you would have left too.

844
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,960
I'm the only one left.

845
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,800
We are never going to meet again.

846
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,560
But we still pretend to

847
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,360
say goodbye.

848
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,360
But we still pretend to

849
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,240
say goodbye.

850
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,520
Love and hate are not clear.

851
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,280
But we still pretend to

852
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,960
say goodbye.

853
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,360
But we still pretend to

854
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,040
Ireland

855
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,640
No matter how you see it,

856
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,840
I can sprinkle tears to blow

857
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:15,240
In your heart

858
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:22,240
My heart is always by your side

859
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,240
The bottom line in your heart

860
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,240
You dare to lock my soul

861
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,240
The emotions can be broken

862
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,240
You and I just always miss each other

863
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,240
The bottom line in your heart

864
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,240
You dare to lock my soul

865
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,240
Lock the heart in my feet

866
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,240
I'm by your side

867
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,240
The bottom line in your heart

868
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,240
You dare to lock my soul

869
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,240
The emotions can be broken

870
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,240
You and I just always miss each other

871
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,240
How can we meet

872
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,240
How can we be famous
