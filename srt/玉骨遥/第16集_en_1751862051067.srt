Episode 16

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Sit down and eat together.

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Me?

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Is there anyone else here?

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's him.

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You actually...

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You actually chose this?

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I won't change it.

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Please give me your name and address.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm not sure.

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Master, do you think

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
something is wrong with it?

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Master, this is the magic weapon I chose.

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Ying,

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
this magic weapon is useless to you.

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You'd better put it back

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and choose another one.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This thing

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
can't be attacked

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and its biggest role

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
is to share the pain with others.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But the premise is

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that the other person has to be willing

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and connect with your spiritual power.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But this connection

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
requires you to risk your life

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and pass your half of your spiritual power

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
to the other person.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You think,

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
there's no one like this in this world?

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So that's how it is.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Master, didn't you save me

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
with your life

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and passed your spiritual power to me?

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This magic weapon is just right.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm willing to use this magic weapon.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Please give me your name and address.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Master,

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
you want me to play it by myself?

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Then I'll show my face.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll call you...

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Gongshang.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
How about Gongshang?

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Since the person who uses this magic weapon

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
wants to die with me,

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
it's like

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm with the sky

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and looking at the earth

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and I'm so excited.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm Gongshang.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The shining light

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
is like what's written in ancient books.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Gongshang, two stars,

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
one for each other.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The two stars are connected.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They look at each other.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They are more ancient.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The one who uses it

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
will live a long life.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Master,

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
what's the name?

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So you also

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
chose this magic weapon.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You even gave me the same name.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It seems that this magic weapon

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
is the destiny

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
between me and you.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I want this magic weapon.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Think about it again.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Do you think

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
it's embarrassing

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
to think of someone

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
who is so talented

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
as me?

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's not what I mean.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Is it because

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
you don't like this name

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
after a long time?

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's not what I mean.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Since you don't like the name,

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you don't like me

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
because of my rough name.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Could it be...

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Could it be that you don't want to admit

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that you are in love with me?

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Enough.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm about to close the door.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know how long it will take.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You should train yourself.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't bother me again.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Master,

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I know.

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The high mountains flow and the water rises.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Gongshang is inseparable.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
From now on,

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
you are my magic weapon.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
From now on,

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
it's the critical moment

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
for Shao Siming

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
to ascend the True Mirror.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I've already set up

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the Heavenly Trap.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm waiting for those

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
who are not evil to enter the dream.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
If Ying'er can

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
ascend the True Mirror

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and she can go back to Jialan,

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
everything will be ready.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm counting on you.

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
for her.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I've been in the empty for seven thousand years.

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Since I entered the True Mirror,

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
there's no one else.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I didn't expect

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that Shao Siming is so young

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
to be able to ascend the True Mirror.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm so impressed.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Remember.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Shao Siming's ascension of the True Mirror

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
is the secret of Mount Jiuyi.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't tell anyone else.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The wise man said

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Shi Ying is about to ascend the True Mirror.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's the weakest thing.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I think

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
it's a good opportunity.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a good news.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Why don't you

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
send our Qing masters

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
to Mount Jiuyi?

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't worry.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Once I get the news,

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I've already started to arrange the deployment.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I will never let

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
that old fox, Da Siming, succeed.

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Your Highness.

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Princess Chi is here to visit her relatives.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Mother is here.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Mother.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Mother. Mother.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Mother, you heard it.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Looks like my Yan'er

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
has forgotten about me.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No.

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yan'er.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I went to see Da Siming.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He's very grateful to you.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But now that you've learned it,

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
you can go down the mountain

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
if you find a chance.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I, Yan'er, have such a talent.

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I will marry a good man in the future.

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't want to hear it.

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't want to marry.

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I will never marry.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Silly girl.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you don't marry,

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
will you stay on Mount Jiuyi

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and learn magic from Shao Siming?

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So what?

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I just want to follow and guard

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
my master all my life

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and be a powerful female officer.

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Nonsense.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Your master is not a person of the inner world.

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Even if you want to follow him all your life,

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
he won't want you.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Your Highness.

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yuan.

176
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This time,

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I brought you

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
the new desserts of Yanfeng Restaurant.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Try it.

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's really delicious.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yan'er, eat.

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Eat slowly.

183
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
By the way,

184
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
how did you bring it

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
to such a far away place?

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Won't it be broken on the way?

187
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is the suggestion of Director Yuan.

188
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I just want to give it to you.

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Director Yuan suggested that

201
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
you should try it on.

202
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're lucky.

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We can find ice cubes

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and exchange them for her on the way.

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I heard that

206
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,780
powerful

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
can melt water into ice.

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yuan.

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I want to learn this skill.

210
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Then I can teach Yuan.

211
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yuan can bring me

212
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
all the delicious food

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
of Yanfeng Restaurant.

214
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You must be tired of it.

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
No.

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll bring it to Master.

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What's this?

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
These are gifts for Young Master.

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Director Yuan prepared them.

220
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So beautiful.

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The weather has been cold recently.

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I can use this factory.

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I hope that

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can get into your master's eyes.

225
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't worry.

226
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I like everything.

227
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Master will like it.

228
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yan and her master

229
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
are so close.

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But

231
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Master has been in seclusion recently.

232
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's been several days.

233
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I saw that there was a lot of security on the mountain.

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So it's for this matter.

235
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
How about

236
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I bring this thing

237
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
to Master now?

238
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I haven't seen Master

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
for many days.

240
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Princess.

241
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yuan.

242
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You followed me

243
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to visit Master

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
with me?

245
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But the Valley

246
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
doesn't allow people to enter.

247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I mean

248
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
it's a long way to go.

249
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It may be a bit dusty.

250
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let me pat it.

251
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No.

252
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll go now.

253
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This...

254
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why is there

255
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
no one to guard

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
the master's seclusion?

257
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Even Chong Ming is not here.

258
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Who would have thought

259
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Master was so young

260
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
but suffered so much.

261
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Master.

262
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
My mother came to visit me

263
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
today.

264
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I was very happy.

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But who would have thought

266
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
she was here to persuade me

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
to get married?

268
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't want to get married.

269
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't want to leave Master.

270
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I once

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
wanted to

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
save the Crown Prince.

273
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But now,

274
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I can't

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
fulfill my wish.

276
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Now,

277
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I want to

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
stay with Master.

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Because in this world,

280
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm encouraged by a girl

281
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
who can learn calligraphy.

282
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Except for the Crown Prince,

283
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I have Master.

284
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm not going to

285
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
marry her.

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm going to

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
marry her.

288
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm going to

289
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
marry her.

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm going to

291
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
marry her.

292
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm going to

293
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
marry her.

294
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm going to

295
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
marry her.

296
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm going to

297
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
marry her.

298
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm going to

299
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
marry her.

300
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm going to

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
marry her.

302
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm going to

303
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
marry her.

304
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm going to

305
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
marry her.

306
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm going to

307
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
marry her.

308
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm going to

309
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
marry her.

310
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm going to

311
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
marry her.

312
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm going

313
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
to marry her.

314
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,800
Sorry.

315
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Well,

316
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's all right.

317
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm glad

318
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I can see it namely.

319
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I won't

320
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
make you feel guilty

321
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
about it.

322
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,600
No.

323
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,080
I guess you didn't hear what I said just now.

324
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,680
You didn't know

325
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,920
what I said just now.

326
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,120
Master's face is so beautiful.

327
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,560
A son of an immortal

328
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,440
can't be described as a stranger.

329
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Ah

330
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,840
don't be afraid.

331
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,400
Don't be afraid.

332
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,200
What if,

333
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,660
I was a device

334
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,760
with special power

335
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,780
that

336
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:07,920
can simply

337
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,880
reach you,

338
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,240
and then

339
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,600
channels the powers

340
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,720
of the Yin step to me,

341
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,240
absorb it

342
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,000
and become my rope dream hostel.

343
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,160
Why are you here?

344
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,040
Master, Zhu Yan is protecting me.

345
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,040
Protecting you?

346
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,720
You need her protection?

347
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,600
One more time.

348
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,440
I deliberately didn't set up a manor.

349
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,080
I set up the Blood Light Curse

350
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,480
to invite the army to enter the palace.

351
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,360
Once they dare to get close,

352
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,720
they will trigger the Blood Light Curse.

353
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,920
I will lead people to come to the King of Yi to attack Jin.

354
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,120
And you,

355
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,640
you broke into my plan

356
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,200
without any reason.

357
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,200
But you,

358
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,400
in order to save her,

359
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,960
you were willing to miss the chance to enter the True Mirror.

360
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,200
What?

361
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,400
Master, this time,

362
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,560
you are going to enter the True Mirror?

363
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,120
I'm sorry, Master.

364
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,920
I was too reckless.

365
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,200
No, I was reckless.

366
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,040
Master,

367
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,040
don't blame Yan'er for this.

368
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,000
I will hold the Lantern Festival again in a few days.

369
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,800
In a few days?

370
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,520
That's easy to say.

371
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,120
But,

372
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,520
who is going to kill Master?

373
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,440
Get out!

374
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,320
There's nothing for you here.

375
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,640
If you dare to do anything bad again,

376
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,720
I will not spare you.

377
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,560
Yan'er and her feelings are really extraordinary.

378
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,800
I must investigate Zhu Yan's background.

379
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,160
I will do my best to find out the truth.

380
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Your father and I

381
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,640
sent you to the mountain.

382
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,600
We wanted to find a clear land for you.

383
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,880
But the Mount Jiuyi is also in danger.

384
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,240
No.

385
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,960
You will go down the mountain with me tomorrow.

386
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,600
No matter how important the study is,

387
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,240
your life is not important.

388
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,160
I can't let you risk it.

389
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,240
Mother,

390
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,160
don't worry about others anymore.

391
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,880
Your daughter is very capable.

392
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,360
She is very capable.

393
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,360
But she just got a small injury.

394
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,880
What small injury?

395
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,800
The Divine Mother said

396
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,880
that your injury

397
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,160
will not get better

398
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,480
in less than ten days.

399
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,960
You are still exaggerating.

400
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,920
Madam,

401
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,840
this is a tonic to nourish your spirit energy.

402
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,520
Please drink it while it's hot.

403
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,160
Chief Steward Yuan,

404
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,240
please persuade Yan'er

405
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,120
to go down the mountain with us.

406
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,600
Hongxing,

407
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,040
how can you be so cruel to Y Tu'te?

408
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
Why are you WordPressing Burning Kylin's fraud?

409
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,880
Since I've posted the news to you,

410
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,320
why don't you just leave him now?

411
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,960
Where are the envoys?

412
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,560
Many people come and visit me.

413
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,000
Why?

414
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,960
Madam looks down upon you.

415
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,640
You were selected as your police chief

416
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,760
because of your busy talent.

417
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,720
You already have the talent in the Mount Jiuyi.

418
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,040
How can you let it go?

419
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,160
Since you are leaving,

420
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,360
it has probably been only a few days.

421
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,400
Please don't worry.

422
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,000
Her Highness is tired today.

423
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,840
Her Highness is also tired.

424
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Take your medicine and rest early.

425
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
The Dragon God

426
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Lord Dragon God, you finally show up.

427
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,520
You have been a monk for many years.

428
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
You still remember your identity.

429
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,400
Shen Yue,

430
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,200
I will never forget.

431
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,960
It turns out that you still remember your position as the power-slayer.

432
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
You have made my ancestors panic.

433
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,400
But did you forget that your ancestors passed through your father's tomb?

434
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,200
But you are here to protect Princess Kong San.

435
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,520
I will kill her now.

436
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
I will cut off your relationship with Kong San.

437
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,200
No.

438
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,720
You can't.

439
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,200
Kong San is the descendant of Langgan.

440
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,720
He has no right to attack.

441
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,400
This time, you will fight for my country.

442
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,000
No.

443
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,600
No.

444
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,200
Stop.

445
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,000
Come out.

446
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Stop. Come out.

447
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Come out.

448
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,400
No.

449
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,000
No.

450
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,600
No.

451
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
No.

452
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,600
No.

453
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,760
No.

454
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,400
You are tired now.

455
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,560
I.

456
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,160
I.

457
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,800
The Demon Gu rescue is for my family.

458
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,360
We should seek the clues of the Sea God

459
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,600
and execute 10 conceptual briefly.

460
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,960
The one who is the guardian of the hidden secret can't be left a single drop.

461
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,960
The one who loves the dead is the one who loves the dead.

462
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
This time, for the sake of a empty house,

463
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
the real thing is not found.

464
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
I didn't.

465
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
I didn't.

466
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
How could it be?

467
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
I love the medicine.

468
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
I can only love one person in my life.

469
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Who is it?

470
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Just admit it.

471
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,960
What you love is the main thing of this Chizu House.

472
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
How could it be?

473
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
How could it be?

474
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,960
The clouds of fire turned into fire because of you.

475
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
How could it be?

476
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
This is your mission.

477
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,960
You killed people again.

478
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
I'm sorry, You Yi.

479
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,960
Is it a dream?

480
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
It's impossible.

481
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
I love You Yi.

482
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
I...

483
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
I love You Yi.

484
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
I...

485
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
I love you.

486
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
I love you.

487
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
I love you.

488
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
I love you.

489
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
I...

490
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,960
The dragon blood is in my hands.

491
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
The one who loves the dead is the one who loves the dead.

492
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
This time, for the sake of a empty house,

493
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
the real thing is not found.

494
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
You love her.

495
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
You didn't just give up your mission,

496
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,960
but also betrayed the god of the Jiaozi.

497
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Admit it.

498
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
You love the main thing of this Chizu House.

499
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
The main thing.

500
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
I can only love one person in my life.

501
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
I can't let You Yi down.

502
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
Those unnecessary feelings

503
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
should be ended.

504
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Your Majesty.

505
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Qing clan is a master of naming.

506
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
Except for the Qing King and Qing Gang,

507
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
they are all here.

508
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Qing clan's intention is to hurt Yuan Qi.

509
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
They should have no ability to make trouble in the Qing Feng.

510
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,960
I released the news

511
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
and asked Qing clan to act.

512
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Yi King is dead.

513
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Everything was supposed to be perfect.

514
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
But Ying Zheng is dead.

515
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Qing clan is dead.

516
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
Qing clan is dead.

517
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,960
Qing clan is dead.

518
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,960
But Ying Zheng

519
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
forced to go out of the place

520
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,960
to get the chance to ascend the real mirror.

521
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,960
It seems that

522
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,960
the end of the Yin-er is Zhu Yan.

523
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
I have been practicing for my whole life.

524
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
I found that ten days later,

525
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,960
the nine stars are connected.

526
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,960
The real mirror of the world.

527
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,960
If I practice the primordial spirit on this day,

528
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,960
I can get nine stars.

529
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,960
You still have the chance

530
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,960
to ascend the real mirror.

531
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,960
You must not be careless.

532
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,960
You must be strict.

533
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,960
That Zhu Yan

534
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
must not let him get into trouble again.

535
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
Yes.

536
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
I didn't expect

537
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,960
we would fail.

538
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Don't worry.

539
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,960
This time, it's just a trap.

540
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
The Grand Minister thought

541
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
our Qing clan was a master of the forbidden food.

542
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,960
Even if he didn't lose to the guard,

543
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,960
he would never have thought

544
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,960
we would fight another battle.

545
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
Let him get some time first.

546
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,960
Otherwise,

547
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,960
we wouldn't have the chance

548
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
to use the killing move.

549
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,960
It's just that

550
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
we can only make the young minister

551
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
who has no desire to win

552
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
to be hooked.

553
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Bai Xue Lu.

554
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
Bai Xue Lu.

555
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
He is very familiar with Mount Jiuyi.

556
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
And he hasn't been

557
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
in my palace for a few years.

558
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Why don't we give him

559
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
a chance to make a contribution this time?

560
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Does your hand still hurt?

561
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
If it weren't for the rule

562
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
that you can only visit your parents for two days,

563
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
I would have waited for you

564
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
to recover.

565
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
You can rest in this house

566
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
and rest in peace.

567
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
After I go back,

568
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
I will write a letter to your father

569
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
to ask for your resignation.

570
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
I will come to pick you up in half a month.

571
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
I won't go home.

572
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,960
I finally found what I wanted to do.

573
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,960
How can I be so stubborn?

574
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
You want to learn magic.

575
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
You can learn it anywhere.

576
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
When the weather is good,

577
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
I will find you the best teacher.

578
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
In this world,

579
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,960
no one can be more anxious than my teacher.

580
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,960
You...

581
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
This child...

582
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Princess Consort, the Minister of War wants to see you.

583
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
The Minister of War?

584
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Think about what I have to say to you.

585
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
Princess Consort.

586
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
When will you leave?

587
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
The carriage is ready.

588
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
Yan.

589
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
I will go to the Minister of War and resign.

590
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
I will leave when I come back.

591
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Yes.

592
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Yuan.

593
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,960
You have something to say to me for my mother.

594
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
You are not a child.

595
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
You can take responsibility for your choice.

596
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
I have no intention to say anything.

597
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
I know Yuan is waiting for me.

598
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Come on.

599
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Don't worry. I'm fine.

600
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
By the way, Yuan.

601
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,960
I want to learn how to swim in the water.

602
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
Can I?

603
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
No.

604
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
I don't want to.

605
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Since you have learned how to swim,

606
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
you'd better not go into the water.

607
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
But Yuan.

608
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,960
I'm not familiar with it.

609
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
And I'm really fine.

610
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
You don't believe me?

611
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
I don't believe you. Look.

612
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Princess.

613
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,960
Be careful.

614
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
Be careful.

615
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Yuan.

616
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,960
I know you are the best.

617
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Please.

618
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
You will promise me, right?

619
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Yuan.

620
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
What's wrong with you?

621
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,960
You are an adult.

622
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
You need to practice in Mount Jiuyi.

623
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,960
You need to be a good master.

624
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,960
I didn't do well enough.

625
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Please forgive me.

626
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Did I do something wrong?

627
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Why do you say that?

628
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Do you want Shao Siming

629
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
to think we have no rules?

630
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
You are right.

631
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
I don't want to be a bad teacher.

632
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
You are right.

633
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,960
I was too willful before.

634
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
I have something for you.

635
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Please take this fish to test it.

636
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
Dragon Blood Ancient Jade is safe.

637
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
It seems that Dragon Blood Ancient Jade

638
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
is related to you.

639
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
Maybe I can protect it.

640
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
It's beautiful.

641
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,960
Take it with you.

642
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
It's not safe in the mountains.

643
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
Princess is worried about you.

644
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
This jade may

645
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
keep you safe.

646
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Yuan.

647
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
I don't know what you just said.

648
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,960
I don't know what you just said.

649
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
I thought we were strangers

650
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
when you said those words to me.

651
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,960
You are so nice to me.

652
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
I can feel relieved now.

653
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,960
But

654
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,960
it should be your ancestral gift.

655
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Such an expensive gift.

656
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
I can't accept it.

657
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,960
If a common person

658
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,960
touches my jade,

659
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
the jade will break.

660
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
You can get it safely.

661
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Even if it's related to you.

662
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Really?

663
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
We are predestined to be together.

664
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
If we two

665
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
compete with each other in the future,

666
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
I hope this jade can protect you.

667
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
And I will

668
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
always wish you

669
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,960
a good life.

670
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
In that case,

671
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
I'll take it.

672
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
Thank you.

673
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Why did he leave without saying goodbye?

674
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,960
You can prepare

675
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,960
for the wedding.

676
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
If you are worried,

677
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
you can write a lucky note

678
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
to your birthday

679
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
after you come back.

680
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
And send it to me.

681
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
I will learn from you

682
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
and help you

683
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,960
avoid the disaster.

684
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
In that case,

685
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,960
thank you for your kindness.

686
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
I'll go down the mountain now

687
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,960
and find someone to make a lucky note.

688
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
I'll send it to you now.

689
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Greetings, Your Highness.

690
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
You can leave now.

691
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Yes.

692
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
Sit down.

693
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
You are so big.

694
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
I didn't want to

695
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
involve you in it.

696
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
But

697
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
I know you are a good person.

698
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
So,

699
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
I won't treat you as an outsider.

700
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Sit down.

701
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Thank you for your kindness.

702
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,960
I hope you can think of a way

703
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
to lure that young minister

704
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
to the Jiuyi Shrine.

705
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
You are the daughter of Luo Xi,

706
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
who is hard to meet in the mountain.

707
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
What?

708
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
Are you unwilling to do it?

709
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Or

710
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
do you have other thoughts?

711
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
You misunderstood.

712
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
It's difficult.

713
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
I'm just thinking of a way.

714
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
If you can

715
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
help me with it,

716
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
we are really

717
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
a family.

718
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
I understand.

719
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
Thank you very much.

720
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
I will take my leave now.

721
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
Thank you.

722
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
I'm leaving too.

723
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,960
Thank you.

724
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
Let go of me.

725
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
Let go of me!

726
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Let go of me!

727
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
Let go of me!

728
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Let go of me!

729
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Let go of me!

730
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,160
Master, why are you here?

731
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,000
It turns out that this is your masterpiece.

732
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,420
That's great!

733
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,340
sail overnight.

734
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,640
Playing this or that is called

735
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,260
a martial art skill ready to face the minister zone.

736
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,600
Have you seen your enemies?

737
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,260
No.

738
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,600
Can you then

739
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,940
분 disasters in another side?

740
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,800
Can anyone

741
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,200
make me suffer with just this?

742
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,920
Master,

743
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,000
does the natural drag

744
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,160
have the shape

745
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,360
that I would climb

746
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,680
if I wanted?

747
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,480
I wish to see

748
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,760
those clouds-made hills.

749
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,160
Master,

750
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,600
Can a courtyard be built on that mountain?

751
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Amazing!

752
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,880
Master, can you and I be built

753
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,400
on that courtyard?

754
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:39,840
I haven't experienced the difficulties

755
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,960
Then let me take you back

756
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,160
It's okay

757
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,640
People who have practiced

758
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,240
have to suffer it

759
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,920
But I am different now

760
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,640
Thank you.

761
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,440
Most of the time,

762
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,760
I'm too absent-minded in my consciousness.

763
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,520
I just woke up today.

764
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,000
I thank you for

765
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,120
what happened in the real world that day.

766
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,920
Master, you really don't have to comfort me.

767
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,960
Instead,

768
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,160
it's because I dragged you down

769
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,560
that you didn't get to the real world.

770
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,120
Actually,

771
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,520
it's not that important

772
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,440
whether you get to the real world or not.

773
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,160
You know that.

774
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,200
I've always wanted to drive that girl down the mountain.

775
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,960
But after she went up the mountain,

776
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,880
you learned a new trick.

777
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,640
I'm very confused now.

778
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,320
What trick?

779
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,520
Please tell me.

780
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
You'll laugh.

781
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,520
Ever since she went up the mountain,

782
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,080
the boy who once lived a thousand miles away

783
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,480
will laugh.

784
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,880
I'll laugh.

785
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,520
You have to believe in my ability.

786
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,520
It's just a small thing to miss once.

787
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,160
Master came to thank me as soon as he woke up.

788
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,640
He must be afraid that I'll feel guilty about what happened that day.

789
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,120
If I keep thinking about it,

790
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,640
Master won't be at ease.

791
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,800
Yes.

792
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,680
Master's magic is great.

793
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,760
It will definitely work in the future.

794
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,800
My dear,

795
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,760
do you want to learn the magic of the Jade Cloud?

796
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,720
Yes.

797
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,600
This is a gift from Master.

798
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,120
Try it.

799
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,400
Master, you'll have a close look at it.

800
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,680
Master, look over there.

801
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,120
This is the painting of Carrie you painted last time.

802
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,440
I thought it's a person.

803
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,520
That is Master.

804
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,120
Master, look over there.

805
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,480
You see the flowerよ.

806
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,960
One another.

807
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,240
It's thick and dense.

808
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,880
It's slightly sweet.

809
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,360
Doesn't it look like your eyebrows?

810
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,160
Alright.

811
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,800
It's getting late.

812
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,160
You haven't recovered yet.

813
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,640
You need to go back to your room to rest.

814
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,240
I'll go back to my room to rest too.

815
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,880
Alright.

816
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,520
When Master enters the real world,

817
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,040
I'll prepare a pot of good wine for him to celebrate.

818
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,320
In the future,

819
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,040
I mean,

820
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,160
in the future,

821
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,280
whenever Master breaks through the barrier,

822
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,720
I'll prepare a pot of good wine for him.

823
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
I don't drink.

824
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,400
But I can watch you drink every time.

825
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,600
That's great.

826
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,320
Master,

827
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,160
we still have a lot to do.

828
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,160
It's a deal.

829
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,440
It's a deal.

830
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,320
By the way,

831
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,200
the festival of Chongming is coming soon.

832
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,280
I hope you can take care of each other

833
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,560
one by one.

834
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,240
Although he looks fierce,

835
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,000
he's actually a child.

836
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,800
Master, don't worry.

837
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,200
After you leave the temple,

838
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,160
Chongming and I will go back to the mountain world

839
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,560
one by one.

840
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:30,400
Ling&Dai

841
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,560
If we could tell that it would be best

842
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,620
I'd never tell any lie
