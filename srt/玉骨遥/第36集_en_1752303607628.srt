1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
This weight gives you one more last piece.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,000
Xuan terre is a seal to Princessjing Gate of Heaven.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,800
Head Fragrance Division

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,760
Flying Phoenix

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,760
The world is so beautiful

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,760
I want to spend my life with you

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,760
When the sun rises

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,760
I want to be with you

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,760
It's your reason

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,760
I want to spend my life with you

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,760
I want to be with you

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,760
Give me a life of shining scenery

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,760
I am a cloud

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,760
I am not afraid of the sky

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,760
But I ask you

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,760
How to live forever

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,760
I am a butterfly for you

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,760
In the sea of clouds

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,760
I want to be with you

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,760
The first encounter

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,760
Is engraved in my heart

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Zhu Yan, after Yin'er is dead

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,760
What are your plans?

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Don't worry, my lord

25
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,760
I will leave him

26
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,760
I will never see him again

27
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,760
Zhu Yan

28
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,760
I am a daughter of the mortal world

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,760
I have caused him to die once

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,760
How can I stay by his side

31
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,760
And let him suffer

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
Get hurt

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,760
And even die once again

34
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,760
I am the kind of person

35
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,760
Who is watching

36
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,760
The most important person

37
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,760
In my hand

38
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,760
The feeling of gradually losing

39
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,760
Just one life

40
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Is enough

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,760
OK

42
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,760
After Yin'er regains her soul

43
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
Everything that happened in these three days

44
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
She will forget

45
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
Then

46
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,760
Just as what you said today

47
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Leave the mountain alone

48
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,760
Yes

49
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,760
Did you see anything just now?

50
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
My lord

51
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
I didn't see anything

52
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
Who are you?

53
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Where am I?

54
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,760
You're awake

55
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
Are you ok?

56
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
I'm fine

57
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
You're awake

58
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
I'm fine

59
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,760
I'm fine

60
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
I'm fine

61
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,760
I'm fine

62
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,760
I'm fine

63
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
I'm fine

64
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,600
Ji Xin.

65
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Why am I here?

66
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,960
I'm you father's birthday girl now.

67
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,200
It's a letter for you.

68
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,240
For me?

69
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,860
Wait,

70
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,280
what I've written

71
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,220
is this.

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,260
As it produces charges of aggression,

73
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,860
we can't afford to check if it's working or not,

74
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,920
or if it's done and destroyed.

75
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,420
Ying.

76
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
while killing Hai Hwang,

77
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,960
you were念 drugged

78
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,780
and fake depending on ground survival skills.

79
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,740
The spirit power was temporarily sealed,

80
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,920
and your memory beginning to get messy.

81
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,960
You could rest in the mountains for a few days

82
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,300
and you would be fine again.

83
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
The...

84
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,260
The Sea King's rebellion?

85
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,180
Yes.

86
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,660
Commander asked me to take good care of you.

87
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,540
You can rest in Mount Jiuyi

88
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,740
and rest in peace.

89
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,060
Don't worry.

90
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,700
Then,

91
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,500
who are you?

92
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,060
I...

93
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,780
I'm your maid.

94
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,780
You're my maid?

95
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,740
Why haven't I seen you before?

96
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,580
I came after His Majesty's birthday.

97
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,380
I think you forgot about me.

98
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,500
You must be thirsty.

99
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,140
I'll get you some water.

100
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,940
You just woke up.

101
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,500
Don't worry.

102
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,380
Thank you.

103
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,780
It's strange.

104
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,420
What's wrong with me?

105
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,180
Why can't I tell the difference between cold and hot?

106
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,540
You have to prevent

107
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,140
the impurity of the Central Yin Qi.

108
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,500
The Central Yin Qi

109
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,500
is very vulnerable to your own damage.

110
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,180
It will bring you

111
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,860
the unbearable consequences.

112
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,580
The Fourth...

113
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,780
The Fourth...

114
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
The Fourth...

115
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,020
The Fourth...

116
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
The Fourth...

117
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,260
The Fourth...

118
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,380
The Fourth...

119
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
The Fourth...

120
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,620
The Fourth...

121
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,740
The Fourth...

122
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,020
The Lord of the Five Realms,

123
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,020
the first step is to remove the impurities.

124
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,740
Is this the second step of the Central Yin Qi?

125
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,580
Your Highness, your water is here.

126
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,660
Your hand is red.

127
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,820
It's okay.

128
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,700
Wait a minute.

129
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,020
Come on.

130
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,220
Let me paint it for you.

131
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,780
It's so strange.

132
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,100
Why do I know

133
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,220
the medicine is in that box?

134
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,220
Your Highness, you probably forgot

135
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,620
that you used to come to the Nine-Yi Mountain Pavilion.

136
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,580
Look.

137
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,180
This is your living room.

138
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,740
There's your clothes.

139
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,660
Inside,

140
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,340
there are all the clothes you often use.

141
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,740
Follow me.

142
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,500
No wonder I think the dust in this place

143
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,180
is especially in line with my heart.

144
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,740
Your Highness,

145
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,380
are you going to take a bath and change your clothes?

146
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,860
That's right.

147
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,380
Then you should avoid it.

148
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,140
I'm going to take a bath.

149
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,620
I'll go to the bathroom.

150
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,820
I'll go to the bathroom.

151
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,900
I'll go to the bathroom.

152
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,060
I'll go to the bathroom.

153
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,100
I'll go to the bathroom.

154
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,700
Master Liu is here alone.

155
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,180
What if he finds something wrong again?

156
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,220
His memory will be disturbed

157
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,380
and eventually cause a fire to extinguish.

158
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,100
Absolutely not.

159
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,740
Before,

160
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,540
I was the one who served you

161
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,820
with your hair and clothes.

162
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,100
This is my duty.

163
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,700
There's no knot on the front.

164
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,220
I...

165
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,980
I...

166
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,300
I'll do it myself.

167
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,540
Okay.

168
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,140
Then I'll go to prepare

169
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,620
wet Harتي Lasting Medication for you.

170
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,820
All right then.

171
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,380
May I help Your Highness

172
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,580
to make Your Highness' blood leave?

173
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,900
you have the ability

174
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,300
to protect him from the evil circumstance.

175
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,500
I'm waited for air treatment for years.

176
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
You are not my maid.

177
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,860
Because in my palace,

178
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,060
no such stupid maid lives.

179
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,020
Why must you stay by my side?

180
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,620
I always feel that

181
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,140
we are not just a couple.

182
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
This is bad.

183
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,140
Master's soul has changed.

184
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,580
Could it be that he's reminded of

185
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,300
the scene of the Abyss of Heaven?

186
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,020
I don't know why,

187
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,100
but I feel that this scene

188
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,220
seems familiar.

189
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,020
Your Highness,

190
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,860
you guessed it right.

191
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,580
I'm not your maid.

192
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,540
I was once a maid

193
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,060
and I was ashamed of you.

194
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,860
I didn't have the chance to see you.

195
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,500
I heard that you were injured

196
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,780
and needed someone to take care of you.

197
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,260
I rushed over

198
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,620
to make up for my mistakes.

199
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,140
Who are you?

200
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,540
What did you do

201
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,780
that you did me wrong?

202
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,100
Your Highness,

203
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,060
since you've lost your memory,

204
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,620
why do you talk about the past?

205
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,180
Even if I say it,

206
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,940
you won't remember it.

207
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,100
When you

208
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,100
regain your memory,

209
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,820
you will remember me.

210
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,380
Then,

211
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,020
you don't need to talk about the past.

212
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,500
Why do you take a shower

213
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,700
outside during the day?

214
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,220
If I say no to the one I love,

215
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,460
you will forget about me.

216
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,980
I know.

217
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,100
Then,

218
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,660
show no mercy to everybody

219
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,420
when you are life,

220
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,020
and put on a high school uniform.

221
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,940
Eat more.

222
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,260
Thank you.

223
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,980
Feel better?

224
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,860
Its made of array.

225
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,600
In 5 days,

226
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,140
I'm no longer scared of the frost.

Shi! Shi! Shi!

231
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,080
Your Highness,

232
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,000
you're awake.

233
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,760
Who are you?

234
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,760
You look familiar.

235
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,400
He's a famous mountain bird.

236
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,240
I met you before.

237
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,120
Nice to meet you.

238
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,360
Your Highness,

239
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,200
I'm the commander of the four chiefs

240
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,240
of the Nine Ways Mountain,

241
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,880
Minister Feng.

242
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,840
Today, the commander

243
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,120
sent a message from Jialan.

244
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,240
His Majesty has made a follow-up arrangement

245
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,440
to the navy.

246
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,840
He said that you should rest in the mountain

247
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,880
and return to the capital as soon as possible.

248
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,600
Although I'm weak,

249
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,440
I can't

250
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,800
stop myself from doing something.

251
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,920
I can't stay here for too long.

252
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,640
No, no.

253
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,400
No, no, no.

254
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,200
You can't leave.

255
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,280
You're so talented.

256
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,360
I'm always quick-tempered.

257
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,080
Please don't mind it.

258
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,720
Did you take a lot of effort

259
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,600
to save me?

260
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,360
It's all done by the commander.

261
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,400
So,

262
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,920
you'd better wait until the commander comes back

263
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,960
and leave after you've recovered.

264
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,840
Yes, yes, yes.

265
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,720
That's right.

266
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,400
I have something to do.

267
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,480
I'll leave now.

268
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,840
Goodbye.

269
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,640
I'll go see them off.

270
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,960
Take good care of Shuiying.

271
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,440
Nothing should happen to her.

272
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,920
Don't worry.

273
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,080
Let's go.

274
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,480
You three are so strange.

275
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,440
Especially you.

276
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,280
You know the situation in the mountain very well.

277
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,560
That's because

278
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,360
I stayed in the mountain for months.

279
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,680
Although I can't remember who you are,

280
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,200
since the commander

281
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,560
left you with me,

282
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,040
and the sacred birds in the mountain

283
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,640
also trust you quite a bit.

284
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,960
It proves that

285
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,960
you're not a evil person.

286
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,920
Maybe you did

287
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,120
something wrong to me before.

288
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,640
But it's all in the past.

289
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,040
I can't pursue it anymore.

290
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,240
I forgive you.

291
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,920
But it doesn't mean

292
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,320
I need you to take care of me.

293
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,360
So,

294
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,800
you should leave with them.

295
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,840
Your Highness.

296
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,360
Don't you really need me to take care of you?

297
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,720
The mountain is quiet.

298
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,000
The holy officers

299
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,480
are all working.

300
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,480
Your Highness,

301
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,080
you'll be bored.

302
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,440
Just a few days.

303
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,360
It's okay.

304
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,280
The holy officers

305
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,560
usually only eat

306
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,080
some light soup and water.

307
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,440
Do you also have a good night?

308
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,840
Just a few days.

309
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,600
It's okay.

310
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,920
It seems that

311
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,360
you're going to be

312
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,680
confined in this Qingxiu Hall for a few days.

313
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,160
The mountain is dangerous.

314
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,600
The grass is growing.

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,680
Your Highness, you don't have any memory

316
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,760
and you don't have any magic to help you.

317
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,160
If no one is with you,

318
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,080
what if you get lost

319
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,320
in the mountain?

320
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,200
I'm afraid that you won't even

321
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,200
have a cup of tea or rice.

322
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,600
By then,

323
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,600
you'll probably

324
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,800
only be able to absorb

325
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
the spirit of heaven and earth.

326
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,800
Okay.

327
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,960
So, Your Highness,

328
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,280
just let me stay.

329
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,120
I swear

330
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,920
that I won't say anything

331
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,280
for the next few days.

332
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,440
Okay.

333
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,760
Since you insist on staying,

334
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,800
I'll have to trouble you

335
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,280
to take me to the Diyang Valley first.

336
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,600
That's the place where my ancestors

337
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,440
were buried.

338
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I should go there to pay my respects.

339
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

340
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,200
Your Highness, be careful.

341
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

342
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

343
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,760
Your Highness,

344
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,880
follow me.

345
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,000
Your Highness,

346
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,280
please wait for me.

347
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,760
I'll be right back.

348
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,640
Your Highness,

349
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,640
please wait for me.

350
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,640
Your Highness,

351
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,720
please wait for me.

352
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Your Highness,

353
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
please wait for me.

354
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
Your Highness,

355
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,360
please wait for me.

356
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
Your Highness,

357
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
please wait for me.

358
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Your Highness,

359
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,840
please wait for me.

360
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Your Highness,

361
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
please wait for me.

362
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Your Highness,

363
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
please wait for me.

364
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,480
Your Highness,

365
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
please wait for me.

366
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Your Highness,

367
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,920
please wait for me.

368
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Your Highness,

369
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
please wait for me.

370
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,360
Your Highness,

371
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
please wait for me.

372
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Your Highness,

373
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
please wait for me.

374
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
Your Highness,

375
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
please wait for me.

376
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
What's going on?

377
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,480
Are you lost?

378
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,560
Let's go.

379
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,720
Hurry up.

380
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,720
Oh no.

381
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,400
That direction is the only way to the Empress of Bai Ying.

382
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,200
Your Highness, wait for me.

383
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,760
Your Highness, slow down.

384
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,000
Your Highness, wait for me.

385
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,600
Your Highness, slow down.

386
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,240
Your Highness.

387
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,280
Your Highness.

388
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,000
There are too many gaps in the forest.

389
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,720
We shouldn't go in there rashly.

390
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,880
I don't know why,

391
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,880
but after I worship the ancestors,

392
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,600
I feel that there are still some unsolved problems.

393
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,320
It's in the forest behind you.

394
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,200
Your Highness, it's late at night.

395
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,760
It's forbidden to visit the King's Valley

396
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,440
after returning from a long journey.

397
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,720
We'd better leave as soon as possible.

398
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,640
I heard that the fireflies in the King's Valley

399
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,160
have been accompanying

400
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,000
the Empress of the past.

401
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,160
They are quite spiritual.

402
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Why are they in your sleeve today?

403
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,840
They seem to be lost.

404
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,840
They look like they were born.

405
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,640
How about this?

406
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,320
Let's send them back to the forest

407
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,480
and leave.

408
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,760
Your Highness,

409
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,440
Your Highness, you are so good at calling out.

410
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,440
Look.

411
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,280
That's their mother.

412
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,280
They found their home.

413
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,600
Why?

414
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,400
I have a very sad feeling.

415
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,240
Master left his mother when he was young.

416
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,160
Seeing such a scene,

417
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,960
even if he lost his memory,

418
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,440
he would still come back unconsciously.

419
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,480
Master will never

420
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,160
see the Empress again in his life.

421
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,560
In his three-day dream,

422
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,360
let him meet his mother again.

423
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,480
The thought of yesterday is now real.

424
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
The one who saved the master of this house

425
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,480
is back in the mortal world.

426
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,080
Draw.

427
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,400
Yin.

428
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,640
Mother.

429
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,760
Why are you here?

430
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,880
Yin.

431
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,720
I know

432
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,600
what you have done for the people.

433
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,640
You have grown up.

434
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,960
I am proud of you.

435
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,280
Mother.

436
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,440
I think

437
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,440
I haven't seen you for a long time.

438
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,640
Yin.

439
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,640
Take care of yourself.

440
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,280
I will wait for you in the palace.

441
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,840
isn't it right?

442
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,560
That shouldn't work.

443
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,880
Your Highness Princełum.

444
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,080
In fact,

445
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,440
after your full recovery,

446
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,280
Chong Ming took battleship to Bai Yan.

447
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,080
So I was just acting again.

448
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,380
why not

449
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,080
look

450
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,720
Don't you think I did a good job?

451
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,660
Thanks

452
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,660
you know

453
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,700
Every year to this time

454
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,200
The city of Jialan

455
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,060
Will be full of snow wheat

456
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,680
Mother will make me a snow-flavored cake.

457
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,480
The snow-flavored cake she made

458
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,040
is the most delicious.

459
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
The whole empty warehouse

460
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,520
can't find another

461
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,120
better cake than hers.

462
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,440
The Empress must be very good at cooking.

463
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,480
That's right.

464
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,200
Everything I ate in the palace

465
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,240
was made by my mother.

466
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,360
She said

467
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,160
she liked to see

468
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,640
me eating and drinking.

469
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,480
She said

470
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,560
that's what a child should look like.

471
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,640
Instead of pretending to be a gentleman,

472
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,760
there's another dish

473
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,240
called Cloud-Wood Shrimp.

474
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,400
It's made of river prawn and tea leaves.

475
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,720
It's called

476
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,120
the most delicious

477
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,280
when drunk

478
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,680
and in the season.

479
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,920
Don't stand there.

480
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,200
Come and sit.

481
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,220
Mr. Feng…

482
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,280
If there's a chance,

483
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,400
I'll get my mother

484
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,680
to make

485
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,360
a snow-flavored cake for you.

486
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,440
She can make one for you.

487
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,920
under the

488
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:29,220
regeneration

489
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,960
For 3 days

490
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,480
the goddess S Power

491
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,080
is Dankeu

492
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,360
for she has a loose soul

493
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,580
when the sun falls

494
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,920
the spell wakes up

495
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,520
and even make the one

496
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,160
go into a coma,

497
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,720
he will only ever try

498
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,100
the deadliest desserts.

499
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,200
Really.

500
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,920
mundo

501
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,920
Contempla

502
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,400
Me

503
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,320
international

504
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,800
The economy

505
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,680
LES

506
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,680
Water

507
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,480
ries

508
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,280
Aspire

509
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,920
I'll make you a snow-white cake.

510
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,960
Why is the snow-white smell not fragrant?

511
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,400
It's not that the smell is not fragrant.

512
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,040
I can't smell it.

513
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
I've only been with him for a day.

514
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Why do I feel that he's getting closer?

515
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
Your Highness.

516
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,680
You said that you've done something that's wrong with me.

517
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,880
So I'm very disgusted with you.

518
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,840
But it's been a long time.

519
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,920
I've been thinking about it.

520
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,120
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

521
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,000
But it's strange.

522
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,520
I don't have any feelings for you.

523
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,920
Logically, even if a person loses his memory,

524
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,840
his body will react to others' attitude.

525
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,520
Isn't it?

526
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,920
Your Highness, you're thinking too much.

527
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,440
Although Yin'er lost her memory,

528
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,000
in the past three days,

529
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
every day,

530
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,800
her feelings for you will become stronger.

531
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,080
You must be careful.

532
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,360
Don't let her know.

533
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,440
That's because you're a kind person.

534
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,840
Even if you've been thinking about me,

535
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,160
you'll treat me like you treat others.

536
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,160
Your Highness, don't worry about me anymore.

537
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,760
Don't mention the past.

538
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,280
You made it?

539
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,760
My cooking is not as good as your mother's.

540
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,280
But it's better than nothing.

541
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,320
Try it.

542
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,400
Thank you.

543
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,840
It's good.

544
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:39,200
goal

545
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,720
Delicious.

546
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,760
I always wonder

547
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,720
why I feel more comfortable with you.

548
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,920
It feels like we used to

549
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,720
living side by side,

550
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
sitting in Fruit mist.

551
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,840
I think...

552
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,440
By the way,

553
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,360
you said you wanted to eat so much food two days ago.

554
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,160
I've already told the servant

555
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,760
to go down the mountain to buy some.

556
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,440
If you don't mind my cooking,

557
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,560
I'll make it well

558
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,160
and bring it to you

559
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,680
to taste.

560
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,160
Thank you.

561
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,640
Is there an emergency nearby?

562
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,280
I want to go shopping alone.

563
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,120
No.

564
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,760
I'm afraid I can't go alone.

565
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,880
I'll go with you.

566
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,960
I'll go with you.

567
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,120
I'll go with you.

568
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,120
I'll go with you.

569
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,080
No.

570
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,880
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

571
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,240
How can you walk around freely?

572
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,720
I want to check the situation.

573
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,240
If you're worried,

574
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,920
you can go with me.

575
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,520
Why did Xiao Yingzi suddenly want to go to the market?

576
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,120
Could it be that

577
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,760
she wanted to go shopping with you

578
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,320
in the middle of the night?

579
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,240
No matter what the reason is,

580
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,360
I can't stop Master.

581
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,920
Chongming,

582
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,640
everyone in Jiuyi Jun knows us.

583
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,320
We have to go a little further.

584
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,840
It's not easy to have me here.

585
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,840
This is the legendary Chongming God Bird.

586
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,120
Can it fly in the sky?

587
00:33:59,440 --> 00:33:59,960
Yes.

588
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,440
You can sit behind me later.

589
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,240
If you're afraid,

590
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,840
you can grab its feathers later.

591
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,200
I'm afraid it can't fly.

592
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,880
I'm afraid it can't fly.

593
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,480
I'm afraid it can't fly.

594
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,040
I'm afraid it can't fly.

595
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,800
Slow down.

596
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,200
Come here.

597
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,320
Chongming, let's go.

598
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,040
It's a good deal.

599
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,840
It's a good deal.

600
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Try it.

601
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,040
Come on, try it.

602
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
Cotton.

603
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Do you like it?

604
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,640
Cheng Ming, pay.

605
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
Come on, take it.

606
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,440
Come and see the fresh fruit.

607
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,240
Fresh and sweet figs.

608
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,440
Come on.

609
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,240
Figs.

610
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,240
Cheng Ming, buy some.

611
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,840
Come on.

612
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,040
Come on.

613
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,640
Look.

614
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,640
Great.

615
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,640
So handsome.

616
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,440
So handsome.

617
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
So funny.

618
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
So cool.

619
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,640
I'll wait for you in front.

620
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
Come on, look.

621
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
So funny.

622
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,440
What's this?

623
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,040
I don't know why

624
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,640
I think you'll like it

625
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,240
when I see this.

626
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
Master, you don't remember anything, do you?

627
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
Thank you, Cheng Ming.

628
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
Cheng Ming.

629
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
How about this?

630
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
I'll buy one for you.

631
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,640
Take it as a thank you gift

632
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,240
for my care these days.

633
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,440
No.

634
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,040
I can't take good care of him.

635
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,640
We're not meant to be.

636
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,040
Miss,

637
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
aren't you...

638
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,040
No.

639
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
I don't know you.

640
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,240
This is my first time here.

641
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,840
Well...

642
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,240
No.

643
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
At the Jiuyi House,

644
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,440
you...

645
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:47,840
Aren't you...

646
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,040
Jiuyi Mountain...

647
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,640
That beast...

648
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
Your little white beast ran away.

649
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Go, go over there.

650
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,840
My little white beast.

651
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,440
We...

652
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,840
Your Highness,

653
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,640
I've always been

654
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,040
a good-looking and

655
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,840
gentle-looking person.

656
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
I'm used to

657
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,840
being mistaken.

658
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,840
Good-looking and gentle-looking person?

659
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,040
Let's go find Cheng Ming.

660
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
Miss Zhou Yuan,

661
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,440
here are the spices you asked for.

662
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,040
But the spices in the mountain

663
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,640
are made from your spiritual material.

664
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,040
They're different from the human world.

665
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
This is the quicksand,

666
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,240
which is made from the salt in the wind.

667
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
It's not salty.

668
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,240
This is the honeydew,

669
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,240
which is suitable for ancient wood.

670
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
It's not dry.

671
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,640
This is the fire crystal,

672
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,840
which is suitable for the firewood.

673
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
This is the fire-fire crystal.

674
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
It's not salty.

675
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,240
This is the fire-fire crystal.

676
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,040
It's suitable for ancient wood.

677
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,240
It's not spicy.

678
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,640
This is the plum-tree,

679
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,040
which is suitable for the plum-tree wine.

680
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,040
It's not sour.

681
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,240
Salt,

682
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,040
sugar,

683
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,640
chili,

684
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,640
vinegar.

685
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:05,840
Yes.

686
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
I got it.

687
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,040
It's all my fault for losing the first move.

688
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,440
I didn't know what to do.

689
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,240
Come on.

690
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,240
By then,

691
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,840
all your senses

692
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,240
will be lost.

693
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,640
It's finally time to die.

694
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:46,840
Forget it.

695
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,440
I'd better go to the temple.

696
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,040
The crown prince wants to ask you.

697
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
What can I do for you?

698
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,840
Haven't you ever heard that

699
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,040
the kitchen is the battlefield of the cook?

700
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,040
No one can come to burn the kitchen.

701
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,040
If you want to help,

702
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,840
just wait for the food.

703
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,440
Come on.

704
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,040
Hurry up.

705
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,840
It's okay.

706
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,040
We can help you wash the dishes.

707
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
Right, Cheng Ming?

708
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
No need.

709
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,840
Take it.

710
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,040
Take it.

711
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,440
Just listen to me.

712
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,440
Come here and have a good rest.

713
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,040
Leave the rest to us.

714
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,640
We can be happy

715
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,040
when we do things with you.

716
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,040
Otherwise,

717
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,840
we can't eat this meal.

718
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,240
Right, Cheng Ming?

719
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
It's urgent.

720
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,240
Wash the dishes.

721
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,440
In these three days,

722
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,240
I can get along with you

723
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
so well.

724
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,240
God has been kind to me.

725
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,440
This is the last time

726
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
I cook for you in my life.

727
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,840
I can't let him down.

728
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,440
I'll taste it one by one.

729
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
It's so delicious.

730
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,640
This is the best.

731
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,440
My throat is sore.

732
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,840
Master, master.

733
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,440
Don't put too much

734
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,640
when you cook later.

735
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,840
Salty.

736
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,240
The first level is finally completed.

737
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,440
I'm so tired.

738
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
I'm going to sleep.

739
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,440
I'm going to sleep.

740
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
I'm going to sleep.

741
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
I'm so tired.

742
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,640
Come on.

743
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,040
Your Highness, eat more.

744
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,240
You'll get better soon.

745
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,840
Cheng Ming,

746
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,240
eat with His Highness.

747
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,840
I'll go to the kitchen to clean up.

748
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,040
Wait.

749
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,640
Why is your throat

750
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
so hoarse?

751
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,240
What's wrong with your face?

752
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,040
His Highness found out.

753
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,840
I...

754
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,440
I have an old problem.

755
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,240
Every time I change my mind,

756
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,840
I have some allergy.

757
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,440
I think it's going to rain.

758
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
Is it so serious?

759
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,840
Your Highness.

760
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,840
Sorry.

761
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,040
I'm too hot.

762
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,440
I'll go get some tea.

763
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,040
Sorry.

764
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,440
I...

765
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,440
I don't know why.

766
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,040
Seeing you like this,

767
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,040
I feel very sad.

768
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,640
I want to comfort you.

769
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,040
I was in a hurry, so...

770
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,840
I understand.

771
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,240
But...

772
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,240
I'm guilty.

773
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,640
I don't deserve your pity.

774
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
I feel that

775
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,240
our relationship

776
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,640
is not like what you said.

777
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,240
Although I lost all my memories,

778
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,040
my heart tells me

779
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,640
no matter what you did,

780
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,840
I never mind you.

781
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,640
I never blamed you.

782
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,640
On the contrary,

783
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,840
we are very close.

784
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,040
Your Highness,

785
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,640
please eat your food.

786
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,640
If the food gets cold,

787
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
I'm sorry.

788
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,240
I've worked so hard.

789
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,040
If you don't stay,

790
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,440
I'll have no appetite.

791
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,240
Come on.

792
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,240
Sit down.

793
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,440
Eat with me.

794
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,440
Sit down.

795
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,680
What a nice idea.

796
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,440
Look at your upper line.

797
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,640
Check your stage.

798
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,440
Sure.

799
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:30,960
Who?

800
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:31,440
Who?

801
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,040
Who met him fl portion of?

802
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,040
Alias Yu Ziyun.

803
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,040
Yes.

804
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,440
So,

805
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,240
brand her to him?

806
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,640
Brand him as WeiNDang's

807
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,640
It's me.

808
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,640
The flower and snow in the dream are so beautiful.

809
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,640
Love and hate are not separate.

810
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,640
Why do we have to stay awake?

811
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,640
Why do we have to stay awake?

812
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,640
Why do we have to live without regrets?

813
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,640
The more lonely, the more tears are shed.

814
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,640
The line in your heart,

815
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,640
a wind that dares to touch my soul.

816
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,640
Lock me in the heart of your kiss.

817
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,640
I don't leave you.

818
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,640
The line in your heart,

819
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,640
a wind that dares to touch my soul.

820
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,640
The feelings can be broken into pieces.

821
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,640
You and I are just like a necklace.

822
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,640
The line in your heart,

823
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,640
a wind that dares to touch my soul.

824
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,640
Lock me in the heart of your kiss.

825
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,640
I don't leave you.

826
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,640
The line in your heart,

827
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,640
a wind that dares to touch my soul.

828
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,640
The feelings can be broken into pieces.

829
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,640
You and I are just like a necklace.
