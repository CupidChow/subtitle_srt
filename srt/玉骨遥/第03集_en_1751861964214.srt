00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,980
The

2
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,980
The

3
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,980
The

4
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,980
The

5
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,980
The

6
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,980
The

7
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,980
The

8
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,980
The

9
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,980
The

10
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,980
The

11
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,980
The

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,980
The

13
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,980
The

14
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,980
The

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,980
The

16
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,980
The

17
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,980
The

18
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,980
The

19
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:34,980
I want to tell you the story of love and hate

20
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,980
I want to be with you, the first time we met

21
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:46,980
It's engraved in my heart

22
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,980
The voice of the sea will return to the new car

23
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,980
I'm not yours

24
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,980
What am I to him?

25
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,980
Kill him

26
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:51,880
I'm going to kill a

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Watch out

28
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
Call him to kill him

29
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Hurry up

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
OK

31
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
You have to kill him

32
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
I am going to kill him

33
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
You have to kill him

34
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
You have to kill him

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
You have to kill him

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
Hurry up

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
OK

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
Wait

39
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
You can talk

40
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
Then what I just said

41
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,880
He must have heard it all

42
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
I'm going to kill him

43
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
You have to kill him

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
You have to kill him

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
You have to kill him

46
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
You have to kill him

47
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
You have to kill him

48
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
You have to kill him

49
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
You have to kill him

50
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
You have to kill him

51
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
You have to kill him

52
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
You have to kill him

53
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
You have to kill him

54
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,880
You have to kill him

55
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
You have to kill him

56
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
You have to kill him

57
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
You have to kill him

58
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
You have to kill him

59
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
You have to kill him

60
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
You have to kill him

61
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,880
You have to kill him

62
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
You have to kill him

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
You have to kill him

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
You have to kill him

65
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
You have to kill him

66
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
You have to kill him

67
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
You have to kill him

68
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
You have to kill him

69
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
You have to kill him

70
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
You have to kill him

71
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
One

72
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,280
Be careful

73
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
The martial arts of the blood!

74
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
The martial arts of the blood!

75
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,880
The martial arts of the blood!

76
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,880
The martial arts of the blood!

77
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
The martial arts of the blood!

78
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
The reinforcements are here.

79
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Retreat!

80
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Why are you still here?

81
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
I...

82
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
I have a question to ask you.

83
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
Master Shangguan...

84
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Where is this place?

85
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
It smells so good.

86
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,880
It's the smell of the blood.

87
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
Where is this place?

88
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
Master Shangguan!

89
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Where is he?

90
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Master.

91
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
The visitors have left.

92
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Don't you still have...

93
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Do you still have medicine to drink?

94
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Ice-cultivation?

95
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
Search everywhere.

96
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
See if there are any missing fish.

97
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
Yes.

98
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
So you're here.

99
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Master Shangguan.

100
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Take me out.

101
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
Hey!

102
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Could it be...

103
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
You're a illusion?

104
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Today,

105
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
I'm glad you're here.

106
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
I didn't cause a big trouble.

107
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
If it were someone else,

108
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
I couldn't resist.

109
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
The Ice-cultivation has been expelled.

110
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
There has been no chance

111
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
to step into the empty pit.

112
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Why did you suddenly come to the valley today?

113
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
If you talk about treasures in the valley,

114
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
is it only the legendary

115
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
backland god realm?

116
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
This is indeed strange.

117
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Although the heaven has the power to destroy the heaven and the earth,

118
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
the backland has the power to protect the empty pit.

119
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
But the chosen one can't control it.

120
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
It's of no use to you and me.

121
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
Not to mention the Ice Tribe.

122
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
If the Ice Tribe is expelled this time,

123
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,880
the criminal is here for the backland.

124
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,880
I'm really confused.

125
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
I've been in the valley for many years.

126
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,880
I still don't know the exact location of the backland.

127
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
I don't know either.

128
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Could it be that the Ice Tribe

129
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
knows it?

130
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
But there is one thing that can be confirmed.

131
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,880
There aren't many people in Jiuyi Mountain

132
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
who know when to defend the empty pit.

133
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
No.

134
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,880
It's not something that the Ice Tribe can find out by themselves.

135
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
According to your guess,

136
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
there are people with high power in the empty pit

137
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
who are here to be the backland's spy.

138
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,880
The state of the empty pit has been in power for more than 7,000 years.

139
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,880
The Meng Hua dynasty seems to be a singing and dancing dynasty.

140
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,880
In fact, it's not good.

141
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,880
The people of the six tribes are busy fighting for power.

142
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,880
If someone of them is in collusion with the Ice Tribe,

143
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,880
I won't be surprised.

144
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,880
You must keep your mouth shut tonight.

145
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
You can't let anyone else know.

146
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
Yinzhi.

147
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Just kidding.

148
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
I'm right.

149
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,880
It seems that there were living people in the valley.

150
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
It's not the Ice Tribe.

151
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Have you met anyone else?

152
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
No one else.

153
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,880
You trapped me here.

154
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Of course, you have your reasons.

155
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,880
I'll just wait.

156
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
I don't know why

157
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
but the first time I saw you,

158
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
I felt so close.

159
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
You and he

160
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,880
both have such a beautiful beauty.

161
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
What's wrong?

165
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
Yin.

166
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Do you remember the story of the fated calamity five years ago?

167
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,880
If you have any doubts,

168
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,880
you can check it.

169
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
There have been a lot of people recently.

170
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
There are a lot of women in the six tribes.

171
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
I may be a little suspicious.

172
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
It's for your own good.

173
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Master.

174
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
There are no ice tribes nearby.

175
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,880
We have expanded the search range.

176
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Search carefully.

177
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Don't let anyone leave.

178
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Yes.

179
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
Blood-stained hair.

180
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,880
It's the same as the crown prince's.

181
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,880
Why does it look so similar?

182
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,880
Even if you stay with me,

183
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
I won't talk about it.

184
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,880
I won't call you anymore.

185
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
What does Prince Yinv think that you are?

186
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
If you continue to drink from this drink,

187
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,880
you'll be這個的

188
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,880
I'm deliberately đượctwo

189
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
a little love getting you

190
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
and Bernese

191
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,720
Actually, I want to say

192
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,840
how you did it just now.

193
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,840
How did you hide me

194
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,000
between the fables?

195
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,680
You don't need to know.

196
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,720
But how did you know?

197
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,960
I touched you.

198
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,480
Enough.

199
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Don't mention it again.

200
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,760
No.

201
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,280
I have to tell you.

202
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,400
I have to tell you.

203
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,360
I have to tell you.

204
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
I have to tell you.

205
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
I have to tell you.

206
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,440
I want to explain it to you.

207
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,280
I'm not that kind of girl

208
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,800
who can do whatever she wants.

209
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,560
If it wasn't for the illusion,

210
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,320
I would have looked like you.

211
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,680
I would have looked like you.

212
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,680
I...

213
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,280
Anyway,

214
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,840
if you're my master,

215
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,320
I wouldn't dare to do it.

216
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,120
Enough.

217
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,960
Stop talking.

218
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,840
Anyway,

219
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,520
no matter what I said or did,

220
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,240
I couldn't escape your eyes.

221
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,920
You're really a great person.

222
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,680
Then I want to ask you

223
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,800
that across all the flowers and grassroots,

224
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,520
There's adrawing-which would win spring.

225
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,600
Is it normal for people to have this story?

226
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,600
Did I tell you

227
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,880
that it's the same thing for you?

228
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,360
Because what happened today

229
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,040
is just like a dream

230
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,040
for you.

231
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,800
No!

232
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,400
My Lord,

233
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,320
Do you want

234
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,400
to erase my memory?

235
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,560
Without I do this,

236
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,120
What are you doing with your forehead?

237
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,200
You think you can erase your memory

238
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,040
by using your forehead?

239
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,840
Where is it?

240
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,360
Your forehead.

241
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,920
What? You lied to me?

242
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,220
Oh.

243
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,080
I'mremlin you.

244
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,640
You just want to get rid of her memory?

245
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,760
Don't forget that she is your daughter.

246
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,920
She is just a woman who broke into the valley by mistake.

247
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Just?

248
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,200
Just?

249
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
What did Chen Yu say?

250
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,880
I've been with you in the valley for years

251
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,160
and ruined everything.

252
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,840
Not all the women I met before I turned 18

253
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,360
are people of the same fate.

254
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,040
She is a man of boldness and is different from me.

255
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,840
And she would never do anything related to me.

256
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,000
We will never be able to be together again.

257
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,200
I'm not afraid of her.

258
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,160
We will never be able to meet again.

259
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,320
So,

260
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,560
don't worry.

261
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,200
I've been with you for so long

262
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,280
and I've never seen you be moved.

263
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,640
You just met her and broke up with her.

264
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,720
She must be...

265
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,320
Don't talk nonsense.

266
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,800
You are just soft-hearted.

267
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,840
Kui Lei was willing to die for you.

268
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,840
But he didn't care about you.

269
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,560
He met you by chance.

270
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,600
And you became a bad guy.

271
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,440
If you meet this woman before you turn 18,

272
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,960
you will die in her hands.

273
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,200
You must be careful.

274
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,000
We went to the valley to steal the God Realm.

275
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,040
It's not as you said, we were just defending.

276
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,320
But we were attacked by a strong enemy.

277
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,040
What strong enemy?

278
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,960
This man lives in the valley.

279
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,560
He is a young man who is strong

280
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,840
and powerful because he is weak.

281
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,280
The cultivation of that young man

282
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,080
is even above the four dimensions.

283
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,840
There is also a young girl.

284
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,040
But this young girl

285
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,480
looks like she is weak

286
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,560
and weak.

287
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,400
Who is she?

288
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,080
I'm here to tell you

289
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,720
that you must make it clear

290
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,600
before you give me any news in the future.

291
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,960
Now I will make it clear.

292
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,400
Given my carelessness in this matter,

293
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,240
I promise you

294
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,280
that I will make it clear in the future.

295
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,360
However, I have been doubtful

296
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:07,480
why the Japanese

297
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,240
send you to steal the update realm.

298
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,520
Your Excellency,

299
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,960
we are ordinary people.

300
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,720
We don't need to make any guesses.

301
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,440
This matter has no harm to the King of Qing.

302
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,880
Please don't ask again.

303
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,720
Look over there.

304
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,720
Who is it?

305
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,200
Forgive me, Your Highness.

306
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,840
There is a missing

307
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,040
murderer on the mountain.

308
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,480
We are ordered to search for the missing person.

309
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,240
I want to ask if you have heard of any strange movements?

310
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,640
No.

311
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,120
Yes.

312
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,840
Then we won't disturb you.

313
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,360
Otherwise,

314
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,840
my powerly force might not be enough.

315
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,320
Help me impacts me again.

316
00:18:44,040 --> 00:19:01,960
Another way to

317
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,560
disappear.

318
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,900
is that there is nothing wrong with a black sheep

319
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,840
The death of alg magnate

320
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,580
How can you break in?

321
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,860
Group script call

322
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,300
Let you save as much as you want

323
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,100
Sir, do I need to show you the way?

324
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,200
Group league meal burger

325
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,780
Let you save as much as you want

326
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,260
This place of a good view

327
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,660
It's different from my place

328
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,780
Sir

329
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Your guest room service.

330
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
My lady, you're awake.

331
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,560
How did I fall asleep in this outfit?

332
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Consort Yu, what happened yesterday?

333
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
My lady asked me.

334
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Last night, she seduced me with the ink.

335
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
She didn't even know where she went.

336
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
I'm so dizzy.

337
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,560
My hand...

338
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,560
I shouldn't have been in the King's Valley last night.

339
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
My lady, you should take some fire-resistant powder.

340
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
It's not worth taking such a risk.

341
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
I only took the ink to get the medicine.

342
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,560
The Heart-forgetting Stone is also in my bag.

343
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,560
It's said that the backland's realm is hidden in the King's Valley.

344
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,560
But no one knows where it is.

345
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,560
If I don't find it,

346
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
if I find out where it is,

347
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,560
I'll be the last one to ascend the throne.

348
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,560
The names of all the ladies in Hong Sang are all in this library.

349
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,560
I'll know if that Princess Chizu is a person of the fate.

350
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,560
The Chizu's eyes are as bright as the moon in the three years.

351
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Fortunately, it's not.

352
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,560
I was too worried.

353
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
I'm sorry.

355
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,560
I was too worried.

357
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,560
Shi Yang!

358
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,560
Shi Yang!

359
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
This is good. I checked the elixir book.

360
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,560
The Princess of Chizu is born in the Yang Yue.

361
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
She's not the daughter of your fate.

362
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
I know.

363
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
It's gone.

364
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
No way.

365
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
This is a fate knot.

366
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Isn't it worth the joy?

367
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
Look at you.

368
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,560
You're always crying.

369
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,560
You're bored on the left and boring on the right.

370
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,560
You're so angry.

371
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Let me think about it.

372
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,560
That girl was a bit reckless yesterday.

373
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
But she's still funny.

374
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,560
Since she's not the daughter of your fate,

375
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
why don't I catch her

376
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,560
and make a joke to you?

377
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
I just want to be fair and ask for a few things.

378
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560
When I'm an adult,

379
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,560
I'll return to Jialan

380
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,560
and make up for my mother's innocence.

381
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
Why are you so boring?

382
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Don't always say something ridiculous.

383
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,560
You're just stubborn.

384
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,560
When the Star Lord saw Bai Wei,

385
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
the face of the Goddess

386
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
was just like the girl you saw yesterday.

387
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,560
was just like the girl you saw yesterday.

388
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,560
was just like the girl you saw yesterday.

389
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Please return to the mouth of the King of the Emperor

390
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,560
and be the head of the Central Plains.

391
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,560
There's a living person in the valley.

392
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,560
There's a living person in the valley.

393
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,560
There's a living person in the valley.

394
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,560
But the one who came has no cultivation.

395
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,560
It can't be that little girl again, right?

396
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Xiao Ying, since you don't want to see her again,

397
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,560
I'll...

398
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Please don't.

399
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
Please don't.

400
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Please don't.

401
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Please be the head of the God Realm.

402
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
I'll be the head of the God Realm.

403
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
This girl is far from the fun she was before.

404
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,560
This girl is far from the fun she was before.

405
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,560
But she's also delicate and tender.

406
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
But she's also delicate and tender.

407
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Why don't I

408
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Why don't I

409
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
bring her here to eat?

410
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
Chong Ming.

411
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
No.

412
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,560
She should be my cousin.

413
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
She's definitely not the one who said that.

414
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
You don't have to kill her.

415
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
It's all because the valley is dangerous.

416
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
But now,

417
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
these little princesses

418
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
are coming in and out of the valley.

419
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
It makes me look like a useless hand-pulled bird.

420
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
So,

421
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
you're going to get rid of your memories and let her go?

422
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Ever since I left the palace,

423
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,560
I've never heard from Mother.

424
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
This Princess of the Bai family

425
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
should know about my mother's situation.

426
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Chong Ming, I want to ask her.

427
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Since you're the Princess of the Bai family,

428
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,560
have you seen Aunt Bai Yan recently?

429
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,560
Aunt Bai Yan is locked up in the Kunyuan Palace.

430
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,560
Within five years,

431
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
His Majesty forbids anyone from visiting her.

432
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Then...

433
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Do you know

434
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
how she's doing?

435
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
I haven't seen Aunt Jiang for a long time.

436
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
I don't know how she's doing.

437
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
You really don't know?

438
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
I heard that Aunt is having a hard time in the palace.

439
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
She often doesn't give food to her servants.

440
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
When she's sick,

441
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
she doesn't even have a bed or a blanket.

442
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
You're talking nonsense!

443
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Mother is the Queen of the State.

444
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
How could His Majesty do this?

445
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
This...

446
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
This...

447
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
Chong Ming, send her back.

448
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
I'll go to see Da Si Ming.

449
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
I can't let my mother

450
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
live such a life.

451
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Your Majesty!

452
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
Your Majesty!

453
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Your Majesty!

454
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
I don't care.

455
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
I'm going to Jialan.

456
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Ying Er!

457
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Where are you going?

458
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
Your Majesty,

459
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
do you know

460
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
what kind of life

461
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
my mother is living now?

462
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
Ying Er!

463
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
You don't have to go.

464
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
I just came back from Jialan.

465
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
Your mother...

466
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Your mother has left.

467
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Your Majesty,

468
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
what are you joking about?

469
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
How could my mother suddenly...

470
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
She died of a miscarriage.

471
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
She died of a miscarriage?

472
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Impossible.

473
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
Impossible.

474
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
Impossible.

475
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
What are you talking about?

476
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
Impossible.

477
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
What happened?

478
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Ying Er.

479
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
What happened?

480
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
Listen to me.

481
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
When I arrived,

482
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
she couldn't talk.

483
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
She asked me to give her this letter.

484
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
Mother,

485
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
I miss you very much.

486
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
I will definitely come back

487
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
when I'm 18 years old.

488
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
Your dinner is here.

489
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,560
Put it there.

490
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
Your Highness,

491
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
why is your voice...

492
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Your Highness,

493
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
I'm sorry.

494
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
I'm sorry.

495
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
I'm sorry.

496
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
I'm sorry.

497
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
I'm sorry.

498
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
I'm sorry.

499
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
I'm sorry.

500
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
I'm sorry.

501
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
It's okay.

502
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
It's okay.

503
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Ying Er sent me

504
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
a green jade deer.

505
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
You went to Mount Jiuli for five years

506
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,560
and you've mastered

507
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
such a profound magic.

508
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
You really let me

509
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
down.

510
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,560
But Ying Er,

511
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
don't think about

512
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
your mother anymore.

513
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
It's too dangerous.

514
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
They will be worried about you

515
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
until you're still alive.

516
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,560
I want you to be safe.

517
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,560
But I'm alive

518
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
is the biggest debt

519
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
to you.

520
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
Your Highness,

521
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Her Highness's voice

522
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
seems to have recovered.

523
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Really?

524
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
Who can protect her?

525
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,560
I have to investigate it

526
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
and report to His Majesty.

527
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
Ying Er,

528
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
everything I did

529
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
was to make you

530
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
live safely

531
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
on Mount Jiuli.

532
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
I don't need to take revenge

533
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
because no one

534
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
can hate me

535
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,560
but my daughter.

536
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
You're a good girl.

537
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,560
Don't be fooled by your emotions.

538
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
You've ruined your heart

539
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
and your mother's life.

540
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
When you learn

541
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
what you've learned,

542
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
you can use the magic

543
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
to save your mother.

544
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
I'm sorry.

545
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
I'm sorry.

546
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
I can only protect

547
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,560
the people with magic

548
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
with my own hands.

549
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,560
Ying Er,

550
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,560
you must avenge your mother.

551
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
It's all because of me.

552
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,560
I'm the one

553
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
who ruined my mother.

554
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,560
No.

555
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
Ying Er,

556
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,560
it's not your fault.

557
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,560
You can only blame those

558
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
who made your mother

559
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,560
suffer such a cruel death.

560
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
No.

561
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
It's my fault.

562
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
It's all my fault.

563
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
It's all my fault.

564
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
It's all my fault.

565
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Ying Er,

566
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
it's all my fault.

567
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Go to hell.

568
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
It's all my fault.

569
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Go to hell.

570
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Go to hell.

571
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Go to hell.

572
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
It's all my fault.

573
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
It's all my fault.

574
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
Your cultivation

575
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
has reached

576
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
the level of

577
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
moving the world with thought.

578
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Go to hell.

579
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
It's all my fault.

580
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
It's all my fault.

581
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
It's all my fault.

582
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Ying Er,

583
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
calm down.

584
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
Calm down.

585
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Control your heart.

586
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
The whole body is in the mountain.

587
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
You've hidden

588
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
many martial arts masters.

589
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
If you can't control

590
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
your own mind,

591
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:35,820
you'll be a fake

592
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,560
and a coward.

593
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
Mother.

594
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,560
Mother.

595
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Mother.

596
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,560
Mother.

597
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
Ying Er.

598
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
If you can use my death

599
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
to exchange for Bai Yan's life,

600
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
I won't hesitate.

601
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
It's his own choice.

602
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
In the end,

603
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,560
there are only you and me.

604
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,560
border moat

605
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,560
To protect you

606
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
from Crispy Red Lips

607
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,560
You are born

608
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
as a utilities officer

609
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
Yes.

610
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
So,

611
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
I know

612
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,840
I just wanted to take a walk before going to bed.

613
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,280
I was in a daze.

614
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,880
I didn't know where I was.

615
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,960
I don't know why I passed out.

616
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,480
I don't remember

617
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,560
what happened.

618
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,480
As the princess of the Bai clan,

619
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,400
how could you be so ignorant

620
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,040
about your behavior?

621
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,560
If the King of Qing knows this,

622
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,800
won't you have another reason

623
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,360
to break off the marriage?

624
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,200
If you think so,

625
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,120
I have no reason to disagree.

626
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,200
When Prince Shiyu is in the mountains,

627
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,440
please let me get closer to him

628
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,480
and get closer to you

629
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,880
to help me solve my problems.

630
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,520
You...

631
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,440
Your Highness.

632
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,240
This is the urgent medicine from Jialan.

633
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,560
You may leave.

634
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,320
Yes.

635
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,240
What's on your mind, Father?

636
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,000
I'll share your burden.

637
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,520
Bai Yan is gone.

638
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,040
He said he was in a state of suicide.

639
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,000
He couldn't bear the pain of the cold palace.

640
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,920
His Majesty is not in a good mood.

641
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
He is not as good as before.

642
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,400
When did your aunt die?

643
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,560
At midnight last night.

644
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,280
Maybe my aunt's death

645
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,720
is my chance.

646
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
I see.

647
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,600
I was in a daze last night.

648
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
It was midnight.

649
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,960
I think I have a feeling

650
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,160
about my aunt's death.

651
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,160
Before the accident,

652
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,960
I often accompanied my aunt in the palace.

653
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,680
She praised me for being smart

654
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,440
and that I would be a noble

655
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,080
and be the leader of the central palace.

656
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,280
I felt something when she died.

657
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,400
I think

658
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,480
it's a destiny of heaven.

659
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,320
Although Xue Lu is not from a good family,

660
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,680
he is more intelligent than Xue Ying.

661
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,640
Maybe

662
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,240
he can really become the Crown Princess Consort.

663
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,600
Xue Lu, get up.

664
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,240
Come.

665
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,440
Yes.

666
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,400
Ask the kitchen to add a bowl of bird's nest soup

667
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,840
to Xue Lu.

668
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,800
Yes.

669
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:55,800
Father.

670
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,800
I want to listen to the discussion.

671
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,760
Xue Lu, you have worked hard.

672
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,240
Have a bowl of bird's nest soup to calm your nerves.

673
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,800
Who is the next queen?

674
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,160
It directly concerns the survival of our Bai clan.

675
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Xue Ying is a soft-hearted child.

676
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,920
Xue Lu.

677
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,160
You are the one I like the most.

678
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,000
Thank you for your consideration.

679
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,280
Ying, sit up.

680
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Ming'er, get up.

681
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
Your mother's spirit in heaven

682
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,280
will not be able to see you

683
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
in such a state of lost soul.

684
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
I will not let you

685
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,280
see you in such a state of lost soul.

686
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
It's all my fault.

687
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,280
I sent my mother to the hell.

688
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
I caused her to die.

689
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,280
It's all my fault.

690
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,280
You wake up.

691
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Your mother said in the letter

692
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
that she hoped you were dead.

693
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
But you are a son.

694
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
You should know

695
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
how to do something for your

696
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
mother who died in the cold.

697
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Listen to me.

698
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
When you are eighteen years old,

699
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
you will be out of the hell

700
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,280
when you break your precepts.

701
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Then I will

702
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,280
give you the name of Shao Si Ming.

703
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
After ten days,

704
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
when your cultivation

705
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
reaches the real state,

706
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
you can take off your robe

707
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
and return to your home

708
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
to take back your position.

709
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
You have to take all the

710
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
humiliation

711
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
that your mother has received

712
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,280
back to the victims.

713
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,280
Take back all the things

714
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
she lost.

715
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,280
Do you understand?

716
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Take back?

717
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
I caused her to die.

718
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
It's me.

719
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
I caused her to die.

720
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
How can I take back?

721
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
How can I take back?

722
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,280
How can I take back?

723
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
How can I take back?

724
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Seeing Ying Er in this state,

725
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
I can only remember for a long time.

726
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
Ying Er.

727
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
After half an hour,

728
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
the six tribes will have a meeting in the hall.

729
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
How will they treat your mother?

730
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
If you have a heart,

731
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
you can see it yourself.

732
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,280
I have received

733
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,280
the donations from all the princes.

734
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Now I will announce

735
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,280
the results of the competition.

736
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,280
Your Majesty.

737
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Now I will announce

738
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
the contributions of the empress.

739
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
The new emperor

740
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
has donated

741
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
3,000 sheep,

742
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
3,000 cows,

743
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
and 3,000 winter pearls.

744
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
10,000 vases of gold,

745
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,280
900 vases of spring wine,

746
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,280
10 eggs of broken tea,

747
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
and thousands of lamps at night.

748
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
The late empress has donated

749
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,280
100,000 smoke.

750
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
Minister,

751
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
I heard it right, right?

752
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
How can the white smoke

753
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,280
be treated by the empress?

754
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Although the white smoke has been abolished,

755
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,280
it is also a legitimate word

756
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
written into the empress's single book.

757
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,280
To pay tribute to the empress of the past generation,

758
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,280
she is not at fault in it.

759
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
This is a bad word.

760
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,280
The white smoke

761
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
was consumed by the charcoal fire

762
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,280
and committed suicide for the crime.

763
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
His Majesty

764
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,280
buried it in the house

765
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,280
in a hurry

766
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
and left it in the house.

767
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,280
It was not in the palace.

768
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
His Majesty's attitude

769
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
is obvious.

770
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
He doesn't want to admit the empress.

771
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
The people who donated

772
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,280
are all virtuous people.

773
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
Even in the palace,

774
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,280
there is no place for the white smoke to be used.

775
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
How can there be

776
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,280
her position in the ceremony?

777
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
What do you think?

778
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
I agree.

779
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
Brother Qing,

780
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280
you are right.

781
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,280
Since you are the criminal

782
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,280
that His Majesty despises,

783
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,280
of course you can't treat him with courtesy.

784
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
Brother Bai,

785
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,280
what do you think?

786
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
Criminal?

787
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,280
He

788
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
doesn't deserve it.

789
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
This...

790
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,280
This...

791
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,280
All right.

792
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
In Jiuyi Mountain,

793
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,280
it's all out of the ordinary.

794
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,280
I don't know about the changes in the court.

795
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
It's not a fault.

796
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
Minister,

797
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
according to the order of the ancestors,

798
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,280
the court will be closed.

799
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,280
Yes.

800
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,280
Erase the name.

801
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,280
Shen Pu,

802
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,280
bring the brush.

803
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,280
Go.

804
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,280
Leave.

805
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
Continue.

806
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,280
The Great Earth

807
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,280
is equipped with a thousand sheep,

808
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,280
a thousand cows,

809
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,280
a thousand gold, ten-tonne fox,

810
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,280
nine hundred big ponds,

811
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,280
and a hundred thousand night lights.

812
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Ying,

813
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,280
I want you to see

814
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,280
how cruel the world is.

815
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,280
You will understand

816
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,280
my two-hearted heart.

817
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,280
Your Highness,

818
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,280
please take the medicine.

819
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,280
The so-called pot is like sand.

820
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,280
The empress deliberately made a mistake.

821
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,280
Even in the palace of the emperor,

822
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,280
there is no place for Bai Yan to hide.

823
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,280
Then how can there be his position

824
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,280
above the memorial?

825
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,280
I want you to be safe.

826
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,280
I want you to be safe.

827
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,280
I want you to be safe.

828
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,280
I want you to be safe.

829
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,280
I want you to be safe.

830
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
I want you to be safe.

831
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,280
But I live

832
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,280
for the biggest debt of your life.

833
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,280
You let me protect the world.

834
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,280
But did you see

835
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
the world is so cruel?

836
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,280
These ruthless people

837
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,280
don't deserve

838
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,280
your mercy and forgiveness.

839
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,280
I want revenge.

840
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,280
Shi Ying.

841
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
Shi Ying, what's wrong?

842
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,280
Get out of my way.

843
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,280
I'm sorry.

844
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,280
I'm sorry.

845
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,280
I'm sorry.

846
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,280
I'm sorry.

847
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,280
I'm sorry.

848
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,280
I'm sorry.

849
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,280
I'm sorry.

850
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,280
I'm sorry.

851
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,280
I'm sorry.

852
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,280
I'm sorry.

853
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,280
I'm sorry.

854
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,280
I'm sorry.

855
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,280
I'm sorry.

856
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,280
I'm sorry.

857
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,280
I'm sorry.

858
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,280
I'm sorry.

859
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,280
I'm sorry.

860
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,280
I'm sorry.

861
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,280
I'm sorry.

862
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,280
I'm sorry.

863
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,280
I'm sorry.

864
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,280
I'm sorry.

865
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,280
I'm sorry.

866
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
I'm sorry.

867
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,280
I'm sorry.

868
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,280
I'm sorry.

869
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,280
I'm sorry.

870
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,280
I'm sorry.

871
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,280
I'm sorry.

872
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,280
I'm sorry.

873
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,280
I'm sorry.

874
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,280
I'm sorry.

875
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,280
I'm sorry.

876
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,280
I'm sorry.

877
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,280
I'm sorry.

878
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,280
I'm sorry.

879
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,280
I'm sorry.

880
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,280
I'm sorry.

881
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,280
I'm sorry.

882
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,280
I'm sorry.

883
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:55,280
I want to be with you

884
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,280
I want to be with you

885
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,280
I want to be with you

886
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,280
I want to be with you

887
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,280
I want to be with you

888
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,280
I want to be with you

889
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,280
I want to be with you

890
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,280
I want to be with you
