1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
I want to know that.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm willing to be a flower, a star

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm willing to be a flower, a star

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm willing to be a flower, a star

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm willing to be a flower, a star

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When the moonlight rises

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll be the one to bloom

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll be the one to bloom

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I wish that time could fly by

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I wish that time could fly by

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Give me a life of shining beauty

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm willing to be a flower, a star

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm willing to be a flower, a star

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm willing to be a flower, a star

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Eunuch, as I spend the night for you

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Your name meant a lot to me

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Please recover my heart

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
as you My first love

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He said that Princess Wang

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
is like a fire in the mortal world

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and is buried in the mountains of Jiguang.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yan'er,

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Qing Gang is a talented and outstanding person.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Even though you don't have a relationship with a man and a woman,

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
if you get along with each other for a long time,

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
your relationship will naturally get better and better.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yan'er,

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
the nine-dress clothes are all given as a gift.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It proves that your master still recognizes Qing Gang.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Your Highness, Princess Consort,

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I will take my leave.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Madam Shen, please.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Please.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Please.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Madam Shen, please.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Please.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Your Highness, Princess Consort,

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
something bad has happened.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The Princess snatched the horse

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and broke out of the mansion.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What?

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
His Majesty is troubling Princess Consort because his Majesty wants to protect Crown Princess.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If Can ThouЖew Come creating upon it,

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
you will cause a problem all over the country

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
but்

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Boss,

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have everything you asked.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I will even army all your countrymen

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and soldiers to impeach him.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Your Highness.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,200
You know how to build an empty warehouse.

54
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,520
And you're so good at it.

55
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,880
Who taught you that?

56
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,440
If you go back with me,

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,360
I'll answer all your questions.

58
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,120
Your Highness,

59
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,000
your Yuan's Mansion is right here.

60
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,080
You can tell me anything.

61
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,880
Aren't you going to leave, too?

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,280
Are you going to leave me, too?

63
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,200
No.

64
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,720
I'll be with you.

65
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,520
But...

66
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,120
why did Master do that?

67
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,640
Young Minister, he's a Taoist.

68
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,120
But you were born in Hong Chen.

69
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,680
You're destined to go through

70
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,080
all the hardships.

71
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,880
The marriage of Qingchi

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,840
is the will of your parents.

73
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,320
Since you can't stop it,

74
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,560
you have to live with him.

75
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,280
But at least,

76
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,960
he can stop writing the marriage certificate.

77
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,000
I didn't expect him to do that.

78
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,240
I thought he would understand me.

79
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,800
Yuan, no matter what,

80
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,520
I'll never marry Qinggang.

81
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,960
I know that if I go back now,

82
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,240
my parents will be more obedient than me.

83
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,400
Do you have any way

84
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,720
to stop these troubles?

85
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,200
If you really don't want to go back,

86
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
I have a place

87
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,880
for you to stay for a few days.

88
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,320
When you and Master are all calm,

89
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,880
we'll discuss it.

90
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,760
Yours, Yuaniliyor.

91
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,720
Calm down.

92
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,240
The beautiful bride is born.

93
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,320
Be careful,Yuan ratio.

94
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,520
Why do you suddenly

95
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,360
go to drag business with the finished Apply for marriage.

96
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,480
Look.

97
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,880
Thank you.

98
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,120
Madam, have some water

99
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,000
Thank you, miss

100
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,560
Madam, you have lived here for a long time, right?

101
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,240
More than two hundred years

102
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,880
You have seen it

103
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,600
We are all useless people

104
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,280
We can only starve to death if we are out of town

105
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,640
If it weren't for the shelter of the benefactors, we would have starved to death long ago

106
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,600
More than two hundred years

107
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,120
I have been living a peaceful and peaceful life

108
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:34,320
I didn't expect that I would be punished for the first time

109
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,320
I haven't come back for a long time

110
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
I don't know what will happen

111
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,000
Officer Yuan, you have been here for two hundred years, right?

112
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,560
Even more than my birthday

113
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,280
No one knows the rules in the mansion better than you

114
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,480
You even made the most of it

115
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,520
You are the one who taught the rules to others

116
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,040
I didn't expect it

117
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,840
In the end, you broke the rules

118
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,320
Do you forget what the crime is?

119
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,000
I know it

120
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,800
But she doesn't want to marry

121
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,720
I hope you won't force her

122
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,320
You

123
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,120
I am not the до煎熬

124
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,520
Yan'er is a**hole

125
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,400
We didn't find a suitable man for her

126
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,400
Do you want to see Yan'er die alone?

127
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,280
Don't still think you can heartsick

128
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,720
No matter I grew up seeing you

129
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Your Highness, please rest assured.

130
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,240
Her Highness is safe with me.

131
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,840
But before she is willing to go home,

132
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,720
I will not reveal her whereabouts.

133
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,720
I am willing to take any punishment from you.

134
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Okay.

135
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,440
Okay.

136
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,680
Guards.

137
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,560
Your Highness,

138
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,200
beat him to death!

139
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,240
Yes.

140
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,760
Father.

141
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,640
Ah Yue, you are back.

142
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,320
My Lady.

143
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,200
Ah Yue.

144
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,000
I...

145
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,720
Why are you hurt so badly?

146
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,240
Was my father the one who sent a person to beat you?

147
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,720
It was a minor injury.

148
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Don't worry.

149
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,760
Please don't blame Prince for it,

150
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,320
She just can't see you go back.

151
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,480
She's just anxious.

152
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,720
It's all my fault.

153
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,960
You didn't get me into trouble before.

154
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,560
But if you put your tears

155
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,040
into my wound now,

156
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,880
it'll really hurt me.

157
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,440
Have you ever heard of salt sprinkling on wounds?

158
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,720
A'Yuan,

159
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,240
I'm not familiar with this.

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,520
If it hurts you,

161
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,560
you should tell me.

162
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,560
It's okay.

163
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

164
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,280
A'Yuan,

165
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,400
you promised to tell me

166
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,160
why you know swordplay.

167
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,560
Can you tell me now?

168
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,480
She taught me

169
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,000
how to use sword.

170
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,040
She

171
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
is your lover

172
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,480
that A'Yuan mentioned to me before.

173
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,520
So,

174
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,640
she's also A'Yuan's master.

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,840
A'Yuan

176
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,280
met a good master.

177
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,560
Actually, your master is also for your own good.

178
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,720
You can't

179
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,280
practice on the footwear forever.

180
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,400
But he promised me before.

181
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,520
You know it in your heart.

182
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,040
You can't do that, either.

183
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,360
If you want to,

184
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,680
Qinggang is a good choice.

185
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,000
I think

186
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,120
your master thinks so, too.

187
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,640
Actually, I know

188
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,360
if we're talking about marriage,

189
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,000
Qinggang is my best home.

190
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,280
But if you're my master,

191
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,760
what will you do?

192
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,200
Will you give him

193
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,560
a wedding gift

194
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,600
like he did?

195
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,280
You won't.

196
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,000
You'll come to Tianjinfeng City

197
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,360
to persuade me and talk me into it.

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,520
If I really don't want to,

199
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,720
you'll find a way

200
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,320
to help me get out of this marriage.

201
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,440
Maybe everyone has a different personality.

202
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
And the way you behave is different.

203
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,080
No.

204
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,920
I have a different position in your heart.

205
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,120
I thought

206
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,200
my relationship with my master

207
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
was as close as A'Yuan's.

208
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,120
We could talk about everything.

209
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,000
But in your heart,

210
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,760
I'm an outsider.

211
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,760
Once I'm out of the picture,

212
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,080
I'll have nothing to do with him

213
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,760
and I'll be lost.

214
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,400
Actually, I've figured it out.

215
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,120
I won't have any more dreams.

216
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,880
I hope my master

217
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,880
can break the mirror in Jiuyi Mountain soon.

218
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,120
It's good that you think so.

219
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,560
At least you'll feel better.

220
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,560
A'Yuan.

221
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,640
In this world,

222
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,720
except for my parents,

223
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,920
you're the closest person to me.

224
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,240
I can only accompany you and listen to you.

225
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,520
But the prince and the princess

226
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,040
are really thinking about you.

227
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Why don't you go and talk to the prince?

228
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,840
Calm down and tell him what you think.

229
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,840
The prince is here.

230
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,040
Your Highness.

231
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,120
Special Envoy, it's tough to leave.

232
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,280
The nozzle is here.

233
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,800
Please come in to ink for Rogue Aました.

234
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,280
Open.

235
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,200
The Prince.

236
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,760
Well.

237
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,760
Well.

238
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,040
rope.

239
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,440
Nothing.

240
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,960
Clear it up.

241
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,480
Clear it up.

242
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,840
Wait...

243
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Go...

244
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,360
SRC Tigers,

245
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,920
don't you dare step foot in their business.

246
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,200
Also,

247
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,120
go, catch them alive,

248
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,000
hurry,

249
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,160
and then rush to theIA Deep.

250
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,080
We haven't done the good deed of the Qingliang clan yet.

251
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,720
The military surrender

252
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,040
will be empty.

253
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,960
You've been doing this for a long time.

254
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,520
Are you playing tricks on us?

255
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,600
My brothers

256
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,120
have already gone down the drain.

257
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,880
Isn't this forcing us to rebel?

258
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,520
Right?

259
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes.

260
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,960
You're so arrogant.

261
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,680
Are you threatening Jialan?

262
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,400
I...

263
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,360
Stop talking.

264
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,000
Come.

265
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,560
Chi Song.

266
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,480
Your Highness.

267
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,360
Go back to the mansion.

268
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,480
Please send the food

269
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,120
to the army to save the country.

270
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,920
Hurry up.

271
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,640
Your Highness.

272
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,960
The Princess has already told us

273
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,040
to send the food to the army.

274
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,320
There's no food left now.

275
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,820
Sir.

276
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,680
It's a big thing

277
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,000
that the army has been so unstable.

278
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,480
Could you please help me as well?

279
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,400
Please send the food

280
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,080
as soon as possible, Your Highness.

281
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,840
Please.

282
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,000
I am begging you, Your Highness.

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,320
I've played along.

284
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,440
It comes to nothing

285
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,520
even if we sign the engagement.

286
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
I've already said it.

287
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
If the engagement doesn't work,

288
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,520
there's no money.

289
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,520
An army can't even fight a battle.

290
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,520
This flag

291
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
is a disgrace to the people.

292
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
You!

293
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
What are you doing?

294
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Are you going to rebel?

295
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
What are you doing?

296
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Stop it!

297
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,520
Your Highness!

298
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
Your Highness!

299
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
You're forcing us to die!

300
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,520
This is a crime to destroy the entire clan!

301
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
Destroy the entire clan?

302
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,520
We have to be prepared to be destroyed!

303
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Stop!

304
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Yan'er!

305
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,520
Father!

306
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
Why didn't you tell me earlier

307
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
that you were bearing such a heavy burden?

308
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Isn't it just a marriage between the Qingchi and Liang clans?

309
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Go back and tell your master.

310
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Tell him that Zhu Yan has agreed.

311
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Yan'er!

312
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Your Highness, this is...

313
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
Open it and take a look.

314
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
This silver hairpin was made by me

315
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
when I was looking for someone

316
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,520
to give me as my concubine.

317
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Do you still like it?

318
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Your Highness,

319
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
this hairpin is really exquisite.

320
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
You are also a smart person.

321
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
You should know my feelings.

322
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
Actually,

323
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
no matter it's a real or fake hairpin,

324
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
it's still a good thing.

325
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
I'm not lying.

326
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
I'm just being honest.

327
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,520
Actually,

328
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
no matter it's a real or fake hairpin,

329
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
it's still not important.

330
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
What do you think?

331
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,520
I only do things for Your Highness.

332
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,520
I have no other thoughts.

333
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
I don't care about fake or fake hairpins.

334
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
Your Highness,

335
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
General Qinggang is here.

336
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Since Your Highness still has something to do,

337
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
I'll take my leave.

338
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
You don't have to leave.

339
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Let him in.

340
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Yes.

341
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
I'm leaving.

342
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

343
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
I've already known

344
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
about Zhu Yan's wedding.

345
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
But General Qinggang, don't worry.

346
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,520
Prince of Chizhi will accept it sooner or later.

347
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Your Highness,

348
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
I'm here

349
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,520
to ask Your Highness to take back the post.

350
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
I don't want to marry

351
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Princess of Chizhi.

352
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
Aren't you and Zhu Yan

353
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
quite close?

354
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
Why don't you want to marry her?

355
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
I do have a good relationship with her.

356
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
But it's not a love between a son and a daughter.

357
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,520
She's not the one I love.

358
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,520
I'm willing to sacrifice my life for Qing clan.

359
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
But if I marry Qing,

360
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
I'm still willing to

361
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,520
be loyal to the one I love.

362
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
Xiao Lu.

363
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
Listen.

364
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
General Qinggang

365
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,520
has the one he loves.

366
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
I want to know

367
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
who the woman you love

368
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
is.

369
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
Luohua has a reason.

370
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
She's so beautiful.

371
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
That's why I'm here.

372
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,040
The flowers are beautiful, the water is clear.

373
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,400
I have no feelings for the person I love.

374
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,200
I'm determined to

375
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,840
be the one I love.

376
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,640
I can't change

377
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,120
my own mind.

378
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,680
I only hope Qing can get what she wants.

379
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,800
But I don't want to give up my idea.

380
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,480
I don't want to marry her forever.

381
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,760
I want to spend my life

382
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,360
alone in prison.

383
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,040
How dare you!

384
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,120
What are you talking about?

385
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,080
Aren't you afraid that I'll take

386
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,320
your position as the general of the Yingwu Division?

387
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,240
I'm willing to be punished.

388
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,880
You...

389
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,920
Calm down, Your Highness.

390
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,080
I'm angry with myself

391
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,680
for this.

392
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,600
General Qing,

393
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,680
you're so stupid.

394
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,640
Among the six branches of the School of Law,

395
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,200
there are many young talents

396
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,840
who are eager to be the general of the Yingwu Division.

397
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,320
It's because you're brave and good at fighting,

398
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,440
the Yingwu Division is loyal to you,

399
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,800
and Consort Qing and the Qing family are loyal to you.

400
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,400
They haven't found a chance to win.

401
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,640
But now,

402
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,520
you give up everything because of your own idea.

403
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,880
You gave those

404
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,200
who are not ambitious enough to be the general of the six branches a chance.

405
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,120
You've been

406
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,280
destroying Moji since then.

407
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,240
But

408
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,040
don't blame me, Your Highness.

409
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,280
I've seen it with my own eyes.

410
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,800
General Qing is not a person who knows no right or wrong

411
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,160
and doesn't know the right and wrong.

412
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,800
But that Princess Zhu Yan,

413
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,400
who is so lucky to be the general of the Qing family,

414
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,920
is always spoiled and has no one in her heart.

415
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,600
It seems that she's very difficult to deal with.

416
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,760
It's because she doesn't agree to this marriage,

417
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,840
so I'll ask General Qing to come out

418
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,000
and cover for her.

419
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,480
This matter is not about Princess Zhu Yan.

420
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,360
It's about Qing Gang...

421
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,640
The envoy of the imperial guards is here.

422
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,880
Greetings, Your Highness.

423
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,600
I have something important to report.

424
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,120
What is it?

425
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,360
What?

426
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,160
Zhu Yan agreed to the marriage?

427
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,640
Grand Bun,

428
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,160
is this

429
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,640
the bottom of your heart?

430
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,600
As you wish.

431
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
Now

432
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,760
I'm going to marry Qing Gang.

433
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:25,120
music

434
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:33,580
After this, these Nine also are to be sacrificed.

435
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,260
Can't you work any more?

436
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,260
I will rest for now,

437
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,240
since you are a Dau many years ago,

438
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,400
I will still try to change my ways.

439
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,360
If I tried to change my ways,

440
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,200
I'm sorry.

441
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,800
Xu Xuan Shu.

442
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,800
What's wrong with you?

443
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,760
What's going on?

444
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,080
Why can't I get in?

445
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,480
Yes.

446
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
Without the blessing of the Three-Divine Law,

447
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,360
I can't enter the barrier

448
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,000
and you can't see me.

449
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,000
Why don't you let me in?

450
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,480
Yan Er.

451
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,560
Let me in.

452
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,800
You're still so silly.

453
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,960
Xu Xuan Shu.

454
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,920
Don't waste your energy.

455
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,040
Okay.

456
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,720
Master sent me the wedding tree.

457
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,280
Now I can't get in here.

458
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,080
Master.

459
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,520
Master.

460
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm going to marry someone.

461
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,120
Do you hear me?

462
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,000
Your only disciple is going to marry someone.

463
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,880
You'll never see him again.

464
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,400
Master.

465
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
I know.

466
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,520
Once you leave,

467
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,840
you'll never come back.

468
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,240
Master.

469
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,560
Why don't you let me in?

470
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,560
Okay.

471
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,080
You still sent me the wedding tree.

472
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,880
Let's drink the wedding wine together.

473
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,320
I'll send you the wedding invitation.

474
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,200
Please. Please.

475
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,720
Master.

476
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,720
Master.

477
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,760
Master, do you really want me to marry someone?

478
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,880
Do you really not want to see me again?

479
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,200
Do you really...

480
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,040
really not care about me anymore?

481
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,560
In your heart,

482
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,960
I'm still an outsider.

483
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,480
How could I?

484
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,360
You're the person I care about the most in the city.

485
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,480
But...

486
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,560
But I can't keep you by my side

487
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,160
and drag you and your family into this.

488
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,560
But Master.

489
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,040
I'm so worried about you.

490
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,000
When you were the Crown Prince,

491
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,760
you were alone.

492
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,600
You were alone.

493
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,760
Now, it's you.

494
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,840
You're alone.

495
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,680
No matter what happens,

496
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,640
you can only be alone.

497
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,400
Master.

498
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,000
From now on,

499
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,280
I can't be with you anymore.

500
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,600
When you're alone,

501
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,280
remember to smile.

502
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,680
Be happy.

503
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,280
You should...

504
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,000
yourself.

505
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,760
Don't ever think that

506
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,320
I'm the master that made you feel sad.

507
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,720
Master.

508
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,280
I will be your husband.

509
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,680
I will be your wife.

510
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,880
Xuan Shu.

511
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,080
It's true.

512
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,480
These words are not enough to see me and Teacher getting old.

513
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,680
It's good that you say goodbye.

514
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,680
Goodbye,

515
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Xuan Shu.

516
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,880
It's good that you say goodbye.

517
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,480
It's good that you say goodbye.

518
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,080
It's good that you say goodbye.

519
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,480
It's good that you say goodbye.

520
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,480
It's good that you say goodbye.

521
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,280
It's good that you say goodbye.

522
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,880
It's good that you say goodbye.

523
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:20,880
Missing you, I was engraved in my heart.

524
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,480
Chasing after your light,

525
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,280
the life is like a shadow following the star.

526
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:40,880
It's also me who has gained courage for you.

527
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,480
I will search for you for you.

528
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,680
I will be your husband.

529
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,680
Yan Er, goodbye.

530
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,480
It's engraved in my heart.

531
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Missing you, I was engraved in my heart.

532
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,880
It's also me who has gained courage for you.

533
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,880
I will search for you.

534
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,680
I will ask your father to fly to Jialan

535
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,840
to strengthen the defense

536
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,600
to prevent more soldiers from entering the empty pit.

537
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,880
But there

538
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,160
should be no one we are looking for.

539
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,120
Let's go.

540
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,320
Let's go to Xifeng County.

541
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,320
In my opinion,

542
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,520
we should go to Xihuang first.

543
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
We must pass by Tianji and Fengcheng in Sun Moon Lake.

544
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,320
We can also take a look at Xiao Yan.

545
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,040
There are many children missing near Sun Moon Lake.

546
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,120
There are many children missing.

547
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,720
There should be a difference

548
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,120
between the number of children.

549
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,400
Then let's pass by Tianji and Fengcheng.

550
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,920
Don't bother her.

551
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,280
It depends on how I fly.

552
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,600
Princess.

553
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,360
You agreed to marry Qingzu.

554
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,160
It means you have grown up.

555
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,720
Actually, it's not that you need me.

556
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,480
It's that I can't let you go.

557
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,040
I can see that you have a good family.

558
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,720
I know you are really happy.

559
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,960
I have an explanation for everyone.

560
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,920
It's not like that, Yuan.

561
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,400
You have done so much for me.

562
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,600
I also hope to do something for you.

563
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,080
Qing Gui,

564
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,440
one more thing.

565
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,040
Xihuang.

566
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,360
Don't accept the marriage proposal here.

567
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,440
Princess.

568
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,960
What are you doing?

569
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,880
I can find her name

570
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,480
by just drinking it.

571
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,520
When I was in the most painful time,

572
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,080
she was the only one who knew my worries

573
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,640
and spent the most difficult time with me.

574
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,640
I really miss her every day.

575
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,120
But she is an empty-minded woman.

576
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,760
She has passed away for many years.

577
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,720
I'm sorry, Yuan.

578
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,840
I have made you sad again.

579
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,240
It's been two hundred years.

580
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,360
I've sent away too many people.

581
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,600
I've seen the farewell of life and death.

582
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,160
Thank you for your concern.

583
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,200
Why don't you

584
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,360
teach me how to draw the paper crane?

585
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,280
After we pass away,

586
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,160
we will return to Biluohai.

587
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,000
I want to draw some paper cranes

588
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,560
and fly to Biluohai

589
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,240
to find my old friends.

590
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,040
It's a kind of comfort.

591
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,280
Okay.

592
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,640
The paper crane

593
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,040
May Yuan's old friends

594
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,760
rest in peace.

595
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,800
Yaoyi,

596
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,320
have you seen the paper crane in the sky?

597
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,760
I made an appointment with you

598
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,840
to meet in the next life.

599
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,080
But it's only been two hundred years.

600
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,720
I always miss the other person.

601
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:42,960
I'm sorry.

602
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,320
What should I do

603
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,800
to make Yuan feel better?

604
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,320
By the way, Yuan,

605
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,000
you always carry this with you.

606
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,800
Is it also

607
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,840
the gift he gave you?

608
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:01,960
Yes.

609
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,520
This is my most precious thing.

610
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,460
Part 1

611
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,440
Maybe

612
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,240
only when I let him see

613
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,680
the one in the heart

614
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,920
can he get comfort.

615
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:11,140
Feeling like watering should also be done from a hill-hold,

616
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,500
don't sleep.

617
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,220
A porcupine

618
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,820
My comforter said

619
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
one midday morning in Niezu

620
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,520
I sprayed water as the air was so

621
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,160
I hope you can feel better when you see this girl.

622
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Where is it?

623
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
Yuan.

624
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,920
omic

625
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,380
You are

626
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,260
I am back

627
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,100
You're back.

628
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:32,860
You...

629
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,300
Yue,

630
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,780
I'm really back.

631
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,220
Impossible.

632
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,860
It can't be you.

633
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,700
Yue,

634
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,780
am I dreaming?

635
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,380
I saw the paper you wrote me.

636
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,420
So I came back to you.

637
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,580
Did the pearl

638
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,460
bring Yang Yi back?

639
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,820
Yue,

640
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,500
why are you so worried?

641
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,020
Tell me.

642
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,620
Let me share your burden.

643
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,780
Yang Yi.

644
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,900
It seems that the spell is effective.

645
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,420
Look up the clouds.

646
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,140
Look at the stars.

647
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,980
Blue clouds.

648
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,940
In my dream,

649
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,940
won't you make me see you for again?

650
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,020
Because of my dream,

651
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,700
许愿!

652
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,060
You...

653
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,060
Even if I die,

654
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,500
I would rather never fall in love again.

655
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,220
What's going on?

656
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:51,860
Yes.

657
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,820
What are you doing?

658
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,220
Father, I...

659
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,700
She's not the one.

660
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,740
I know it.

661
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,620
A'Yuan.

662
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,940
How dare you insult the princess?

663
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,780
Father, it's not A'Yuan's fault.

664
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,060
It's all my fault.

665
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,900
Captain, I'm sorry to bother you.

666
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,220
Your Majesty.

667
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,420
Your Majesty.

668
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,620
Your Majesty.

669
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,820
Your Majesty.

670
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,020
Your Majesty.

671
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,220
Your Majesty.

672
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,420
Your Majesty.

673
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,620
Your Majesty.

674
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,820
Your Majesty.

675
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,020
Your Majesty.

676
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,220
Your Majesty.

677
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,420
Your Majesty.

678
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,620
Your Majesty.

679
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,820
Your Majesty.

680
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,020
Your Majesty.

681
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,220
Your Majesty.

682
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,420
Your Majesty.

683
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,620
Your Majesty.

684
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,220
Your Majesty.

685
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,820
Your Majesty.

686
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,020
Your Majesty.

687
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,220
Your Majesty.

688
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,420
Your Majesty.

689
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,620
Your Majesty.

690
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,820
Your Majesty.

691
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,020
Your Majesty.

692
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,220
Your Majesty.

693
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,420
Your Majesty.

694
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,620
Your Majesty.

695
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,820
Your Majesty.

696
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,420
Your Majesty.

697
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,020
Your Majesty.

698
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,620
Your Majesty.

699
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,220
Your Majesty.

700
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,820
Your Majesty.

701
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,420
Your Majesty.

702
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,020
Your Majesty.

703
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,620

00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,020
Your Majesty.

712
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,460
Princess.

713
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,620
Your Majesty.

714
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,220
Your Majesty.

715
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,020

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,220
Your Majesty.

717
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,420
Your Majesty.

718
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,220
clever.

719
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,420
Quick.

720
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,740
Your Majesty,

721
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,740
The End
