1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to be with you in this life

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Give me a life of shining fortune

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want to be with you in this life

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to be with you in this life

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But I ask you to give me the courage

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I want to be with you in this life

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want to be with you in this life

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let you and me, the first meeting

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
engraved in my heart

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The power can only be suppressed in the fingertips

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It also needs you to not play cards in the field

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Can believe in the fire butterfly

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's a good luck that you are not strong

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Young Si Ming

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Whose handkerchief did you wear

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He doesn't know

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Was it yours just now

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't know

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But it looks a little like

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What is this

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Red light

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It seems that the handkerchief of Zhu Yan has changed

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Master, look

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Shao Si Ming used your handkerchief to demonstrate

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Really Zhu Yan's

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Really red

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
With the effect of the spiritual teacher's grass

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Everyone saw the reaction of the heart

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If you talk about the firm mind

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No one can remember the life of the young Si Ming in the mountain

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Do you have a challenger?

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll come first

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
it is good

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What are you doing

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Who else is willing to ask for advice

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
A Yan, you go

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Forget it, I won't go

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Shao Si Ming

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Small tricks

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
How will Shao Si Ming be shaken

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
High-level students

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Can practice with each other

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Start practicing

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm not afraid

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm not afraid

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm not afraid

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm not afraid

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm not afraid

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm not afraid

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm not afraid

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm not afraid

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Start practicing

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Start

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What to do

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Go and talk about it

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Go

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's really Qing Gang

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The mind is so firm

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Qing Gang's wrist is not moving

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
General Qin

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What is it?

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Look, it's moving

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Move

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's a good move

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's moving

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I knew General Qin must like the snow road

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
General Qin is blushing

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
General Qin

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You have to practice more with Shao Si Ming

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why did you leave, General Qin

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
General Qin

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is the famous memory of the doctor

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Come on, try it

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Come on, move

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Come on, try it

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What to try

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's moving

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Look at mine

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Shao Si Ming

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you for choosing the bracelet I made

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't think it's simple

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Only one came out

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Push in

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Go in

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hurry up, try it

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is it good?

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Like this

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Look at me

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Shao Si Ming

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Why are you looking at me like this

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Could it be

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You like me

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Try again

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's okay

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Go on

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Good

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I can't scare you like this

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's so strong

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hold on

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's coming

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What's going on

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why is it suddenly coming

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Everyone

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There is a thunder in the mountain

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm afraid it's about to rain

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's all for today's class

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Please go back and study hard

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Gathering the spiritual stones is the basis of all magic

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Thank you, Shao Si Ming

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Go, go, go

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Try again

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Who

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Go

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Although I don't know what I said

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Even the thunder was shocked

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I said she was the daughter of the fate

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Even if she is not

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's also the stepping stone on her future path

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Little shadow

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Fortunately, I have the name of the immortal

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I gave you fruit

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What's going on

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I obviously learned it according to this new law

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But why can't I calm down

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You can't calm down

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Because you have too many thoughts in your heart

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We practitioners

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The most favorite is that there are thoughts in your heart

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You and I

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Why did Shao Si Ming come here

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is where I practice

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Then I'll give you this position

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll go

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This place is so spacious

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Not much more than me

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Maybe I will imitate Shao Si Ming's magic

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
His spiritual stone grass ring will stop moving

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Don't talk

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Do you know that the magic of spiritual stone is the most basic magic

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Everyone else has learned

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Then now is my last student

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But I can definitely learn

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't move, don't move

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Get some air

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Shao Si Ming, what's going on

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You sit by my side

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm more confused

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
strange

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What's going on with this weather

155
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Since this fish has fallen

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why don't you learn to use spiritual stones to carry out the rain?

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Of course

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Spiritual stone through the rain

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I heard that as long as the body is fast

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Can pass through the rain and the rain

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No water is stuck

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What's the difficulty

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You can do it too

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Shao Si Ming

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm afraid I can't do it

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I have to make it

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I have to make it

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I have to make it

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I have to make it

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have to make it

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I have to make it

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I have to make it

173
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Shao Si Ming, don't laugh at me

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I can't even learn the most basic meditation

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
How can I pass through the rain and the wind?

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You pay attention

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let your consciousness follow this grass ring

178
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Pass through the rain and the wind

179
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You remember

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Even if the sky falls down, you don't care

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
In your eyes

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Only this grass ring

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Even if the sky falls down, you don't care

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
In your eyes

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Only this grass ring

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I can do it

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I actually did it

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Although you are the last one

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But I also congratulate you

190
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Thank you Shao Si Ming

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Shao Si Ming

192
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Shao Si Ming

193
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Is it you

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Caught you

195
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You let me go

196
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You are so cute

197
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What are you doing

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Let me cut you

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Don't be so rude

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Don't touch me

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Zhu Yan, let go

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Let me go

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't run

204
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Shao Si Ming

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't run

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm coming to catch you

207
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Where to run

208
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm coming to catch you

209
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What is it

210
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Don't come over

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I am allergic to this kind of thing

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Dare to eat my walnuts

213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I

215
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's you

216
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Could it be the effect of the spell of eating the fruit

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
How do you see me turn into an animal

218
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
No feeling of surprise

219
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
As if everything is in your expectation

220
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Who is it

221
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Who is it

222
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Who is it

223
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Who is it

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Who is it

225
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Who is it

226
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Who is it

227
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Who is it

228
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Who is it

229
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Who is it

230
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Who said I was not surprised

231
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Moreover

232
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Didn't you change back?

233
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's good to change back

234
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's good to change back

235
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Otherwise, I will be allergic to it

236
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Little red dots

237
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It really affects the appearance of the mountain

238
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Really

239
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How do you feel

240
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You don't seem to worry about me

241
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Who said I wasn't worried about you

242
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I really don't

243
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Impossible impossible

244
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What's wrong with him

245
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Who is he

247
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
How do you feel that you know more than me

248
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,480
What else did you hide from me?

249
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,200
Before I get angry,

250
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,440
I'll count to three

251
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,960
before I go out.

252
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,880
You and your Princess Chizu

253
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,440
are fighting with each other.

254
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,160
I was very worried.

255
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,120
So I turned to the Hall of Hidden Purity.

256
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,640
I finally found a perfect plan.

257
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,000
You turned me into an animal.

258
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,000
It's called a perfect plan.

259
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
It's written in the book.

260
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,240
But the one who is skilled in cultivation is righteous.

261
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,000
He won't be harmed by women.

262
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,800
He only wants to cultivate.

263
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,360
I didn't expect

264
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,800
it to be such a spell.

265
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,360
It's wonderful.

266
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,800
If you turn me into an animal,

267
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,880
you won't be close to women.

268
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,720
Okay. Okay. Okay.

269
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,320
I got it.

270
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,120
It must be time to set the incense.

271
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,240
You'll change yourself.

272
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,000
Look.

273
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,200
Aren't you fine now?

274
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,720
You're fine.

275
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,320
I'm fine?

276
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,920
Try it.

277
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,400
No.

278
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,760
I'll do it myself.

279
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,360
Look.

280
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,400
Even if a man is beautiful,

281
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,320
he is beautiful.

282
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,840
Don't worry.

283
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,560
You're cute when you're a little animal.

284
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,520
Who asked you this?

285
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:05,920
I...

286
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,360
I want to know the way to accept it.

287
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,960
Can you believe me?

288
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,400
It's written on it.

289
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,680
It's not clear for now.

290
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,320
No, no.

291
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,200
When you turn me into an animal,

292
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,600
I'll be your companion.

293
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,160
Besides,

294
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,760
what's wrong with being an animal?

295
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,480
I've been a bird for ten thousand years.

296
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,560
I'll live well.

297
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,240
Or

298
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,400
you always look down on me?

299
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,680
You...

300
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,520
You...

301
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,840
My lords.

302
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,520
Excuse me.

303
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,000
Seriously.

304
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,520
He's the culprit.

305
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,000
Shao Siming.

306
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,400
I brought you something good.

307
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,160
It's this.

308
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,000
I brought it from Tianjifeng City.

309
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,800
It's a big meal I prepared for you.

310
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,560
No wonder you always

311
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,240
look like a

312
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,360
a foodie.

313
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,360
Take your things and leave.

314
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,400
And

315
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
don't tell others what you saw and heard today.

316
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,320
But I have a lot of lessons

317
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,840
to learn from Shao Siming.

318
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,600
For example,

319
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,640
it's so delicious.

320
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,080
Have a bite.

321
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,560
Boring.

322
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,880
If you have nothing to say,

323
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,160
please leave.

324
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,680
I...

325
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,240
I have something to say.

326
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,160
Actually, I want to ask

327
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,560
where there are so many people on Mount Jiuyi,

328
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,320
there are often strange shapes, right?

329
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,240
For example,

330
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,160
he

331
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,160
needs thousands of years of cultivation

332
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,840
to have such a beautiful figure, right?

333
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,560
Right?

334
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,440
Of course.

335
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,840
I'm the most famous person

336
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,720
in the shape of all the beasts.

337
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,360
How is it?

338
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,400
Right.

339
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,760
What about the shape of Xiaobai?

340
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,480
How many mountains and rivers can he eat?

341
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,800
I guess

342
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,280
it's enough to have such a high altitude, right?

343
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:11,960
Right.

344
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,800
That's right.

345
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,560
I'm the shape of an animal.

346
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,800
But my favorite food

347
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,880
is not fruit,

348
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
but human souls.

349
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,960
If you don't leave,

350
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,160
you'll be my side dish.

351
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,880
So,

352
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,760
you really made

353
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,200
the cute boy today.

354
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,640
Xiaobai,

355
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,520
today is not the first day of the lunar month,

356
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,040
and it's not the fifteenth.

357
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,120
Why are you

358
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,600
so like Yuan?

359
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,320
So,

360
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,480
don't touch him again.

361
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,920
Not even a finger.

362
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,600
Got it?

363
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,640
So,

364
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,440
it's really because of that hug.

365
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,120
What?

366
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,560
You let him hug you?

367
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,880
I'll explain to you later.

368
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,400
I...

369
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,360
I...

370
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,040
Leave now.

371
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,960
But,

372
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,840
I have one more thing

373
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,160
to ask you.

374
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,240
Tell me.

375
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,240
I want to know

376
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,360
how Xiaobai's tail...

377
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,240
Not bad.

378
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,320
So awesome.

379
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,600
Shao Siming,

380
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,760
do it again.

381
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,800
You don't really think

382
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,040
I'm a monster in the mountain, do you?

383
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,640
What do you think?

384
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,040
After all this,

385
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,320
you won't be embarrassed

386
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,640
when you see me.

387
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,200
Xiaobai,

388
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,640
see you tomorrow.

389
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,240
heart dying

390
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,600
guests continue to watch

391
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,520
Yu Gu Yao

392
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,640
anging

393
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,160
I am out of green

394
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,120
等你

395
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,080
You...

396
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,840
You have been practicing for half a month

397
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,800
since you entered Mount Jiuyi.

398
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,280
All the scores are recorded.

399
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,880
I guess you all know

400
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,440
that there will be a theoretical assessment tomorrow.

401
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,800
I hope you can be more careful

402
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,240
and review it carefully.

403
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,560
Bai Xue Lu is 59 points,

404
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,000
ranked first.

405
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,160
Qing Gang is 58 points,

406
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,520
ranked second.

407
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,480
Zhu Yan is 20 points,

408
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,080
ranked bottom.

409
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,400
What's going on?

410
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,600
I didn't expect that

411
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,920
Princess Xue Lu and General Qing

412
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,240
are only one point apart.

413
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,320
All right.

414
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,640
That's all for today.

415
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,960
If you have any questions,

416
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,400
you can ask me anytime.

417
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll do as you say.

418
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,800
I'm not sure

419
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,200
about the imperial edict.

420
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,400
I need more advice.

421
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,320
I need more advice.

422
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:21,800
Let's go.

423
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,240
Let's go together.

424
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,840
We need to

425
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,880
think about it.

426
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,520
Thank you, A Yan.

427
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,320
Look at this.

428
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,920
That's the key to the imperial edict.

429
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,560
It's a real couple

430
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,800
in this picture.

431
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,520
You're right.

432
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,120
You need to remember this.

433
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,360
I said

434
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,640
that the spiritual sense is the basis of all magic.

435
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,000
After you go back,

436
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,200
you need to practice

437
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,920
the Qin family yourself.

438
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,600
You rest assured lightly.

439
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,080
Do you eat

440
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:38,220
you'll geninally plan to

441
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,680
is not Bai Xue Lu.

442
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,360
Actually, she is not easy.

443
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,880
Not easy?

444
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,680
I've been practicing for many years.

445
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,720
Although I'm not as good as Shao Si Ming,

446
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,200
I can see that everyone's roots are high and low.

447
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,280
She is not born with talent.

448
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,160
She has the skills to be like today.

449
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
She has to work hard to get it.

450
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,960
A girl is working so hard.

451
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,680
I think so.

452
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,280
Qing Gang,

453
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,680
it means that you are very good at Bai Xue Lu.

454
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,280
Take a look at her.

455
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,520
Do you like her?

456
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,680
What are you talking about?

457
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,800
Listen to me.

458
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,520
You can see her roots very well.

459
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,760
But you can't see her.

460
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,520
I know best

461
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,720
what kind of person Bai Xue Lu is.

462
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,320
She is a beauty snake

463
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,360
who is good at making up stories.

464
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,880
If you want to kill her,

465
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,160
stay away from her.

466
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,880
Xue Lu is just a strong-minded person.

467
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,840
She is not a bad person.

468
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,480
You don't know her.

469
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,680
I think you really like her.

470
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,720
Qing Gang, you are in trouble.

471
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,040
Try this first.

472
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,360
The pastries are good.

473
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,160
Actually,

474
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,080
she looked for me yesterday.

475
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,360
General Qing.

476
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,360
General Qing.

477
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,600
General Qing.

478
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,240
General Qing, are you hiding from me?

479
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,960
What I said in the cold pond that day

480
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,560
was a joke from Xue Lu to you.

481
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,360
General Qing, you don't take it seriously, do you?

482
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,560
I'm just kidding.

483
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,320
Then why did Consort Qing send you here?

484
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,240
I lied to you.

485
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,440
You lied to me?

486
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,160
Xue Lu just wanted to know

487
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,880
why General Qing was here.

488
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,600
She wanted to know more about General Qing.

489
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,680
She didn't have any bad intentions.

490
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,960
Look.

491
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,760
I didn't reveal

492
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,240
my identity as Shao Si Ning, did I?

493
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,480
Why do you want to know me?

494
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,480
Because we are competitors.

495
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,600
Yes.

496
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,600
General Qing, you were fooled again.

497
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,440
General Qing has given up

498
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,000
the real mission of Zi Qing.

499
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,120
You are not in the Mountain of Nine Ways.

500
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
The Qing clan will definitely call you back

501
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,920
to make contributions.

502
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,520
The one you will go down the mountain

503
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,040
will not compete with me.

504
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,440
Actually,

505
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,000
I admire your character

506
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,240
and ability

507
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,120
to be your friend.

508
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,120
I am handsome and handsome.

509
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,400
There are many jealous people around me.

510
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,480
I have few true feelings.

511
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,640
I don't look like a villain.

512
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,120
So I have to

513
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,680
rely on myself to win.

514
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,080
I have been raised to be a competitive

515
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,600
and aggressive person.

516
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,720
I'm afraid that I will be

517
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,200
a soft-hearted prince

518
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,760
who is bullied by others.

519
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,120
After a long time,

520
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,480
I forget how to make friends with others.

521
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,440
Your Highness,

522
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,840
you don't have to think too much

523
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,920
about the people around you.

524
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,320
As long as you give your true heart,

525
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,440
you will definitely make friends.

526
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,280
You are right.

527
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,880
I may have scared you

528
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,480
by the way I taught you.

529
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,960
I apologize to you

530
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,560
here.

531
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,720
Your Highness, don't.

532
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,360
Thank you for your advice, General Qing.

533
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,040
Please accept it.

534
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,240
You didn't tell me

535
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,640
that he sent this, right?

536
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,640
He sent it.

537
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,640
I just want you to feel

538
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,640
his kindness.

539
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,920
Indeed,

540
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,840
it's good for me.

541
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,520
Master.

542
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,320
I...

543
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,360
I...

544
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,080
You...

545
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,920
I'm sorry.

546
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,400
As Qinggang said,

547
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,920
that Young Minister is not a stone shadow.

548
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,720
If he is just a stranger,

549
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,400
why would that Great Minister

550
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,040
work so hard for him?

551
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,120
Anyway,

552
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,560
we can't be too confident.

553
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,000
It seems that

554
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,440
there will be many changes

555
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,160
after Yu'er ascends the throne.

556
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,240
Our alliance with the Ice Tribe

557
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,000
still needs to be continued.

558
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,520
If the east window really does happen,

559
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,880
the Ice Tribe

560
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,880
will be a way out for us.

561
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,840
Qinggang.

562
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,960
Wake up.

563
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,240
Qinggang.

564
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,600
We'll be late.

565
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,720
The test is over.

566
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
It's over.

567
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,840
Lu,

568
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,000
you're not the only one

569
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,040
who's tied up this time.

570
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,480
You're so unlucky.

571
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,840
I've told you that I'll go down the mountain.

572
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,880
Why do you still insist on doing that?

573
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,920
It's hard to predict.

574
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,880
How do I know if you'll change your mind?

575
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,880
I don't dare to bet on others' feelings.

576
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,440
I just want to be the first one

577
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,920
to take the throne.

578
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,560
I'm sorry.

579
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,880
I'm sorry.

580
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,960
I'm sorry.

581
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,080
I'm sorry.

582
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,200
I'm sorry.

583
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,280
I'm sorry.

584
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
I'm sorry.

585
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
I'm sorry.

586
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
I'm sorry.

587
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,440
The first move is mine.

588
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,320
The clangy ability of 2009,

589
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,440
you have pulled such leaf.

590
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,000
She's really amazing.

591
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,280
I've put out a lot of energy

592
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,640
with you yesterday with all my might.

593
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,160
You're awkward today.

594
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,400
I'm starving.

595
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,080
You prepared this for us,

596
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,440
for you and me,

597
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,840
I'll make it less schema.

598
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,560
You even bought rice and butter coats,

599
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,840
which are cheap online.

600
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,880
Why bother for mother's sake?

601
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:53,760
She's not like that.

602
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,360
Is it because you like me?

603
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,840
However,

604
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,520
one can't not show one's takimity.

605
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,760
How cruel!

606
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,880
Are you all right?

607
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,720
exponentially did not agree to my request.

608
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,560
Until now,

609
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,360
the offices of Cun Si Cang

610
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,280
remained container stores,

611
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,720
so I should be facing them constantly.

612
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,480
Yes.

613
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:33,700
The Hall of

614
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,160
Thoughts is a place of pure gold. What are you doing?

615
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
Princess Zhu Yan was angry at me

616
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
for not taking the exam.

617
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
I wonder what you two did last night.

618
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
Since you both overslept,

619
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
you missed the most important exam today.

620
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,160
It's ridiculous.

621
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
She...

622
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
One, you failed the exam.

623
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Two, you didn't attend the class.

624
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
Three, you hurt your classmates.

625
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,160
Do you know your fault?

626
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
I didn't do anything wrong.

627
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
I didn't do anything wrong.

628
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
I didn't do anything wrong.

629
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
I didn't do anything wrong.

630
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I didn't do anything wrong.

631
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
I...

632
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
What did I do wrong?

633
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
It was her...

634
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
The child is the one who made the excuse.

635
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
The intelligent person only looks at the result.

636
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
If you do something wrong,

637
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
you have to be responsible for your actions.

638
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
You don't have to be so sad.

639
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
Actually, this exam is the same for you

640
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
whether you attend or not.

641
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Because even if you attend,

642
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
you can't be the first.

643
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Compared with me,

644
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
you are too far apart.

645
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
You...

646
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
I just don't look at you.

647
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
So what?

648
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Qing Gang is defeated.

649
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
The first place

650
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
is now in my bag.

651
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
And you

652
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
are just a lowly mule.

653
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Yan.

654
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
It's all my fault today.

655
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,040
Don't take it to heart.

656
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Yan.

657
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,040
You know what kind of person my sister is.

658
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
Don't be so smart with her.

659
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Yes.

660
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
You guys talk.

661
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
I'm sorry.

662
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
I'm sorry.

663
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
I'm sorry.

664
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
I'm sorry.

665
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
I'm sorry.

666
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
I'm sorry.

667
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,040
I'm sorry.

668
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
I'm sorry.

669
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
I'm sorry.

670
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
Bai Xue Lu and I are competing for the first place.

671
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,480
How many wins do we have?

672
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
You want to compete for the first place?

673
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,480
You are a person who is scheming.

674
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Why should I let him lose the chance?

675
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
The first place he won last time

676
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
can't be him.

677
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
He doesn't deserve it.

678
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,480
I want to compete with him.

679
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
How about it?

680
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Yan.

681
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,480
I know you are not happy.

682
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
I know you are working hard.

683
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,480
But my sister's result is very bad.

684
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
You are still at the bottom.

685
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Unless you can win the last time.

686
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Not that kind of

687
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,480
a one-on-one battle.

688
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,480
You have to beat him to the point where he has no power.

689
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
He just won you.

690
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Thank you, sir.

691
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,480
I learned the art of transfer in three hours.

692
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
Yan.

693
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
I believe you can do it.

694
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,480
Okay.

695
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
I also believe you can win.

696
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
Actually, I know.

697
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,480
You chose me

698
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
because we are friends.

699
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
You supported me

700
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,480
because you felt you got me involved in this.

701
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
You don't think I can win.

702
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
But who am I?

703
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
I am Zhu Yan.

704
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
I can't give up

705
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
until the last moment.

706
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Okay.

707
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
We three

708
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,480
chose the most inappropriate one.

709
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,480
We loved the one we shouldn't love.

710
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,480
We had the hardest time.

711
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,480
We chose the hardest way in the world.

712
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
We are all eaters.

713
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
Come on.

714
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Let's eat.

715
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Come on.

716
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Let's eat.

717
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Let's eat.

718
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Qingge.

719
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Let's eat.

720
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
One more.

721
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
One more.

722
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Who?

723
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
I can't drink any.

724
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
Forget it.

725
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,920
I don't want to play with you.

726
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
I want to learn

727
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,920
the art of transfer.

728
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,920
What do you want to do?

729
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,920
I want to defeat Bai Xue Lu

730
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,920
and become the first disciple of Shao Si Mian.

731
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
You want to be my first disciple?

732
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
Shao Si Mian?

733
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
Why is it you?

734
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,920
I have to drink

735
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
even if Shao Si Mian comes.

736
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Why...

737
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,920
Why are you avoiding me?

738
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,920
I am very sad.

739
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,920
I know.

740
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,920
Do you think I can't defeat Bai Xue Lu?

741
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,920
I can't be your first disciple.

742
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,920
We need to make it clear

743
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,920
about the first disciple.

744
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Why are you hiding?

745
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,920
Can't you just stop hiding?

746
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
You have to make it clear to me.

747
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,920
I don't understand

748
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
where I am inferior to Bai Xue Lu.

749
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,920
I want to be the first disciple of Shao Si Mian.

750
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,360
Just tell me.

751
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Where am I inferior to her?

752
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
You hugged me.

753
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
You didn't change.

754
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,360
Your tail is out.

755
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,360
Just do it, Master Bai.

756
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,360
You...

757
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,360
What?

758
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,360
You...

759
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
Master Bai,

760
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
change your body.

761
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
Come on.

762
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Change your body.

763
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
Come on.

764
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
Change your body.

765
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
Change your body.

766
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,360
Shao Si Mian, change your body.

767
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,360
Change your body.

768
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
Master Bai.

769
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,360
Take it.

770
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Take me.

771
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,360
You...

772
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,360
Why did you fall again?

773
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,360
I won't drink with you.

774
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
I want to learn martial arts.

775
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,800
I want to go to the Qing Xiu Hall.

776
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
What are you looking at?

777
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
You keep waiting for them.

778
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
I'm going to learn martial arts.

779
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
I'm going to learn martial arts.

780
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
I'm going to learn martial arts.

781
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Master Bai.

782
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
Here.

783
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
Master Bai.

784
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
Come out with me.

785
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Master Bai.

786
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
Get up.

787
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
You think I can't find you

788
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
if you hide here?

789
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Master Bai.

790
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Master Bai, come out with me.

791
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
Come out.

792
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,240
Come out.

793
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,240
Come out.

794
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,240
Zhu Yan.

795
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,240
Go back to where you live.

796
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
Come out.

797
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
Be honest.

798
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,240
Did you steal my Master Bai?

799
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,240
Master Bai.

800
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,240
I know you're here.

801
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
Master Bai.

802
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,680
Master Bai.

803
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,680
What are you going to do with Master Bai?

804
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,680
What am I going to do with Master Bai?

805
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,680
I don't know what I'm going to do with Master Bai.

806
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,680
No.

807
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,680
I'm going to take Master Bai

808
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,680
to the Heavenly Palace

809
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,680
to meet many people.

810
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
There are many delicious food.

811
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,680
I'm going to take him

812
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,560
to the Western Ma

813
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
and the Imperial Palace

814
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,560
to do something interesting.

815
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,560
I'm not taking you.

816
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,560
You want me to be your apprentice, right?

817
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,560
No.

818
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
I can't let you go home

819
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
if I'm your apprentice.

820
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,560
Master Bai.

821
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,560
You really want to be my apprentice?

822
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,640
Master Bai.

823
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,640
Master Bai.

824
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Master Bai.

825
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
Master Bai.

826
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
Enough.

827
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
It's all your fault.

828
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,240
You stole my Master Bai.

829
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,240
Master Bai.

830
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
Let go.

831
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
What's wrong?

832
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
I'm not even

833
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,240
a dog with a nose and a nose now.

834
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Stop.

835
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,240
I think I'm a little dizzy.

836
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
Master Bai.

837
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,240
You're here.

838
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Zhu Yan.

839
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240
You're better.

840
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
Don't come over.

841
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
Zhu Yan.

842
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
You're messing around.

843
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,240
Let me hold you

844
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
and sleep.

845
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,240
How dare you?

846
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
Let me go.

847
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,240
Don't mess around.

848
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240
Let me go.

849
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
You...

850
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,920
Let me go.

851
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,920
Master Bai.

852
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
You're the best.

853
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,920
Let go.

854
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,920
Let go, Zhu Yan.

855
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,920
Minister.

856
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,920
I've surpassed Qing Gang

857
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,920
in today's competition.

858
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,920
I've beaten everyone

859
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,920
and I can use the ice you gave me freely.

860
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,920
I'm sure of the competition

861
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,920
after half a month.

862
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,920
I was right about you.

863
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,920
Very good.

864
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,920
After you become his disciple,

865
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,920
you'll get to know him.

866
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,920
You're young and beautiful.

867
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,920
You know the feelings.

868
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
He's righteous

869
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,920
but he's full of blood.

870
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,920
I hope you

871
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,920
can feel his sincerity.

872
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Then you'll be

873
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
the empress.

874
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
I'll do as you say.

875
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,600
You'll be lonely

876
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,600
if you follow me.

877
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
No.

878
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
There were only dead people

879
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
in the valley before.

880
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
Master would be lonely

881
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
by himself.

882
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,600
But from now on,

883
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
I'll be with you.

884
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,600
I'll be with you forever.

885
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,600
You've been

886
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,600
my dream for so long.

887
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,600
You've been my

888
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,600
dream for so long.

889
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,600
You've been my

890
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,600
dream for so long.

891
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,600
You've been my

892
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,600
dream for so long.

893
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,600
You've been my

894
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,600
dream for so long.

895
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,600
You've been my

896
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,600
dream for so long.

897
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,600
You've been my

898
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,600
dream for so long.

899
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,600
You've been my

900
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
dream for so long.

901
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,600
You've been my

902
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
dream for so long.

903
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,600
You've been my

904
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,600
dream for so long.

905
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,600
You've been my

906
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,600
dream for so long.

907
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,600
You've been the

908
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,600
dream for so long.

909
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,600
I've been with you

910
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,600
the whole day.

911
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,600
You've been my

912
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,600
dream for so long.
