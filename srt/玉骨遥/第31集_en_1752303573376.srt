1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
I want to be with you forever

2
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,800
I want to be with you forever

3
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,400
I want to be with you forever

4
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,600
The first person I met

5
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,200
is engraved in my heart

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,800
Don't worry, Your Highness

7
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,600
His Highness just got a little skin injury

8
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,000
and didn't get hurt

9
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
I think he'll recover after a few days of rest

10
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,200
I see

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,200
You may leave

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Does it hurt?

13
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,800
It hurts so much

14
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
It's all my fault

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I was asked by my mother and uncle

16
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,200
to go to see the altar alone

17
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,800
I didn't expect that I was injured

18
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Really?

19
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I miss my mother every day

20
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,000
I really want to come back

21
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
But I have no chance

22
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Now I can't go to see the altar

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now I can stay with my mother

24
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,000
Your Highness

25
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,600
Shao Si Ming from Jiuyi Mountain is here

26
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
He said he wanted to see you

27
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,600
Brother is here

28
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
It's okay

29
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,800
Since you want to see me

30
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,400
then go ahead

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
I can't stop you anyway

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
But

33
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,600
I have to say

34
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,800
You are seriously injured now

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,400
You have to take the medicine

36
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,400
on time to promise me

37
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,200
Go to see Yu Yi

38
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,600
If Yu Er's medicine is ready

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
bring it to me first

40
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,400
and then bring it to him

41
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,600
Yes

42
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
Who is the Judas Easy Nightmaker?

43
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,000
It's me

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,480
Your

45
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,060
evil feminine

46
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,460
power

47
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,060
isρώ,

48
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,580
isrow,

49
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,120
and spirit

50
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,560
are in there.

51
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm not even sure

52
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
about the situation.

53
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,760
Maybe

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,240
I can single out

55
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,200
my creative brain

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,400
to exploit

57
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,440
Is this sacrifice seal?

58
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,780
Princess,

59
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
I'm totally recovered.

60
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,140
How is it possible?

61
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,240
Really?

62
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,280
It's not what you think.

63
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,400
He left.

64
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,480
Her Majesty blackmailed him to get back on track.

65
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,220
He made an exception for self- bathroom.

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,900
His Majesty...

67
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,360
He even conspired to cover it up.

68
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,960
But I was this clever-minded,

69
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,480
being Silicon too.

70
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,720
One of them turned out to be a liar.

71
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,600
Exactly,

72
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,240
I committed a grave crime.

73
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,080
Everyone once said

74
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,380
he only chose that package.

75
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,080
It hurts.

76
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,960
Don't move. Lie down.

77
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,960
You're badly injured this time.

78
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,720
You need to rest for a while

79
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,760
to recover.

80
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,440
Take this spiritual pearl.

81
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,800
It contains my spiritual power.

82
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,960
When you're in pain,

83
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,680
put the pearl in your palm.

84
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
The spiritual power will help you feel pain.

85
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,280
Thank you, brother.

86
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,280
With this, I really won't feel pain.

87
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,800
Yu'er.

88
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,480
Ye City is a place of fire and fire.

89
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,120
Why do you come here to hunt?

90
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,600
If you have any problem,

91
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,920
you can write to me.

92
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,920
Why do you hurt yourself?

93
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,600
I've been lying for a long time.

94
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,640
I was exposed by you.

95
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,120
I just don't want to stay in the military camp.

96
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,200
I want to come back soon.

97
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,000
But I'm willing to admit it.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
I was lying to myself.

99
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,480
But I was hurt.

100
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,120
Please take care of me.

101
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,000
Take me to the retreat.

102
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,920
If you don't agree,

103
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,840
I can only leave this matter to Bai Feng Lin.

104
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,000
Qing Gang is a righteous man.

105
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,120
Why don't you hand him over?

106
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,160
Ye City is the territory of the Bai clan.

107
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,200
Qing Gang is a Qing warrior.

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,080
Bai Feng Lin won't listen to him.

109
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,840
Brother.

110
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,240
The retreat is a big deal.

111
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,680
It concerns the people.

112
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,880
For the sake of the people,

113
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
please promise me.

114
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,840
You've already calculated it.

115
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,360
Why do you ask me?

116
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,720
I'll just promise you.

117
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,240
Consort Qing is here.

118
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,920
Be careful.

119
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,560
So you're here too.

120
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,600
I told Yu to get some medicine for Yu'er.

121
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
I hope you can

122
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,760
help Yu'er drink it.

123
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,200
Brother, I'm fine.

124
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,000
I can do it myself.

125
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,400
No.

126
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,360
Don't touch it.

127
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,560
No.

128
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,960
The pill is poisonous.

129
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,400
Mother.

130
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,760
Could it be you?

131
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,520
Shut up.

132
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,800
Mother.

133
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,680
Do you think I'm a three-year-old child?

134
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,320
Yu'er.

135
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,840
I came to the palace

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,480
and offended many people in the palace.

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,160
Some of them have a grudge against me.

138
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,440
It's reasonable to want to harm me.

139
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,400
Tell me.

140
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,000
Who is going to harm my Yu'er?

141
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,280
You won't tell me?

142
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Aren't you afraid I'll destroy your family?

143
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,120
Never.

144
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,560
Yu'er.

145
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,440
Brother.

146
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,140
Don't say it.

147
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:38,200
A

148
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,120
My Lady,

149
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,320
after getting back,

150
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,360
you've had a full-face.

151
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,600
You've been doing well

152
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,480
for a whole night!

153
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,680
Yufei,

154
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,360
you're here at the right time.

155
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,200
I have something to tell you.

156
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,520
Come on, sit down.

157
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,280
I really don't understand

158
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,680
why Master

159
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,840
took off his robe.

160
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,800
Young Minister

161
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,280
must have returned to the secular world

162
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,920
and re-entered the position of Crown Prince.

163
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,640
Miss, you don't know, right?

164
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,600
The rumors have spread.

165
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,400
Everyone said

166
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,040
that His Highness Shiyu is gentle

167
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,760
and hard to protect from the air.

168
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,680
But Young Minister

169
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,960
always defends the people

170
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,240
with his own will.

171
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,120
He always defends the people with his own will.

172
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
He is the best candidate for Crown Prince.

173
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,080
Nonsense.

174
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,840
My master doesn't believe in that.

175
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,080
Young Minister

176
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,840
must not believe in

177
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,520
fighting for power and power for himself.

178
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
But he is a person

179
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
who is willing to

180
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,040
do his best for the people.

181
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,080
Now the war between the Kongsang and the Jiao clan has been over.

182
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,840
It's not far from the day

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,960
when the people live in peace.

184
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,800
It's not that simple.

185
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,280
Even if there is no Imperial Army,

186
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,440
there are still the Ice Tribe.

187
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,840
Maybe they will

188
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,640
re-enters the Kongsang.

189
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Everyone is worried about this.

190
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,320
Besides,

191
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,920
didn't you say that

192
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,320
Young Minister read the marriage proposal today?

193
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,640
I think

194
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,640
he is not

195
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,160
looking down on you.

196
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,560
He must be planning for the future.

197
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,320
After all, every king of Kongsang

198
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,000
will marry a woman from the Bai clan.

199
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,080
Nonsense.

200
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,480
You are making it worse.

201
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,000
Someone asked me to give this to Her Grace.

202
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,360
It's Xueying?

203
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,400
This place

204
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,840
is the most important place

205
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,640
for the empire of Kongsang

206
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,280
to be integrated

207
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,960
with the order to be sends its troops.

208
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,920
Ying'er.

209
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,280
You finally changed your mind.

210
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,800
said Your Majesty.

211
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,680
As I know,

212
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,600
Your Majesty, I was entrusted by Yu'er.

213
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,680
Yu'er's injury is not serious,

214
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,880
but she needs some rest.

215
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,400
But we can't wait for the withdrawal.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,240
So I have to leave it for now.

217
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,680
You're the best candidate.

218
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,200
Qinggang and Bai Fenglin

219
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,360
are the top generals in our clan.

220
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,080
But they don't agree.

221
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,600
If they hand over the withdrawal,

222
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,680
they may be in trouble

223
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,960
because of the withdrawal.

224
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,280
Ying,

225
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,840
the withdrawal is a big matter.

226
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,640
It's about the safety of the people.

227
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,880
You must do your best.

228
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,880
Don't let me down.

229
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,720
I know I'm a burden.

230
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,240
I'll do my best.

231
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,320
After Yu'er recovers,

232
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,760
I'll give her the military power.

233
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,960
He has stayed with operable Yang all the time.

234
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,280
Who wouldn't?

235
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,240
He is not for worry.

236
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,440
He is the

237
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,000
most pretentious in the whole fell.

238
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,640
Could they ilude him now?

239
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
No, we can't.

240
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,800
So we can't let him

241
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,640
to live in

242
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,720
his own world?

243
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,840
I didn't expect

244
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,080
that the great Emperor of Xingzun

245
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,800
would end up like this

246
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,360
because of his obsession.

247
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,400
Even if he is the last emperor,

248
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,320
he can't escape from the love.

249
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,240
Ying,

250
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,120
the military power is over.

251
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,480
Only the Imperial Army is left.

252
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,000
You are in danger.

253
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,720
You have the power of Kong Sang.

254
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,680
You can't let it down.

255
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,680
Once this is over,

256
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,160
you will be famous

257
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,520
and famous

258
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,160
for a long time.

259
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,920
I don't care about

260
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,040
the future of the people.

261
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,080
What I care about is

262
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
what my mother taught me

263
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,680
when I was a child.

264
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,800
I don't feel ashamed of

265
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,040
the good deeds of the people

266
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,080
and bloodline.

267
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,120
You want to take Xue Ying away

268
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,880
and give the position of Crown Prince

269
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,360
to my master?

270
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,960
Yes.

271
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,960
You sneaked out of the palace

272
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,960
and was found by Consort Qing.

273
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,040
I have arranged it.

274
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,920
When my mother finds out,

275
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,920
Xue Ying and I will be far away.

276
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,080
I have told my father

277
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,160
to go to the temple for a period of rest.

278
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,960
Now I have to go to the temple

279
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,080
to rest.

280
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,640
I will go to the temple

281
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,720
for a period of rest.

282
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,880
Now,

283
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,240
Da Simi, Shao Simi

284
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,120
and Qinggang all live in my house.

285
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,720
My father is busy with them.

286
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,280
He may not notice us.

287
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,880
I think

288
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,600
this is not appropriate.

289
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,400
It will put you two in danger.

290
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,960
Is there no other way?

291
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,320
If I don't go,

292
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,120
my mother will definitely

293
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,040
kill my brother for the position of Crown Prince.

294
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,960
More importantly,

295
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,160
I don't want to let the people of Kong Sang down.

296
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,600
I don't want to let Xue Ying down.

297
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,520
Yilang and I have the same heart.

298
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,760
Instead of being the Crown Prince and the Consort,

299
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,160
we might as well be

300
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
a couple who share the same fate.

301
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,680
We love Kong Sang

302
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,040
and give him to Shao Simi.

303
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,360
The main camp of the Navy

304
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,160
is located in Jinghu outside the city of Ye.

305
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,000
It is the closest to the army of the Qing Dynasty.

306
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,600
General Qin,

307
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,880
you need to send more people to pay more attention

308
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,640
to the movement of the Navy.

309
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,520
Your army

310
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,640
can delay for two days and then leave.

311
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,600
Yes.

312
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,920
General Bai,

313
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,320
your army as the main force

314
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,920
will leave from today.

315
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,560
Leave immediately?

316
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,960
I'm afraid that

317
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,280
my troops in Ye City

318
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,800
will not obey me.

319
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,160
What did General Bai say?

320
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,920
Shao Simi is here to be the commander.

321
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,160
All the troops should listen to his orders.

322
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,320
Your troops in Ye City

323
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,760
can't be exception.

324
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,560
Don't misunderstand.

325
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,120
I'm not going to be against my cousin.

326
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,440
It's just that my troops in Ye City

327
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,360
are all hard-working.

328
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,280
They only recognize skills

329
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,520
but not the official rank.

330
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,440
They always obey me

331
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,960
because I've been with the Navy for many years

332
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:48,300
and know the habits of the

333
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,720
General Bai.

334
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,720
Can't I tell the truth

335
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,600
about my rules and rules?

336
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,320
Besides,

337
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,880
Ye City

338
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,320
is the territory of my Bai Feng Lin.

339
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,680
General Bai

340
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,520
won't want to be the leader, will he?

341
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,280
What General Bai said is right.

342
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,400
If you want the army to obey you willingly,

343
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
you must have some real skills.

344
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,320
What's this?

345
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,240
General Bai,

346
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,280
you even call yourself a member of the Mages

347
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,880
but you don't even know the best

348
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,080
jade water technique of the Mages?

349
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,960
Why did we come here?

350
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,520
Now,

351
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,040
Chief Da, Shao Simi and Jingang

352
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,160
are all living in my house.

353
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,100
warriors

354
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,320
Most of them have lived in my nein- duplicates.

355
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,040
Is this lifestyle

356
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,660
겠습니다?

357
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,780
Only a few days ago,

358
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,660
one of the ее is killed in my mansion.

359
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,080
Already goal is to

360
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,040
regain the situation as disabilities.

361
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,280
every battle

362
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,440
Go ahead.

363
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,200
openly supremacy orders Zheng Wang Yu

364
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,400
to stop seeing steroids.

365
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,560
You can't bother myself with him.

366
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:54,600
I...

367
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,360
Princess, 박 jugong

368
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,320
Your Jincheng.

369
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,080
I will send a leaf for my cousin's generator.

370
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:11,840
Go, then.

371
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,180
As usual,

372
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,580
she must marry off

373
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,300
the belly ladies from the Bai Clan.

374
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,320
Besides,

375
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,540
now the mourning system

376
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,880
is at its peak of tilt

377
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,020
and influence.

378
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:45,880
Yinzhen also needs to

379
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,320
because Bai Xue Lu lied to me.

380
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,240
So Master was attacked by the Ice Tribe

381
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,520
in Nülo County.

382
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,040
He almost lost his life.

383
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,320
I knew it long ago.

384
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,560
It's a matter of time.

385
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,720
Now, Ying'er needs Bai Xue Lu more.

386
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,320
You're the future chief of the Ghost Clan.

387
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,040
You should know the relationship between them.

388
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,120
You should learn how to

389
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,560
control the situation.

390
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,320
But...

391
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,160
Did my Master agree?

392
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
Whether he agrees or not,

393
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,800
you'll know when you come with me.

394
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,280
You're busy with official affairs.

395
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,880
I've prepared some pastries

396
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,280
for you.

397
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,440
They are

398
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,880
a couple

399
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,480
of princes and princesses.

400
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,800
They are a match made in heaven.

401
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,720
They were just not meant to be.

402
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,320
They were just too stubborn.

403
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,400
Now,

404
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,240
Ying'er is about to be crowned.

405
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,880
They have

406
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,240
decided on each other.

407
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,720
They will get along with each other.

408
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,000
Zhu Yan,

409
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,000
you're no longer a child.

410
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,240
Don't be so ignorant in the future.

411
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,240
You always come to disturb your master.

412
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,440
Do you understand?

413
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Leave the tea ceremony

414
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
to me.

415
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,240
You don't have to come here again.

416
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,560
It's the pastries

417
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,080
that don't suit your taste.

418
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,160
I'll go out for a while.

419
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,000
I happen to be hungry.

420
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,800
I'll eat these pastries.

421
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,240
Cui He.

422
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,520
You may leave.

423
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,960
Okay.

424
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,320
Are you helping me out?

425
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,920
Think about it.

426
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,880
There will be more and more

427
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,800
of these situations in the future.

428
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,680
Is what you want

429
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,000
really worth your life?

430
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,640
You know that Shao Siming doesn't like you.

431
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,480
Since I chose this path,

432
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,040
everything will happen

433
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,920
as I expected.

434
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,520
Please don't underestimate

435
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,480
the longevity of Xue Lu.

436
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,960
I've never looked down on you.

437
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,760
I just...

438
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,080
I just can't bear to see you

439
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,480
put yourself in the lowly love.

440
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,640
I appreciate your kindness.

441
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,280
I'll go on

442
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,360
the path I chose.

443
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,320
I'll regret it

444
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,040
if I give up halfway.

445
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,040
Yan.

446
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,640
Yan.

447
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,280
Why are you here?

448
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,640
Master.

449
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,760
Don't be so rude

450
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,160
and disturb him again.

451
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:50,880
I...

452
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,560
I'm here to look for Xue Ying.

453
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,880
I went around

454
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,480
when she was away.

455
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,080
You don't look well.

456
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,920
Are you feeling unwell?

457
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,800
Yes.

458
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,760
I'm not feeling well.

459
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,960
No, Master.

460
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,560
I...

461
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,960
I might have a stomachache.

462
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,400
Master, don't worry.

463
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Just go back to your work.

464
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,040
I'll go home and have a rest.

465
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,040
Yan.

466
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,080
Are you free tomorrow?

467
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,920
I want to...

468
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,880
I want to go for a walk with you.

469
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,720
Master,

470
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,200
do you still want to go shopping with me?

471
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,960
I didn't finish what I said last time.

472
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,160
I want to tell you in person.

473
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,800
Okay.

474
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,880
Master,

475
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,480
I'll go now.

476
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,000
You can go back to your work.

477
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,520
Don't see me off.

478
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,440
You're so smart.

479
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
You should know how to do it.

480
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,560
What?

481
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,520
Do you have any other choice?

482
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,160
Don't worry, Chief Minister.

483
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
For the sake of the future,

484
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,960
I can give up everything,

485
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,040
including my feelings.

486
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,600
I had no intention to destroy them.

487
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,520
It's my fault.

488
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,200
I'm sorry that Zhu Yan blocked my way.

489
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,800
Well,

490
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
since you met Zhu Zhu,

491
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,400
you've been staring at the window.

492
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,680
Is it possible that Zhu Zhu is in the window?

493
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,560
Yan,

494
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,480
you seem to be unhappy.

495
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,080
It's my fault.

496
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,920
I forgot to give you some advice.

497
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,680
It must be because when you went out last time,

498
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,800
you didn't leave a good impression on Zhu Zhu.

499
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,680
This time,

500
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,440
she heard you asked her out,

501
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,040
she must have felt embarrassed.

502
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,760
Where do you want to go next?

503
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,040
I'll go with you.

504
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,040
I'll go with you?

505
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,840
Okay.

506
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,200
I'll find it.

507
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,280
So that Master won't forget my wish.

508
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,440
Think about it.

509
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,040
When she was shopping with you,

510
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,840
was she completing her task

511
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,680
like she was completing her homework on the mountain?

512
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,120
In my opinion,

513
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,160
the biggest problem between you and her

514
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,760
is the title of Master.

515
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,200
But I told her last time

516
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,400
not to call me Master anymore.

517
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,520
But I told her last time

518
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,880
not to call me Master anymore.

519
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,840
Listen to me.

520
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
When you said that,

521
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,600
you were still a Master.

522
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,200
I know

523
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,720
you've been crying for too long.

524
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,960
It's not easy to say that.

525
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,360
It's okay.

526
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,920
I'll teach you a few tricks.

527
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,720
Remember.

528
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,640
When you were shopping this time,

529
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,840
you have to think about it.

530
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,880
It's not that you're not giving her

531
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,000
the high-level Zhu Yan,

532
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,320
but that you're playing with her

533
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,280
and her.

534
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,360
You have to do

535
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,840
some things that a man and a woman

536
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,960
do in love.

537
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,120
For example,

538
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,400
she likes to be lively.

539
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,680
You can ask her to listen to a book first.

540
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,480
Remember.

541
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,400
You have to listen to those

542
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,920
romantic words.

543
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,280
When the little pig

544
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,200
is surprised by the sound of the music,

545
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,200
you can send her a love letter.

546
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,360
Love letter?

547
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
But now,

548
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,320
does Yan like such a common thing

549
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,280
as love letter?

550
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,400
Besides,

551
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,080
I've already given her

552
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,040
the jade bone.

553
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,440
Are you still the heir of the God of the Gods?

554
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,680
Are you still the young minister of the Cloud Sky?

555
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,200
Where did you go?

556
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,840
Did I just say it for nothing?

557
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,320
That's right.

558
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,920
This jade bone is a thing that can only be found in the palace.

559
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,240
But she doesn't know it.

560
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,200
Think about it.

561
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,440
When you gave her the jade bone,

562
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,800
did you send the disciples' magic weapons

563
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,480
to her when you were leaving?

564
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,680
You have to let her know that

565
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,720
from now on,

566
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,240
you are a man and a woman,

567
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,040
not a poem and a picture.

568
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,800
Yes.

569
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,960
I see.

570
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,600
I've been playing the guitar for tens of thousands of years.

571
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,040
I finally have a place to play the drums.

572
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,360
Don't laugh.

573
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,480
Zhao Wen is here.

574
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,840
It seems that

575
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,200
Master has returned to Jialan

576
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,680
and has made his decision.

577
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,200
Master doesn't care about my master anymore.

578
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,000
He is the emperor of the Cloud Emperor

579
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,280
and the protector of the people.

580
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,960
And

581
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,080
Bai Xue Lu's husband.

582
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,880
Why am I so difficult?

583
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,960
Why am I so sad?

584
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,200
Miss, Miss.

585
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,520
Look who I brought.

586
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,080
You haven't seen each other for days.

587
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,440
I brought Su Mo to see you.

588
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,680
Come on, sit.

589
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,000
Miss, what's wrong with you?

590
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,960
My master asked me to go shopping tomorrow.

591
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,440
I was right.

592
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,840
Last time, the Minister of Shao said

593
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,200
he only said half of what he was going to take off his robe.

594
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,280
He asked you to go shopping tomorrow.

595
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,320
He must have told you the other half.

596
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,880
After all, he is your master.

597
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,160
If he wants to be the crown prince again,

598
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,640
he must give you an explanation.

599
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,480
It's really a blessing for me.

600
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,440
Stop talking nonsense.

601
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,800
Go tell the butler to prepare the carriage earlier.

602
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,480
Yes.

603
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,600
It seems that

604
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,440
the master's return to the throne

605
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,680
is a great achievement

606
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,160
and a person's heart.

607
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,560
Sister,

608
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,040
why are you unhappy?

609
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,560
Here you are.

610
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,560
My mother said

611
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,600
if you have sugar in your mouth,

612
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,440
you won't feel bitter.

613
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,800
Su Mo,

614
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,560
you actually spoke to me.

615
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,480
I know.

616
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,840
You didn't even tell me.

617
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,320
Burn it out!

618
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,280
Where did you learn this book?

619
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,800
It's the skill book

620
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,480
my master wrote for me.

621
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,400
So it means

622
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,960
your master wants to be the crown prince again?

623
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,760
Yes.

624
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,320
My master is chromatic.

625
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,480
He is born to pardon his mistakes,

626
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,240
which is an irresistible teaching.

627
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,520
Then what do I want

628
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,120
but which one doesn't?

629
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,440
It's that time of year.

630
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,300
This time,

631
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,100
when you are in front of thehouses,

632
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,360
is it okay for me to be here alone?

633
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,160
Yes.

634
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,300
I was looking at the trees

635
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,220
for the interview.

636
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:09,680
Could that man n video call me?

637
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,640
It was an inspired person.

638
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,800
Who is it?

639
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,380
My mother.

640
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
OHoHow about you?

641
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,540
This is her.

642
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:25,080
Don't talk about

643
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,100
my stepmother.

644
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,580
I've been to this library.

645
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,540
It should be very lively at this moment.

646
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,220
Why are there only me and Master now?

647
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,940
Last time, we wanted to watch the shadow play,

648
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,860
but we couldn't.

649
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,420
So I found the owner of the stall

650
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,460
and persuaded him

651
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,620
to let him give us a special play.

652
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,700
Which play do you want to watch?

653
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,500
Or the one ten years ago?

654
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,340
Remember,

655
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,820
it must be a love story.

656
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,740
Boss,

657
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,660
we won't watch that today.

658
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,900
Let's watch the love story between Xingzun and Bai Wei.

659
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,340
Okay.

660
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,900
Please wait a moment.

661
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,180
Master actually watched this play.

662
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,580
Is he trying to persuade me?

663
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,580
Everyone knows that

664
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,020
seven thousand years ago,

665
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,380
the Emperor and the Empress Bai Wei

666
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,060
unified the six parts of the Clouds again

667
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,180
and drove the Ice Tribe to the North

668
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,460
to become a legend.

669
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,540
And the Emperor Xingzun loved Bai Wei

670
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,860
and made a vow.

671
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:48,460
We will be together forever.

672
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,220
Is it because

673
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,260
the Emperor Xingzun and the Empress Bai Wei

674
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,860
can only marry the Empress Bai Wei

675
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,780
if they are allies?

676
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,700
Yes.

677
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,780
This is the love between Xingzun and Bai Wei.

678
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,980
We will be together forever.

679
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,500
We will be together forever.

680
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,820
Why do I want to cry?

681
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,620
It must be because I'm not used to

682
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,380
the change of my master's identity.

683
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:23,780
No.

684
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,460
I can't show up

685
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,940
and drag my master down.

686
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,300
Yan.

687
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,060
This play is so good.

688
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,380
The way to sleep is really effective.

689
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,980
Good.

690
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,380
Well.

691
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,040
Yan.

692
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,300
Yan.

693
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,620
Have you brought back

694
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,020
something that determined you?

695
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,460
Nothing.

696
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,020
I'm recalling

697
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,500
the play just now.

698
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,180
I'll take it.

699
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,940
I'll take the new song

700
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,420
from Little Bamboo.

701
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,500
And I'll send you the love song.

702
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:25,900
Yan,

703
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,220
Linglong Pavilion is in front of us.

704
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,620
I heard

705
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,900
the accessories there

706
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,460
are the best in the Hall of Emptiness.

707
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,900
Why don't we go there

708
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,900
and pick some accessories

709
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,860
to have a look?

710
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,580
You know that

711
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,420
I don't know much about women

712
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,300
and I don't know much about women.

713
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,620
So

714
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,980
I don't know what to pick.

715
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,300
Master wants me

716
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,180
to pick the accessories for him

717
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,780
and send them to Bai Xue Lu.

718
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,220
Yan,

719
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,580
what's wrong?

720
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,940
I can't be worried about Master.

721
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,260
This is the only thing

722
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,860
I can do to help Master.

723
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,380
I must do it well.

724
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,540
Okay.

725
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,580
Take a look.

726
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,780
This is suitable.

727
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,660
This is it.

728
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,900
You two are really good at it.

729
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,100
This ring

730
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,580
is the most suitable for love.

731
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,620
It's a good ring.

732
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,220
It's a good ring.

733
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,620
It's a good ring.

734
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,780
It's a good ring.

735
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,940
It's a good ring.

736
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,100
It's a good ring.

737
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,260
It's a good ring.

738
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,420
It's a good ring.

739
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,580
It's a good ring.

740
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,740
It's a good ring.

741
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,900
It's a good ring.

742
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,060
It's a good ring.

743
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,220
It's a good ring.

744
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,380
It's a good ring.

745
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,540
It's a good ring.

746
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,700
It's a good ring.

747
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,860
It's a good ring.

748
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,020
It's a good ring.

749
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,180
It's a good ring.

750
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
It's a good ring.

751
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
It's a good ring.

752
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,660
It's a good ring.

753
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,820
It's a good ring.

754
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
It's a good ring.

755
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,140
It's a good ring.

756
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,860
It's a good ring.

757
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:22,940
Yan.

758
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,900
Master.

759
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,860
You first.

760
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,940
I…

761
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,060
I suddenly remembered

762
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,900
I have something urgent to deal

763
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,340
with at home.

764
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,780
I'll send you back then.

765
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,980
It's okay.

766
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,660
I'll go by myself.

767
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,640
Here

768
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,940
Thank you

769
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,740
Thank you

770
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,120
Good

771
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,780
What a great stage

772
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,100
Good

773
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,140
It's amazing!

774
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,140
It's amazing!

775
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,140
Come on, stand properly.

776
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,140
It's amazing!

777
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,140
It's amazing!

778
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,140
It's amazing!

779
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,140
Let's cut the vows

780
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,140
and let the world be like the ocean.

781
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,140
It's hard to change our fate.

782
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,140
We can't escape

783
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,140
without our vows.

784
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,140
The love that's deep in my heart

785
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,140
is an unwavering love.

786
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,140
The flowers of love

787
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:57,140
bloom when they bloom.

788
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,140
How is it?

789
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,140
Are you happy, little pig?

790
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,140
I don't know why.

791
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,140
Yan'er saw me buy a flower.

792
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,140
I'm so happy.

793
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,140
I'm so happy.

794
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,140
I'm so happy.

795
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,140
I'm so happy.

796
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,140
I'm so happy.

797
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,140
I'm so happy.

798
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,140
I'm so happy.

799
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,140
I'm so happy.

800
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,140
I'm so happy.

801
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,140
Yan'er saw me buy this and left.

802
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,140
I chased after her

803
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,140
but I couldn't catch up with her.

804
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,140
That's a good thing.

805
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,140
Think about it.

806
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,140
Little pig must have guessed your feelings.

807
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,140
So she's shy.

808
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,140
You and your child are like this.

809
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,140
You let her calm down for a few days.

810
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,140
Then you express your feelings to her.

811
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,140
Then she'll be able to get what she wants.

812
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,140
Princess.

813
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,140
Princess Zhu Yan is here.

814
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,140
This is...

815
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,140
Princess Zhu Yan likes this jade pendant.

816
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,140
This is the jade pendant of Linglong Pavilion.

817
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,140
I got it yesterday.

818
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,140
Just this one.

819
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,140
Master gave it to her.

820
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,140
Master gave it to her so quickly.

821
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,140
Princess Zhu Yan

822
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,140
has been here with me for dinner.

823
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,140
What brings you here today?

824
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,140
This jade pendant

825
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,140
was given to you by my master.

826
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,140
So you're here for this jade pendant.

827
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,140
You should know that

828
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,140
you're just her disciple.

829
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,140
You should know the rules and etiquette.

830
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,140
You can't be too harsh.

831
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,140
You can say whatever you want.

832
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,140
As long as...

833
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,140
As long as you treat my master well.

834
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,140
Since I've pressed it down,

835
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,140
I'll do it for you.

836
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,140
I'll do it for you.

837
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,140
I'll do it for him.

838
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,140
I'll leave it to you.

839
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,140
Yan'er.

840
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,140
Yan'er.

841
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,140
Yan'er.

842
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,140
I don't want to hear anything

843
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,140
about her explanation today.

844
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,140
You can die to atone for your sins.

845
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,140
Eternal Love�

846
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,260
Nobody said the flower of fascinated drift in blood

847
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,360
Love and hate have no difference

848
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:21,020
Who can fail to 번 Ore

849
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,060
6

850
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,060
I have never seen anything

851
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:31,060
Justant is the beauty of life

852
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,740
The line at the end of your heart

853
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,940
A wind that dares to touch my soul

854
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:48,140
Lock me in the deep silence

855
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:53,140
Not leaving you

856
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,740
The line at the end of your heart

857
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,740
A wind that dares to touch my soul

858
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:07,740
The feeling can be broken

859
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:12,740
You and I just keep on falling

860
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:17,740
The line at the end of your heart

861
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:22,740
A wind that dares to touch my soul

862
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,740
The line at the end of your heart

863
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:32,740
Not leaving you

864
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:37,740
The line at the end of your heart

865
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:42,740
A wind that dares to touch my soul

866
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:47,740
The feeling can be broken

867
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:52,740
You and I just keep on falling

868
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,740
How could we meet

869
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:02,740
How could we meet
