1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

2
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,200
I want to be with you

3
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,720
Please give me a life of shining fortune

4
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,400
I want to be with you

5
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
I want to be with you

6
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,520
But I ask you

7
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,440
The courage to be together

8
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,120
I want to be with you

9
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,800
I want to be with you

10
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,480
I want to be with you

11
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,160
In my heart

12
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,440
Tang Chen's back sword protein powder

13
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,640
Increases immunity

14
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,880
Invite you to watch the Yugu Yao

15
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,760
Protecting power milk powder

16
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,800
Choose the best skin

17
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,720
With HMO 3SL new ingredients

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,080
Invite you to watch the Yugu Yao

19
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,720
Master, as long as I'm here

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,880
I will never let you kill A Yue

21
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,760
Zhu Yan, did you listen to me?

22
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,720
I have

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,640
Then why are you so stubborn?

24
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,920
Get out of the way

25
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,960
Because because

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,480
Because I like A Yue

27
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,120
You talk

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,160
What did you say?

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,120
Don't talk nonsense

30
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm not lying

31
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:40,080
Master

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,320
I was willing to die because of the dead

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,320
I was willing to die because of the dead

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,640
I'm willing to die because of the dead

35
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:46,720
I'm willing to die because of the dead

36
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,040
I'm willing to die because of the dead

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,280
I was willing to die because of the dead

38
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,360
I'm willing to die because of the dead

39
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,600
I'm willing to die because of the dead

40
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,160
I'm willing to die because of the saved

41
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,480
Thanks.

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:48,880
Don't say it

43
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,680
Don't say it

44
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,160
Don't say it

45
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,120
Are you serious?

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,680
Yes

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,320
Yes

48
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,320
and return to the Heaven's Garden.

49
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,320
When you finally recognize me

50
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
and accept me as your disciple,

51
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,320
only Yuan can share my joy.

52
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
When you drove me down the Nine-Tree Mountain,

53
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,320
it was also Yuan who spent the most difficult time with me.

54
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
If it weren't for Yuan,

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,320
maybe I would have been married long ago.

56
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
I wouldn't have gone up the mountain

57
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
and met you.

58
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,320
I wouldn't have had the Bamboo Spell today.

59
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Yuan,

60
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
you don't have to lie to me to save me.

61
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,320
The person I really love is...

62
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
It's Yuan!

63
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
I know I'm limited.

64
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,320
I know it's hard to compare myself with you.

65
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
I will only drag you down again and again

66
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
and hurt you.

67
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
It's Yuan.

68
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,320
It's Yuan who told me

69
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,320
that even if I can never catch up with you in this life,

70
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
he would always stay by my side.

71
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
If you don't believe me,

72
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
you can go to Tianji Peak to ask.

73
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
Who doesn't know that the reason why Qingdu was rejected

74
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
was because they met me in the Garden

75
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
and shared their love with Yuan?

76
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
So,

77
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
I was just being selfish.

78
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
I was just being selfish.

79
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
I was just being selfish.

80
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Yan'er.

81
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Master.

82
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
This is my personal matter.

83
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
I shouldn't have told you.

84
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
But in today's situation,

85
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,320
I just hope you can let Yuan go.

86
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Yan'er.

87
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
In this life,

88
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
I will be a secret agent with Yuan.

89
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,320
I won't let anyone else have a chance to succeed.

90
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Yan'er, stop talking.

91
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
It's too late.

92
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
The Ghost Blood has been released.

93
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,320
I must kill the child

94
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
and the child

95
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
right now.

96
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
I must kill Yuan Haihuang.

97
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Even if he is the one you love.

98
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Yan'er.

99
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Yan'er.

100
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Yan'er.

101
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
Qian Shuo.

102
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Yan'er learned Qian Shuo for him.

103
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Zhu Yan.

104
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
Your Qian Shuo can't resist my beads.

105
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Move.

106
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Can you resist?

107
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Master will know in a moment.

108
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
I won't be mercy.

109
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Okay.

110
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Then I will die with Yuan.

111
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Okay.

112
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Yan'er.

113
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
Yan'er.

114
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Yan'er.

115
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Tell me.

116
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
You want to die with him?

117
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Yan'er.

118
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Thank God.

119
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
You finally wake up.

120
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
You scared me.

121
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Come.

122
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Where is Yan'er?

123
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Come.

124
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Yan'er.

125
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Yan'er.

126
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
How is Yan'er?

127
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
When I arrived at the secret passage,

128
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
she was lying on the ground.

129
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
You were beside her.

130
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
You didn't know what to do.

131
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
You tried your best to get me back from her.

132
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
I was just pretending.

133
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
What about Hai Huang?

134
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Those navy soldiers are indeed brave.

135
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
They protected Hai Huang.

136
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
They almost killed Qing Gang and Bai Feng Lin.

137
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
They almost killed them all.

138
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
But I have something to ask you.

139
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
What happened that day?

140
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Hai Huang's power is far less than yours.

141
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
How did he do that?

142
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,320
He escaped from you and hurt you like this.

143
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
What gave birth to me

144
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
is the power of the beads.

145
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Beads?

146
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
You mean

147
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
your beads

148
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
were finally cast on yourself.

149
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Why did you take back the beads?

150
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
Is it because of the beads?

151
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
So in Yan'er's heart,

152
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
the one she has always liked

153
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
is Zhiyuan.

154
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
She doesn't believe in the same person.

155
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
What did you say?

156
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Okay.

157
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Then I'll die with Yuan.

158
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,320
So I was the one who did all this.

159
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Impossible.

160
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
They are over two hundred years apart.

161
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Besides, that merman

162
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
had already died for his great-grandmother.

163
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
How could Zhu Yan still like her?

164
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
There must be a misunderstanding.

165
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
There is no reason

166
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
for love.

167
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
As long as I know that

168
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Zhu Yan likes Zhiyuan,

169
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
I can stop him.

170
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm just thinking

171
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
I must kill Haihuang.

172
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
But that day,

173
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,320
how should I face Yan'er?

174
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Don't worry about her.

175
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Think about how to recover.

176
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Although you are safe,

177
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
you are badly injured.

178
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
What's more,

179
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
you were beaten by the West Desert.

180
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
You were beaten by the West Desert.

181
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
You were beaten by the West Desert.

182
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
You were beaten by the West Desert.

183
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
You were beaten by the West Desert.

184
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
You used Zhiyuan.

185
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
You need to recover

186
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
at least three or five months.

187
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Why don't you

188
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
use Zhiyuan

189
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
instead?

190
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
No.

191
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
I can't let Daziming know

192
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
that I used Zhiyuan.

193
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Why?

194
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
What's the matter

195
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
that I can't know?

196
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
We are talking about...

197
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,320
It's the thing between me and Chongming.

198
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Please forgive me.

199
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
How is your injury?

201
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
I have Zhiyuan's body.

202
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
My injury

203
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
is almost recovered.

204
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Your level

205
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
is much higher than that of Haihuang.

206
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
How can your injury be so serious?

207
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
The merman is cunning.

208
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
And I'm not familiar with their secret tunnels.

209
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
So I was hit

210
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
and was hit by their secret tunnels.

211
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
I let them escape.

212
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
Please rest assured.

213
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
If they meet again,

214
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
they won't be so lucky.

215
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
It's inevitable to lose the secret.

216
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
You need to recover first.

217
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
You have Zhiyuan's body.

218
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
You will recover in a few days.

219
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Yes.

220
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Chongming.

221
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
I will block the news

222
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
that Ying'er is injured.

223
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Ying'er will recover in a few days.

224
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Tell Ying'er to recover.

225
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Tell him to practice in seclusion.

226
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Okay.

227
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Ying'er.

228
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
I have some

229
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
healing herbs.

230
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
It's good for your injury.

231
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
I'll ask Chongming to get them with me.

232
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Ying'er's injury

233
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
is obviously because of the beads.

234
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
How could she be hit by the beads?

235
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
The secret tunnel was dark

236
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
and it was hard to get out.

237
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
She said

238
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
she didn't want to hurt the innocent.

239
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
That's why she took back the beads

240
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
and let the merman escape.

241
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Hurt the innocent?

242
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
That day,

243
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
there were only Ying'er and Haihuang

244
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
and others in the secret tunnel.

245
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
I don't know.

246
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
I don't know.

247
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
Who else?

248
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
And...

249
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Answer me.

250
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Zhu Yan.

251
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Zhu Yan, that bitch,

252
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
she was afraid of Shi Ying

253
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,320
so she broke in to fight with Haihuang.

254
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
But Shi Ying was afraid of hurting Zhu Yan

255
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
so she took back the beads at the last moment.

256
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
It's really a fate.

257
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,320
I thought she was useful

258
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
so I gave her the beads

259
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,320
so she could stay with Ying'er.

260
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
If Zhu Yan

261
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
killed Ying'er,

262
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
she would be killed by the rebels.

263
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
So you knew

264
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
that Zhu Yan was the one who killed Shi Ying.

265
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
There are so many things

266
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
in the Jiuyi Mountain

267
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,320
that can't be hidden from my eyes.

268
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Then why did you

269
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
tell me that

270
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Shi Ying's fate was over?

271
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
You were lying to me.

272
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
Are you doing this for...

273
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Without her,

274
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,320
how could Ying'er be willing to go back to Hong Chen?

275
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
Now,

276
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
I've achieved my goal.

277
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Ying'er has fallen for Chen Xin.

278
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
She will definitely take off her robe.

279
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
If Zhu Yan doesn't know

280
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,320
that she will still be entangled with Ying'er,

281
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
I have to do something.

282
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Except for her,

283
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Ying'er's health is important.

284
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Take care of her.

285
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
I'll choose some medicine for her

286
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
to help her heal.

287
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Yes.

288
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
You heard it all?

289
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
I'm sorry.

290
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
If this was all

291
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
the plan of Da Si Ming,

292
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
I wouldn't have

293
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
put you and Zhu Yan in the same place.

294
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
It's all my fault

295
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
that you were always

296
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
so angry.

297
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
That's why you're so sad now.

298
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
It's none of your business.

299
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
It's the same for both of us.

300
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
It's all in the past.

301
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
Now,

302
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Da Si Ming has fallen for Zhu Yan.

303
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
What are you going to do?

304
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
The King of Yan

305
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Yan'er is awake.

306
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
Yan'er.

307
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Father.

308
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Mother.

309
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Father.

310
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Yan'er.

311
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
How do you feel?

312
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
What are you doing here?

313
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
You've been unconscious for days and nights.

314
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
You're so confused.

315
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
What do you mean by

316
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
we're here too?

317
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,280
You're here too.

318
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,560
This is our home.

319
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,440
Yes.

320
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,640
Yan,

321
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,040
Chongming sent you back a few days ago

322
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,320
and said you were too tired to practice.

323
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,320
What kind of practice is this?

324
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,400
You're not allowed to practice anymore.

325
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,120
Yes.

326
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,200
Under Master's heaven,

327
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,880
I didn't die.

328
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,600
Did Master let me go?

329
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
What about A'Yuan?

330
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,440
Father, mother,

331
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,640
how is Hai Huang?

332
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,480
Look.

333
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,200
I'm telling you

334
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
to be careful.

335
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,160
You've started it again.

336
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,920
You're a girl.

337
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,360
It's good to be safe.

338
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,440
Your master and Qingbai

339
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,000
are in charge of the war.

340
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,000
Do you still suspect

341
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
your master's ability?

342
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,760
Yes.

343
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,520
Although this time,

344
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,040
it's not to let Hai Huang escape.

345
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,040
What?

346
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,920
Hai Huang didn't die?

347
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,640
Master indeed showed mercy.

348
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,480
But Master took back the Divine Beads.

349
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Then my master...

350
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,760
Don't move.

351
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,720
It's good.

352
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,360
What's wrong with Shao Siming?

353
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,280
He's in the middle of the training.

354
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,320
After he's out of the camp,

355
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,360
he'll be able to calm down soon.

356
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,800
Kill Hai Huang and destroy the Imperial Army.

357
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,240
His Majesty ordered it.

358
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,600
You're awake.

359
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,720
Your daughter just woke up.

360
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,160
Why did you tell her so much?

361
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,280
Let her rest.

362
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,120
Okay.

363
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,040
Have a good rest.

364
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,040
I won't say anything.

365
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll go and check

366
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,960
if the soup is ready.

367
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,360
Right.

368
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,760
Don't disturb your master.

369
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,520
Go.

370
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,280
Okay.

371
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,920
Let's go.

372
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,400
Let Yan have a good rest.

373
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,400
Okay.

374
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,640
He thinks I like Yuan!

375
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,920
I told my master

376
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,960
that I like Yuan.

377
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,520
I was right.

378
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,280
I lied to him

379
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,040
and messed up his plan.

380
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,760
I don't know how angry he is.

381
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,320
He must not want to see me.

382
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,160
Master must be badly injured.

383
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,680
But I have no face to see him.

384
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,360
He's here.

385
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,840
Master.

386
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,360
Tell Zhu Yan that

387
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,640
I don't want to see him

388
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,720
in front of me again.

389
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,040
But your wound...

390
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,320
I'm fine.

391
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,360
I'm fine.

392
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,400
I'm fine.

393
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,360
I'm fine.

394
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm fine.

395
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,400
I'm fine.

396
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,520
I'm fine.

397
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,440
I'm fine.

398
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,440
I'm fine.

399
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,640
But your wound...

400
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Yin.

401
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,920
If Zhu Yan still has a long way to go,

402
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,240
I can help you.

403
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,480
Master.

404
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,880
What are you doing here at night?

405
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,560
Master.

406
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,360
It's my fault.

407
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,240
I didn't have the face to see you.

408
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,120
Are you okay?

409
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,160
Get up first.

410
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,560
We'll talk later.

411
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,600
You're happy

412
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,120
to see me, right?

413
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,440
Thank you for not killing me.

414
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,240
But I was too kind to you.

415
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,800
I don't know if I hurt myself.

416
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,600
You two

417
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,920
want to hurt me too?

418
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,520
That's good.

419
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,640
Actually,

420
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,760
I said those words

421
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,360
out of love.

422
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,800
I know

423
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,080
killing Hai Huang is His Majesty's order.

424
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,480
I have no choice.

425
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,640
But you

426
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,600
stopped the plan for me.

427
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
No.

428
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,760
I want you to go back

429
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,400
and practice the art of war.

430
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,120
Because next time I kill him,

431
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,160
you have the right

432
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,560
to face me two more times.

433
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,200
Master.

434
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,920
I didn't kill you last time

435
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,680
just because you saved my life

436
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,320
in the Cangwu Abyss.

437
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,280
I don't want to be

438
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,240
a bad person who kills people.

439
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,720
But next time, I won't.

440
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,160
Because of our friendship,

441
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,440
that's all.

442
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,840
From now on,

443
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,600
dust is dust,

444
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,280
and earth is earth.

445
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,400
Master.

446
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,920
Are you kidding me?

447
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,600
Why don't you want my disciple?

448
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,400
Master.

449
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,080
I, Shi Ying,

450
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,160
from now on,

451
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,960
I don't have a loyal and ungrateful

452
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,600
disciple who ignores the country.

453
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,400
Master.

454
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,280
Master.

455
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,960
Stop calling me that.

456
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,680
From now on,

457
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,160
I am not your master.

458
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,640
Go back.

459
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,000
Master.

460
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,360
Please give me back my blessing.

461
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,040
Please.

462
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,560
Master.

463
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,760
Please don't expel the maids from the temple.

464
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,440
Get lost!

465
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,640
Master!

466
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,960
Master!

467
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,800
Master!

468
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,640
Master!

469
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,520
Don't you want to open the door of the temple?

470
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,280
Master!

471
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,560
Master, don't!

472
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,520
Master!

473
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,720
Master!

474
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
Master.

475
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,040
Master left as soon as you recovered the jade bone.

476
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,440
What are you doing here?

477
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,240
If I don't do this,

478
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,480
he won't leave me.

479
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Master won't let him go.

480
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,720
And I must kill Hai Hong.

481
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,040
Instead of letting him suffer and despair in the future,

482
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,600
I'd rather let him hate me now.

483
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,560
It's raining.

484
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,920
I know.

485
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,720
But he's still kneeling outside.

486
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Let him go, Master.

487
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
Let him kneel.

488
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,480
He's dead,

489
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,400
so he has to leave me.

490
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,200
Master.

491
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,960
The gaze is like a flower re Catch me after the rain

492
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,100
The look is like faculty

493
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,000
Your startling gaze

494
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I want to be the shining scenery

495
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,600
I want to be the rain

496
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,400
I want to be the sky

497
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,600
I want to be the first encounter

498
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,600
That is engraved in my heart

499
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I want to be the shining scenery

500
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I want to be the rain

501
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I want to be the sky

502
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I want to be the first encounter

503
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That is engraved in my heart

504
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I want to be the rain

505
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I want to be the sky

506
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I want to be the first encounter

507
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
That is engraved in my heart

508
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Young Si Ming's taste is light

509
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The freshly brewed peach juice

510
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
will surely suit your taste

511
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I want to be the first encounter

512
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That is engraved in my heart

513
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I want to be the first encounter

514
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That is engraved in my heart

515
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I want to be the first encounter

516
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Why is he still kneeling outside the door?

517
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Why don't I send him back first?

518
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
As the only daughter of the King of Ch,

519
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
he has been kneeling outside the door.

520
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It will be a shame if he gets to know.

521
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Whatever.

522
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm sorry.

523
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Young Si Ming is now in the mountain.

524
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Is he the person who changed his mind

525
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
just because you kneeled in the rain for a whole night?

526
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You really don't understand your master anymore.

527
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yes.

528
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
He is right.

529
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Master asked me to leave the sect.

530
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
The conflict between Kong San and the Jiao clan

531
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
will never be resolved.

532
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
As long as Master sees that A Yuan

533
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
can bring peace to the two clans,

534
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
he can forgive me.

535
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yes.

536
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'll go find A Yuan.

537
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Guards.

538
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes.

539
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Bring him a cup of ginger tea.

540
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And prepare my clothes.

541
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
If you go out like this,

542
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
how will others miss your master?

543
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'll send you back to Ch's mansion first.

544
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Don't feel burdened.

545
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm doing this for Young Si Ming.

546
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Let him know how generous and kind I am.

547
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Thank you.

548
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Send the ingredients I chose

549
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
to the kitchen.

550
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Remember,

551
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
this soup needs to be cooked for an hour.

552
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yes.

553
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Every time you send something,

554
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
it's returned by the wind.

555
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Do you still want to persist?

556
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
What's important is not whether he eats it or not.

557
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I want him to know

558
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
that I never gave up.

559
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I want others to know that I'm a good choice.

560
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You didn't give up.

561
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So what you told me that day

562
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
was all fake.

563
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You can leave now.

564
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I have something to say to General Qing.

565
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Yes.

566
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
General Qing

567
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
doesn't allow me to go back on my word.

568
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I lost an important document.

569
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Did you take it?

570
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You suddenly came to my room that day

571
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
and said those words to me.

572
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I was so embarrassed.

573
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I didn't know

574
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
what you were thinking.

575
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I was so embarrassed.

576
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You told me those words

577
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
because Bai Feng Lin asked you to set a trap

578
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and steal it from me.

579
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The one who secretly passed the information to the Navy

580
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
is your brother.

581
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
General Qing,

582
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
you can't talk nonsense.

583
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Xuan Lu,

584
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
if you admit it now,

585
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I can still think of you as you

586
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
and your brother as your brother.

587
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I didn't.

588
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
If so,

589
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'll tell you

590
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
that the one you took from me

591
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
was stolen by me.

592
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
The one your brother wrote

593
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
is still in my hands.

594
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But the last three documents

595
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
are forced to be closed and the training is over.

596
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'll prove it to you.

597
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
No.

598
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It's really you.

599
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
This is...

600
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
On Mount Jiayi,

601
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
when you returned the gold to me,

602
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
you accidentally put a leaf in it.

603
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
A Night of Love

604
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
A night of love

605
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
has tied me up until today.

606
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But I'm still in love with you.

607
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But I, Qing Gang,

608
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
always have a bottom line.

609
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I don't blame you

610
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
for using my feelings again and again.

611
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm willing to do it.

612
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Because this is a private matter between us.

613
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But since you chose to help

614
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
an empty-handed traitor,

615
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I was wrong about you.

616
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
From now on,

617
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I can't be with you anymore.

618
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
No.

619
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
A Night of Love

620
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Please give me back

621
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
my jade pendant.

622
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I've lost the jade pendant

623
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
that I loved you.

624
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Princess Xue Lu,

625
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
no matter what the reason is,

626
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
it's a big crime

627
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
to be with an enemy.

628
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
No.

629
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
A Night of Love

630
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
If you overuse the spell of dream,

631
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
you'll keep sleeping.

632
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I didn't expect Ruyi to wake up.

633
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Maybe only your master

634
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
can handle the whole empty funeral.

635
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So my master saved Ruyi.

636
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yan,

637
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
you shouldn't have done that.

638
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You lied to your master

639
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
to save me

640
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
and said you liked me.

641
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You know your master...

642
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It's not the time to say that.

643
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I had no choice

644
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
at that time.

645
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I have no face

646
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
to face my master now.

647
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm here

648
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
to ask you

649
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
about your plan.

650
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I went to see you a few days ago.

651
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I wanted to say goodbye.

652
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But you were in a coma.

653
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Say goodbye?

654
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
In this situation,

655
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
it's the best choice

656
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
to lead the Jiao Ren Society to the sea.

657
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yes.

658
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The best choice.

659
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Then, you don't have to fight again.

660
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
My master can't catch you.

661
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You won't die

662
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
because of the identity of the sea king.

663
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
My master won't be

664
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
in a dilemma

665
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
because of me.

666
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yan,

667
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
are you leaving too?

668
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Of course.

669
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I'm the sea king.

670
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Okay.

671
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I support you.

672
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Thank you for your support.

673
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But you can only do it in your heart.

674
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yan,

675
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
don't interfere in this matter again.

676
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Commander Shao,

677
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
you left the capital so soon.

678
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Commander Shao,

679
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
the sea king hasn't been captured yet.

680
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It's better to act as soon as possible.

681
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I was careless

682
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and caused the sea king to escape.

683
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You two have worked hard.

684
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It's you who have worked hard.

685
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
You killed more than ten

686
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
of the imperial guards.

687
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
You almost

688
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
took the sea king away from them.

689
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
This is my duty.

690
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
General Bai,

691
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
you don't have to do this.

692
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I heard that

693
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
the Jiao people have stopped fighting.

694
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
They are going to leave the sea entrance.

695
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And you

696
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
destroyed many of the sea entrances.

697
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Jiao people and I

698
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
have been fighting for many years.

699
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
The sea entrance

700
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
is the place

701
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
where the Jiao people return to the Bilo Sea.

702
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
If you don't go through the sea entrance

703
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
and let the Jiao people go to the sea,

704
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
you will get lost

705
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
in the vast sea.

706
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So I forced the

707
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
imperial guards to surrender.

708
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
From their words,

709
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I learned that

710
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
the Jiao people entered the sea entrance.

711
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Then I fought with General Qing

712
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and cut off their retreat.

713
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Don't kill the Jiao people.

714
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
If they want to go back to the Bilo Sea,

715
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
just follow them.

716
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
We just need to keep an eye on the sea king.

717
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
He is the culprit.

718
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
But His Majesty's order

719
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
is to kill all the Jiao people.

720
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
If we don't cut off the grass,

721
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
the spring breeze will blow and the wind will blow.

722
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
If we catch the sea king earlier,

723
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
they will be outnumbered.

724
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm afraid it won't work.

725
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
General Qing is right.

726
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
If you

727
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
draw the sea king's appearance,

728
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I can send someone

729
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
to attack him.

730
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
In this case,

731
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I think we can

732
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
save a lot of things.

733
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
If we can catch him

734
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
with just a portrait,

735
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
what's the difference between

736
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
the ordinary soldiers of the sea king

737
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and the sea king's army?

738
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
These places

739
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
may also be the sea entrance.

740
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Please send someone

741
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
to check it.

742
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
The sea king will definitely

743
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
take someone to escape from these places.

744
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
From what I know about him,

745
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
he won't leave

746
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
before all the Jiao people

747
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
retreat to the Bilo Sea.

748
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
We just need to torture him.

749
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So,

750
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
we don't need to hurt

751
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
other innocent Jiao people.

752
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
We don't need to destroy the sea entrance.

753
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
General,

754
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
do you have anything else to say?

755
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
General Qing,

756
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I think Cousin's plan

757
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
is very clear.

758
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Why don't we go down

759
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
and carry out the plan?

760
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Yes.

761
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
General Bai,

762
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
are you worried that

763
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I will report to Young Commander

764
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
about the information?

765
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You don't need to do that.

766
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
When the time is right,

767
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I will ask for forgiveness from Young Commander.

768
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
General Bai is looking for an excuse

769
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
to delay the time.

770
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Fei Ye,

771
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I didn't mean to

772
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
collude with the enemy.

773
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I just want to delay the war

774
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and take more chances to make achievements.

775
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
But now the situation is clear.

776
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
The Jiao people are going to retreat to the Bilo Sea.

777
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I don't need to do this again.

778
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Don't worry.

779
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm ready.

780
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
The day of the victory of this war

781
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
is the day I ask for forgiveness from Young Commander.

782
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You convinced him?

783
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm sorry.

784
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It's just a matter of delaying the war.

785
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
If he insists on reporting,

786
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I can only get rid of him.

787
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Qing Gang is a general.

788
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
The two tribes are at war now.

789
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
He died in the battlefield.

790
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Of course he deserves it.

791
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Princess,

792
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
we have done too many wrong things.

793
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
If we make one more mistake,

794
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm afraid we will be waiting for our mistakes.

795
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
What are you talking about?

796
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
We have no way out now.

797
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I'm committing a crime of colluding with the enemy.

798
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
If I make a mistake,

799
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
the Bai family will never rise again.

800
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
But we can't...

801
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
But what?

802
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You are not the guy I pity, are you?

803
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I warn you.

804
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
You are from the Bai family.

805
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Don't put your arms out.

806
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm sorry.

807
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I'm worried that I can't save her,

808
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
but I sacrificed my own life in vain.

809
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Lord Yuan.

810
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
How is it?

811
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
The old and weak women in the tribe

812
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
have left with their clothes and clothes.

813
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
The Xiaoqi Camp of Bai Fengming

814
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
is still being chased by the Jiao people.

815
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But the silversmiths in Qing Gang's home

816
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
are willing to let them go.

817
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Then we should leave

818
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
as far as possible from Qing Gang's control.

819
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Yes.

820
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
But you

821
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
must let them go.

822
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Yes.

823
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
But, Lord Yuan,

824
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
there are only a few

825
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Bilo Sea's entrances.

826
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And Qing Gang is willing to

827
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
leave mercy to the innocent Jiao people.

828
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
But it may not be

829
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
a good idea for the brothers.

830
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And the wind is getting stronger

831
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
and the search is getting more and more intense.

832
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I'm afraid

833
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
we can't get all of them out

834
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
and they will find all the entrances

835
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
of Kong Sanren.

836
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
If the Bilo Sea dies,

837
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I will die for him.

838
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
The rain falls.

839
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
How can I face the fate?

840
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
How can I face the fate

841
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
that I can't break free from?

842
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
The more I think about it, the more my tears are burning.

843
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
The thread in your heart

844
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
has been made into my soul.

845
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
The star in my feet

846
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
is not by your side.

847
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
The thread in your heart

848
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
has been made into my soul.

849
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
The feelings can be broken into pieces.

850
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
You and I are just like a couple.

851
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
The thread in your heart

852
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
has been made into my soul.

853
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
The star in my feet

854
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
is not by your side.

855
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
The thread in your heart

856
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
has been made into my soul.

857
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
The feelings can be broken into pieces.

858
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You and I are just like a couple.

859
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
How can we meet?

860
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
How can we meet for the sake of tomorrow?
