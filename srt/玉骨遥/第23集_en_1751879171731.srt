1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please give me a life of shining fortune

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want to be a piece of jade

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to be a piece of heaven

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But I want to be the eternal love for you

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I want to be the eternal love for you

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I want to be the first person in your heart

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Welcome to subscribe channel

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If you were me

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You have gone too

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have no one then

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,560
Yes.

13
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,720
How can I bear to leave you alone?

14
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,080
Actually I know

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,520
why you want to marry Huotu Bu.

16
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,840
When you are free,

17
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,600
I will recognize you

18
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,640
in everything.

19
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,400
I want to tell you personally

20
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
that you are the one

21
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,480
who made me wait for 200 years.

22
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,280
But

23
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,360
now Dragon God has awakened,

24
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,720
and my whereabouts have been revealed.

25
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,520
I can never

26
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,440
let you fall into the same

27
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,000
danger and danger as 200 years ago.

28
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,400
When I lure Haihuang to the right path,

29
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,800
the grudges between the two tribes

30
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
will never be able to be kept between us.

31
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,520
No one can hurt you again.

32
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,120
No one can stop us

33
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,440
from being together again.

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,520
You Yi,

35
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,880
wait for me.

36
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,080
God willing,

37
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,520
Thule and I

38
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,640
will fail.

39
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,860
Since last

40
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,440
evening,

41
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,240
I found it around 들laughing

42
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,780
I heard from the old guy

43
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,240
this tower is exacting

44
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,440
And on the map

45
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,660
it's marked

46
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,980
Every requirements for this map

47
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,740
are carefully marked

48
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,220
Who only gave this sign

49
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,100
to me?

50
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,940
Try guessing

51
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,180
It's not a wages

52
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,340
Where are Xue Ying and Qing Gang?

53
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,100
Princess Xue Ying and General Qing

54
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,620
went back this morning.

55
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,100
I guess this picture

56
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,860
was left to you by General Qing.

57
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,260
With Qing Gang's position,

58
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,620
how could he find out my thoughts?

59
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,820
Forget it.

60
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,340
Who cares about the map?

61
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,900
I'll use it first.

62
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,180
Maybe.

63
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,620
Since we're going to marry into the Land of War,

64
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,060
we should know more about it.

65
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,060
Yes.

66
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,700
We're leaving in two days.

67
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,940
My Lady,

68
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,700
are you sure you don't want to take the jade seal with you?

69
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,260
Father.

70
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,380
Mother.

71
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,500
I was too naive.

72
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,620
I've caused trouble

73
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,820
and caused you and mother to suffer.

74
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm grateful to you.

75
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,380
I'm a man of my word.

76
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,980
I'm going to

77
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,140
the high mountains and the remote lands.

78
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,940
I'll return to my wife and have a good life.

79
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,660
I'm afraid I won't be able to

80
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,140
serve you and your parents.

81
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,140
I'm afraid I'll be

82
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,780
your daughter in the next life

83
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,340
and be a burden to you.

84
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,360
May Royal Father and sled deputy

85
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,420
bring you happiness in prioritizing the heaven's wheel.

86
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,480
I've thought of all the diocese laws

87
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,520
ii will make it clear

88
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,720
to my parents in return

89
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,060
We'd be settled

90
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,840
We're gravel-clad

91
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,420
after driving apart

92
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,800
묻뵀어

93
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,540
Never

94
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,420
Let me

95
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,220
det explorer

96
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,820
serve as your

97
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,120
equals

98
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,380
I

99
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,380
Yan'er,

100
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,340
don't say that.

101
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,340
We're not saying goodbye.

102
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,140
Although you're married,

103
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,140
you can still get married and get married.

104
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,260
As long as you want,

105
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,540
you can come back

106
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,580
to live with us

107
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,340
every few months.

108
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,900
Yan'er,

109
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,620
I've made a plan for you.

110
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,440
I won't let you suffer in the

111
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,740
Land of the Dead.

112
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,700
This is the song group

113
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,740
that I chose for you.

114
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,660
Among them,

115
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,620
many people

116
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,860
will watch you grow up

117
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,140
and be loyal to you

118
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,260
and keep you safe.

119
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,620
And these

120
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,620
are your food and clothing.

121
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,460
I've also prepared them for you.

122
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,620
In the future,

123
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,620
I'll send you the song in the future.

124
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,700
I want you to live

125
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,820
a life of peace and happiness.

126
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:17,940
Yan'er,

127
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,060
I...

128
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,900
Father,

129
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,700
Mother,

130
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,860
promise me

131
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,700
that no matter what happens in the future,

132
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,380
you'll be fine.

133
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,860
I'm not a good woman.

134
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,540
I should remember to take care of myself.

135
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,380
Father,

136
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,220
don't be angry all the time.

137
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,500
I still love to see you smile.

138
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,260
Father, please smile.

139
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,100
Smile.

140
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,260
Yes.

141
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,420
Today is

142
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,140
Yan'er's wedding day.

143
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,660
Didn't we agree

144
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,020
to be happy?

145
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,180
Yes, we're happy.

146
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,580
We're happy.

147
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,900
Don't worry about us.

148
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,140
We'll be fine.

149
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,140
But you...

150
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,420
Without me and your father by your side,

151
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,660
you'll be fine.

152
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,540
Yan'er.

153
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,380
Yan'er.

154
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,180
It's okay.

155
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,980
Don't cry.

156
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,100
It's good.

157
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,220
Get out.

158
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,420
It's good.

159
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,580
It's good.

160
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,380
It's just fine.

161
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,740
I'm just fine.

162
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,740
This is it.

163
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,140
What?

164
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,420
cope with those Who are hiding from me.

165
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,220
I don't know

166
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,220
what would have changed

167
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,460
between me andBCA.

168
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,280
By tying into the metal

169
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,020
I could seem like an immortal

170
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,940
His fingers

171
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,420
Wipe away the basic

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,900
Why you just procedures

173
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,620
Wipe out the ship

174
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,860

00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,700
Greetings, Your Highness.

199
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,300
It must have been a long journey.

200
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,620
We have prepared

201
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,780
the necessary supplies for you.

202
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,020
Please have a rest.

203
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,860
This is my son, Kerk.

204
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,380
It's my pleasure

205
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,380
to welcome you.

206
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,860
Greetings, Your Highness.

207
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,020
He is a little arrogant

208
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,540
and a little heroic.

209
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,540
But I don't like him.

210
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,540
Greetings, Your Highness.

211
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,020
Although they are all strong,

212
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,820
they are not my rivals.

213
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,660
But this great sorcerer

214
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,980
makes me a little scared.

215
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,780
I have to test his magic.

216
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,260
Please have a rest in the tent for a few days

217
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,260
and wait for the good day.

218
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,940
Thank you, Your Highness.

219
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,900
Please.

220
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,340
The source of the sorcerer's abilities

221
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,020
and powers are traces of the ordinary people.

222
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,420
They all are very great together.

223
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,500
Pleasei, please have a rest.

224
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,500
It's okay.

225
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,660
He must draw a Х-shaped неёium several times.

226
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,900
It can eliminate the diseases of external organs in the body.

227
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,940
No, it's okay.

228
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:37,220
He should not think we are good at the witchwork.

229
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,020
Since it's an import of self- wizened weapons,

230
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,060
how come there is an import of robbing people?

231
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,020
What do you want to do?

232
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,340
Stay here.

233
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,780
Go, go, go.

234
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:56,940
Yu'er.

235
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,540
Yu'er.

236
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,780
What are you doing?

237
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,900
Your Highness the Proud Prince.

238
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,120
Just now, I found

239
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,140
a tom that injured me.

240
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,060
I want to take it back to save it.

241
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,020
Your hand...

242
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,900
It's not heavy, but it hurts.

243
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,540
Let's put it in the box first.

244
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,260
Okay?

245
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,180
Here.

246
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

247
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,020
The star and moon are in the middle of the night.

248
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,140
Peace and happiness are in the air.

249
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,700
Looking back, we've been apart for a long time.

250
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,340
There are many things to come.

251
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,620
I heard that the other high disciple,

252
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,780
Princess Zhu Yan, is about to marry Huotu Bu.

253
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,420
If you go to the mountain to visit her,

254
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,180
would you like to come to visit her?

255
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:07,900
It's full!

256
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,820
It's full! It's full!

257
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,380
It's full, Ying!

258
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,060
Is she going to the West Desert to get married?

259
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,260
The more peaceful she looks,

260
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,340
the more she's fierce in her heart.

261
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,060
Could she be forced to do so?

262
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,660
Cheng Ming.

263
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,060
Let's go.

264
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,180
Are you washing my brush?

265
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,780
No.

266
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,100
I'm thirsty.

267
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,140
Yes, I'm thirsty.

268
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,380
No.

269
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,460
Master.

270
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,540
Do you know what my wish is?

271
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,460
I want all the books here

272
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,620
to have my name

273
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,940
on the first street of the West Desert.

274
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,100
Can you finish reading all these books?

275
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,740
I want to stay here

276
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,540
and accompany you for the rest of my life.

277
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,140
I can finish reading them all in one day.

278
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,700
Are you happy Mm' deuxième brings you home?

279
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,580
Don't think I like her.

280
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,620
By the way,

281
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,580
I heard that Huotu Bu

282
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,540
experienced a desert monster on limited time.

283
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,140
Is it true?

284
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,900
Didn't you think she knew

285
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,460
you Peninsula?

286
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,500
That really is something with some dreams andенного élites.

287
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,860
There has been a biggest trouble

288
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,720
over the years here in our hometown,

289
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,660
but you haven't seen it in a long time.

290
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,460
You are the first to know it,

291
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,540
I already knew it.

292
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,140
But can you

293
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,540
tell me how you really felt

294
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,220
when you saw that effect

295
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,220
You don't need to worry

296
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,900
if you haven't seen her.

297
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,300
I won't disturb you any longer.

298
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,340
Goodbye.

299
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,860
My Lady.

300
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,820
Yufei.

301
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,860
I'll tell you something now.

302
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,220
Promise me

303
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,420
not to disturb her after you hear it.

304
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,220
I want to run away from the marriage.

305
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,020
What?

306
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,500
My Lady.

307
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,140
Are you telling the truth?

308
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:18,820
Yes.

309
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,060
I want to pretend to run away from the marriage.

310
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,820
I've made the decision

311
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,220
before I agreed to marry into the Huotu Tribe.

312
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,060
No wonder

313
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,020
you agreed so easily.

314
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,220
It's His Majesty's order

315
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,020
to marry into the Huotu Tribe.

316
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,060
His Majesty's order

317
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,820
is a crime against His Majesty's order.

318
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,340
I don't want to drag the whole Chizu Tribe

319
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,700
into this.

320
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,420
So I can only pretend to run away.

321
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,460
In this way,

322
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,540
I can return my parents' dignity

323
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,820
and relieve the pressure of the Qing Tribe

324
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,620
and also my freedom.

325
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,700
My Lady, it's not right.

326
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,260
Yufei.

327
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,380
Think about it.

328
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,220
I'm here to help you.

329
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,740
Why does it look like

330
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,300
you're here, Mr. Yuan?

331
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,740
Yuan.

332
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,180
My Lady, I'll go out and help you.

333
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,220
Yuan, it's really you.

334
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,620
It's me.

335
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,340
Yuan, sit down.

336
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:25,940
Yuan,

337
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,780
are you feeling better?

338
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,660
Where have you been recently?

339
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,580
I've been here with you.

340
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,300
So Yuan knew about my plan before.

341
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,100
That map and the nuts

342
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,860
were sent by Yuan.

343
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,220
Yuan still protected me like this.

344
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,340
Now everything is ready.

345
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,180
If you have any plans on the day of the wedding,

346
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,020
I'll welcome you to leave at any time.

347
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,020
No.

348
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,100
I can't accept your help this time.

349
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,260
Why?

350
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,780
I'm grateful for your kindness.

351
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,180
But running away from marriage

352
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,540
is a capital crime.

353
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,580
I'll take the responsibility for this.

354
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,900
I can't

355
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,380
and I don't want to

356
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,900
involve anyone,

357
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,740
including you.

358
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,300
Yuan.

359
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,460
Yuan.

360
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,740
You've been worrying about me all the time.

361
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260
But everyone

362
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,420
has to face difficulties alone.

363
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,420
This time,

364
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,340
I'm ready to do anything.

365
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,620
The first map of the Jiuyi Mountain

366
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,140
is not a waste of time.

367
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,820
I'll be safe and sound.

368
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,380
Yuan.

369
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,140
Don't interfere in this matter for me.

370
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,660
I know your worry.

371
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,100
And I've heard a lot

372
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,020
about the bad things

373
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,780
about the Navy all the way.

374
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:44,780
Yuan.

375
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,020
Don't bother about me.

376
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,740
Just do what you should do.

377
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,620
Now the Navy is in a mess.

378
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,260
If Elder Qian knows that I'm with Yan,

379
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,860
he'll be unfaithful to me.

380
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,220
Yan.

381
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,900
You must be careful.

382
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,100
I've found a suitable horse for you.

383
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,260
It's in the closest stable to the camp.

384
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,180
And

385
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,460
the east of the tribe has strengthened the harbor.

386
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,540
The defense on the west side is the weakest.

387
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,940
Don't stop after you leave.

388
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,860
You'll be safe

389
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,900
when you reach the Tianchi in the desert.

390
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,340
The difficulties you're facing

391
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,580
are not the same as mine.

392
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,540
But I can't help you.

393
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,740
Yuan.

394
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,060
You must take care of yourself.

395
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,020
I'll take care of myself.

396
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,180
After I finish my work,

397
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,420
I'll go around the world with you.

398
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,700
Okay?

399
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,060
Why hasn't the firewood soldier come out?

400
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,580
If you disturb the princess,

401
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,220
the princess will be punished.

402
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,220
What are you shouting for?

403
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,020
What's wrong with adding more firewood?

404
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,780
Can you afford to bear the princess' cold?

405
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,660
Yan.

406
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,660
You must take care of yourself.

407
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,020
Wait.

408
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,820
Yuan.

409
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,620
Promise me.

410
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,780
We'll

411
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,980
finish our work smoothly.

412
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,580
And we'll meet in another place safely.

413
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,140
Okay?

414
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,700
Yes.

415
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,660
The barrier must be set by Great Shaman.

416
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,540
It's indeed a narrow and ordinary place.

417
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,860
We can only stop the villagers nearby.

418
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,420
The Wen Xie horse is fast,

419
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,420
but it can't run far.

420
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,860
The Long Xie horse can run for a thousand miles,

421
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,580
but it's easy to be caught.

422
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,620
The Wen Xie horse is fast,

423
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,220
but it can't run far.

424
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,180
The Wen Xie horse is fast,

425
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,820
but it's easy to be caught.

426
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,020
I have this horse.

427
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,260
You...

428
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,780
Youwhy they are all warm!

429
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,140
Is this

430
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,820
your为什么 todos?

431
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,140
I know.

432
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,580
That barrier

433
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,180
wasn't to protect others.

434
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,100
It was to trap you.

435
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,420
Who is so cruel?

436
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,540
Do you want to starve

437
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,220
such a little child?

438
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,900
I'll go get some food for you.

439
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,900
If possible,

440
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,140
I'll go find a doctor

441
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,820
to give the child...

442
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,580
Then...

443
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,740
What do you want me to do?

444
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,820
You know this?

445
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,820
다가

446
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,540
Yuan.

447
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,380
You know Mr. Yuan?

448
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,180
Who are you?

449
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,340
Yu

450
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,620
Ji

451
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,100
You're Yu Ji,

452
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,380
the old prince's favorite.

453
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,160
There was someone

454
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,740
I saw in 열�,

455
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,060
I must be tortured here

456
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,100
because the old prince couldn't

457
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,540
tolerate you after he died.

458
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,220
That's why I locked you up here.

459
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,060
What's the name of this child?

460
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,620
Su...

461
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,860
Su...

462
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,420
Su...

463
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,740
If I can only get some food,

464
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,860
I'll let them live for a few more days.

465
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,820
They'll starve to death after I leave.

466
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,220
I want to save them

467
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,180
unless I take them out.

468
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,340
But I can only

469
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,340
get out of my own way.

470
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,020
Even Consort Yu can't take care of me.

471
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,380
I can't take two people

472
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,660
who can't even walk.

473
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,660
Mother.

474
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,780
You're awake.

475
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,180
Who are you?

476
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,580
You want to hurt my mother.

477
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,180
You...

478
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,300
Did Prince Bai know

479
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,500
that you came here this time?

480
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,140
No, Father.

481
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,660
It's me,

482
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,020
I came here without permission.

483
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,060
You're here to help Consort Qing again?

484
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,540
Your Majesty, please check it carefully.

485
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
I've never been

486
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,740
treated like anyone else.

487
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,020
I just want to listen to my fate.

488
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,340
I'm the strongest person in the world.

489
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,860
According to what you said,

490
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,460
you're testing

491
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,620
the ability of the Nine-divine.

492
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,060
I know I'm guilty.

493
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,740
I'm to blame for everything.

494
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,260
But after what happened,

495
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,900
I'm not going to be so cruel.

496
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,540
I'm here today

497
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,340
to atone for my crime

498
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,860
and report

499
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,500
the conspiracy of the Qing family.

500
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,660
Consort Qing ordered me to enter the palace that day.

501
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,580
I accidentally saw

502
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,980
Consort Qing

503
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,340
and the messenger of the Huotu Tribe

504
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,180
plotting a conspiracy.

505
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,740
Your Highness,

506
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,300
the wedding of Prince Ke'er Ke and Princess Zhu Yan

507
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,740
has begun.

508
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,980
Please rest assured.

509
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,060
Everything

510
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,860
will be done according to your plan.

511
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,060
But does Consort Su Da

512
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,500
think that

513
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,460
the wedding

514
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,860
and the following arrangements

515
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,700
are all a blessing from heaven?

516
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,460
Consort Su has listened to me.

517
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,260
Of course she will do as I say.

518
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,420
Good.

519
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,860
Very good.

520
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,100
People say that

521
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,460
the Qing family is kind.

522
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,980
In fact, they don't know

523
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,860
that the real best insect

524
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,420
is not the poisonous insect,

525
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,460
but the human heart.

526
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,300
Your Highness, you're a good planner.

527
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,700
The Man family can't see through you.

528
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,700
If you can do this,

529
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,780
you will be able to establish a reputation

530
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,540
and keep the country safe.

531
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,260
The most interesting thing in this matter

532
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,820
is not what the messenger of the Huotu Tribe said.

533
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,500
If you can do this,

534
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,700
you will be able to establish a reputation

535
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,100
and keep the country safe.

536
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,900
Although the Huotu Tribe is a large border,

537
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,340
with their loyalty,

538
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,540
they can't hold on to these words.

539
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
I hope that the clues

540
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,900
I provide can help you.

541
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,540
You're a good planner.

542
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,100
Five years ago,

543
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,620
Consort Qing set up this

544
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,860
black sorceress in the Huotu Tribe.

545
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,140
This time,

546
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,900
when the old prince died,

547
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,180
the sorceress tried to lure the consort

548
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,500
to marry Zhu Yan

549
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,740
and control the West Desert

550
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,580
to do evil deeds.

551
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,580
Consort Qing sent Shi Yu

552
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,340
to suppress them.

553
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,980
They can establish a reputation for Shi Yu.

554
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,620
Their action

555
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,660
should be in the next few days.

556
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,180
So everything

557
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,420
is under the control of the Grand Minister.

558
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,260
I'm about to send Shi Yu

559
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,980
to the Huotu Tribe.

560
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,180
Here's the person.

561
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,980
It's Shi Yu.

562
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,780
You know her very well.

563
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,300
So I called her

564
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,940
now just to find her in Sui He Distance.

565
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:14,400
Yes, my

566
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,140
boss.

567
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,900
We're here.

568
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:21,900
Slow down.

569
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,740
This is my place.

570
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,140
It's very secluded.

571
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,380
Even if someone finds you,

572
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,660
they won't come here.

573
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,740
There are some dry food here.

574
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,020
You must be hungry.

575
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,020
Let me help you.

576
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,100
Pei Wen,

577
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,980
ask user Gan Yan

578
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,940
to intercede yourself.

579
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,300
Chief only.

580
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,420
Keep up yourself!

581
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:43,860
Chief...

582
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,300
Get out!

583
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,580
Get away!

584
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,140
Get away!

585
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,820
Is he all right?

586
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,180
Get up!

587
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,580
Get away!

588
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,780
You've been looking for me for years.

589
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,540
I can't stand your big gift.

590
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,540
You can rest here.

591
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,180
Wait for me to come back.

592
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,500
You can rest here.

593
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,180
You've become silly.

594
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,620
It's the inner voice of a fake evilди.

595
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,940
You have a deep mind.

596
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,940
It's the inner voice of a false evildi.

597
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,920
Chief.

598
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,560
MyLet Depression.

599
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,900
Imagine if they put out fire.

600
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,900
How fine I would sound...

601
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,500
and take myovance tar fire to wage war...

602
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,700
when there was such a cold outing!

603
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,500
sighs, chef,

604
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,740
restaurant

605
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,240
つ

606
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,660
These things were 500,

607
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,200
bloodala...

608
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,280
Wasps.

609
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,480
So you really don't need to care about me

610
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,440
and do what you should do?

611
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,280
The Ghost Realm Star is still in full bloom.

612
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,960
If the Sea Emperor falls into the hands of the evil ones,

613
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,840
Kong Sang and the Mages will be trapped in a place of endless misery.

614
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,200
I can't be with you with peace of mind.

615
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,200
Yao Yi,

616
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,560
you really know me best.

617
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,920
I'm sorry.

618
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,920
Your Lordship also saw this Ghost Realm Star.

619
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,240
I was just about to report to Your Lordship

620
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
and ask my disciples to go down the mountain to observe.

621
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,160
The hot weather is breaking out.

622
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,400
The dragon god is waking up.

623
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,840
It's indeed a sign of the past.

624
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,960
Judging from the direction,

625
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,400
the Ghost Realm Star appeared in the West Emperor's Map.

626
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,600
The star cloud has changed.

627
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,160
It's related to Kong Sang's state.

628
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,440
Wu Bei

629
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,240
can't just stand by and watch.

630
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,240
Of course.

631
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,560
But Your Lordship

632
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,200
don't need to worry too much.

633
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
The prophecy just said

634
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,520
that the Sea Emperor will return with the Ghost Realm Star.

635
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,240
It didn't say that the Sea Emperor will return

636
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,040
and will threaten Kong Sang.

637
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,120
Back then, the Mages defeated the State of Mere.

638
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,040
Many years have passed.

639
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,000
Most of the Mages have learned

640
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,760
to live in peace with Kong Sang.

641
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,760
So,

642
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,240
it's hard to make a conclusion

643
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,480
about whether the Ghost Realm Star is right or wrong.

644
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,360
It's hard to make a conclusion.

645
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,920
But this prophecy

646
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,560
is deeply in the hearts of people.

647
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,800
There must be someone who wants to fight.

648
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,560
If we use our bodies to fight,

649
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,760
the world will be in chaos.

650
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,160
It won't be long.

651
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,880
Your Lordship,

652
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,800
if the Ghost Realm Star is an urgent sign,

653
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,680
we should welcome the Holy Master of Taiping.

654
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,000
If it's a bad sign,

655
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,320
I'll take advantage of the fact that the Ghost Realm Star

656
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,560
has just been born,

657
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,640
I'll kill it at all costs.

658
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,200
Go ahead.

659
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,440
Yes, Your Lordship.

660
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,800
A Yan,

661
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,120
the Ghost Sphere is alive.

662
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,200
Maybe it's the fate of the High God

663
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,200
and Ying'er.

664
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,320
If you have the spirit in Heaven,

665
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,360
you must make it come true.

666
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,660
Show it here.

667
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,660
Separate procjd and

668
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,000
commodity on the womb.

669
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,760
I can finally drag out the spirit.

670
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
How does this Ghost Sphere Star

671
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,560
This is the reason why I regret it most.

672
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,560
I suspect he has guessed my identity.

673
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,560
It's a little troublesome if he finds out.

674
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,560
But when the Ghost Blood is angry,

675
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,560
his medicine is to investigate the Ghost Blood.

676
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,560
He gave me a hundred boxes of blood.

677
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,560
When he finds me again,

678
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,560
I will find a way to get rid of him.

679
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,560
A bunch of useless people.

680
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,560
A crippled beggar with a half-dead little boy.

681
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
You can let them escape.

682
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,560
Hurry up and find them back.

683
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,560
If you can't find them, you all can't live.

684
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,560
Yes.

685
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
Please calm down.

686
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
The current big thing is to let the King and Princess Zhu Yan

687
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
marry each other.

688
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,560
I will do it at the wedding night.

689
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,560
I will make a plan.

690
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,560
The materials for the preparation can be prepared properly.

691
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
Don't worry.

692
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,560
I caught some more people recently.

693
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,560
It's all set.

694
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,560
The King of the Sea has already made a big deal.

695
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,560
Why can't I feel his presence at all?

696
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,560
It's strange.

697
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,560
Why is there no one here?

698
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,560
May I ask,

699
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,560
when I was passing by a few days ago,

700
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,560
I saw some beggars here.

701
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,560
Why is there no one here these days?

702
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,560
How would I know?

703
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,560
You can ask others.

704
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,560
Don't worry.

705
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,560
I won't tell anyone.

706
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,560
A few years ago, the King was not feeling well.

707
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,560
The soldiers of Huotu Tribe

708
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,560
started to capture the beggars everywhere.

709
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,560
There are not many beggars here.

710
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
For the past two days,

711
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
there are many more soldiers on the streets.

712
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,560
They took away all the beggars.

713
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,560
I heard that they were all locked up in Guwei City.

714
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,560
I heard that they were all locked up in Guwei City.

715
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,560
They are all locked up in Guwei City.

716
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,560
Why did they capture the beggars?

717
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,560
Where is Guwei City?

718
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,560
I'm just a businessman.

719
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,560
How would I know?

720
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,560
It seems to be quite far.

721
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,560
Hurry up and go.

722
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,560
They are still catching the beggars everywhere.

723
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,560
Let's go.

724
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
Guwei City.

725
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,560
Could it be that the King of the Sea was captured in Guwei City

726
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,560
and lost his sense of sense with me?

727
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,560
I have to find Guwei City first.

728
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,560
The turtle's feet clearly show that the King of the Sea is nearby.

729
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,560
But there is not even a beggar here.

730
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,560
I'll go and find out.

731
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,560
Go ahead.

732
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,560
Hey, big brother.

733
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,560
Thank you.

734
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,560
I've found out.

735
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,560
They said that all the beggars were locked up in a place called Guwei City.

736
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,560
But no one knows where Guwei City is.

737
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,560
I wonder who did it.

738
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,560
There are many beggars in the Huotu Tribe.

739
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,560
Only the most powerful person can lock them all up.

740
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,560
You mean the Great Consort of Huotu Tribe?

741
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,560
Let's go meet her.

742
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,560
Wait a minute.

743
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,560
You're not going to find her now, are you?

744
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,560
What if I don't?

745
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,560
Have you forgotten that your high clan is getting married here today?

746
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,560
So what?

747
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,560
So what?

748
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,560
I won't see her.

749
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,560
If you're going to get married, I'll accompany you to the end.

750
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,560
But you have to take her mother away on the day of her wedding.

751
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,560
Isn't that too inhumane?

752
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,560
Actually, we can wait for a few days.

753
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,560
No.

754
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,560
Finding the King of the Sea is the most important thing.

755
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,560
Then you should do this kind of dirty work yourself.

756
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,560
I'll find some birds to find out where Guwei City is.

757
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,560
I'll see you...

758
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,560
