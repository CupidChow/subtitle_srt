1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,920
The Ancient of Jade.

2
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,160
I will follow you with all my heart.

3
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,320
Enjoy the freshness of life.

4
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,520
I invite you to watch The Ancient of Jade.

5
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,960
Didn't you go to see the new earrings

6
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,640
that His Highness gave to the princesses?

7
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,320
Why did you come back so soon?

8
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,960
Xue Ying seemed to be in a hurry.

9
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,160
She has been in the dark for more than ten years.

10
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,440
I don't know

11
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,000
what kind of trick she used.

12
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,200
How could it be?

13
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,440
Didn't His Highness

14
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,120
have feelings for Her Ladyship?

15
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,520
He was just worried that

16
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,440
Qingwan would see

17
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,760
how he feels about Xue Ying

18
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,360
and he would just pull me out to be his concubine.

19
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,360
Fortunately,

20
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
Shiyu and Xue Ying

21
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,360
have only known each other for a few days

22
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,000
and they can be a little closer.

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,400
Besides,

24
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,320
whoever says they have feelings for each other

25
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,480
can be together for a long time.

26
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,200
At the last moment,

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,480
it's not known who will be the one to die.

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,120
It's not.

29
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,800
It's you who can hold your breath.

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,120
My Lady, what are you doing?

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,080
You want to use me?

32
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,320
I'd like to see

33
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,640
who has more skills.

34
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,680
Mother,

35
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,760
I won't lose to anyone.

36
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,360
Yan.

37
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,240
Did you use the medicine

38
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Cui Liu gave you?

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,600
Yan,

40
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,120
what's wrong with you?

41
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,520
Nothing.

42
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,400
I just didn't sleep well last night.

43
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,480
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,040
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,560
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,320
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,080
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,440
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,120
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,840
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,160
Yan,

54
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,800
I have a question for you.

55
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,440
Do you believe

56
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,640
there's a love at first sight?

57
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,320
There's no love at first sight.

58
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,800
It's just a matter of self-righteousness.

59
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,480
Friends are like this.

60
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,920
Lovers are like this, too.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,520
Then,

62
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,800
I'll tell you something new, right?

63
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,520
It's about a friend of mine.

64
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,680
He

65
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,280
fell in love with a man on the mountain.

66
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,560
That man also said he liked her.

67
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,240
But

68
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,400
their love can't be public.

69
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,680
The lamp master

70
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,240
is mysterious

71
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,720
and mischievous.

72
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,840
This is the legendary lamp master.

73
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,240
Yan,

74
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,360
actually,

75
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,640
it's me.

76
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,800
I fell in love with His Highness Shiyu.

77
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,840
I'm so free

78
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,680
with him.

79
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,720
But

80
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,640
I don't know what he thinks.

81
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,080
His Highness Shiyu has donated all his love.

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,440
Don't you understand his feelings?

83
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,480
He has a clear heart for you.

84
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,120
You're the legitimate daughter of the Bai family.

85
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,480
He's the only prince.

86
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,640
You two are a match made in heaven.

87
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,280
But

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,040
because of the family interests,

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
we can't be too close.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,520
He told me that.

91
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,520
His Highness Shiyu is a wise man.

92
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,520
But if this goes on,

93
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,920
you two will have a hard time

94
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,040
being together.

95
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,400
Yes.

96
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
He also said

97
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,320
if his brother were still alive,

98
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,280
he would only be a free prince.

99
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,080
We don't have to be like that.

100
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,640
Yes.

101
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,280
If only his brother were here.

102
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,840
Is there really

103
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,440
no other way?

104
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,360
Yan,

105
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,520
don't be so hurt for me.

106
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,040
I'm fine.

107
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,480
Yan,

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,840
don't cry, Yan.

109
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,120
Yan.

110
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,640
I'm so touched by you.

111
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,760
I'm so touched.

112
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,200
Look at you.

113
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,480
You're trying to hurt me again.

114
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,040
Why are you so sentimental?

115
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,040
Don't cry.

116
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,680
You've been thinking about him for five years.

117
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,440
Who knows how many years he'll be entangled in this?

118
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,800
If this goes on,

119
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,440
he'll die in your hands.

120
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,520
Go back.

121
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,680
If you're late,

122
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,040
your father will be worried.

123
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,880
Go.

124
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Lord Chongming,

125
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,800
why are you here?

126
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,080
Are you

127
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,240
trying to learn the magic of the reincarnation?

128
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,680
But

129
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,600
didn't you say I didn't...

130
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,360
You just need to answer my question.

131
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,240
Of course I want to learn it.

132
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,360
For this,

133
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,200
I can do anything for it.

134
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,360
Good.

135
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,960
Listen,

136
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,120
the Immortal God asked you to go to the Great Emperor of the King's Valley

137
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,600
to get the Seven Star Lantern

138
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,320
for tonight.

139
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,600
What does this lantern have to do with magic?

140
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,280
Have you heard of

141
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,200
the seven-star lantern is the light of the world?

142
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,360
The seven-star lantern is the shadow of the seven-star tree.

143
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Go get it

144
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,600
as a transparent stone.

145
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,320
But

146
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,240
why didn't you tell me at that time?

147
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,040
You're asking too many questions.

148
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
It seems that you're not sincere.

149
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,600
You just gave up after being rejected.

150
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
If you don't want to,

151
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,480
just do it.

152
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,160
I'll go.

153
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,080
The shadow of the seven-star lantern is hard to be defeated.

154
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,600
The way to re-establish the spirit of the dead

155
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,840
is the highest secret in the world.

156
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,040
You can get the lantern with nine lives.

157
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,480
It's not that easy.

158
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,400
This is also the reason why the Little God didn't allow you.

159
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,960
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

160
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,160
I'll get it.

161
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,400
Good.

162
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,120
If you don't get it,

163
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,440
it means that you don't have the qualification to practice magic.

164
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,120
Don't ever show up in front of it again.

165
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,160
I'll get it.

166
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,840
Sister.

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,280
Like blood, like a shadow,

168
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,960
the blind is in the heart.

169
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,760
Where did you get this dirty thing?

170
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,120
Give it back to me.

171
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,080
How can I believe you?

172
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:14,080
It must be your

173
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,800
Your Excellencies.

174
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,040
Princess Snow-Lurk said that there was an urgent report.

175
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,440
I'm here to gather you for a meeting.

176
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,960
Snow-Lurk saw a man and a woman

177
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,760
in your room.

178
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,200
I'm afraid there are some disciples in the mountain.

179
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,560
I met a beautiful girl

180
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,960
with a thin body.

181
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,920
It's about my reputation.

182
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,360
I hope you can investigate this matter thoroughly

183
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,680
and get rid of this person.

184
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,840
Give me justice.

185
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,240
You two kneel down.

186
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,120
You...

187
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,440
You...

188
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,000
What are you doing?

189
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,680
I know you're the most cautious.

190
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,800
Tell me.

191
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,040
Who insisted on sending you away?

192
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
You had to take it

193
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,360
because you refused.

194
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,840
Snow-Lurk.

195
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,240
Although we want to keep it a secret,

196
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,840
we can't see it often.

197
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,280
I don't know.

198
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,000
What a beautiful princess of the Bai family.

199
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,240
She has been in the mountain for days

200
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,280
and has already taken other people's things.

201
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,400
Her sister is the one who kept it a secret.

202
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Prince Bai.

203
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,280
You're so clever.

204
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,280
Before Snow-Lurk came,

205
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,120
you had an idea.

206
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,320
I am savory it with soju.

207
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,720
What kind of thing is this?

208
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,360
Why didn't anyone say anything?

209
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,760
Imagine,

210
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,320
if something you said

211
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:08,040
or if you wont

212
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,080
to make this Magic Mantis

213
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,680
the outtaquest of all?

214
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,640
Yin-Yang Excelences can never match trendy styles.

215
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,620
This can make the biter one's hands

216
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,620
become colded-down.

217
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,240
More full of power,

218
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,020
moremakersenly affectionate.

219
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,940
I'm here.

220
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,060
That's why you killed yourself.

221
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,340
You don't deserve pity.

222
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,900
When Xiao Yingzi wakes up tomorrow,

223
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,220
everything will be over.

224
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,240
The

225
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,400
The

226
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,860
You've been practicing hard these days.

227
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,580
Your spiritual power has been restored.

228
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,540
But you still need to rest.

229
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,180
I've picked up the Nine-Year-Old Crane for you

230
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,620
and made a spiritual soup for you.

231
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,740
You can have it tonight.

232
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,940
Have an early rest.

233
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,020
Here.

234
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,740
Here.

235
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,460
Chongming.

236
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,300
You have something to hide from me?

237
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,620
No.

238
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,620
No.

239
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,580
Someone has disturbed the tomb of the new emperor.

240
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,980
It's just some bugs and insects.

241
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,620
I'll deal with them.

242
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,940
I can't do anything.

243
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,380
Since you can't do anything,

244
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,780
don't blame me.

245
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,900
You came here

246
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,340
to touch this light?

247
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,220
Really?

248
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,620
Isn't this Kunyuan Palace?

249
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,140
Why am I here?

250
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,140
No.

251
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,820
I'm in trouble.

252
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,460
I must tell His Highness

253
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
Your Highness.

254
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,460
Your Highness.

255
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,460
Your Highness.

256
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,460
Go!

257
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,460
Your Highness.

258
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,460
Who...

259
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,460
Your Highness.

260
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,460
Your Highness, please leave.

261
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,460
Zhu Yan.

262
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,460
Your Highness.

263
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,460
The fire is about to start.

264
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,460
Come with me.

265
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
Come with me.

266
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,460
Let go.

267
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,460
Come with me.

268
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,460
Zhu Yan, let go.

269
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,460
You can still live.

270
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,460
I've learned the magic.

271
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,460
This time, I can definitely save you.

272
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
No.

273
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,460
I've learned the magic of love.

274
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:32,460
This time, I must save my prince.

275
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,460
Only with your help,

276
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,460
I will stay in the front of the city forever.

277
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,460
Waiting for the night to be the last night of my life.

278
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:50,460
The most touching necklace is left in the heart.

279
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,460
Ask the river and ask the sky.

280
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,460
Cross the eternal promise.

281
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,460
I'm going to be with you forever.

282
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,460
His spiritual power is running out.

283
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,460
If we don't save him, he will die here.

284
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,460
Your Highness.

285
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

286
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

287
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,460
I finally tricked him to death.

288
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,460
But you saved him again.

289
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,460
Chong Ming.

290
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,460
I know you're suspicious of me.

291
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,460
But I want to solve this matter myself.

292
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,460
You...

293
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,460
I will make him stop thinking about me.

294
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,460
Your Highness.

295
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
I'm going to the mountain.

296
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
What's your excuse?

297
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,460
I opened a tea house.

298
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,460
Shao Si Ming wants to taste it.

299
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Go to the beauty group, order afternoon tea,

300
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,460
coffee, milk tea, and bring it home.

301
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
Report.

302
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,460
Chong Ming.

303
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,460
Shao Si Ming wants to eat fresh fruits.

304
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,460
He must go down the mountain to pick them.

305
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,460
Still go to the beauty group.

306
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,460
Fresh fruit cut,

307
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,460
delivery takes 30 minutes.

308
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,460
Report.

309
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,460
Why do you go down the mountain again?

310
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,460
He ordered you a tree of fresh flowers.

311
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,460
Beauty group,

312
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,460
a little helper in a beautiful life.

313
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
Not dangerous.

314
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:56,840
The Little

315
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,880
Video

316
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,600
The voice is still

317
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,980
In cables

318
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:12,100
ซ

319
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,620
My Lord.

320
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,060
It was marriage.

321
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,020
In fact,

322
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,300
everyone's life in the core clubs

323
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,980
has both large and small equalities.

324
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,460
You're right.

325
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,660
My Lord,

326
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,020
many different people

327
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,220
are all in the same world.

328
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,220
But who is between the two who emotions a symbol of Manchu?

329
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,300
Greetings to you.

330
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,340
Greetings to you everywhere.

331
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,620
I'm Jinli.

332
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,940
Nikki,

333
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,860
I'm sorry.

334
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,820
My Lord.

335
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,740
Come with me.

336
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,380
Do you still believe

337
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,700
there are many ways

338
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,020
to revive people in this world?

339
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,580
My Lord.

340
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,220
If there is such a way,

341
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,500
where does the king come from?

342
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,260
Which king in the world

343
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,780
doesn't want to live forever?

344
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,340
Even the most powerful Emperor Xingzun himself

345
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,580
has now become Chen Ai.

346
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,660
But you

347
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,420
have made yourself so unkind

348
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,060
for someone you've only met once.

349
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:42,940
Okay.

350
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,220
You see,

351
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,100
you're as different

352
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,700
from the moth that took you away from your own king.

353
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,140
But

354
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,900
why do you let Choumi

355
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,820
come to me and say…

356
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,860
It's because

357
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,940
I set a challenge on purpose

358
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,820
to make you give up.

359
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,660
But you didn't realize it.

360
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,060
You always wanted to get a result.

361
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,900
What?

362
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,900
You lied to me.

363
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,180
This can only prove

364
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,780
that you are stupid and reckless.

365
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,980
I hate people like you the most.

366
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,220
You want to beat me to death

367
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,180
and make me your teacher.

368
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,500
This is ridiculous.

369
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,340
I didn't beat you to death.

370
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,700
I didn't want to come here.

371
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:43,940
But...

372
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,820
But Chu Ming told me that you...

373
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,860
I know it's a dangerous thing.

374
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,660
But I thought we were friends.

375
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,380
Friends?

376
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,260
I've been training in this valley for many years.

377
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,060
Why should I be friends with

378
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,980
a girl who suddenly appears?

379
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,540
You think you deserve it

380
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,140
because you saved me, right?

381
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,340
I've given you back your spiritual power.

382
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,580
We are even now.

383
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,620
Yes.

384
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,260
We are even now.

385
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,300
If you dare to come here again,

386
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,940
I'll move out.

387
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,180
I'll do as I said.

388
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,700
I will never come here.

389
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,420
I won't come here even if I die.

390
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,580
Zhu Yan.

391
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,500
Don't make mistakes for someone you don't deserve.

392
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,620
Don't worry.

393
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,980
With the justice of Prince Shiyu,

394
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,380
we can find him.

395
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,220
Prince Shiyu is here.

396
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,020
Greetings, Prince Shiyu.

397
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,260
You can go now.

398
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,380
I will take in my master's Minx,

399
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,020
and stopになively start to work at school.

400
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,740
Your Majesty,

401
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,380
what does시 aquellp think?

402
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,900
Umm...

403
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,300
It's okay.

404
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,140
I will report.

405
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,780
Please rest assured that

406
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,700
there's nothing inappropriate

407
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,700
to inform you.

408
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,380
It's better to let you handle it.

409
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,820
Where is the evidence?

410
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,500
Your Highness.

411
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,500
This is the thing

412
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,380
that the man in the mountain gave to Snow Ying, the White Tribe.

413
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,380
I'm afraid that it will poison her reputation.

414
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,900
Please make a decision.

415
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,780
How do you prove that

416
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,340
this is made by the man in the mountain?

417
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,300
Maybe this is what Snow Ying

418
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,100
gave to the visitors in Ye City.

419
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,100
Your Highness, you don't know that

420
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,460
the wood used by the wooden bird

421
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,900
is the only ancient wood in the Mountain of Jiuyi.

422
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,660
It won't grow anywhere else.

423
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,300
So this bold and reckless man

424
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,900
must be in the Mountain of Jiuyi.

425
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,460
Well...

426
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,940
Guards.

427
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,460
Yes.

428
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,340
Collect all the scriptures

429
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,780
of the holy officials and nuns in the mountain.

430
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,780
And

431
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,740
follow the six princes

432
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,700
to investigate the bodyguards

433
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,740
who came to the mountain.

434
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,660
Find out who it is

435
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,660
and give Snow Ying a justice.

436
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,180
Yes.

437
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:31,540
He knows

438
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,300
I'll sit down.

439
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,140
Wait.

440
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,300
Chief Minister.

441
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,940
I heard that

442
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,460
there's a little priest

443
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,380
who is training alone in the valley of the Emperor.

444
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,020
Is his handwriting

445
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,900
in it?

446
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,540
So you're the one who's colluding with the Ice Tribe.

447
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,460
It seems that

448
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,660
you know a lot about

449
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,060
the things happening in the mountain.

450
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,500
There is indeed a little priest

451
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,060
who is training alone in the valley of the Emperor.

452
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,420
I'll call him here.

453
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,260
My Lady, you're finally back.

454
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,300
Something serious happened.

455
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,820
Princess Xueying was rumored to have an affair with a man in the mountain.

456
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,860
His Highness is interrogating her now.

457
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,700
Princess Xueying

458
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,140
has been talking to three people so far.

459
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,500
Could it be that

460
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,220
she has fallen in love with the other person?

461
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,420
In just a few days,

462
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,980
the Princess of the Bai Family

463
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,820
really made me

464
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,380
very surprised.

465
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:39,860
Yes.

466
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,900
How could this be?

467
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,180
How could this be?

468
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,700
As the daughter of the White Suo,

469
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,060
she doesn't even know that she's the daughter of the Suo family.

470
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,980
That's right.

471
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,860
How embarrassing.

472
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,260
Xueying.

473
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,220
You're indeed the daughter of the Bai Family.

474
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,140
You're being so despicable

475
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,540
and you're even able to protect that man.

476
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,140
It's a pity that

477
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,060
that woman doesn't deserve his love.

478
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,340
Yan.

479
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,820
That woman said that

480
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,500
she was blinded by the love of her life.

481
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,260
As a man,

482
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,540
when the person you love is in pain,

483
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,220
you can't just stand there.

484
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,660
Why don't you just

485
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,340
leave the Meng family?

486
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:43,980
Come on.

487
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,780
Get up.

488
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,660
At worst,

489
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,660
you can go back to Tianji Feng City with me.

490
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,860
She's not responsible for it.

491
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,580
You can live with me.

492
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,380
At worst,

493
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,500
we can't be a family.

494
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,380
Let's go.

495
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,780
Nonsense.

496
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,820
Xueying.

497
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,140
It's me.

498
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,980
It's His Highness.

499
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,780
His Highness.

500
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,780
His Highness.

501
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,620
His Highness.

502
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,420
His Highness.

503
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,300
His Highness.

504
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,820
Your Highness.

505
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,260
The blood is like a seal.

506
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,420
The Meng family is in my heart.

507
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,180
I'm the one who taught them.

508
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,700
The one who loved Princess Xueying

509
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,340
is me.

510
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,580
Your Highness.

511
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,940
I was worried that Xueying

512
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,140
would be in trouble for us.

513
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,460
But now I've figured it out.

514
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,540
As the descendant of the royal family,

515
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,060
if I can't protect the one I love,

516
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,820
I'm not as good as an ordinary person.

517
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,180
I'm fond of Bai Xueying.

518
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,380
I have nothing to say.

519
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,540
Your Highness, you...

520
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,580
Great.

521
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,300
Your Highness,

522
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,860
you're indeed the pillar of the country.

523
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,660
Xueying and Your Highness

524
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,260
are a perfect match.

525
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,780
What do you think of it?

526
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,180
Report.

527
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,700
Your Excellency,

528
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,420
the Qingxiu God-given official

529
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,460
has been dismissed.

530
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,820
If you dare to come here again,

531
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,060
I'll move out.

532
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,940
I'll do as you say.

533
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,980
Damn it.

534
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,860
Who do you think

535
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,420
I am?

536
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,340
Your Highness.

537
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:02,980
A Yan.

538
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,660
Yan.

539
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,180
Yan.

540
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,860
I'm not feeling well.

541
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,140
I'll leave first.

542
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,820
Be careful.

543
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,540
Yan.

544
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,260
Be careful.

545
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,380
Everyone.

546
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,460
Everyone.

547
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,940
Your Highness,

548
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,060
the case of Mu Niao has been solved.

549
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,540
You don't need to find

550
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,340
the person who has nothing to do with it.

551
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,220
I wonder if

552
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,860
you can tell me what you think.

553
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,900
You're in charge of all the affairs in Jiuyishan.

554
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,020
You're the one

555
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,260
who should decide it.

556
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,420
I'll leave now.

557
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,500
Well...

558
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:42,740
Qing.

559
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,940
Lord Bai, please wait.

560
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,380
Let's go.

561
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,420
What can I do for you?

562
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,820
You don't have to be so anxious.

563
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,780
You can marry your daughter.

564
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,820
The position of the future crown prince

565
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,260
may not be the most important.

566
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,340
What do you mean?

567
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,540
Just now, the King of Qin suddenly asked

568
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,660
the little god in the mountain.

569
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,980
Don't you feel curious?

570
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,900
When he rebuilds the Day of Heaven,

571
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,140
you don't have to

572
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,300
attack the King of Qin.

573
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,900
Could it be...

574
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,220
The God of Rebellion is not in Jiuyishan.

575
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,820
The last clue will be broken.

576
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,060
If we let the future King of Qin appear,

577
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,980
the King of the Three Empties will be in danger.

578
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,740
The day will come.

579
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,100
The King of the Emperor's blood...

580
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,940
Where is the King of the Emperor's blood?

581
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,580
I think the King of Qin has guessed it.

582
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,100
Let him be the leader.

583
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,900
He still refuses to eat.

584
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,300
Since the day the little god came down the mountain,

585
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,820
he hasn't eaten anything.

586
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,220
If this continues,

587
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,060
how can the body and bones be taken?

588
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,140
Yan'er, what's wrong with you?

589
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,660
Chief Steward Yuan,

590
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,220
you should go and have a look.

591
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,580
Don't worry, Your Highness.

592
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,260
The Princess may have made some mistakes

593
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,300
in Jiuyishan.

594
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,540
Let me go and have a look.

595
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,260
Princess, it's me.

596
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,020
Come in.

597
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,540
Come in.

598
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,860
Princess.

599
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,460
Yuan,

600
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,580
are you trying to persuade me

601
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,980
like the others?

602
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,460
I don't want to hear anything

603
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,060
or eat anything now.

604
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,620
That's right.

605
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,140
These are all soups.

606
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,100
It's not your taste.

607
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,420
If you don't want to eat, forget it.

608
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,340
And this medicine.

609
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,140
You don't need to take medicine.

610
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,420
You are ill.

611
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,660
Take it.

612
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,260
Princess, tell me if you want to.

613
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,620
If no,

614
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,940
I will stay here

615
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,180
Ignorant and quiet

616
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,500
Yuan,

617
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,940
you don't haveَ the ability to be reborn.

618
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,020
This tree

619
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,940
has been my dream

620
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,180
for the past five years.

621
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,500
I can never see His Highness again.

622
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,340
I don't hope to save him again.

623
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,300
The dead cannot be chased.

624
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,740
The coming is expected.

625
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,820
I believe that Your Highness' efforts

626
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,220
can be felt by His Highness in heaven.

627
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,340
Besides,

628
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,260
Your Highness is getting more and more skilled in martial arts.

629
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,340
Your eyes are getting wider.

630
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,020
What do you think

631
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,340
might happen

632
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,300
in the future?

633
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,580
Martial arts?

634
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,500
But he said that

635
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,620
I don't have the ability to learn martial arts.

636
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,740
Who is he?

637
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,860
The one you embroidered is...

638
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,980
It's him.

639
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,380
Why did I embroider him?

640
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,580
If you don't have the appetite,

641
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,420
you should apologize to Master Wu of Yanfeng Restaurant.

642
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,300
Wait.

643
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,380
What does it have to do with Master Wu?

644
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,260
During the time when you were in Mount Jiuyi,

645
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,780
Master Wu specially developed some new dishes for you.

646
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,180
If you didn't try them first,

647
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,020
he wouldn't make them for others.

648
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,700
The Western Wildlands

649
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,940
is not suitable for storing seafood and fish.

650
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,540
If you don't show up,

651
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,900
Master Wu won't be able to wait

652
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,380
until you show up.

653
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,820
I'm afraid those ingredients won't be able to wait.

654
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,380
There's such a thing?

655
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,740
What about his business?

656
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,100
He asked me

657
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,140
to give you a few words.

658
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,420
You didn't go there.

659
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,540
He felt lonely

660
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,060
because he had no one to see.

661
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,020
Is it because you haven't been shopping for a long time?

662
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,220
Yes.

663
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,740
How can I go shopping after going up the mountain?

664
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,300
Come and have a look.

665
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,580
Is there anything you like?

666
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,140
Thank you, Master.

667
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,500
I'm glad you like it.

668
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,900
I'm glad you like it.

669
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,260
I'm glad you like it.

670
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,580
I'm glad you like it.

671
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,860
I'm glad you like it.

672
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,100
I'm glad you like it.

673
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,140
Thank you, Master.

674
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,860
This is for you.

675
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,180
It's for a child.

676
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,780
You liked it when you were a kid.

677
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,300
I lost one for you once.

678
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,860
I'll keep it for you today.

679
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,180
Come and have a look.

680
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,060
Thank you, Yue.

681
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,500
I'm much better now.

682
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,260
We're here.

683
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,300
Sir, please come in.

684
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,540
Please come in.

685
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,820
Please come in.

686
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,020
This dish," boland of the blind whale

687
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,140
is should point to the desert

688
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,060
and roast serismيدnes

689
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:45,660
golden linens of the sea

690
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,300
with coriander bathing sand.

691
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,620
Try it.

692
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,380
Roasting fish is not simple.

693
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:49,980
Look,

694
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,180
sprayed leaves on the sands can give rid of the 1000,

695
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,820
Princess, please enjoy it.

696
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,620
How is it?

697
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,480
I remember it's the까

698
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:01,860
Why are you laughing?

699
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,740
Yes.

700
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,940
Delicious.

701
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,420
The crab sauce

702
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,700
is even better.

703
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,340
The fresh shrimp and crab are combined

704
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,500
to make the secret sauce taste the same.

705
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,020
Although the shrimp and crab are golden,

706
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,620
the soup

707
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,500
is the best.

708
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,700
It's even better with the plum wine.

709
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,980
Please.

710
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,700
How is it?

711
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,740
Delicious.

712
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,460
An Yuan.

713
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,460
Someone said that I was impetuous and reckless.

714
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,820
I'm not a practice of magic at all.

715
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,660
Do you think I'm really useless?

716
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,860
The answer to this question

717
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,340
has been answered by the Salang Eagle.

718
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,380
It's flying.

719
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,740
Look.

720
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,100
I really hope it can fly further.

721
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,860
Then no one will catch it.

722
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,380
Your Highness.

723
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,220
Things are not going as planned.

724
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,740
There is no one to make a fuss.

725
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,020
The Salang Eagle

726
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,460
cannot be set a price for it.

727
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,500
Only it can set a price for itself.

728
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,740
Others say it doesn't matter if it can't fly.

729
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,780
It will prove itself by action.

730
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:49,900
Don't

731
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,860
say those things!

732
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,420
But I've found a helpful one.

733
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,940
It's not a big deal,

734
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,340
I can't make such a fool of itself.

735
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,500
It'soni.

736
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,820
I thought

737
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,900
my friend carefully taught me

738
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,100
we might gave up our life.

739
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,860
But why did she

740
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,420
think of me as a bearsherd girl?

741
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,540
Why?

742
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,780
Though I haven't seen her,

743
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,420
based on what you told me,

744
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,540
I have something to tell you.

745
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,460
Yю, go on.

746
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,980
You have so many feelings for

747
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,740
your traveling family.

748
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,660
Having a huge affection for your family

749
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,820
always amusement no ones.

750
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,140
But some people

751
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,140
are true True Love Fans.

752
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,140
The Mos.''s Twice

753
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,340
a man who has no family.

754
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,140
Besides, he is an outsider.

755
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,820
He is lonely and in danger.

756
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,260
It's not his fault.

757
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,060
Of course, it's not your fault.

758
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,340
Yuan,

759
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,140
how do you know so much?

760
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,300
I've lived in this world for so many years.

761
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,380
I must know more than you do.

762
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:48,980
By the way, Yuan,

763
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,460
I've been curious about a question for a long time.

764
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,380
Today,

765
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,700
please answer it for me.

766
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:54,580
Go ahead.

767
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,340
I'm only a teenager this year.

768
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,660
I've already

769
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,740
experienced the sadness of the world.

770
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,540
You've lived alone for so long.

771
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,820
Have you ever had anything

772
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,300
that made you cry?

773
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:08,940
No.

774
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,340
It's been more than two hundred years.

775
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,060
You haven't cried a drop of tears.

776
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,420
Yuan,

777
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,540
let's make an appointment.

778
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,660
In the future,

779
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,500
if I feel sad,

780
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,500
I'll tell you.

781
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,020
If you're sad,

782
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,180
you must tell me.

783
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,420
For example,

784
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,700
if you cry,

785
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,060
you must let me know.

786
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,300
Okay?

787
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,220
Okay.

788
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,220
I want to spend more time with my mother.

789
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,300
I remember that

790
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,580
every year on my birthday,

791
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,900
my mother would

792
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,300
make some snowy cakes for me.

793
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,660
I've tried to make it myself.

794
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,380
But I couldn't make

795
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,780
the same taste no matter what.

796
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,580
Mother.

797
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,060
I miss you so much.

798
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,500
I want to eat

799
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,940
the food you made again.

800
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,980
There are only three days left

801
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,580
until we have to separate

802
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,820
and we cannot be apart endless.

803
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,700
Never leave your friends

804
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,940
the man and the wife.

805
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:01,940
The cold blood that flows through your heart

806
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:06,940
You have been my light in my dreams

807
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:11,940
I will follow you to the end of the world

808
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,940
You and I will be together forever

809
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,940
You and I will be together forever

810
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:36,940
You and I will be together forever

811
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:41,940
You are the only one I have

812
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,940
I will follow you to the end of the world

813
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:51,940
You and I will be together forever

814
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:56,940
You and I will be together forever
