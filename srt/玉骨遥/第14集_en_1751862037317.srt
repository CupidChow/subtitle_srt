1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please give me a life of shining fortune

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to be with you forever

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But I want to spend the rest of my life with you

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I want to be with you forever

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
《The Sound of Providence》

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't think about anything else

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Just follow your heart

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And tell me

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Do you want to be my first disciple?

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
《The Sound of Providence》

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Dragon god is awake

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's impossible for Chizu to be alone

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Water is fire

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I have to plan for the princess

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Princess

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A Yan

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I actually became the first disciple of the young priest

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I didn't expect the princess to become the first disciple

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's fine

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She can follow the young priest to practice martial arts

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She can protect herself in the future

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But if dragon god wakes up soon

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Jiuyi Mountain will become the most dangerous place

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I can't stay here for long

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I didn't expect at the last moment

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I actually got into the magic tree

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And defeated Bai Xue Lu

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Who would have thought

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The one who stayed in the mountain for a long time

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It was me

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
How about it, A Yan?

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Am I a genius in martial arts?

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Do you want to learn the water trick we taught people?

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
See if you are a real genius in martial arts

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But there is no water here

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Please go back to the forest again

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And open the purifying water

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's go in and see this time

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll teach her some water tricks

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So she can know the trick

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's still so beautiful

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
After you learn the water trick

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You can be in the water

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Just like in the real water

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Take a deep breath

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Close your eyes

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Take a breath

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Imagine you are a fish

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I think I've learned it

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let me show you

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think I've learned it

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What's wrong with me recently?

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is it because the dragon blood has been suppressed for too long

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And it's getting more and more different

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Last month

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You learned the trick in the first step

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I already know the jade tree

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's just the first step

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't do it

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I can't do it

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I can't do it

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I can't do it

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You already know the jade tree

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's just the first step

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The jade tree is just the most basic entrance trick

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
From today

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I will teach you the tricks of different tribes

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Since you are from the Shi tribe

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Then we will start with the fire trick

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Come

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let me see what you learned before

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Stop

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Your handwork is not good

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The second step

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The spiritual power is not from the index finger

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But from the whole palm

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The third step

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You are too fast

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The spiritual power is not yet enough to run

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Come again

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The fourth step

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The third step

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The fourth step

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The fourth step

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The fourth step

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The fourth step

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Tick

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The fifth step

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The sixth step

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Was from the smallest finger

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Still wrong

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,280
the fire of the Chis.

99
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,520
You know the number.

100
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,480
There are thousands of them.

101
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,200
You can't be inferior to me.

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,760
Why is it that

103
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
you can't do it here

104
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,240
and you can't do it there?

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,080
That can only prove

106
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,520
that you practiced for thousands of times.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,520
Your movements are irregular.

108
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,440
I need to correct them for you.

109
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,040
Since you're my disciple,

110
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,600
I need to teach you

111
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,760
and help you to become a master

112
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,680
and to be a master.

113
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,280
Master.

114
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,720
Actually, I learned magic since I was a kid.

115
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,160
It's not all because of

116
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,080
my teacher's teaching.

117
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,240
I've read

118
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,280
many serious magic books.

119
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,520
Maybe it's because

120
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,960
the systems are different

121
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,040
that the insights

122
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,560
of magic are a little out.

123
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,160
For example,

124
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,480
for example, my favorite one

125
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,000
is the one with an old man

126
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,960
with a few kids

127
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,960
on the windscreen

128
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,920
burning fire

129
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,160
and breathing.

130
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,400
The old man you're talking about

131
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,320
is the one with a fire snake on both ears

132
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,200
and a fire dragon on both feet.

133
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,120
That's right.

134
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,400
So you've read this book too.

135
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,240
It's not about an old man.

136
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,440
It's about the Fire Deity, Zhu Rong.

137
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,080
The kid you're talking about

138
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,760
is not a kid at all.

139
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,000
It's a devil.

140
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,400
It's about

141
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,120
the devil's

142
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,720
and no other

143
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,200
interesting scenes.

144
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,760
Have you ever read this book?

145
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,840
I...

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,120
The thing I can't tolerate the most

147
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,080
is that there's no difference

148
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,440
in the basic of magic.

149
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,840
Even though you've used the fire ball,

150
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,360
you still need to

151
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,200
practice it repeatedly.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,480
There's no fun in the way of cultivation.

153
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,920
Only suffering.

154
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,680
Do you understand?

155
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,240
I understand.

156
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,640
Keep practicing.

157
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,600
Again.

158
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,160
De suburbs

159
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,600
General Qing

160
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,160
for the care you've given me these days,

161
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,980
we'll be leaving

162
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,460
we'll be going our separate ways.

163
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,860
It's just a matter of time.

164
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,940
You don't have to be polite.

165
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,580
Maybe

166
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,580
it's because I'm tired from riding the carriage.

167
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,820
My sister has been in a bad mood these days.

168
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,620
Princess Xue Lu is a strong-minded person.

169
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,780
The first time I saw her, I was very angry at her.

170
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,060
I'll see you tomorrow.

171
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,500
I hope Princess Xue Ying will take good care of her.

172
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,140
Don't let her do anything stupid.

173
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,220
Don't worry. I will.

174
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,220
General Qin, come out.

175
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,180
General Qin and Min Ye have been following me out.

176
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,100
You finally show up today.

177
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,100
What do you want to do?

178
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,100
I'm afraid you'll be in danger

179
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,340
if you go out alone at night.

180
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,180
Do you think I'm a weak girl

181
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,460
if I lose to Zhu Yan?

182
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,380
If you talk about hard training,

183
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,420
I will never lose to anyone.

184
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,300
So you go out at night

185
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,460
and practice the magic of the Spirit Cloud.

186
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,900
You need to practice the sword and sword skills in a sequence.

187
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,860
If you go too fast, you'll hurt yourself.

188
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,780
I just can't stand this.

189
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,140
If he hadn't suddenly realized this,

190
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,220
how could I lose?

191
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,980
Even Zhu Yan can learn it.

192
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,860
Why can't I learn it?

193
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,620
You don't have to look down on Zhu Yan.

194
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,860
In fact, she has a lot in common with you.

195
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,820
She and me?

196
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,780
Forget it. Let's not talk about it.

197
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,220
Although I don't know the true feelings of people,

198
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,820
I dare to guess that

199
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,900
you think that the person who was born to be better than you

200
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,180
is not as hard-working as you.

201
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,140
Because she is the enemy's daughter,

202
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,220
you are the daughter of the tree.

203
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,580
I know you are not a genius in magic.

204
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,420
With today's achievement,

205
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,420
you must have suffered a lot

206
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,820
and have been able to practice the skill of the Spirit Cloud for thousands of times.

207
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,820
I want to prove that

208
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,860
you are not worse than others.

209
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,500
But you know that I am also a tree-dweller.

210
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,580
I am also a branch of the Qing clan.

211
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,020
I understand your situation.

212
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,980
You don't understand at all.

213
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,940
Do you know who my mother is?

214
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,780
I don't know anything about the marriage of the six clans.

215
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,700
But since she is your mother,

216
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,860
she must be a noble woman

217
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,180
with a great reputation and a great talent.

218
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,260
A noble woman with a great reputation and a great talent?

219
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,860
That's right.

220
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,980
Back then, there were many men who were willing to give up their money

221
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,220
just to make her smile.

222
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,180
But she is not a noble woman.

223
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,580
She is a woman with a beautiful face.

224
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,300
But...

225
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,940
But the chief of the six clans

226
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,780
doesn't allow women from the Qing clan to be his wives, right?

227
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,860
From the moment I have the memory,

228
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,500
she taught me to read and write.

229
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,300
She believed that one day I would be successful

230
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,540
and my father would recognize me.

231
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,220
She even made a wish

232
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,820
and gave me the name of Xue Luo.

233
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,620
A child born in the Qing clan,

234
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,020
she believed that I could be born out of you.

235
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,740
She...

236
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,860
Is she still well?

237
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,660
When I was five years old,

238
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,220
she went to Bai's Mansion

239
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,980
to recognize me as her mother

240
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,980
and committed suicide.

241
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,380
Others only knew

242
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,020
that I was a piece of flesh that was left in the folk's hands for nothing.

243
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,300
But no one knew who my mother was.

244
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,220
Isn't it ridiculous?

245
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,980
It's not ridiculous.

246
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,860
Your mother abandoned you for the love of Prince Bai.

247
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,620
What's ridiculous is that Prince Bai is not her.

248
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,700
You don't know who I was.

249
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,660
If it wasn't for the choice,

250
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,940
which woman would be willing to be a noble woman?

251
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,620
Why would I know who the poor woman is?

252
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,540
So I just want to prove

253
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,180
that no matter what my background is,

254
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,980
I can be a woman

255
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,500
who is above all other women.

256
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,260
I won't lose to Zhu Yan,

257
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,060
Xue Ying or anyone else.

258
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,900
When that time comes,

259
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,940
I can bring my mother's rank

260
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,540
into Bai's Mansion.

261
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,180
Xue Luo, I...

262
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,980
General Qin,

263
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,340
I appreciate what you said tonight.

264
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,340
But we both have our own paths.

265
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,900
You're not meant to be my partner.

266
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,740
I don't want any matter

267
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,940
to settlement out of my hands.

268
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,380
I'll help you get your way.

269
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,580
My sister

270
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,020
has such a chance for political achievements.

271
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,440
You're finally asking me to marry him.

272
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,680
What's the difference?

273
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
He likes you.

274
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,800
Do we know each other now?

275
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,520
Yes.

276
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,480
Even actresses told me

277
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,560
they don't like we don't know each other.

278
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,720
They said,

279
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,640
they would step outside

280
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,760
to threaten you.

281
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,720
So you chose this.

282
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,160
You heard it last night, right?

283
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,080
I didn't mean it.

284
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,080
It's okay if you heard it.

285
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,760
You don't have to sympathize with me.

286
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,520
I don't sympathize with you.

287
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,640
I just think

288
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,360
Father is really...

289
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,040
That's why I asked myself to be independent.

290
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,520
I don't hate Father.

291
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,600
Instead, you

292
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,880
are the legitimate daughter of the Bai family

293
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,280
but you have no ability and skills to be the legitimate daughter.

294
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,560
It's a waste.

295
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,440
Sister.

296
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,040
No matter if you sympathize with me or not,

297
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,400
just keep it.

298
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,400
From now on,

299
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,120
we can fight for the Empress's position.

300
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,960
I won't take it out on you

301
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,000
because you are my sister.

302
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,000
No.

303
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,360
Practice again.

304
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,120
Master.

305
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,840
As long as it can achieve the same effect,

306
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,360
is the posture of the master so important?

307
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,520
If everyone can follow the rules,

308
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,840
how can we create a new technique?

309
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,960
Repeat the wrong actions ten thousand times.

310
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,400
You can only practice your best dance.

311
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,640
It's not as good as

312
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,720
a piece of paper to practice for half a day.

313
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,560
Shen Pu.

314
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,240
Young Master.

315
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,440
Young Master, I...

316
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,520
Don't panic.

317
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,240
Just do as I told you.

318
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,320
How long have you been learning the fire magic?

319
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,720
I'm not a master.

320
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,160
I've never learned magic.

321
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,160
I'm not a master.

322
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,360
I've never learned magic.

323
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,560
Zhu Yan.

324
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,360
Are you convinced?

325
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,920
I'm convinced.

326
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,960
Very good.

327
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,640
Keep practicing.

328
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,720
Do you want to make me look so ugly?

329
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,840
These days,

330
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,120
I haven't improved at all.

331
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,760
I'm not a master.

332
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,960
I'm not a master.

333
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,640
I'll show you seriously.

334
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,920
I'm not as good as a little Shen Pu.

335
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,880
Zhu Yan. Zhu Yan.

336
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,680
Why are you so bad?

337
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,840
You can't even learn this little thing.

338
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,000
How can you practice with your master?

339
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,680
Do you know

340
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,280
where you made a mistake?

341
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,400
I...

342
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,080
My head.

343
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,280
It hurts so much.

344
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,360
I must have learned too much

345
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,760
in the past few days.

346
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,880
It subverted my previous ten years of knowledge.

347
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
Master, look.

348
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,760
This hurts.

349
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,440
This hurts.

350
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,640
Master.

351
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,400
My head hurts so much.

352
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,920
Please tell my family.

353
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,480
It hurts so much.

354
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,880
Master.

355
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,960
I've made your magic

356
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,640
so beautiful.

357
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,280
Your Highness.

358
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,680
Young Master ordered Chen Shi to check the epidemic.

359
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,360
The epidemic has spread.

360
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,200
The villagers are going up the mountain to seek shelter.

361
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,720
Why didn't anyone tell me?

362
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,240
I can also read medical books.

363
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
Maybe I can help.

364
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,000
By the way, where is Lord Chong Ming?

365
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,960
He's in the medicine room of Cangjing Pavilion.

366
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,000
Lord Chong Ming.

367
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,600
We may have had some unpleasant moments before.

368
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,760
But since I'm already a disciple of Master,

369
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,520
I'll definitely cherish this opportunity

370
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,960
to get along with you and Master.

371
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,760
What does it have to do with me?

372
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,040
Since I'm going to practice with Master in the mountain,

373
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,040
I have to get along with the people around him.

374
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,040
It's best if you don't show up in front of me.

375
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,760
Lord Chong Ming.

376
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,120
Are you going down the mountain to meet Master?

377
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,160
You know it well.

378
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,920
You know I'm going to deliver medicine.

379
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,200
Get out of the way.

380
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,160
Lord Chong Ming.

381
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,760
What's wrong with your hand?

382
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,600
What's wrong with my hand?

383
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,240
Lord Chong Ming.

384
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,720
How can you lift a heavy object

385
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,800
with such perfect and flawless hands?

386
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,720
How about this?

387
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,440
Let me help you.

388
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,280
You want to go down the mountain with me?

389
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,640
You don't even have a door.

390
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,480
I'm also a little skilled.

391
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,000
I can help.

392
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,480
For example,

393
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,440
Lord Chong Ming's favorite mask

394
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,160
is a red lotus flower.

395
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,920
It will make you look more handsome.

396
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,760
Really?

397
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,960
Where can I get the red lotus flower?

398
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,720
Red lotus flowers are unique in the desert.

399
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,320
But there are many in my family.

400
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,920
Lord Chong Ming just needs to find a flower

401
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,720
and I'll send someone to deliver it to the mountain.

402
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,640
Lord Chong Ming,

403
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,040
why don't you take me down the mountain

404
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
to find something to watch out for?

405
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,280
Don't think that a small red lotus flower

406
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,320
can buy me.

407
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,720
I'm very determined.

408
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,080
Give them the medicine.

409
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,040
Okay.

410
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
Captain Lin has gone.

411
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,560
received called.

412
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,360
Get some water.

413
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:02,860
Hurry!

414
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,840
Take it slow.

415
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,740
Let me help you.

416
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,260
I'm sorry.

417
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,480
What's wrong?

418
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,720
I'm afraid that I don't know

419
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,420
how I got over with Verb Your Grace.

420
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,020
I didn't expect that the disease is so serious

421
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,500
and it can spread.

422
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,500
Let's go and help Master.

423
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,580
It's the right time to help people.

424
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,060
You're the only one.

425
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,420
Don't be afraid.

426
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,940
It'll be fine soon.

427
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:53,980
Come on.

428
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,300
I'm here.

429
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,860
You're just in time.

430
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,660
Apply the herbs I gave you

431
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,380
to the patient's wound.

432
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,060
It can reduce their pain.

433
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,060
By the way,

434
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,340
send the herbs you brought

435
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,980
to those who are recovering.

436
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,380
Give it to me.

437
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,100
Why are you here?

438
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,100
Why can't I come

439
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,060
when Master is here?

440
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,580
I'm here to help Master.

441
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,100
Do you know that the disease can spread?

442
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,860
Master is skilled in magic,

443
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,380
but he's also a weakling.

444
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,780
Master is not afraid of him.

445
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,540
Why should he be afraid of being a disciple?

446
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,820
I'm here to treat you.

447
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,060
You know nothing

448
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,340
but to talk.

449
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:34,740
I...

450
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,660
If you get infected with the disease,

451
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,300
you'll have a big face

452
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,020
and a lot of pimples.

453
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,820
How will you get married?

454
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:45,860
Stop.

455
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,340
Since Master said I couldn't help him,

456
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,740
he only cares about me.

457
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,820
If Master asks me to leave,

458
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,980
I'll leave.

459
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,020
Come back.

460
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,540
All right.

461
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,540
Let's go.

462
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,140
Come on.

463
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,140
Thank you.

464
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,740
Here.

465
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,140
Are you afraid that she'll get infected

466
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,100
and force her away

467
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,220
because of the heavy words?

468
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,140
Actually, she's not a bad girl.

469
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,620
She's quite like me.

470
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,140
It's a pity that

471
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,180
she's a man of her word.

472
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,260
Here it is, Older Brother!

473
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,220
Thank you for Dr. adorable Brother.

474
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,420
Young Master,

475
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,180
you cured the 125 disease.

476
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,500
We're very grateful.

477
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,540
No need to thank.

478
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,820
After your treatment,

479
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,740
there were about sixteen of aimless patients and sixteen or seventeen of outstanding patients.

480
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,900
Your healty

481
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,140
gave us a big reward

482
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,900
in terms ofType IV.

483
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,540
Now,

484
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,500
I've prepared some dishes.

485
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,180
Please have a rest.

486
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,660
We'll continue tomorrow.

487
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,300
Please.

488
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:25,940
Please.

489
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,220
Please.

490
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,300
Hurry.

491
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,900
Come on.

492
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,140
Please sit down.

493
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,740
What are you cooking?

494
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,340
This is the skill of burning.

495
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,540
Awesome!

496
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,660
Awesome!

497
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,780
You can have more if you like.

498
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,060
The fish soup made by sister is delicious.

499
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,100
Drink slowly.

500
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,820
Hurry.

501
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,420
There's more after drinking.

502
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,620
Aren't you...

503
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,340
Cheng Ming.

504
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,540
Are you hungry?

505
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,780
Didn't you go back to the mountain?

506
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,500
I was going to leave.

507
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,860
But I think the village is full of patients.

508
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,460
Even the food is a problem.

509
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,420
Although I'm not good at magic,

510
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,620
I can still burn the firewood.

511
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,140
So I want to

512
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,500
make a living for everyone

513
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,660
and cook for them.

514
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,380
After all, we can get enough food

515
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,980
to keep our health.

516
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,740
Master, you can also check

517
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,180
how I've been doing

518
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,420
since yesterday.

519
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,340
Master.

520
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,300
It's still the same master.

521
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,780
Where are you going?

522
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,140
Cheng Ming.

523
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,420
Don't you like fish soup the most?

524
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,740
It's for you.

525
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,900
Miss.

526
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,660
Your cooking is so good.

527
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,580
I've never had such delicious food.

528
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,260
I'm so happy to have it.

529
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,460
I'm so happy.

530
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,580
I'm so happy.

531
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,740
I'm so happy.

532
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,900
I'm so happy.

533
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,100
I'm so happy.

534
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,300
I'm so happy.

535
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,460
I'm so happy.

536
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,420
Delicious food.

537
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,300
Such delicious fish soup.

538
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,060
It's so good.

539
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,460
Master.

540
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,220
Master.

541
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,260
Master,

542
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,300
this son has continually

543
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,620
handed me everything from burning to seventh grade in school.

544
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,420
I swords some Mako.

545
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,180
Without tools or chopsticks,

546
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,300
how to use them out here?

547
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,820
You've got a sharp target.

548
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,900
That's what you call me, master.

549
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,020
The West Bur risks capturing and支持ing точкуiko

550
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,660
as well as the wild spreads and wild kitchen the社惠

551
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,700
Specially,

00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,500
osṣit த개 сов Xuanli

553
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,340
Forgetting what they say

554
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,620
You don't start no matter where you execute

555
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,420
The most joinformation thing is to try to avoid it

556
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,820
When you're hungry

557
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,340
White as jade

558
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,820
The stressed sand

559
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,500
It's so delicious.

560
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,700
Master,

561
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,820
I can make it so successful

562
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,260
with the first time I made grilled fish.

563
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,860
I'm really a genius.

564
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,580
Master,

565
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,660
would you like to try it?

566
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,740
Try it.

567
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,420
How is it?

568
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,500
Is it good?

569
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,220
It's delicious.

570
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,740
It's delicious.

571
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,820
Actually,

572
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,340
when I was on the mountain,

573
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,540
I imagined

574
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,420
eating delicious food with you.

575
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,460
Just like now.

576
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,020
Don't care about the occasion or etiquette.

577
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,420
If you're hungry, you have to eat with your stomach open.

578
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,620
Thank you.

579
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,300
Thank you.

580
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,700
Thank you, Master.

581
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,820
Actually,

582
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,620
I should be the one thanking you.

583
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,460
Master,

584
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,100
why do you thank me?

585
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,980
You've been busy with me all day.

586
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,500
You're a disciple of me.

587
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,820
You should accompany me.

588
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,020
Actually,

589
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,780
I should thank you sincerely.

590
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,020
Today, you scolded me.

591
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,580
Actually, I know

592
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,620
you're afraid that I'll get sick

593
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,860
and do it for my own good.

594
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,180
All right.

595
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,980
Don't say that again.

596
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,260
Eat our fish.

597
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,380
Our fish?

598
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,420
Master said

599
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,940
our fish.

600
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,900
We'll eat

601
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,900
many delicious foods together.

602
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,900
If you can accompany me to the Chizu Forest,

603
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,300
I'll take you to eat all over the world.

604
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,220
The beef and mutton on the grasslands

605
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,900
is the freshest and the most delicious.

606
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,140
The people around us sing and bake

607
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,300
while surrounded by the fire.

608
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,940
It tastes great.

609
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,780
If the rain in the desert is over,

610
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,740
a golden mushroom will appear in the desert.

611
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,260
If it's not picked up within an hour,

612
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,660
the mushrooms will disappear.

613
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,500
So every time,

614
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,420
I'll pick them up with my friends

615
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,180
to see who's the fastest.

616
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,060
And

617
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,740
the wine from our shop

618
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,540
is also very delicious.

619
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,620
I miss

620
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,700
the milk tea cooked by my mother.

621
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,820
But she's not good at cooking.

622
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,980
Every time she's on fire,

623
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,500
she'll make a mess.

624
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,140
She'll cook a pot of milk tea

625
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,700
into a pot of porridge.

626
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,820
But every time,

627
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,700
my father and I will drink it all.

628
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:52,900
Master,

629
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,940
if you have a chance to come to my house,

630
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,740
you must try it.

631
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,540
I once heard in the book that

632
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,780
the autumn in the West is bright and bright.

633
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,060
It can be seen that the long river is falling,

634
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,500
the desert is smoking.

635
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
If you have a chance,

636
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,540
you must go there.

637
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,540
Actually,

638
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,860
not only the West,

639
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,740
but also the whole desert,

640
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,260
I want to go there.

641
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,180
I want to see the beautiful Jiangnan,

642
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,940
covered with white snow

643
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,820
and the northern night with white rain.

644
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,820
It sounds

645
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,820
so beautiful.

646
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,420
I wonder if you can take me

647
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,100
with you when you go there.

648
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,260
It depends on your performance.

649
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,900
I may decide to follow your decision.

650
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,300
I don't think

651
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,460
I can be seen as such.

652
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,500
How can you throw j 실se then?

653
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,260
What if you're expansion contexts

654
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,100
and catch you?

655
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,620
Master who is good at painting

656
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,060
will disappear in a second

657
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,260
after I can't do it for a whole week.

658
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,740
It's still so cruel.

659
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,780
Today,

660
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,780
I will test it myself.

661
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,740
Your foundation of jade and fire

662
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,860
is passed.

663
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,700
Bad news!

664
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,620
Bad news!

665
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,420
Bad news!

666
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,700
Let's go back to the village and have a look.

667
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,860
Xia Ruining

668
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,820
I'm not afraid of the dark

669
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,820
I'm not afraid of the dark

670
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:53,820
I'm not afraid of the dark

671
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,820
I'm not afraid of the dark

672
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:03,820
You can't be my friend

673
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:08,820
You are the star that I have been waiting for

674
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:13,820
I'm by your side

675
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:18,820
The heart that you have been waiting for

676
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,820
You can't be my friend

677
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,820
I want to be your friend

678
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:33,820
You and I are not apart

679
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,820
I'm by your side

680
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,820
The heart that you have been waiting for

681
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,820
You can't be my friend

682
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:08,820
I want to be your friend

683
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,820
You and I are not apart

684
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,820
