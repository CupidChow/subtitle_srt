1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Oh다는

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Give me a life of shining scenery

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I am a drop of rain

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I am alone in the world

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But I will stay with you forever

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will be your destiny

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
In the sea of love

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The first time we met

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Is engraved in my heart

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The first time we met

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Is engraved in my heart

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The first time we met

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Is engraved in my heart

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The first time we met

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I greet you, Mr. Zuoquan.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Ruyi, I order you to take Su Mo

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and leave the village

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
to go to Longshen in Cangwu.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
To treat Su Mo.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can't escape from the enemy.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is an order.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then, you can send someone else to take Su Mo away.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It doesn't have to be me.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So strange.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I feel sad when I think about

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
separating with you.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We just met.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Ruyi, Su Mo is not ordinary.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You protect him and keep him safe.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's more meaningful than you stay here.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you understand?

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I will follow your order.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Sir.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Have we met before?

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Then, take care.

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I will take Su Mo to wait for you in Cangwu.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
May you live a long life.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I will be with you.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I will be with you.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I will be with you.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will be with you.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I will be with you.

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I will be with you.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Many people can escape.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Thanks to the order of the young master and general Qing.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But I'm worried.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Will it be against the emperor's order?

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What if the wildfire is not burning?

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Spring wind blows and rises.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Spring wind never rises again.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Tomorrow is the final day.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is the battle book of the king of the sea.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I will fight at the star sea and the cloud temple tomorrow.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There are only two entrances to the sea at night.

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Star sea and the cloud temple and Zhaoyun Du.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I will go to the star sea and the cloud temple tomorrow.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You find the entrance to Zhaoyun Du quickly.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If you meet the king of the sea, you must capture him.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If you don't meet the king of the sea,

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
let those Jiao people leave.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You really want to make a promise?

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I still can't rest assured.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I understand what Zhiyuan means.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
She wants to exchange her own life for the safety of the whole clan.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I will help her.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Chongming, you will observe the movements in the high places of the city tomorrow.

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
In case of emergency.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Although the king of the sea is like a mountain,

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I am worried that some unyielding king of the sea will cause trouble.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay, I will do it.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But your wound...

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's okay to kill the king of the sea.

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I will go with you.

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Tomorrow, we will all leave the city at night.

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And go back to the sea of the dark.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Tomorrow is a dangerous day.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Do you have any plan?

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I will go to the star sea and the cloud temple for a meal.

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The rest of the Jiao people leave from Zhaoyun Du.

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, I will go to the star sea and the cloud temple with you.

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yan, if you really want to help me,

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
go to Zhaoyun Du and help my clan.

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
They need you more.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The last one goes to the star sea.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I will put Luo Yin first.

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But you are alone to deal with my master.

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't worry.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I just go to distract him.

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Then I will go to the star sea with you.

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

95
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Be careful.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I will wait for you.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If my master goes to Zhaoyun Du,

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I can help you.

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
An Yuan.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Do you remember the first time

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
you took me here?

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes.

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You come to worship the crown prince.

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why?

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I come here every time.

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But I have to say goodbye to my family.

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I was the crown prince.

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Now it's you.

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's all my fault.

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can't keep you.

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I am confused.

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
How can I cry in the war?

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I shouldn't mess up your mind.

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
An Yuan.

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We will meet again.

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
After this,

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
you can come back to see me.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Or you can take me to the sea.

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Maybe I can be the first one

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
to visit the home of the crown prince.

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Then I will be the first one to see you.

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I will be your wife.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Where is the empty-sand man?

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I will visit you and Su Mo.

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Thank you for everything you have done for me.

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Thank you for letting me meet you.

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
An Yuan.

128
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Take care.

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
An Yuan.

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hurry!

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Be quick!

132
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Hurry!

133
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Hurry!

134
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Be quick!

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hurry!

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Hurry!

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Walk faster!

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Be quick!

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
When can we enter the prison?

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,720
Hurry up.

141
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,280
Hurry up.

142
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,040
Chief Jian.

143
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,280
No.

144
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,240
No.

145
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,200
Hurry up. It's too late.

146
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,800
Chief Jian is dead.

147
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,160
Who are you?

148
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,680
Use the eye-catching spell to disguise as a merman.

149
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,080
It's okay to deceive them.

150
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,240
I know a lot of merman's power.

151
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,480
There are only a few of them.

152
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,880
Who should I disguise as?

153
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,680
I got it.

154
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,680
No matter what,

155
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,040
I just have to die soon.

156
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,560
I'm here

157
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,080
to help you escape.

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,320
If you believe the abyss,

159
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,800
you can believe me.

160
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,200
Continue to retreat.

161
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,840
I will protect you.

162
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
From now on,

163
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,280
I'm your King.

164
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,320
Retreat.

165
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,960
Retreat.

166
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,640
Retreat!

167
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,200
Yes.

168
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,240
Hurry up!

169
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,040
Hurry up!

170
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,520
Go!

171
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,120
Retreat!

172
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,840
Hurry up!

173
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,280
Retreat!

174
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,800
Hurry up!

175
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,760
The situation is so intense.

176
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,320
I wonder if the King of the Sea

177
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,480
is really here.

178
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,720
Why don't we kill

179
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,800
these rebels?

180
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,440
General Bai,

181
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,640
we agreed to kill the rebels first.

182
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,520
The King of the Sea

183
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,360
won't abandon his people

184
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,160
and leave first.

185
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,920
Let's go and check it out.

186
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,480
I'll go out and hold them back.

187
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll leave this to you.

188
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,480
I wonder who the hero is.

189
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,840
Thank you for the help

190
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
you gave me.

191
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,760
It's not for you

192
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,160
or us.

193
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,960
It's for all of us.

194
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,080
When we get back to the Sea of Biluo,

195
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,440
let's rest in peace.

196
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,160
I believe

197
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,240
the two tribes will be reunited.

198
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,360
See you later.

199
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,280
Retreat!

200
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,640
Hurry up!

201
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,080
Retreat!

202
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,880
Hurry up!

203
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,880
Hurry up!

204
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,280
Retreat!

205
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,120
I'm the King of the Sea!

206
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,080
All of you, come after me!

207
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,560
Is he really the King of the Sea?

208
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,000
He didn't go to the Star Sea Cloud Pavilion?

209
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,520
It's not the time to talk about it.

210
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,080
Let's hold them back first.

211
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,960
King of the Sea,

212
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,840
stop holding back!

213
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,400
Retreat!

214
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,920
Everyone, retreat!

215
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,840
Or else, I'll kill the Commander-in-Chief!

216
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,000
Release Qing Gang!

217
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,480
Tell me.

218
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,360
What do you want?

219
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,680
As long as you release these King of the Sea,

220
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,200
I'll go back with you.

221
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,720
The enemy has no intention to fight.

222
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,960
Why do you have to kill them?

223
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,040
Okay.

224
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,880
I promise you.

225
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,880
Reveal good news from

226
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,320
this General!

227
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,520
You, Bye bye General.

228
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,600
General Qin said

229
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,880
he'd rather sacrifice for the country

230
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,640
than destroy the mermaids.

231
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
He will die with no regrets.

232
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,240
Archers!

233
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,840
Shoot the Emperor to death.

234
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,280
Kill these mermaids!

235
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,840
Yes!

236
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,800
Let him go.

237
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,120
Bai Xue Lu?

238
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,760
Now is the best chance to kill Qin Gang.

239
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,880
If he tells us,

240
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,560
you'll have no regrets in your life.

241
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,840
If you don't let him go,

242
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,400
I'll tell your ugly story.

243
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,920
What did you say?

244
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,440
Three.

245
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,680
Don't be so hasty.

246
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,160
Two.

247
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,000
Qin Gang has changed his mind.

248
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,560
Let him go.

249
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Okay.

250
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,920
Let him go!

251
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,320
It's done.

252
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,680
But...

253
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,600
Why hasn't A Yan come back?

254
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,720
I wanted you to take them back

255
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,280
to make them escape.

256
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,600
But I can't let you go.

257
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
Hai Huang, leave!

258
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,480
You're not a merman.

259
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,960
This is the fire spell of Mount Jiuyi.

260
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,200
It's me.

261
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,240
Fu Yan?

262
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,880
Why are you here?

263
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,120
Hai Huang is fighting with Master Yun Ting.

264
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,560
I was entrusted by him

265
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,960
to help the merman escape.

266
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,480
Qin Gang,

267
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,480
you should think the same as me.

268
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,680
After the war,

269
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,120
I'll kill the Emperor.

270
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,080
Go!

271
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,040
Chase them!

272
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,760
You wanted to kill Hai Huang,

273
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,400
so you killed me, right?

274
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,040
We'll have to

275
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,280
settle this.

276
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,200
The Emperor has escaped,

277
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,160
it's all your fault.

278
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,360
Send the order for this time,

279
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,960
so that the Emperor

280
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,480
will instinctively

281
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,000
surround Yun Ting

282
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,920
and they can laugh at you.

283
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,800
Pleaseweight Lava M sustain the mermen's escape.

284
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,160

285
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:47,480

No regrets for all 가지고

290
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,160
Fine, I'll help you

291
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,840
Master, stop it!

292
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,440
The Navy has already returned to the Ice Sea.

293
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,920
Yuan didn't lie to you.

294
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,160
He's really going to the battle of Jingshu.

295
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,760
Master!

296
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,640
Master!

297
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,360
Shen Yuan.

298
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,080
Stop it.

299
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,600
I know you very well.

300
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,640
But for Kong Sang...

301
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,880
No!

302
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Master!

303
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,400
Master, don't!

304
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,120
Master!

305
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,960
Master!

306
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,880
Master!

307
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,720
Who dares to say thank you to me?

308
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,400
For the sake of the Pope,

309
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,520
do it.

310
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,080
Master!

311
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,720
No!

312
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,520
Master!

313
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,760
No!

314
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,560
Take good care of her for me.

315
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,440
Let us be enemies in this life.

316
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,280
In the future,

317
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,800
I hope we can be friends.

318
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,200
No!

319
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,400
Okay.

320
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,720
No!

321
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,360
Master!

322
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,560
Master!

323
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,000
Master!

324
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,040
Master!

325
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,440
Yuan?

326
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,800
Yuan!

327
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,160
Yuan!

328
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,160
Yuan!

329
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,800
Yuan!

330
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
A Yan.

331
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
A Yan.

332
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800

337
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
A Yan.

338
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
A Yan.

339
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
A Yan.

340
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
A Yan.

341
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
A Yan.

342
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Don't go.

343
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
A Yan.

344
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
A Yan.

345
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800

350
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
A Yan.

351
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Don't go.

352
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
A Yan.

353
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
A Yan.

354
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
The leader of the rebels.

355
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
A Yan.

356
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
The Emperor of the Sea ordered.

is agré.

361

The emperor's sustainment

362

is not agré.

363
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800

00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,900
I swear I won't kill you today!

375
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,100
The sea king is dead.

376
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,420
Ying'er has made a contribution to the Kuang's clan.

377
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,020
Bao Jian is dead.

378

Bao Jian is dead.

380

The master is dead.

381
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,740
I'm here to tell you that

382
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,100
the chaos between Kong Sang and the sea king

383
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,260
has been going on since today.

384
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:29,900
Why did you kill the Great Yuan?

385
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,300
Why?

386
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,340
I've told you.

387
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,700
Why did the sea king destroy Kong Sang

388
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,580
seventy years later?

389
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,020
Will the prophecy come true?

390
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,820
Yuan has been called the Great Wall.

391
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,260
Why do you still believe in the prophecy

392
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,740
but not me?

393
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,260
The prophecy will come true.

394
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,420
For the prophecy,

395
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,260
Yuan is dead.

396
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,900
You killed my Yuan.

397
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,060
It's you!

398
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,820
You killed my Yuan!

399
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,540
It's you!

400
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,180
It's you!

401
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,580
It's you!

402
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,580
You killed my Yuan.

403
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,020
So,

404
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,300
you want to avenge your Yuan?

405
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,540
You Lan, take me down.

406
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,220
I'm a woman of no value.

407
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,900
I can't avenge my Yuan.

408
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,060
But I hate you.

409
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,980
I hate you!

410
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,820
In this life,

411
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,540
I don't want to see you again.

412
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,300
Do you love him so much?

413
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,700
Don't you read the books?

414
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,780
You're ready.

415
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,820
Master.

416
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,900
Master.

417
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,580
No.

418
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,580
No.

419
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,580
No.

420
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,580
No.

421
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,580
No.

422
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,580
Yan'er, I'm sorry.

423
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,580
I killed your beloved one.

424
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,580
I didn't do it for you.

425
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,580
No.

426
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,580
No, Master.

427
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,580
No, no.

428
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,580
Yan'er, Yu Gu.

429
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,580
Yu Gu is in hell.

430
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,660
He's been

431
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,580
raping Pi An.

432
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,580
I'm dead.

433
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,580
Will you be sad?

434
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,580
When Hui Bin dies,

435
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
I'll be sad too.

436
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,580
I'll be sad.

437
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,580
I'll be sad.

438
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,580
Will you be sadder

439
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,580
than when Hui Bin dies?

440
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,580
No.

441
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,580
It's not like that.

442
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,580
It's not like that, Master.

443
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,580
Master, it's not like that.

444
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,580
Master, it's not like that.

445
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,580
Master.

446
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,580
I like you.

447
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,580
I like you.

448
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,580
It's you, Master.

449
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,580
Master.

450
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,580
Master.

451
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,580
Why don't you

452
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,580
love me?

453
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,580
I've liked you

454
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,580
since you were a prince.

455
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,580
I don't dare to tell you.

456
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,580
Master.

457
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,580
Master.

458
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,580
Master.

459
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,580
I like you.

460
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,580
I like you.

461
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,580
It's the mortal world of the Pearl.

462
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,580
It's the world of the Pearl.

463
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,580
Master.

464
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,580
Master.

465
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,580
Wake up.

466
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,580
Master.

467
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,580
Ying.

468
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,580
Si Ming.

469
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,580
Si Ming.

470
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,580
Ying.

471
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,580
Please save me.

472
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,580
Ying.

473
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,580
Please save me, Master.

474
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,580
Please save him.

475
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,580
Ying.

476
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Am I too late?

477
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
Why did Zhu Xinzhou die?

478
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
Master.

479
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,580
You killed Ying.

480
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,580
It's...

481
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,580
I killed Master.

482
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,580
Master.

483
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,580
Master.

484
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,580
Master.

485
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,580
Master.

486
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,580
Master.

487
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,580
He did so much for you.

488
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,580
Master.

489
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,580
You...

490
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,340
so many things.

491
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,460
Master.

492
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,340
Yin,

493
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,420
why are you so stupid?

494
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,700
How can there be

495
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,220
a stupid person like you in this world?

496
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,660
You actually used your life

497
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,580
to solve the curse of the Heart-picking Beads for her.

498
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,180
What is the Heart-picking Beads?

499
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,100
Yin died for you.

500
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,620
Today,

501
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,340
you will go to the netherworld to accompany her.

502
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:50,820
You...

503
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,660
Yin,

504
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,420
you have to protect her even if you die.

505
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,020
Master.

506
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,420
Master.

507
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,660
Master.

508
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,020
Leave.

509
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,820
I won't kill you today.

510
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,940
The last spell of Yin

511
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,420
is to protect you with the Jade Bone.

512
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,340
Out of my way!

513
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,020
If Iilda falls into my hands,

514
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,840
she won't be able toi testing my intern,"

515
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,380
even if I die hungry with fear.

516
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,540
Master.

517
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,900
I opened my eyes

518
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,620
and The ts Starkies !!!

519
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,140
My dear one.

520
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,060
His Majesty ordered me to die

521
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,460
and destroy the star-shaped shell

522
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,420
to exchange for the trust of the lost soul

523
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,380
and give us a chance to make a promise.

524
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,540
Now that the lost soul has died,

525
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,420
the world is in chaos.

526
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,500
The future is finally in the human world.

527
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,780
His Majesty is really smart.

528
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,740
His Majesty is as smart as a god.

529
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,540
Congratulations, His Majesty.

530
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,060
May I ask His Majesty

531
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,620
to help us?

532
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,220
We have the future in our hands.

533
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,100
We will do our best to help His Majesty

534
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,740
and get the heaven.

535
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,500
Your cousin has eliminated

536
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,740
the biggest threat of the Kongsang Dynasty.

537
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,660
The credit is in the world.

538
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,900
Who can compare with him?

539
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,220
This one last wish, Shi Ying,

540
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,980
to return to the temple

541
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,540
must be the most important thing.

542
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,660
Feng Lin,

543
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,820
you must

544
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,500
help him in the future.

545
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,460
To rebuild the reputation of our Bai clan.

546
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,980
Xue Lu,

547
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,060
you just be a virtuous queen.

548
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,140
When he comes back from Mount Jiuyi,

549
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,540
he will be the ambassador of our Bai clan.

550
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,700
I deserve to die.

551
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,780
I'm afraid the first thing my cousin will do after he returns to the Jialan

552
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,420
is not to help the Bai clan,

553
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,860
but to blame myself.

554
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,100
Feng Lin,

555
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,060
what do you mean?

556
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,060
I've been working hard

557
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,900
and hate to let people in.

558
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,020
I've never been willing to send fake information to the Imperial Army

559
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,700
just to lure the enemy in

560
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,300
and kill them all.

561
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,420
But before my plan

562
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,740
was successful,

563
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,780
Qing Gang intercepted the information.

564
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,500
He intended to fight for the credit with me.

565
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,340
So everyone didn't listen to me

566
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,220
and insisted on accusing me of

567
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,300
colluding with the enemy.

568
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,620
I can't lie.

569
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,300
Bai Feng Lin,

570
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,380
it was you who tried to contact the Imperial Army

571
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,700
to make a profit in the war.

572
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,020
You even threatened me to steal the military report.

573
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,740
Now you're here to make a fool of me.

574
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,300
What's your secret?

575
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,780
Father,

576
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,140
Bai Feng Lin made a big mistake.

577
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,620
I'm a accomplice.

578
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,860
I'm willing to be punished.

579
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,700
I'm willing to confess everything to Young Commander.

580
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,980
You bastard!

581
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,620
Sister,

582
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,820
have you ever thought

583
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,260
if we're to be punished for this,

584
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,860
but when Shi Ying returns,

585
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,540
not only can the Bai clan not rise again,

586
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,220
but it will become a laughing stock in the court.

587
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,780
Moreover,

588
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,700
why don't you care about my feelings?

589
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,140
I only have me, you, and Xue Ying.

590
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,020
Now, there's no news of Xue Ying and Shi Yu's escape.

591
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,340
If you do anything wrong,

592
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,580
will you give the empty funeral

593
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,460
to the Bai clan in the future?

594
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,940
Xue Lu,

595
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,780
you'll leave for Mount Jiuli tomorrow.

596
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,460
But you won't go to sue your brother.

597
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,060
You'll take advantage of the most vulnerable time

598
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,500
to take him down

599
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,100
and do something good for you.

600
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,180
You're embarrassed, aren't you?

601
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,500
What's the big deal?

602
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,260
You think your mother used the trick of the fox girl

603
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,660
to confuse me?

604
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,860
I won't even look at her

605
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,900
when she's like that.

606
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,700
In order to sit on the throne,

607
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,980
why don't you use some tricks

608
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,740
your mother taught you?

609
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,500
I won't mind.

610
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,420
Father is clever.

611
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,580
He has 12 tricks.

612
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,500
First,

613
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,060
he can make you sit on the throne.

614
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,580
Second,

615
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,660
when Shi Ying becomes the son-in-law of the Bai clan,

616
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,660
he won't pursue me.

617
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,140
I'm not afraid of him.

618
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,460
I'm not afraid of him.

619
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,940
How can he pursue me?

620
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,300
What a small mistake.

621
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,900
I don't want to do that.

622
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,580
You don't want to?

623
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,860
You don't want to take back

624
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,060
your mother's position?

625
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,780
If mother knew it,

626
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,700
she wouldn't let me do such a treacherous thing

627
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,060
and betray myself.

628
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,420
She betrayed herself

629
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,940
and put you in prison for more than ten years.

630
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,980
If I hadn't taken you in,

631
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,300
you would have been the same as her.

632
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,980
Now it's time for you to take back the Bai clan.

633
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,460
I'll give you one last chance.

634
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,060
Will you marry Shi Ying?

635
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,940
She won't.

636
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,420
The marriage of the sister

637
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,900
is the family business of the Bai clan.

638
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,460
It has nothing to do with you.

639
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,180
Of course it has something to do with me.

640
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,060
Xue Lu and I

641
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,020
have been engaged for life.

642
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,020
You're so kind and kind.

643
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,180
But you and my sister

644
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,340
are in love.

645
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,700
Do you have any evidence?

646
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,100
Xue Lu.

647
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,620
I'll give you your family bed.

648
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,140
I know you'll wear it with you.

649
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,300
Bai Xue Lu, how dare you!

650
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,820
Xue Lu, let's go.

651
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,980
If you don't take Bai Fu's side,

652
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,100
I'll never be your shameless daughter!

653
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,220
Xue Lu, think it over.

654
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,900
Don't be so stubborn

655
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,180
and let your mother's efforts go to waste.

656
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,180
Xue Lu.

657
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,780
Stop!

658
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,020
Somebody stop them!

659
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,820
Xiao Qi, listen up!

660
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,260
Qing Gang broke into the Bai clan

661
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,940
and kidnapped Princess Xue Lu.

662
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,020
Kill them all!

663
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,060
It's so dangerous.

664
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,180
They might take the Bai clan's wennin falsities and make a plan Sayaka e fifty years later

665
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:19,740
rescuebrd particular

666
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,140
Su Ye Huan is an einmal

667
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,780
and he should be among muy well-versed skills.

668
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,940
You...

669
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,940
Since you have reached such a level of cultivation,

670
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,940
why didn't you tell me?

671
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,940
Why?

672
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,940
Why should I not tell you first?

673
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,940
I am already like General Qing,

674
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,940
who has been determined to be loyal to me forever.

675
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,940
You don't deserve to know.

676
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,940
From now on, let's call each other by the name of Ying Yang

677
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,940
several years ago.

678
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:54,900
Xu Lu,

679
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:56,580
are you really

680
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,500
extend over P는nif headlights now?

681
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,940
I've been practicing for a day after I left the mountain.

682
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,940
But my previous thoughts

683
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,940
were all about how to climb up and get the other person's attention.

684
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,940
Until I saw you today,

685
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,940
you were in such a dangerous place,

686
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,940
I realized that

687
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,940
I actually had such a great power.

688
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,940
Then next, we

689
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,940
came.

690
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,940
We?

691
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,940
Xue Lu,

692
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,940
wait for me for a while.

693
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:53,940
Your father and brother

694
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,940
will definitely not give up.

695
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,940
I must hurry to Jiuyi Mountain

696
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,940
and report everything to Young Commander.

697
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,940
I'll go with you.

698
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,940
Ying'er,

699
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,940
it's all my fault.

700
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,940
I shouldn't have let you take off your clothes.

701
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,940
I shouldn't have used my eyes

702
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,940
to shake your heart.

703
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,940
I thought that

704
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,940
everything was in my control

705
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,940
and I was trying to challenge the will of the heavens.

706
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,940
I thought that I could change my prophecy.

707
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,940
But I was wrong.

708
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:55,940
I was wrong.

709
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,940
I didn't change my prophecy.

710
00:46:58,940 --> 00:46:59,940
If I knew today,

711
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,940
I should have let you stay in the mountain

712
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,940
and be a clean and pure god.

713
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,940
I won't let you go

714
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,940
and walk in the world.

715
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,940
It's my destiny

716
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,940
to let you see me

717
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,940
for the last time.

718
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,940
Zhu Yan hurt Shiyi.

719
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,940
Why didn't Zhu Xinzhao die?

720
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,940
Ying'er held Zhu Yan's sword

721
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,940
and sent the weapon into her chest.

722
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,940
She committed suicide.

723
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,940
I shouldn't have been so lucky.

724
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,940
I should have known

725
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:04,940
that the rain would always be real.

726
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,940
She's still locked in the palace.

727
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,940
Let her in.

728
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:23,940
I'll go in.

729
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:42,940
Lord Chongming.

730
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:44,940
You killed her.

731
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,940
I will never forgive you.

732
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:53,940
Lord Chongming.

733
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,940
Master.

734
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,940
Zhu Yan.

735
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,940
Shiyi died for you.

736
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,940
I know.

737
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,940
You know?

738
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:33,940
You know that when Shiyi

739
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,940
was in Mount Jiuyi and out of prison,

740
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,940
she was destined to die

741
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,940
for you.

742
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,940
You know that?

743
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:41,940
You know that?

744
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,940
You know that?

745
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,940
You know that?

746
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,940
You know that?

747
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,940
You know that?

748
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:51,940
You know that?

749
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,940
You know that?

750
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:56,940
What are you talking about?

751
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:06,940
Today,

752
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,940
I'll tell you everything.

753
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:14,940
Back then,

754
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,940
I made Ying'er fake her death

755
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,940
and took her away from Jialan.

756
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:21,940
But because of your sacrifice,

757
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,940
she made you her life.

758
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,940
If she saw you before she was 18,

759
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:29,940
she would die in your hands

760
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,940
according to the rain.

761
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:34,940
So I told her

762
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,940
to stay in the palace

763
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:40,940
and not to see any women

764
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,940
before she was 18.

765
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:43,940
I didn't have any female disciples

766
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,940
in Mount Jiuyi.

767
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,940
I thought I was fine.

768
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,940
But you were exposed

769
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:52,940
to the rain.

770
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,940
I didn't expect you to break into the Empire.

771
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,940
Why did I swallow it?

772
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,940
Back then,

773
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,940
I should have killed you to save you.

774
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,940
But she was soft-hearted

775
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,940
and hid you in front of the Minister of War.

776
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,940
She used magic to erase your memory.

777
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,940
Then,

778
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,940
you saved her by mistake

779
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,940
and proved that you were her destiny.

780
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,940
You comforted her mother's pain.

781
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,940
She couldn't bear to kill you.

782
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,940
She only wanted you to leave.

783
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,940
And then...

784
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,940
Master wanted to send me away

785
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,940
to protect me.

786
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,940
But

787
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,940
he knew I would kill him.

788
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,940
Why did he take me as his disciple?

789
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,940
Was it

790
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,940
to kill you

791
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,940
and cover my identity

792
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,940
and protect me?

793
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,940
You and him were in a hurry.

794
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,940
He was so fond of you.

795
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,940
How could it be?

796
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,940
How could he like me?

797
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,940
After the abyss,

798
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,940
he realized his own feelings.

799
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,940
Can't you see

800
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,940
what he did for you?

801
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,940
This is the ancient weapon

802
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,940
that the Empress of Baiwei passed down.

803
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,940
It's also your gift of gift.

804
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,940
I'll carry you up the mountain.

805
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,940
Be careful.

806
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:01,940
Otherwise,

807
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,940
you'll fall down.

808
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:09,940
A life is a life.

809
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:10,940
A pair of people.

810
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,940
Don't lose, don't forget,

811
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,940
don't leave each other.

812
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,940
Yan'er,

813
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,940
I actually plan

814
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,940
to drag you down

815
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,940
to the abyss

816
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,940
and resign from the position of the Divine Officer.

817
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,940
Master likes me.

818
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,940
So

819
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,940
Master said to drag me down

820
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,940
is also for me.

821
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,940
It's to get back to the mortal world

822
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:35,940
and live with you forever.

823
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,940
He loved you so much.

824
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,940
But you let him down again and again.

825
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,940
You even told him

826
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:45,940
that you loved that Qiao Ren.

827
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:55,940
Yan'er, Yan'er, Yan'er, Yan'er, Yan'er.

828
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,940
I'm not only the sacred item

829
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,940
left by the Empress of Baiwei,

830
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,940
but also the emperor of the empty warehouse.

831
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:07,940
I'm envious of the Empress.

832
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,940
I...

833
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,940
I will definitely keep you safe.

834
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:21,940
Why didn't you tell me earlier

835
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:24,940
that I've been in love with you

836
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,940
since the first night I saw you?

837
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,940
Da Siming,

838
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,940
is there

839
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,940
a way to return to heaven?

840
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:01,940
I remember asking you once.

841
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,940
You said

842
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:04,940
there wasn't.

843
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,940
I remember asking you once.

844
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,940
You said

845
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,940
there wasn't.

846
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,940
I remember asking you once.

847
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:17,940
You said

848
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,940
there wasn't.

849
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,940
Now I'm asking you one last time.

850
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,940
Is there really no way?

851
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,940
Even if it's the spirit medicine of the Pure Land,

852
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,940
the secret method of the Heaven,

853
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,940
or the forbidden magic of the Poison God,

854
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,940
even if there's only one-thousandth of hope,

855
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,940
I have to pay all the price

856
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,940
to let you return to the mortal world.

857
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,940
Yan'er's seven souls are scattered.

858
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:46,940
I will do my best

859
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,940
to continue her seven days.

860
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:51,940
At this stage,

861
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,940
it's not life or death.

862
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,940
It's the middle and the body.

863
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,940
Then...

864
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,940
Then what happens next?

865
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:06,940
If I can't

866
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,940
restore her soul in seven days,

867
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:14,940
her seven souls will be scattered.

868
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,940
If she cries and lights out,

869
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,940
she will return to the mortal world.

870
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:22,940
I will do it.

871
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,940
Please tell me how.

872
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,940
There is indeed

873
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,940
a forbidden magic of the Poison God.

874
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,940
But I've never heard

875
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:34,940
anyone succeed before.

876
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:35,940
Because it needs

877
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:37,940
the same people

878
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,940
with the same spirit power

879
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:40,940
and the same thoughts as the dead.

880
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,940
It will be the end of the world.

881
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,940
The soul of Yin'er will be scattered.

882
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,940
In three days,

883
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,940
she will be cremated

884
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,940
on the top of the furnace

885
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,940
to feed her soul

886
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,940
so that she can regain her life.

887
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,940
Any of the steps

888
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,940
will be lost.

889
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:05,940
I will do it.

890
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,940
This spell

891
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,940
will be very harmful to the person who fails.

892
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,940
You need to sacrifice half of your life.

893
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,940
I've calculated your remaining life.

894
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,940
There are 54 years left.

895
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,940
That means,

896
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,940
whether you succeed or not,

897
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,940
you only have

898
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,940
27 years left.

899
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,940
Have you considered it carefully?

900
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,940
Even if it's a life-or-death situation,

901
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:32,940
I'm willing to sacrifice my life.

902
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,940
Okay.

903
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:42,940
Follow me.

904
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:44,940
Okay.

905
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,940
Master.

906
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:55,940
Trust me.

907
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,940
We will meet again.

908
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,940
No matter where we are.

909
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,940
In this scroll,

910
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:16,940
it's recorded

911
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,940
the most profound magic of Yunhuang.

912
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:20,940
The forbidden magic we're looking for

913
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:21,940
is also in it.

914
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:27,940
How could it be?

915
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,940
Isn't this the small book

916
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,940
that Master gave me?

917
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,940
But that book

918
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,940
has a lot of drawings of it.

919
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,940
It's written in the book.

920
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,940
It's written in the book.

921
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,940
It has a lot of drawings of it.

922
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:44,940
You mean, Ying'er

923
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,940
has written a book for you?

924
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,940
Where is it?

925
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:48,940
Zhu Yan.

926
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:50,940
In this scroll,

927
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,940
there is only this small book.

928
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,940
The last page of it

929
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,940
is the forbidden magic we're looking for.

930
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,940
The blood of Xinghui.

931
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:05,940
The blood of Xinghui.

932
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,940
That page

933
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,940
was torn by her.

934
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:22,940
It seems that the last page

935
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:24,940
of this scroll

936
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:25,940
was also torn by Ying'er.

937
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:28,940
She knew it would happen.

938
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:30,940
She actually did this

939
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,940
for you.

940
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,940
This stupid person

941
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,940
has brought me back to life.

942
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:40,940
I've lived for tens of thousands of years.

943
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:42,940
I've never seen such a stupid person.

944
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,940
Da Simin.

945
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:47,940
Is there any other way?

946
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:49,940
As long as I can save Master,

947
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,940
I'm willing to do anything.

948
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:53,940
Even if it's for my life.

949
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:56,940
The record of the blood of Xinghui

950
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:00,940
has been torn by Ying'er.

951
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,940
I have no other way

952
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:05,940
to let her open her eyes.

953
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,940
No.

954
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:13,940
I don't believe it.

955
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:29,940
Zhu Yan.

956
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:33,940
Da Simin

957
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,940
must have another way.

958
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:40,940
Master.

959
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:42,940
Please connect the spiritual boundary

960
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:43,940
between me and Master.

961
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:45,940
Since Master's soul

962
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:46,940
is still missing,

963
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,940
the mark of the attack

964
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:48,940
has also been restored.

965
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:50,940
Maybe

966
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:51,940
I can find the page

967
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:52,940
of the blood of Xinghui

968
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,940
from the spiritual boundary

969
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:54,940
of Master.

970
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:56,940
You're right.

971
01:00:58,940 --> 01:00:59,940
There is indeed

972
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,940
a past memory

973
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:01,940
in the spiritual boundary.

974
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:02,940
You also entered

975
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,940
the spiritual boundary of your Master.

976
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:07,940
So

977
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:08,940
that's not my dream?

978
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:10,940
Your spiritual powers are the same.

979
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:12,940
She also loves you.

980
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,940
You can only enter it.

981
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:17,940
Zhu Yan.

982
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:20,940
I have no other way.

983
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:21,940
I can only rely on you.

984
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:25,940
Then I'll try it myself.

985
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:27,940
There is no way

986
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:29,940
that the two heavenly men

987
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:30,940
can enter the spiritual boundary

988
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:31,940
of the dead

989
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:32,940
and talk to her.

990
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,940
Even if there is only a little hope,

991
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:38,940
I will not give up.

992
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:45,940
I want to remind you

993
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:47,940
that the spiritual boundary

994
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,940
will not last long.

995
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:51,940
After you enter it,

996
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,940
you must find the blood of Xinghui as soon as possible.

997
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:55,940
But remember,

998
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:56,940
you can't touch anything

999
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:57,940
when you enter it.

1000
01:01:58,940 --> 01:01:59,940
If you leave any traces

1001
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:00,940
in it,

1002
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:02,940
it will cause you

1003
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:03,940
extremely terrible harm.

1004
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:09,940
I...

1005
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:13,940
What should I do?

1006
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:15,940
I have wasted

1007
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,940
a day's time.

1008
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:39,940
I really entered it.

1009
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:02,940
Master.

1010
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:05,940
Master.

1011
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:08,940
Master.

1012
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:23,940
Master can't see me

1013
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:25,940
in his memory.

1014
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:32,940
Master.

1015
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:38,940
Who made

1016
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,940
this ugly,

1017
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:41,940
very egotistical thing?

1018
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:45,940
It's him again.

1019
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:49,940
Why did you choose

1020
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:50,940
his grass ring?

1021
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:51,940
You just washed it.

1022
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:53,940
This grass ring is not neat at all.

1023
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:54,940
If you put it in the past,

1024
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:55,940
you must have just thrown it away.

1025
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:57,940
It's pretty ugly.

1026
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:58,940
Let me help him sort it out.

1027
01:03:58,940 --> 01:03:59,940
Then why did you choose it?

1028
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:02,940
I was trying to break it

1029
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:03,940
and I couldn't.

1030
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:04,940
This is not a good thing.

1031
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:05,940
If you want to break it,

1032
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:06,940
you must have it.

1033
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:08,940
I have already

1034
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,940
told Zhu Yan

1035
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:11,940
about the hurtful words

1036
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:12,940
of the people.

1037
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:13,940
If it were someone else,

1038
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:14,940
he would have been shocked.

1039
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:16,940
Zhu Yan is the only one

1040
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:17,940
who has never changed his original intention.

1041
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:19,940
I plan to

1042
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,940
encourage him.

1043
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:23,940
You won't be moved by him

1044
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:24,940
because of the thing

1045
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:25,940
about the quay?

1046
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:27,940
Don't forget that

1047
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:28,940
he is the one who saved your life.

1048
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:30,940
I don't care about that.

1049
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:32,940
Life and death are predestined.

1050
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:33,940
I never hesitate.

1051
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:36,940
Moreover,

1052
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:37,940
he doesn't have

1053
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:39,940
the ability to do that.

1054
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:40,940
No.

1055
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:41,940
I want to ask you

1056
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:42,940
what you think.

1057
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:43,940
I will not

1058
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:44,940
keep him.

1059
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:45,940
If he knows

1060
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:46,940
that the prince he cares about

1061
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:48,940
is such a

1062
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,940
cold-hearted person like me,

1063
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:53,940
he will be greatly affected.

1064
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,940
The flower is blooming.

1065
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:14,940
The flower is blooming.

1066
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:16,940
Zhu Yan is the only one

1067
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,940
who has never changed his original intention.

1068
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:24,940
The flower is blooming.

1069
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:27,940
Yan,

1070
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:28,940
don't change your mind.

1071
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:29,940
The flower is blooming.

1072
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,940
Draw a heartless

1073
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:35,940
dream.

1074
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,940
Even if others

1075
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:42,940
laugh at me.

1076
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,940
I will draw a picture of the world

1077
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,940
without you.

1078
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,940
Master, you can't see me.

1079
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:30,940
Master, you really think of me as an outsider

1080
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:32,940
and don't want to teach me

1081
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:33,940
the skills of keeping a house.

1082
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:36,940
So what?

1083
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:37,940
The skill is high.

1084
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:39,940
It's just that

1085
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:40,940
I'm not good enough

1086
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:41,940
to keep a house.

1087
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:43,940
I have a lot of

1088
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:44,940
skills.

1089
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:46,940
I'm not good enough

1090
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:47,940
to keep a house.

1091
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:49,940
If you don't want to keep a house,

1092
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:50,940
I will give you a hard time.

1093
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:52,940
I'm not good enough

1094
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:53,940
to keep a house.

1095
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:55,940
I don't want to

1096
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:56,940
keep a house.

1097
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:57,940
The skill is high.

1098
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:58,940
It's just that

1099
01:06:58,940 --> 01:06:59,940
I'm not good enough to keep a house.

1100
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:00,940
You...

1101
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:05,940
You...

1102
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:27,940
No.

1103
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:51,940
What should I do?

1104
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:53,940
Where should I go?

1105
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:57,940
The Golden Pavilion.

1106
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:58,940
Yes.

1107
01:07:58,940 --> 01:07:59,940
I have to go back

1108
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:00,940
to the day when Master

1109
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:01,080
wrote the small

1110
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:09,220
and small

1111
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,940
Golden Pavilion.

1112
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,940
I'm sorry.

1113
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:27,940
The heart is the place

1114
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:28,940
in the blood

1115
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:29,940
that can be used to

1116
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:30,940
transcend the life and death.

1117
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:32,940
Its rules

1118
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:33,940
are closely related

1119
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:34,940
to the operation of the heart.

1120
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:36,940
But in tens of millions of years,

1121
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:37,940
no one can understand.

1122
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:39,940
You can only rely on yourself

1123
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:40,940
to control the heart.

1124
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:42,940
I'm sorry.

1125
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:44,940
I'm sorry.

1126
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:46,940
I'm sorry.

1127
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:48,940
I'm sorry.

1128
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:50,940
I'm sorry.

1129
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:52,940
I'm sorry.

1130
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:54,940
I'm sorry.

1131
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:55,940
You can only rely on yourself

1132
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,940
to understand the arrogance in it.

1133
01:09:58,940 --> 01:09:59,940
I will set up a formation

1134
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:01,940
for you in the Fanyin Lake.

1135
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:03,940
You are in the heaven and earth.

1136
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:04,940
Finding all the soul fragments

1137
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:05,940
of the corpse shadow

1138
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:07,940
is the first step

1139
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:08,940
to revive the corpse shadow.

1140
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:11,940
Can Zhu Yan hold on?

1141
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,940
He has been

1142
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:15,940
invaded by the spirit of the middle yin.

1143
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:16,940
But he insisted not to

1144
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,940
let me go out of the way.

1145
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:19,940
It's very harmful

1146
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:20,940
to his own injury.

1147
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:23,940
He will gradually lose his senses.

1148
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:24,940
He can't turn back.

1149
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,940
Is there any other way?

1150
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:29,940
Now, the only one who can save the corpse shadow is Zhu Yan.

1151
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,940
He can only sacrifice himself.

1152
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:54,940
Master.

1153
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:57,940
I will definitely save you.

1154
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:07,940
Here.

1155
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:09,940
And this.

1156
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:12,940
You eat.

1157
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,940
You eat more.

1158
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:15,940
Eat more.

1159
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,940
You two are both handsome and beautiful.

1160
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:20,940
Your husband is so considerate.

1161
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:21,940
You are so kind.

1162
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:22,940
No.

1163
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:23,940
I have never worshiped him.

1164
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:26,940
You should work harder.

1165
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:27,940
Such a gentle and gentle girl.

1166
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:29,940
Don't let others take her away.

1167
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:33,940
I have a few words to say.

1168
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,940
I also want to marry her soon.

1169
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:40,940
Who said I want to marry you?

1170
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:43,940
Look.

1171
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:46,940
Tang is here.

1172
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:48,940
Tang.

1173
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:50,940
Tang.

1174
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:53,940
Eat slowly.

1175
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:54,940
Thank you.

1176
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:55,940
Thank you.

1177
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:01,940
I know that you were

1178
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:03,940
forced to die that day.

1179
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:06,940
But now everyone in Ye City knows

1180
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:08,940
that you eloped with me.

1181
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:14,940
Lu.

1182
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:16,940
I will never let you down.

1183
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:22,940
Go.

1184
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:46,940
Lu, be careful.

1185
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:52,940
Hurry.

1186
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:17,940
Hurry.

1187
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:22,940
My men, you dare not to move.

1188
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:53,940
My men.

1189
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:22,940
What's wrong?

1190
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:23,940
Go.

1191
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:27,940
Are you okay?

1192
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:31,940
Miss.

1193
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:33,940
No.

1194
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:34,940
You are so good at fighting.

1195
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,940
You are so lucky.

1196
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:43,940
I am so happy.

1197
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:45,940
I am so happy.

1198
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:47,940
I am so happy.

1199
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:49,940
I am so happy.

1200
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:50,940
I am so happy.

1201
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:55,940
Xu Lu.

1202
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:56,940
You...

1203
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:04,940
The way you saved me

1204
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:07,940
and the way you ate with me

1205
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:09,940
are so different.

1206
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:12,940
You really scared me.

1207
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:15,940
Which one do you like more?

1208
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:17,940
The gentle one

1209
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:18,940
or the fierce one?

1210
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:25,940
I like both

1211
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:27,940
as long as it's you.

1212
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:48,940
No one can protect her.

1213
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,940
But she has been blind for three days.

1214
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:54,940
If it goes on like this,

1215
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:55,940
she will not be able to adapt.

1216
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:57,940
She will die.

1217
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:04,940
What should I do?

1218
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,940
If I can't save her today,

1219
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:09,940
I will be in trouble.

1220
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:11,940
I will be in trouble.

1221
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:13,940
I will be in trouble.

1222
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:15,940
I will be in trouble.

1223
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:17,940
If I can't save her today,

1224
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,940
I will never have a chance again.

1225
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:41,940
The mirror

1226
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:43,940
is upside down.

1227
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:47,940
Now,

1228
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:49,940
I have to enter the water with one eye.

1229
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,940
Then I can activate the formation of the Star Soul Blood.

1230
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:16,940
It's true.

1231
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:19,940
I am the blood of the other Yin and Yang.

1232
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,940
I am tired of being in the mortal world.

1233
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:47,940
One life, two lives.

1234
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:50,940
Two lives, three lives.

1235
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:53,940
Three lives, no hope.

1236
01:17:55,940 --> 01:18:06,780
The cow turns the

1237
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:19,940
Master, my energy is almost empty.

1238
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:47,940
Yan'er,

1239
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:50,940
you are stronger than you think.

1240
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:53,940
Remember, as long as you are willing,

1241
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:54,940
you can always catch up,

1242
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:55,940
and you can always do it.

1243
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:17,940
Yan'er,

1244
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:19,940
you are stronger than you think.

1245
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:20,940
You can always catch up,

1246
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:21,940
and you can always do it.

1247
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:22,940
You can always do it.

1248
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:23,940
Yan'er,

1249
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:25,940
you are stronger than you think.

1250
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:26,940
You can always do it.

1251
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:27,940
You can always do it.

1252
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:28,940
You can always do it.

1253
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:29,940
You can always do it.

1254
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:30,940
You can always do it.

1255
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:31,940
You can always do it.

1256
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:32,940
You can always do it.

1257
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:33,940
You can always do it.

1258
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:34,940
You can always do it.

1259
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:35,940
You can always do it.

1260
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:36,940
You can always do it.

1261
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:37,940
You can always do it.

1262
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:38,940
You can always do it.

1263
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:39,940
You can always do it.

1264
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:40,940
You can always do it.

1265
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:41,940
You can always do it.

1266
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:42,940
You can always do it.

1267
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:43,940
You can always do it.

1268
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:44,940
You can always do it.

1269
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:45,940
You can always do it.

1270
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:57,940
The pain she bore

1271
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:59,940
is like a physical trauma

1272
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:00,940
that tears your heart apart.

1273
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:02,940
Maybe the ten shadows really can

1274
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:03,940
defeat the human world.

1275
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:05,940
Maybe the ten shadows really can

1276
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:06,940
defeat the human world.

1277
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:07,940
When that time comes, they...

1278
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:08,940
If Ying'er can wake up,

1279
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:10,940
I won't force her

1280
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,940
to take off the身包 anymore.

1281
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:13,940
I won't force her

1282
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:15,140
the other side doesn't

1283
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:16,820
force her

1284
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:19,620
to return Home and inherit the throne.

1285
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,220
So, as she wished,

1286
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,960
she can be a Shouldn't be in Med Ain with one's heart.

1287
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:25,980
Steal herenta from the Heaven and Earth

1288
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,820
and donate ten thousand shares to all people,

1289
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,020
She is just like

1290
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:29,900
the state save the least

1291
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,180
her Majesty's oath to keep,

1292
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:33,940
Perhaps

1293
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:36,340
she would live empire and onuathe gradually.

1294
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:16,940
Master, you're back.

1295
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:46,660
How come my sister is here?

1296
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:02,500
Master, I'm going to meet you right now.

1297
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:08,520
Zhu Yan.

1298
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:12,060
Don't be so too loud.

1299
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,020
I'll help you up the mountain.

1300
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,060
Don't waste your energy.

1301
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,260
Keep your spirit.

1302
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:22,940
Did I make it?

1303
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:25,100
I think you did it.

1304
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:27,060
Zhu Yan.

1305
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:30,740
This is the new blood of the dead.

1306
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,740
No one has ever done it

1307
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:35,140
in the past ten thousand years.

1308
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:42,900
Master.

1309
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,300
Master.

1310
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,260
Feel it.

1311
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:39,380
Yin.

1312
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:40,380
Yin.

1313
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:42,180
Zhe Shang!

1314
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:55,220
Master.

1315
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:02,420
The next three days

1316
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:04,380
are very important to Ying'er.

1317
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:06,020
If she can live a peaceful life,

1318
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:07,420
she can

1319
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,220
regain her life completely.

1320
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:11,940
This time, Ying'er

1321
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:13,700
has gone through a life-and-death crisis.

1322
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,060
I, Fang Wu Chu,

1323
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:17,980
have been obsessed with

1324
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:19,300
the world.

1325
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:21,060
I only hope

1326
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:22,860
that after she wakes up,

1327
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,540
she will have no worries

1328
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:26,260
and enjoy the rest of her life.

1329
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:29,300
It's just that they

1330
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,180
have been together for many years.

1331
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:32,900
Even if Ying'er

1332
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:35,420
is willing to abandon her past,

1333
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:36,660
I

1334
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:37,660
can't let her

1335
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:39,180
continue to be so insolent.

1336
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:40,780
A few days ago,

1337
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:42,820
Jialan sent a message

1338
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,780
saying that the Northern Burma is in a critical situation.

1339
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:47,740
I plan to go there

1340
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:51,020
and find a way to save the Northern Burma

1341
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,860
and prove their names

1342
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,460
and tell the world.

1343
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,060
Zhe Shang, don't worry.

1344
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:58,620
This time,

1345
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:00,820
I won't make any mistakes.

1346
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:03,060
You are the one who saved Ying'er.

1347
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:04,580
There is one thing

1348
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:07,740
you need to know.

1349
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:10,540
Before Ying'er has recovered from her three-soul disease,

1350
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:12,660
she can only remember

1351
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:15,660
the memories before she met you.

1352
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:25,220
Before she met me,

1353
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:27,980
that is to say,

1354
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:30,420
the three days after Master's death,

1355
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,580
I thought I was

1356
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:35,020
the Crown Prince before I was born.

1357
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:36,220
So,

1358
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,220
you must cooperate with her.

1359
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:40,060
Otherwise,

1360
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:42,380
it will only cause her memory to be in chaos

1361
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,100
and the fire will be extinguished.

1362
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:47,940
It's that serious?

1363
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:49,540
Especially you.

1364
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:51,460
You must not

1365
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:54,180
let her remember everything about you.

1366
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:55,580
Originally,

1367
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,420
you shouldn't have stayed by her side.

1368
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:01,180
But you have her soul fire in your body.

1369
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:03,260
You can't leave her.

1370
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:09,460
Get up.

1371
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:11,340
I have a secret.

1372
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:26,940
Have you ever remembered it?

1373
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:30,020
I don't care about the Buddhist scriptures

1374
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:32,380
except that

1375
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:34,380
I'm afraid that Master

1376
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:36,440
won't finally accept it.

1377
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:37,380
It's alright.

1378
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,460
I will keep anball to him.

1379
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:40,420
If you give it to him,

1380
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:41,540
of course he would accept it.

1381
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:43,100
In his memory,

1382
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:46,340
I am his uncle.

1383
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:57,660
Zhu Yan,

1384
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:00,340
after Yin'er is dead,

1385
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:02,820
what are your plans?

1386
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:06,620
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

1387
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:11,660
I will leave her.

1388
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:19,300
I'll never see her again.

1389
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:25,300
You are not my maid.

1390
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:26,580
Because in the palace,

1391
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:28,780
there will never be such a stupid maid.

1392
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:39,220
Who are you?

1393
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:28,140
You are not my maid.

1394
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:29,260
