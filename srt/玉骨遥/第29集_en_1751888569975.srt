00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 16

2
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,960
Yuan!

3
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,640
Yuan!

4
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,960
You make me so worried.

5
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,960
I'm worried about you.

6
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,760
The news of your being beaten by Master

7
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,560
has spread.

8
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,760
Are you okay?

9
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,440
I'm fine.

10
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,960
I've been wanting to

11
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,080
speak some fair words for Master.

12
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,000
This time, we're going to be quick.

13
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,360
What's the big deal

14
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,440
about being beaten by a few boards?

15
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,440
Yuan,

16
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,720
my Master said

17
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
you're the King of the Sea.

18
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,160
Is it true?

19
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,200
Yes.

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,280
I'm the King of the Sea.

21
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,000
That's great.

22
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,520
That's great.

23
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,400
I trust your character the most.

24
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
You're the King of the Sea.

25
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,200
What's there to worry about

26
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,760
about the matter of the Ghost Scare?

27
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,960
Yuan,

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,840
my Master is in the old house

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
of the Queen of Baiyan of the East.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
Go and talk to him.

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,640
I believe that you'll

32
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,320
solve all the misunderstandings

33
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,240
when you're together.

34
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,520
I understand.

35
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,000
But...

36
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,800
I know that you just returned to the tribe.

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,480
Even if you're the King of the Sea,

38
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,240
you need to listen to those

39
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,600
who are used to being beaten by the King of the Sea.

40
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,360
It'll take some effort.

41
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,920
But you and my Master

42
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,080
are the most respected

43
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,200
and trusted people in the world.

44
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,840
I don't want to see you two

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,200
fighting with each other.

46
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,040
Besides,

47
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,480
you two are the only ones

48
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,800
who can put out the fire,

49
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,880
right?

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,640
Yuan,

51
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,880
don't give up easily,

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,240
okay?

53
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,520
Okay.

54
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,960
I'll go and see your Master.

55
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,280
Yuan,

56
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,120
is there anything else

57
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,280
that you need my help with?

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,400
Just tell me.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,880
I really want to ask you for a favor.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,560
Jing'er.

61
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,920
It's Su Mo.

62
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,840
You know her?

63
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,600
I met her and her mother

64
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,480
in Huotu Tribe.

65
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,240
I know her very well.

66
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,800
I also know her and her mother.

67
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Where is her mother?

68
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,280
Mother.

69
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,240
Don't die.

70
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,240
Mother.

71
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,960
Your mother didn't leave.

72
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,000
She's here.

73
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,200
Two hundred years ago,

74
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,160
I helped Yu Ji

75
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,400
to escape from the Imperial Army.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,640
Later,

77
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,680
I met her in the West Desert.

78
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,120
I didn't expect that you and Yu Ji's mother

79
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,560
had such a fate.

80
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,600
Unfortunately...

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,040
If I could have felt it at that time,

82
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,600
Yu Ji might not have died.

83
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,360
Don't blame yourself.

84
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,760
The murderer is the one

85
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,800
who is trying to stir up the war

86
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,480
for her own selfish thoughts.

87
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,560
Su Mo looks

88
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,040
very seriously ill.

89
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,560
Yes.

90
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,000
She's always having a fever.

91
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,120
She needs spiritual power to protect her heart.

92
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,160
I'm a merman.

93
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,520
I can't practice the empty-sand technique.

94
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,040
I don't have the spiritual power.

95
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,680
I can only ask for help from you.

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,280
Mother.

97
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,400
You've calmed down a lot.

98
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,320
Your breathing is also smooth.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,760
That's great.

100
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,040
Yuan.

101
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,360
You'll have to

102
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,200
stop the war between the two tribes.

103
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,280
It's inconvenient to take a sick child.

104
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,600
Why don't you

105
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
leave it to me

106
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,640
to take care of Su Mo?

107
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,960
Thank you.

108
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,520
Your Highness.

109
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,040
I've caused you trouble.

110
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
When did I

111
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,120
become a person who's afraid of trouble?

112
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
If you say so,

113
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,160
it's an identity.

114
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,160
You've become an identity

115
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,640
and called me Your Highness again.

116
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,760
Yuan,

117
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,360
is there anything else?

118
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,280
Your Highness.

119
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,040
This is a serious matter.

120
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,680
Please don't mention anyone,

121
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,560
including His Highness,

122
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,240
Your Highness,

123
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,960
and...

124
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,920
and your master.

125
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,640
Don't mention Su Mo's past.

126
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,040
Don't even mention me.

127
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,800
I'm special.

128
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,840
I don't want to cause any trouble

129
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,120
to you.

130
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,400
Please get up.

131
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,760
Okay.

132
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,760
I'll tell you then.

133
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,880
I picked up Su Mo

134
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,760
on the street today.

135
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,640
After you and my master

136
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,720
finish your business,

137
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,840
I'll cure Su Mo.

138
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,960
When everything is settled,

139
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,600
we'll go back to Tianji City together.

140
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,160
Where are you going?

141
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,840
Lend it to an empty-yard man to adopt Su Mu.

142
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,680
She'll be better.

143
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,240
If she stays with us,

144
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,000
we'll soon be detected by elders.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,460
Besides, we can't

146
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,500
help her draught.

147
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,600
And Yan E'er

148
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,680
can ease her pains.

149
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,800
Maybe one day,

150
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,400
Shao Siming will find out the identity of Su Mo

151
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,520
and will let him go

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
because of Yan Er.

153
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,520
Yan Er is the one

154
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,760
who is destined to be in the Dragon Blood Valley.

155
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,520
Now, we have the chance

156
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,800
to hand Su Mo over to him.

157
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,160
Maybe it's God's arrangement.

158
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,960
Ruyi,

159
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,560
we need someone to change Yun Huang.

160
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,400
He is not the Emperor of Kong Sang.

161
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,280
He is not the Emperor of the Three Realms.

162
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,920
He is not the Elder.

163
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,360
He is

164
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,800
the Emperor of the Seven Thousand Years.

165
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,600
Su Mo is the hope of our clan.

166
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,200
He will definitely grow up

167
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
to be a powerful and powerful person.

168
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,040
But if the Elder knows

169
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,600
that the Emperor of the Seven Thousand Years is still a child,

170
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,000
he will definitely use him to do whatever he wants.

171
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,680
The pain we suffered

172
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,120
and the mistakes we made

173
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,200
will never happen to him.

174
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,320
��

175
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
You finally woke up.

176
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,640
Are you hungry

177
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,360
and hungry?

178
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,480
I asked someone to make porridge for you.

179
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,760
See if you want to eat something sweet or salty.

180
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,840
What?

181
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,600
You don't recognize me anymore?

182
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,680
Yufei.

183
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,880
Go and check if the porridge is ready.

184
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,320
Su Mo.

185
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,280
Your Uncle Yuan

186
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,080
asked me to take care of you.

187
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,040
I'm here to take care of you.

188
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,160
But you can't

189
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,760
mention him to anyone here.

190
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,960
You can only say

191
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,840
I picked you up by chance on the street.

192
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Do you understand?

193
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,080
I don't need to be blamed by Uncle Yuan.

194
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,440
He's a liar.

195
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,720
You're a liar too.

196
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,680
Don't say that, Yuan.

197
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,880
I couldn't meet you

198
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,880
because I was assigned to do something.

199
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,640
But later,

200
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,120
I took people to search the whole mountain.

201
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,240
But you were all gone.

202
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,160
You're a liar.

203
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,840
Su Mo.

204
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,800
Su Mo.

205
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,480
Su Mo.

206
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,080
Su Mo.

207
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,120
I'll kill you!

208
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,840
You're all bad people!

209
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,640
Su Mo.

210
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,360
I'll kill you!

211
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Calm down.

212
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,320
I'll kill you!

213
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,320
Calm down.

214
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,160
Listen to me.

215
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,200
Su Mo.

216
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,240
You're not fully recovered

217
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,080
and you're not alone.

218
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,360
Do you know how chaotic it is outside?

219
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,280
Even if I let you out,

220
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,080
you might die outside.

221
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Do you know that?

222
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,840
I'll die and you can't even see me.

223
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,880
I didn't feel it when I saw you.

224
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,680
I'm sorry to you

225
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,200
and your mother.

226
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,640
You can blame me

227
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,120
or even beat me.

228
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
But your mother risked her life to protect you.

229
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,640
She didn't do it to make you

230
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,800
as bad as you are now.

231
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,960
Do you know that?

232
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,640
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,280
Your Highness.

234
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,280
Princess Xueying is here to see you.

235
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,400
Mo Mo.

236
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,760
Yu Fei.

237
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,800
Take good care of her.

238
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,880
Whatever she wants,

239
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,400
satisfy her.

240
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,160
Yes, Your Highness.

241
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,120
Yes.

242
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,920
Your Highness.

243
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,160
Your Highness!

244
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,040
Oh no!

245
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,480
The little pride mule ran away.

246
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,080
What happened?

247
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
It was my bad.

248
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,400
I talked to her about her mother

249
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,280
and made her angry.

250
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Then I told someone

251
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,600
to go after her again.

252
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,120
Who would have thought

253
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,800
the vassals roam around

254
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,000
vilifying the pride mule

255
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,480
as Jaoguo해.

256
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,760
So I was suspicious that

257
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,240
they're avenues for him.

258
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,560
I was right.

259
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,520
Do you want the vassals to come after us again?

260
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Xiao Qi Jun.

261
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,800
My brother will scare Xiao Qi Jun.

262
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,000
My brother

263
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
just returned from the front line to Ye City to report to His Majesty.

264
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,280
The capital of Ye City?

265
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
Bai Feng Lin?

266
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,000
My brother has never looked down on the?

267
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,720
If he gets the child,

268
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,000
he will suffer a lot.

269
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,120
I'll go and get Su Mo back.

270
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,600
Your Highness.

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,120
I'll go with you.

272
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,800
My brother may be able to

273
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,320
forgive me in front of me.

274
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,880
Don't worry.

275
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,040
No matter what,

276
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
I'm the princess of the Chis.

277
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,480
Bai Feng Lin

278
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
is not a good person.

279
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,680
Princess Zhu Yan of the Chis.

280
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,760
Greetings, General Bai.

281
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Princess Zhu Yan.

282
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,120
What is it that you are trying to stop me?

283
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,000
That child of the Jiang people

284
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,400
is a member of my family.

285
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,280
He is not a member of the Imperial Army.

286
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,000
There must be some misunderstanding.

287
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,920
I still have work to do.

288
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,480
I'll not get off the horse.

289
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,000
You mean this person, right?

290
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,240
Su Mo.

291
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,160
Wait.

292
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,600
Princess Zhu Yan.

293
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,320
You said this person is a slave of the Chis.

294
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,000
Does he have a slave?

295
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
He is a free spirit.

296
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,640
He doesn't have a slave.

297
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,520
He is not a member of the Chis.

298
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,400
How can you guarantee

299
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,960
that he is not a member of the Imperial Army

300
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,120
or a descendant of the Imperial Army?

301
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,160
He is like a brother to me.

302
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,840
How could he be a member of the Imperial Army?

303
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,120
Please forgive me, General Bai.

304
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,360
Miss Zhu Yan.

305
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
You mean you,

306
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,200
a princess of the Chis,

307
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,640
actually took this person as your brother.

308
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,920
Since General Bai said

309
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,960
this child is a descendant of the Imperial Army,

310
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,560
do you have any evidence?

311
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,320
Princess, you have seen it.

312
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,000
I have a lot of military affairs.

313
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,920
If you insist on evidence,

314
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,640
come back in ten days.

315
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,760
If I can't get any evidence,

316
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,160
I will return it to you.

317
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,480
But until now,

318
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,000
no one can hide it in my hands.

319
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,320
Bai Cheng.

320
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,880
Take these people and kill them.

321
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,560
He is not my brother.

322
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,160
Why do you to be equal to me?

323
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,600
It hurts.

324
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,360
Stupid...

325
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,720
How can he fight like this?

326
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,800
Get away from here.

327
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,480
Young Master.

328
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,880
Sixth Goddess.

329
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,560
Young Master.

330
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,720
You're staying in the inn at night?

331
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,320
This inn is in my mother's name.

332
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,880
Sixth Goddess was my mother's maid before.

333
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,920
After my mother came to the palace,

334
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,360
she stayed here

335
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,840
to take care of this inn.

336
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,880
Mother often brought me here to spend the summer.

337
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,760
Sixth Uncle and Sixth Goddess

338
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,360
watched me grow up.

339
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,640
Then we had an accident...

340
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,640
Thanks to their willingness to stay

341
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,000
and take care of this inn,

342
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,280
the inn is not so deserted.

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I found out

344
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,000
about Young Master and Young Mistress.

345
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,920
It was really a great relief.

346
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,240
Later, I heard that Young Mistress was seriously ill.

347
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,080
We asked someone to come to the palace to visit,

348
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,320
but they all refused.

349
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,600
Thank God.

350
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,560
Young Master is finally back.

351
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,120
Yes.

352
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,440
Young Master, since you're back,

353
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,480
I'll have someone clean up

354
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,640
this inn.

355
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,400
No need.

356
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,600
I saw the red lotus fragrance

357
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,080
in the grass in the front yard.

358
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,520
It's a good herb that can help you look beautiful.

359
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,560
Take me to search the whole yard

360
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,640
and clean it up.

361
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,040
Okay.

362
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,200
Please come with me.

363
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,080
Okay.

364
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,560
Young Master,

365
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,720
I'll make you some tea.

366
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,600
Thank you, Sixth Aunt.

367
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,160
Young Master,

368
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,320
a Jiao man is asking for an audience.

369
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,600
Let him in.

370
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,600
Yes.

371
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,680
Thank you, Sixth Aunt.

372
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,200
Young Master, he's here.

373
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,440
Sorry to keep you waiting.

374
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,680
Sit.

375
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,560
Sixth Aunt,

376
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,520
is this tea

377
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,200
the water I brought?

378
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,360
Yes.

379
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,000
This water is good for your skin.

380
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,880
It's clean and clean.

381
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,680
It's picked in the autumn.

382
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,880
The heart of the grassless wood is the liver of the fish.

383
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,760
It's the water of the Geshans.

384
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
It's said that the Yellow Sea

385
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,680
has a connection with the four seas

386
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,240
and the water of the Four Seasons.

387
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
It's really extraordinary.

388
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,920
Young Master, you've asked for it.

389
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,880
I hope you can tell me.

390
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,880
His favorite tea is Yunwu Qing.

391
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,320
And when making this tea,

392
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,400
it needs the water of the Geshans.

393
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,000
And it's picked in the autumn.

394
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,160
So the heart of the grassless wood

395
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,720
is the liver of the fish.

396
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,760
According to the meeting of the King of the Sea,

397
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,320
you must know what I'm going to ask you.

398
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,240
You're afraid of

399
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,800
the Jade Flame, aren't you?

400
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,440
You're afraid that the Kingdom of the Sea will be destroyed.

401
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,760
Young Master,

402
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
the blood of the turtle is just a star in the sky.

403
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,520
It's not dangerous.

404
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,280
Now the state of the air is broken.

405
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,960
It's not caused by a star.

406
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,600
Tell me why.

407
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,600
In ancient times,

408
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,560
the gods were all very powerful.

409
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,640
The Kongsang, the Jiao, the Ice and the He Ping

410
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
were all shining.

411
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,360
That's why there was a great person like the Star Lord Bai Wei

412
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
who appeared in the sky.

413
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,680
But later, the Kongsang Clan was in great danger.

414
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,040
The other clans were defeated.

415
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,880
After seven thousand years,

416
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,320
people were alone and enjoying themselves.

417
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,280
The whole Yunhuang was in a state of chaos.

418
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,320
It was worse than before.

419
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
That's why there was a king of the North Emperors

420
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
who was alone and beautiful and ignored the state affairs.

421
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,040
You deceived the king.

422
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,240
Are you really not afraid that I'll kill you?

423
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,440
No.

424
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,600
There are three reasons.

425
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,960
First,

426
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,960
as the person of Young Commander,

427
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,200
you don't need to be a relative.

428
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,000
Second,

429
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,120
if you don't even listen to the truth,

430
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,240
what's the use of the situation in the future?

431
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,000
What a good plan.

432
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Then tell me.

433
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,520
What's the use of the situation in the future?

434
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,940
When a fiance and a man reunite to banking on the Kongsang Download and

435
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:39,080
primary

436
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,700
We will have peace in our country soon.

437
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,580
The state of the Yu State is as brilliant as a star.

438
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,500
Is this what you mean?

439
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,500
Is it from the lung?

440
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,980
Young Minister,

441
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,580
my clan worshiped Dragon God.

442
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,100
Dragon God has always been good at

443
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,740
fighting instead of arranging troops.

444
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
It shows that my clan is not a battle-riding clan.

445
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,900
Dragon God chose me

446
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,300
because I have the heart of a humble clan

447
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,700
and I am not able to fight with him.

448
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,660
I think you are thinking the same way.

449
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,180
Otherwise, why bother saving my life?

450
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,180
Fine.

451
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,140
Since you have such a wish,

452
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
let's make a deal.

453
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,140
Within a month,

454
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,580
the Jiao clan and the Kongsang clan will withdraw their troops.

455
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,660
I will do my best.

456
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,660
Do your best?

457
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,180
Although the army of the Haiguo State is full of fish and dragon,

458
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,660
you are the King of the Sea

459
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,100
who has been waiting for 7,000 years.

460
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,540
The Jiao people will listen to you.

461
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,540
As long as you are determined,

462
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,060
you can't do anything you want to do.

463
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,060
Unless

464
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,620
you are not the King of the Sea at all.

465
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,500
Young Minister, you are joking.

466
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,620
I promised him that I would do whatever I said.

467
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,140
Fine.

468
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,980
I am willing to trust you again.

469
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,780
When did you know

470
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,420
who you are?

471
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,380
I was the left-hand man of the Haiguo Army.

472
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,460
I was seriously injured in the war 200 years ago.

473
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,140
So I hid my name in the West.

474
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,100
Recently, I felt the dragon god

475
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,020
and the Gui Xie Star rising.

476
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,540
So I returned to the Haiguo Army.

477
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,900
What's the matter?

478
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,740
You want to recover for 200 years?

479
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,020
I appreciate it.

480
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,220
Young Minister,

481
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,300
when I succeed in withdrawing the Haiguo Army,

482
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,060
please tell Young Minister

483
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,180
about the past.

484
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,060
It's a deal.

485
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,580
By the way,

486
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,620
you said three reasons just now.

487
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,540
But you only said two.

488
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,980
I won't kill you.

489
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,180
The third reason is

490
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,220
if Young Minister kills me,

491
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,780
I will have a better chance

492
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,500
to find out the truth.

493
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,380
Young Master,

494
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,220
you finally come back.

495
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,980
Why don't you stay for dinner?

496
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,100
I made tofu with ginseng and rice.

497
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,020
You loved it when you were a kid.

498
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,220
Thank you, Goddess Liu.

499
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,340
You can stay for dinner tonight.

500
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,140
Maybe we can find more

501
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,700
similar hobbies.

502
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,820
Right. Right. Right.

503
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,820
Let's stay together

504
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,900
and have a meal together

505
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,180
when you come back.

506
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,180
It's more lively with more people.

507
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,420
Okay.

508
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,740
I'll go to the room.

509
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,500
Okay.

510
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,300
I'll do as you say.

511
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,100
Ying,

512
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,940
the red lotus incense I picked

513
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,140
is real.

514
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,580
It...

515
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:05,940
It...

516
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
It's the sea king.

517
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,140
You...

518
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,260
It's a misunderstanding.

519
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,300
Then I...

520
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,020
Shut up.

521
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,220
Sit down and have a meal.

522
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,380
I...

523
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,700
I didn't expect

524
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,900
I could pick the red lotus incense.

525
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,100
The fish

526
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,260
became friends with the fish.

527
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,500
But I still don't trust him.

528
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,700
Don't be fooled by him.

529
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,220
Lord Chongming,

530
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,740
400 years ago,

531
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,340
you saved a mermaid

532
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,820
in the Qing Shui River.

533
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:41,980
I...

534
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,860
Dazhu,

535
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,180
don't do this.

536
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,020
I came to save you.

537
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,260
I saved many people.

538
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,420
The man

539
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,260
is a foot-dresser of our clan.

540
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,620
The red lotus incense you gave me

541
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,860
has become a must-have item for us

542
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,220
and used for foreign merchants.

543
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,700
His name is

544
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,940
Chongming Gao.

545
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,620
In fact,

546
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,020
for more than 7,000 years,

547
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,500
the things we eat and use

548
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,180
are no different from the empty-sand people.

549
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,780
The empty-sand people can't live without us.

550
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,260
The war is just a month away.

551
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,060
The people are badly injured.

552
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,660
And the surrounding city

553
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,500
is not as prosperous as before.

554
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,020
So the war

555
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,740
is not about fighting for time.

556
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,100
It's about following the will of God.

557
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,420
Let's go.

558
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,340
The little duck can't catch up.

559
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,180
What do we do if we can't catch up?

560
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,260
Come on, catch up.

561
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,180
Catch up.

562
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,060
Catch up.

563
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:47,900
Catch up.

564
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,860
Catch up.

565
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,060
You caught up again.

566
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,380
You caught up.

567
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,220
I caught up this little duck.

568
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,220
Come on.

569
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,900
Is the lotus in this pond

570
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,180
planted by your mother?

571
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,260
In my life,

572
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,580
the lotus in this pond

573
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,820
is not in bloom except for you.

574
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,620
It's not in bloom

575
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,260
except for you.

576
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,620
Your mother is a woman of the world.

577
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,940
I'm sure

578
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,020
she's already in the world of freedom.

579
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,340
She won't be fooled by the past.

580
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,740
But, Young Minister,

581
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,660
your attitude towards the Jiao people

582
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,300
is a little unexpected.

583
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,260
What do you think?

584
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,100
Your true identity

585
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,700
has been spread all over the world.

586
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,180
What I said today

587
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,380
is not a bad thing.

588
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,700
With your background,

589
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,060
if you want to use this war

590
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,420
to completely destroy the Jiao people,

591
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,860
you should also

592
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,460
be reasonable.

593
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,420
I didn't expect you

594
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,820
to take the initiative

595
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,180
to fight and withdraw troops.

596
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,900
I'm also a man.

597
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,820
If I don't hate Qiu Shui,

598
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,820
I'll feel sorry for my mother.

599
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,660
But...

600
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,940
But you

601
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,780
fought in the Eighth Battalion of the Guwei City.

602
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,100
You were kind to the navy

603
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,940
in Tianji Fengcheng.

604
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,940
I knew

605
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,180
you couldn't do it

606
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,820
with the lives of thousands of people.

607
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,140
A man like you

608
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,500
is worth a long time.

609
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,280
Prince Fei.

610
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,020
Back then,

611
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,660
you were in the left Thoughtaffek trap,

612
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,100
yet you were able to let go of everything

613
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,300
and hide your name.

614
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,300
You stop your winning by meaningless words.

615
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,380
You can truly see that

616
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,060
you're a guy who takes great care of their love

617
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,940
and faith.

618
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,380
You would rather wow the everywhere

619
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,020
than take your responsibility.

620
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,060
Are you really a man?

621
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,900
Stop him!

622
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:16,900
negative thinking

623
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,100
And not

624
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:21,940
Come back

625
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:24,880
or

626
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,620
Ok

627
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,860
Resign

628
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,140
Come on.

629
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,580
Be careful.

630
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,980
Be careful.

631
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,180
Come on.

632
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,500
Okay.

633
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,460
Your Excellency,

634
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,460
Xiao Qi's army has been capturing people everywhere.

635
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,820
They discussed about

636
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,540
taking over our house for a few days.

637
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,540
They're afraid that they'll be involved

638
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,060
and kick us out.

639
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,940
They have nowhere to go now.

640
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,980
Yes.

641
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,740
We have nowhere to go.

642
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,300
Young Commander,

643
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,260
the war is fierce now.

644
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,460
The world is in danger.

645
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,660
The blind people

646
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,940
can't protect themselves.

647
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,220
I'm also searching everywhere

648
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,940
for a place to hide.

649
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,700
Don't be afraid, Young Commander.

650
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,300
I'll take them away now.

651
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,100
These people are old

652
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,380
and have a bad eye.

653
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,660
They're not easy to deal with.

654
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,380
Why don't you live here

655
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,300
with me?

656
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,380
This is my mother's old house.

657
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,860
Those Xiao Qi's army

658
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,420
dare not be too impudent.

659
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,100
Thank you.

660
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,020
Thank you.

661
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,540
Thank you for taking care of us.

662
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,580
Thank you.

663
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,300
Please get up.

664
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,660
Thank you.

665
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,420
Get up.

666
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,380
Young Commander.

667
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,940
I can never forget

668
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,700
your kindness to the Jiao clan.

669
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,260
I just hope

670
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,900
that if you and I make a promise,

671
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,180
we'll stop the war as soon as possible

672
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,780
so that these poor people

673
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,140
can live in peace.

674
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,300
Sixth Uncle and Sixth Aunt,

675
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,940
please take care of them.

676
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,140
Yes, Young Master.

677
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,780
Granny, come with me.

678
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,300
Come on.

679
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:15,980
Granny.

680
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,580
If

681
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,060
you're not in different camps,

682
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,420
maybe

683
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,020
we can be friends.

684
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,620
This is

685
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,820
where we live.

686
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,220
We'll all have a place to stay.

687
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,020
Ruyi.

688
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,860
Why did you bring Granny here?

689
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,260
I just said it.

690
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,580
The landlord kicked us out.

691
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,780
We have nowhere to go.

692
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,580
No.

693
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,380
You want to use Shiyi's sympathy

694
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,500
so that she won't doubt my character again

695
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,260
and use the lives of the clan

696
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,860
to protect me.

697
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,220
I didn't.

698
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,060
I know you're worried about me.

699
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,260
But I don't want you to be like the sword master

700
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,460
who risked his life

701
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,060
for his own good.

702
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,540
The abyss is not just a danger for the humans.

703
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,540
When you made a mistake

704
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,820
for your own good,

705
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,260
you were like the last step of the ten thousand steps.

706
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,340
So as your brother,

707
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,140
I have to stop you from the beginning.

708
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,420
I know, Brother.

709
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,620
I didn't find the sea king.

710
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,020
What about you?

711
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,140
When we arrived,

712
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,100
there was no trace of the sea king.

713
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,780
I sensed that the sea king was right there.

714
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,460
The Kongsang Army suddenly arrived.

715
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,500
I took them away and drove them away.

716
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,420
I was about to die.

717
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,820
If you hadn't fought against the Kongsang Army

718
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,180
in the Great Qing Dynasty,

719
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,820
I would have brought the sea king back safely.

720
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,100
It was an accident.

721
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,900
I was just a little boy.

722
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,580
I was just a little boy.

723
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,060
It was an accident.

724
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,940
Now that it has come to this,

725
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,060
can't we stop fighting?

726
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,660
Right?

727
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,180
Right.

728
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,700
Right.

729
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,140
Yes.

730
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,420
We can't stop fighting.

731
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,820
We have to stop fighting now.

732
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,140
The Blood-sucking Star has been hiding its light.

733
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,900
I suspect that the sea king was lost

734
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,580
because of the war.

735
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,540
He is in a bad state.

736
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,820
If we continue to fight,

737
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,820
the sea king will be in danger

738
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,940
and affect the great cause of our country.

739
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,260
Yes.

740
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,180
We should wait for the return of the sea king.

741
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,220
Well...

742
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,300
What a bad idea.

743
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:21,980
Yes.

744
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,460
The sea king cares about his people.

745
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,340
He will never let the Jiao people

746
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,740
make a fearless sacrifice.

747
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,380
You.

748
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,220
You.

749
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,060
And you.

750
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,100
Your children

751
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,660
died because of this.

752
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,540
He said that the sea king would remember Wang Cheng.

753
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,620
But he didn't even see him.

754
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,940
How could he remember?

755
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,820
What a bad idea.

756
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,940
But we have sacrificed

757
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,100
so many soldiers.

758
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,020
Are we going to give up the city

759
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,540
that we have fought so hard for?

760
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,700
The sea king is a man of the heaven.

761
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,020
He will bring the Jiao people to restore the country.

762
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,100
Why are you so eager to fight?

763
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,060
What if the sea king is a bait?

764
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,620
It seems that you really want the sea king to be a bait.

765
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:07,900
Then you can

766
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,540
write the seal of the sea king to the Jiao people.

767
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,580
A'xi.

768
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,180
Lead the army.

769
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,220
Yes.

770
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,300
Wait.

771
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,660
Sir.

772
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,420
If we withdraw the army now,

773
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,180
the empty-sand army will be in a tight chase.

774
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,500
Can you take the responsibility?

775
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,860
I promise you.

776
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,180
As long as the navy withdraws the army,

777
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,220
the two tribes can stop the war.

778
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,020
The order of Mount Jiuyi is

779
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,700
I didn't call you.

780
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,820
Why did you attack?

781
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,540
Your Majesty.

782
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,540
Recently, the new county of Gui Xie

783
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,580
has been heavily attacked.

784
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,780
I will shoulder the responsibility of the mountain of Jiuyi

785
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,460
and go down the mountain to investigate this matter.

786
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,100
Recently, this matter has been advanced.

787
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,500
The situation is serious.

788
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,420
So I came here

789
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,500
to report to Your Majesty.

790
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,500
What's the progress?

791
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,980
Tell me.

792
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,060
I have found the sea king.

793
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,980
We found the sea king.

794
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,980
We found the sea king.

795
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,980
We found the sea king.

796
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,260
We found the sea king.

797
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:17,940
We found the sea king.

798
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,940
We found the sea king.

799
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,740
Really?

800
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,860
Yes.

801
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,700
I also made a promise to the sea king

802
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,780
that within a month,

803
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,020
the Jiao tribe and the empty-sand army will withdraw the army

804
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,500
and stop the war.

805
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,180
So I

806
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,900
beg Your Majesty's permission

807
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,500
to withdraw all the empty-sand army.

808
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,980
What a good commander.

809
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,180
Stopping the war is a great thing.

810
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,660
You actually made a decision with the Jiao tribe.

811
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,300
Zhong Haiqing.

812
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,420
What do you think?

813
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,380
Your Majesty.

814
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,380
The war is of great importance.

815
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,060
The Minister of War

816
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,780
didn't know about the military situation in the front line.

817
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,900
But he secretly arranged a peace treaty with the Jiao tribe.

818
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,220
I think

819
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,540
the Minister of War

820
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,260
wants to take the credit of

821
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,700
pacifying the rebellion

822
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,020
to himself.

823
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,100
Please investigate it, Your Majesty.

824
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,180
Although I didn't participate in the war,

825
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,540
I know the principle of

826
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,180
the people as the foundation

827
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,700
and the foundation of the people as the foundation.

828
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,900
There are countless common people in this war.

829
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,300
The people are all the same.

830
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,860
There are countless common people in this war.

831
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,020
The families are all destroyed.

832
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,220
Do you think the people's pain

833
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,580
is just a trick

834
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,020
to get credit?

835
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:25,780
You...

836
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,700
The navy

837
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,900
is not a threat.

838
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,860
Your Majesty.

839
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,860
Now,

840
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,860
the army led by Shi Yu

841
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,380
is a big problem.

842
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,540
It's a disaster.

843
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,500
Even if there is a small sacrifice,

844
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,340
I don't think

845
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,220
it's necessary

846
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,340
to withdraw the army

847
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,140
when the war situation is favorable to the air war.

848
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,100
Instead of saying that the situation is bad

849
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,380
and the news is spread,

850
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,940
it's better to say that the enemy is hurt

851
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,420
and the loss is 800.

852
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,500
Our air war

853
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,100
is just because there are many people

854
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,500
and the advantage is taken.

855
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
And the navy is determined to die

856
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,060
and fight to the end.

857
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,340
The war

858
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,100
will not end soon.

859
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,620
The casualties of both sides

860
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,140
will only get bigger and bigger.

861
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,940
No matter how big the casualties are,

862
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,420
it's necessary.

863
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,300
The Jiao people are not my kind.

864
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,260
The navy has been destroyed for thousands of years.

865
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,820
But they are still not dead.

866
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,140
This time,

867
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,500
we must eliminate them as soon as possible.

868
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,140
Never give up.

869
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,500
Your Majesty.

870
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,180
Your Majesty.

871
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,180
We can't let them die.

872
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,180
We can't let them die.

873
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,180
We can't let them die.

874
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,180
We can't let them die.

875
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,180
We can't let them die.

876
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,180
We can't let them die.

877
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,180
Commander Shao,

878
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,420
as an outsider,

879
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,940
you have been interfering in the affairs of the state.

880
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,540
Now,

881
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,260
you are the one who is responsible

882
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,060
for the peace agreement.

883
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,740
I want to ask you, Commander Shao,

884
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,300
what is your identity

885
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,940
to make the decision for His Majesty?

886
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,620
What is your intention?

887
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,220
Your Majesty.

888
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,580
I do have a personal intention.

889
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,460
Some people are

890
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,620
eager to fight with each other

891
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,180
and are worried about the future.

892
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:19,640
The Tang army is in the

893
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,340
And there are many people

894
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,940
who have been in touch with the army in the court.

895
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,340
If you can't answer my question,

896
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,780
you can just open the door

897
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,580
and use the army to confuse the public.

898
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,180
That's right.

899
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,340
Fortunately, His Majesty is wise.

900
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,620
How could he be deceived by you?

901
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,500
Your Majesty,

902
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
you are right.

903
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,460
Commander Shao is disobeying His Majesty

904
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,220
and slandering the court officials.

905
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,020
I hope Your Majesty can punish him severely.

906
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,300
I hope Your Majesty can punish him severely.

907
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,780
I hope Your Majesty can punish him severely.

908
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,060
I hope Your Majesty...

909
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,860
I have evidence.

910
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,780
This...

911
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,420
How dare you!

912
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,820
You want to rebel?

913
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,020
I'm here!

914
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,140
This is the evidence.

915
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,700
Bring it here.

916
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,660
No.

917
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,780
This weapon looks normal.

918
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,460
Your Majesty,

919
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,500
this is the weapon of the soldiers.

920
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,140
It's made of black iron.

921
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,540
It's very lethal.

922
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,900
It's not a big deal for soldiers to use it.

923
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,780
Because they have already adapted

924
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,180
to extreme cold weather.

925
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,580
If the air is empty,

926
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,780
once touched,

927
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,540
the cold air will be absorbed.

928
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,180
If used for a long time,

929
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,580
the heart pulse will drop.

930
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,660
Eventually, it will die of illness.

931
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,660
Where did you get this?

932
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,220
I found it in General Qing's

933
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,500
military camp in Ye City.

934
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,980
Many elite soldiers in the camp

935
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,740
all used this weapon.

936
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,020
Because of this,

937
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,220
the air is empty,

938
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,740
so the cold air will drop

939
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,140
since the war began.

940
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,580
You have made great contributions.

941
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,260
I didn't expect you to use such a weapon.

942
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,900
It's said that the world is like a broken bamboo,

943
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,180
and the news is spread.

944
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,940
It's actually built

945
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,500
above the danger of thousands of soldiers.

946
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,940
There's such a thing?

947
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,260
Your Majesty, don't worry.

948
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,940
When I left the camp,

949
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,380
I already told General Qing

950
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,740
to return the military mission quickly.

951
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:40,940
Your Majesty,

952
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,500
what's your explanation?

953
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,300
Your Majesty,

954
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,180
I'm wronged.

955
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,060
It's just that the Commander

956
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,900
still said it was unfair.

957
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,500
Even if the Qing army

958
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,660
used this mission,

959
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,100
who can prove that

960
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,020
it's a weapon of the military?

961
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,620
You guessed it right.

962
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,620
No one has ever seen the air of the military,

963
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,820
so they dare to do so boldly.

964
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,980
But you forgot, Your Majesty.

965
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,180
I was attacked in Mount Jiuyi.

966
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,780
The perpetrator was a soldier.

967
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,220
This is the weapon they left behind.

968
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,700
I've been in Mount Jiuyi.

969
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,100
All the officers are witnesses.

970
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,860
Your Majesty can send someone to check

971
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,980
if it's the same material.

972
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,980
I have no evidence.

973
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,100
I'm not sure.

974
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,020
Qing Dongfang,

975
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,940
are you still trying to deny

976
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,180
that a large number of military weapons

977
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,020
are in the Qing army?

978
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,380
You still dare to say that you don't know?

979
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,460
I know I'm wronged.

980
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,620
But I only know that

981
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,180
it's easy to kill the enemy.

982
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,500
So I didn't expect

983
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,540
that many of them were my misjudgments.

984
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,900
The air of the military and the army

985
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,180
have never been in contact.

986
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,220
Where did these weapons come from?

987
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,500
Your Majesty,

988
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,340
I will investigate thoroughly

989
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,140
the person who bought these weapons.

990
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,620
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

991
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,180
The military is small.

992
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,580
It's not the Qing army's fault.

993
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,180
The Qing army is not the enemy.

994
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,620
If it wasn't the Qing army's fault,

995
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,940
how could they

996
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,940
blame the subordinates?

997
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,180
Your Majesty,

998
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,620
the private communication with the military

999
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,700
is a big crime.

1000
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,180
I hope Your Majesty can investigate thoroughly.

1001
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,220
I hope Your Majesty can investigate thoroughly.

1002
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,020
I don't think

1003
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,540
it's necessary to investigate thoroughly.

1004
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,140
Just like Your Majesty

1005
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,060
once said to me,

1006
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,980
the night falls and the world is in the autumn.

1007
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,900
One person is drunk and the people are worried.

1008
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,740
Since you have given out the auction,

1009
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,380
you can enjoy the view

1010
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,380
by saying this.

1011
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,940
Your Majesty,

1012
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,820
thank you for

1013
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,340
your kindness.

1014
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1015
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,740
You don't have to thank me.

1016
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:17,820
It's all

1017
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,340
because of Your Majesty's virtue.

1018
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,740
I know Your Majesty

1019
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,220
won't be angry with you.

1020
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,020
It's like Your Majesty has been pitying

1021
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,420
the innocent people who were involved in the war.

1022
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,220
The situation was urgent at that time.

1023
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,740
So I had to take the risk

1024
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,060
and make my own decision

1025
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,060
to cooperate with the King of the Sea

1026
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,460
to stop the war.

1027
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,820
However, whether it's the people or the people,

1028
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,260
it depends on Your Majesty's thoughts.

1029
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,340
Since you said so,

1030
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,540
can I

1031
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,540
refuse you?

1032
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,860
Send my order.

1033
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,940
From today on,

1034
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,420
the whole of Kongsang

1035
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,860
will withdraw the army.

1036
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,740
Your Majesty,

1037
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,100
tell me.

1038
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,900
Who will

1039
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,100
take charge of withdrawing the army?

1040
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,620
Shi Yu, the Crown Prince,

1041
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,260
has been living in the army

1042
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,860
since the beginning of the war.

1043
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,740
He knows a lot about the army.

1044
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,500
I'll see Shi Yu.

1045
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,700
Yes.

1046
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,540
Go.

1047
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,820
Go.

1048
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,580
Your Highness, your letter.

1049
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,220
It must be a letter from Xue Ying

1050
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,220
when she knew the war was over.

1051
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,420
Your Highness.

1052
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,420
Your Highness.

1053
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,260
Is there anything

1054
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,020
that troubles you?

1055
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:04,460
No.

1056
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,820
The war between the two tribes is in Qingqiu.

1057
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,580
The withdrawal of the army

1058
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,020
will be carried out as planned.

1059
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,980
It can't be delayed.

1060
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:20,980
You...

1061
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,500
Who are you?

1062
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,020
You...

1063
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:23,860
What are you doing?

1064
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,500
Somebody!

1065
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:25,220
Somebody!

1066
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,020
Don't panic.

1067
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,020
I'm Shao Siming of Mount Jiuyi.

1068
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,660
I have something to ask you.

1069
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,860
I... I don't know anything.

1070
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,420
Are you still

1071
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,460
hiding something from him?

1072
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,380
Do you really think

1073
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,220
he will protect your mother

1074
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,540
and your son?

1075
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,500
I've sent your son to Mount Jiuyi.

1076
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,740
He is now an outsider.

1077
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,480
He is not a

1078
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,100
part of the world.

1079
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,540
Thank you, Shao Siming,

1080
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,740
for saving my family.

1081
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,260
You were an innocent man.

1082
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,460
My soldiers are also innocent.

1083
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,220
I don't want to let the innocent die.

1084
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:11,740
So,

1085
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,860
I must find out the truth.

1086
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,340
I'm willing to tell

1087
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,700
Shao Siming

1088
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,140
what I know.

1089
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,300
researching on dig sehe

1090
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,860
A wind that can break my soul

1091
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:31,860
Lock me in your heart

1092
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:36,860
Not leaving you

1093
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:41,860
Your heart is broken

1094
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:46,860
A wind that can break my soul

1095
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,860
A feeling that can be broken

1096
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,860
You and I just walk face to face

1097
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,860
You walked to the bottom of the mountain

1098
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:07,860
A wind that can break my soul

1099
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:12,860
Lock me in your heart

1100
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:17,860
Not leaving you

1101
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:22,860
Your heart is broken

1102
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:27,860
A wind that can break my soul

1103
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:32,860
A feeling that can be broken

1104
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:37,860
You and I just walk face to face

1105
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:42,860
How can we meet

1106
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:47,860
How can we meet again
