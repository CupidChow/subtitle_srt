1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Give me a life of shining fortune

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want to be your rain

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to be your rain

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But I ask you to give me the courage

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I want to be your rain

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want to be your rain

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let you and me, the first meeting

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
engraved in my heart

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yu Fei, you're finally back

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yu Fei

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Miss, what's wrong with you?

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hurry up and send someone to Bamiang to find Yu Ji's mother and son

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, I can't be trapped here

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I won't do anything

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I won't do anything

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I won't do anything

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I won't do anything

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I won't do anything

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I won't do anything

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I won't do anything

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You want to go out and read it

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You can break my enchantment

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No one can stop you by then

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Is this me?

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Qian Shu

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I didn't expect that you would even hand it to me

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I didn't expect that you would even hand it to me

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I want to be your rain

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I want to be your rain

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I want to be your rain

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You even want to hand me the book?

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What's the page that he tore?

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is it harder than Qian Shu?

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Are you afraid that I won't learn it?

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's go

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How about we find a place to stay tonight?

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I think this place is pretty good

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, this time we have to go around the city

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We can't go to the Huotu Tribe's party again

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If we can earn money again, we will only have one life

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What happened to Huotu Tribe?

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Huotu Tribe's main consort tried to rebel

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Fortunately, the master of Mount Jiuyi came

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Otherwise, I don't know how many people will die

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The great sorcerer hasn't been caught yet

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They are using the life of the sorcerer to make sorcery

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's very evil

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's hurry up

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We can't wait any longer

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The workers are not good people

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't believe it at all

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I didn't hear it

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He said the great sorcerer is using us to teach people how to do it

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We can't be caught

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The great sorcerer is using us to teach people how to do it

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We can't be caught

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't believe it

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We can't be caught

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We can't be caught

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's go

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's go

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's go

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's go

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's go

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's go

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's go

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's go

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I've been looking for you for three times

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I haven't found the sorcerer's mother and son you mentioned

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A mother with a disability

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Where can she go with a child who is sick and unwell?

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Miss, I don't think you need to worry too much

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You said that Yu Ji is the favorite of the master

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Of course, she has seen the world

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's not a difficult thing to live with a child

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I guess they will wait for you for a long time

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They will leave without seeing you

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's all my fault

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I forgot about them for the great sorcerer

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I have to break the barrier and go to them

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Miss, you were so busy yesterday

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And you didn't have a good rest last night

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You can't stand it

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm fine, don't worry

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You can leave now

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I have my own way

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's go

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Give me something to eat

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Give me something to eat

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Be good

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Still no response

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The sea king is not in Gu Wei City

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Where else can he be?

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't know

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't know

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't know

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Huh?

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The house is empty

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He has to leave

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He hasn't come back

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He can't come back

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
For six months

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No 어떤 explanation

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We should go there

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Go

111
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,000
Miss, someone has escaped from the prison

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,600
Can we still get out?

113
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,560
I'll take you out.

114
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,000
You take us out?

115
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,880
Impossible.

116
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,240
We can't get out.

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,000
The weather here

118
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,480
is good for the Jiao people.

119
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,680
You can go there after you get out.

120
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,600
Can you take us out?

121
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,240
Really?

122
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,280
Can you?

123
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,600
Be brave.

124
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,280
Don't hurt us.

125
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,160
Be brave.

126
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,880
Be quiet.

127
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,040
Uncle Yan, I'm scared.

128
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,320
Hurry.

129
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,640
Hurry.

130
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,520
Be quiet.

131
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,440
Hurry.

132
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,240
Hurry.

133
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,320
Be careful.

134
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,040
Hurry.

135
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,040
Hurry. Follow up.

136
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,000
Be careful.

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,680
Be careful.

138
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,520
Great巫师.

139
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,200
Great巫师.

140
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,960
Be careful.

141
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,040
Be careful.

142
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,640
Is this the great巫师 who locked you up?

143
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,600
Yes.

144
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,320
Yes.

145
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes.

146
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,200
Who are you?

147
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,320
How dare you enter Guwei City?

148
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,000
You committed many crimes.

149
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,120
Today I'll avenge my people.

150
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,640
No.

151
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,760
Come on.

152
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,800
Die in the Jiao City.

153
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,200
I'll protect you.

154
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,740
Don't!

155
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,500
Don't leave!

156
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,460
Didn't you say

157
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,200
that I've hidden them here?

158
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,820
Go.

159
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,460
Go!

160
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,700
Go!

161
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,700
Am I leaving

162
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,680
the people who don't have soul?

163
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,320
is the most valuable thing to you.

164
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,520
Chase them.

165
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,640
You...

166
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,600
There is no soul poissem

167
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,240
in these people's bodies.

168
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,600
They are not alive at all.

169
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,320
Instead of controlling them

170
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,120
to become primordial animals,

171
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,040
we can send them back

172
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,160
to Peep France

173
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,440
early to il Letter Taven.

174
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,240
But they are pure and fine.

175
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,600
But Gui Xing is no longer ill.

176
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,440
Once Ha황 Fект

177
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,080
makes خوش� свои تعالمن

178
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,400
he will pick one who is Speaker's choice

179
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
to go to the other sea.

180
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,040
You and you won't

181
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,840
Once the Sea Emperor is gone and Dragon God returns,

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,120
they still have a chance to wake up.

183
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,800
You're the only one

184
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
who has the soul of the Immortal.

185
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,200
And

186
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,560
you know these things

187
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,920
to show that you're not low in the merman.

188
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,040
Are you

189
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
the Sea Emperor?

190
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,160
You're really the Sea Emperor?

191
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Why do you want to find the Sea Emperor?

192
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,040
Who are you?

193
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,160
I'm the Young Minister of Mount Jiuyi.

194
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,040
I'm here to protect the Emperor

195
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,240
and the Sea Emperor.

196
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
It's my duty.

197
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,640
He's Yan'er's master.

198
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,800
Why is he here?

199
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,480
The power of the Black Eye's God's Array

200
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,960
must be obtained by a hundred people at the same time.

201
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,800
I've been waiting for this opportunity for many years.

202
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,200
I can't fulfill my conditions.

203
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,520
Until I saw the Young Minister of Mount Huotu

204
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,560
wielding ten thousand swords with one sword.

205
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,640
I knew you would help me complete the task.

206
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,440
You're really a genius.

207
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,680
If you can make the fire, you'll be a human.

208
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,760
If you want to surrender to me,

209
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,280
you can use your soul for my sake.

210
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,000
I can spare your life.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,920
I'm the Young Minister of Mount Jiuyi.

212
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,360
How can I dream of

213
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,760
a thing like you?

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,040
You ignorant boy.

215
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,560
Why don't I tell you a secret?

216
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,760
I'm here to help you.

217
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,880
I know you.

218
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,040
The Young Minister of Mount Jiuyi

219
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,560
is the former Prince Shi Ying.

220
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,800
How about we make a deal?

221
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,560
I'll give up the ten years of the Kuangfu.

222
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,640
I'll help you take over the country.

223
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,720
After the task is done,

224
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,480
you can give me the last word.

225
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,640
Every word you say

226
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,560
is dirty to my ears.

227
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,080
Shi Ying.

228
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,480
You're so rude.

229
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,120
I got the power of the Demon God of Shanggu.

230
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,960
You think you can defeat me with your power?

231
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,840
Even if I die of a sharp sword,

232
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,280
I won't let you go.

233
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,600
You're my clan.

234
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,720
I'll settle the score with you today.

235
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,400
I'll help you.

236
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,080
You're not his opponent.

237
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,880
Leave now.

238
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,720
You're not afraid of the Young Minister of Mount Jiuyi.

239
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,360
Am I afraid?

240
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,600
Then you're all dead.

241
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,960
Ge İn, no!

242
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,780
Fire.

243
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,020
Be careful!

244
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,720
How is it?

245
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,720
She's finally dead.

246
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,320
This is bad.

247
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,640
There's the power of the ancient Demon God in this gemstone.

248
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,720
Young Master.

249
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,520
Young Master.

250
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,160
Are you all right?

251
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,760
Young Master.

252
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,000
You're finally awake.

253
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,400
Didn't you say that you can handle it alone?

254
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
You even asked me

255
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,200
to look around for other sites.

256
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,640
How did it turn out like this?

257
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,640
Look at this.

258
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,920
This. This.

259
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,600
It's good that you're awake.

260
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,720
The power of the Demon God in this gemstone

261
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,200
is much stronger than the power of the Demon God.

262
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,240
It's not like you can't handle it alone.

263
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,040
You're not the only one who can handle it.

264
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,600
The power of the Demon God

265
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,040
is different from the power of the Heavenly Emperor you've cultivated.

266
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,400
And it will suppress your spiritual power.

267
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,920
The longer you stay in your body, the more damage you'll have.

268
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,320
You have to find a way to get it out.

269
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,640
Why am I here?

270
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,680
Where's the merman?

271
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,760
I was just about to say that

272
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,360
when I arrived,

273
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,840
the merman was dragging you.

274
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,080
He was obviously exhausted.

275
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,840
He looked pale as if he were possessed.

276
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,200
When he left, he handed you over to me.

277
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,080
By the way,

278
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,160
he also gave me the spiritual medicine.

279
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,640
Let him go.

280
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,720
You...

281
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,880
Look.

282
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,120
He knows and the Ghost Blood knows.

283
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,560
This person

284
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,640
must be the one we're looking for.

285
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,240
What?

286
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,360
But I don't know his identity.

287
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,120
If that person is Hai Huang,

288
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,480
then you two will

289
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
meet on the battlefield in the future

290
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,320
and fight to the death.

291
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,480
With this person's character,

292
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,360
if he's Hai Huang,

293
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,120
the two tribes

294
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,160
might not be so different.

295
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,400
They can fight together.

296
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,640
In this case,

297
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
the Ghost Blood is fine.

298
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,200
For Kong Sang,

299
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,240
maybe

300
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,320
he's just a mere man.

301
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,560
But all these years,

302
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,840
the position of the Navy

303
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,800
doesn't seem to be guided by a master.

304
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,760
The Ghost Blood has just risen.

305
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,440
The identity of the new Hai Huang

306
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,400
must have just been confirmed.

307
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,440
But

308
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,280
this person shouldn't be in the Navy.

309
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,520
Otherwise,

310
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,680
why would he fight alone on the battlefield?

311
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,400
As for the Mermaid,

312
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,360
Hai Huang is obedient and obedient.

313
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,720
So,

314
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,360
Hai Huang's thoughts

315
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,960
will eventually affect the overall situation.

316
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,440
If they're together,

317
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,320
it's a good thing for the two tribes.

318
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,320
Phoenix, Nie Pan and Kutong,

319
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,600
heroes are born in the battle.

320
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
Just like the desert under our feet,

321
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,520
one day,

322
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,960
the wild grass will bloom again.

323
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,920
Since we entered Huotu部 to pursue the Ghost Blood,

324
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,440
you've made great efforts

325
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,600
to get rid of the Ghost Blood

326
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,120
and done many good things.

327
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,240
But in the end,

328
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,160
you gave credit to others

329
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,160
and even got yourself sealed.

330
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,760
Is it worth it?

331
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,760
It's not too late.

332
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,320
We should find out

333
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,200
where the Ghost Blood is.

334
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,400
I think

335
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,600
it's important to get the fragments first.

336
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,080
It's been two days.

337
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,000
Why can't I understand

338
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,360
the mystery?

339
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,880
Yu Ji and Mu Zi are still waiting for me.

340
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,200
How can I be so useless?

341
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,440
Yun spatial culture

342
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
I got it.

343
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,440
These movements must be是不是

344
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,440
not for then,

345
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,200
but for winning before.

346
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,480
We need childhood rearing.

347
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,800
but not to lower my heart.

348
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,080
My Lady,

349
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,680
eat something before you practice.

350
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,200
My Lady,

351
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,120
what's wrong?

352
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,360
My Lady,

353
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,520
are you all right?

354
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
I did it.

355
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,240
My Lady.

356
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,960
My Lady.

357
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,800
Yufei,

358
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,360
I'm going to find Yuji and her mother.

359
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
When I find them,

360
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,680
I must take them home.

361
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,160
They will definitely like

362
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,120
Tianji Feng City.

363
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,760
Su Mo was injured.

364
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,560
Maybe Yuji took her to the clinic.

365
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
This is the place.

366
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
This is the place.

367
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,960
This is the last clinic here.

368
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,320
Yufei,

369
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
go in and have a look.

370
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,760
Yes, My Lady.

371
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,880
The Young Minister of Jiuyi Mountain

372
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,240
used his own strength

373
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,000
to conquer the army of Huotu Tribe

374
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,360
and destroyed the land.

375
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,800
He's really something.

376
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,560
He's really something.

377
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,680
I heard about it too.

378
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,000
It's been rumored

379
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,960
that the Young Minister

380
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,360
is actually the former Crown Prince.

381
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,800
The former Crown Prince didn't die.

382
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,000
In my opinion,

383
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,880
he came to Huotu Tribe

384
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,200
to make a contribution.

385
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,240
That's right.

386
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
With this contribution,

387
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,000
he can fight for the throne of the Emperor of Kongsang.

388
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,000
He said that

389
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,320
he was practicing the Taoism in the mountains

390
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,360
and he was as pure as jade.

391
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,120
He couldn't be helped at all.

392
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,040
Yes.

393
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,560
That's right.

394
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,280
These people

395
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,800
are talking nonsense.

396
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,280
My master is a righteous man.

397
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,480
He loves the people.

398
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,880
He won't steal the credit

399
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,160
and take the throne of the Emperor.

400
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,960
He won't seek revenge.

401
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
My Lady, don't be angry.

402
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,480
I'll catch them right now

403
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
and get you some air.

404
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,680
Forget it.

405
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,920
I've caused a lot of trouble

406
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,240
for my master.

407
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,960
If I make another mistake,

408
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,840
I'll be the one who will be disowned.

409
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,800
I'm afraid

410
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,160
I'll cause more trouble

411
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,520
for my master.

412
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,920
Please bear with it.

413
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,200
How is it?

414
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,200
Did you find them?

415
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,560
Yu Jing and her son are not inside.

416
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,440
We've been walking here

417
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,200
and everyone said that

418
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,640
they haven't seen their mother and son.

419
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,120
My Lady, do you think

420
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,880
they've already

421
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,280
returned to Tianji Feng City?

422
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,280
Yu Ji used to come with His Highness

423
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,720
to visit His Highness.

424
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,720
This time, you saved them.

425
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,600
Do you think they'll return to Tianji Feng City

426
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,520
before you arrive?

427
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,560
There's no other way now.

428
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,840
Let's pack up

429
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,400
and return to Tianji Feng City now.

430
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,760
Let's go.

431
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,520
This is the way.

432
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,680
Others don't know who wrote this.

433
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,760
But I know it.

434
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,480
You're really a noble man.

435
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,760
To me,

436
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,120
it's not a wrong thing.

437
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,440
It's just a lot of things.

438
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,440
But

439
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,120
we didn't spread

440
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,120
what you did.

441
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,240
Why did everyone

442
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
know it along the way?

443
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,680
Could it be

444
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,400
your noble man did it too?

445
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,920
It's what you did.

446
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,280
Yes.

447
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,880
Chief Minister wanted to urge you

448
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,960
to return to Jialan.

449
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,720
Let's go.

450
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,240
I'm afraid that His Highness

451
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
knew about the rebellion.

452
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,960
I went down the mountain this time

453
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,360
and stopped the rebellion.

454
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,080
He expected all of this.

455
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,320
Yes.

456
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,520
But you can't be blamed for this.

457
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,760
You're the emperor's blood.

458
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,760
How can you stay at the side

459
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,280
when you encounter a rebellion?

460
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Yes.

461
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,240
After I solve the matter of the ghost blood,

462
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,960
I'll return to Mount Jiuyi immediately.

463
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,360
The ghost blood is just ahead.

464
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,400
Let's go.

465
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,400
Officer Zuoquan.

466
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,080
Officer Zuoquan.

467
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,520
It's been 200 years.

468
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,160
How did you find this place?

469
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,560
It's been 200 years.

470
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,400
The transmission of the Haikou Army

471
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,520
hasn't changed.

472
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,840
I heard you were here.

473
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,040
So I came to check it out.

474
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,880
It seems that the rumors

475
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,560
about the Haikou Army

476
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,080
are true all these years.

477
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,920
It's a misunderstanding, Officer.

478
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,280
It's all a misunderstanding.

479
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,920
You have the oldest

480
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,040
Jiao clan's surname.

481
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,520
The blood of the dragon clan

482
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,880
can be detected

483
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,080
by the dragon blood of the Sea Emperor.

484
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,720
Everyone is looking forward to your return.

485
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,800
By the way, Officer.

486
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,400
Do you have any traces of the Sea Emperor?

487
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,240
No.

488
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,680
Can you detect

489
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,200
if there's any Sea Emperor here?

490
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,800
Let's see

491
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,120
this magic trick.

492
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
The Haikou Army

493
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,440
has been here for a long time.

494
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,520
It's been a long time.

495
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,640
It's been a long time.

496
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
It's been a long time.

497
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,920
It's been a long time.

498
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,040
It's been a long time.

499
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
It's been a long time.

500
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,360
It's been a long time.

501
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,520
It's been a long time.

502
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
It's been a long time.

503
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
It's been a long time.

504
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's been a long time.

505
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,160
It's been a long time.

506
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
It's been a long time.

507
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
It's been a long time.

508
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,640
It's been a long time.

509
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
It's been a long time.

510
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
It's been a long time.

511
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
It's been a long time.

512
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
It's been a long time.

513
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
It's been a long time.

514
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
It's been a long time.

515
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
It's been a long time.

516
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,280
There are no sea kings among them.

517
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,600
Eat some mute medicine for them.

518
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,400
Take their Ningbi Pearl.

519
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Yes.

520
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
Stop.

521
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
You are really doing something that you can't see.

522
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,360
Even the empty-minded people

523
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,040
are doing such a heart-wrenching thing.

524
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,960
You are still killing your own comrades.

525
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
You are still killing your own comrades.

526
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,280
You are still killing your own comrades.

527
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
Your comrades.

528
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,000
Where is your conscience?

529
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Sir.

530
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,000
200 years ago,

531
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,800
you abandoned us first.

532
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,280
You pretended to be dead and stayed in the Chiyin Mansion.

533
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,680
We didn't punish you.

534
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,520
But you came to blame us.

535
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,520
You need to think about revenge and war.

536
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,000
These people have been dead.

537
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,800
Instead of letting them die for nothing,

538
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,840
why don't you make some contribution to us?

539
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,200
The Fu State

540
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,760
is to make all the people

541
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,200
not be bullied

542
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,600
by the Fu State.

543
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,560
Let everyone go.

544
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,160
Since you have spoken,

545
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
let them go.

546
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
Hurry.

547
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
Hurry.

548
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,080
Thank you.

549
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,000
Get up.

550
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Thank you.

551
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,440
People like you

552
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,720
don't deserve to find the sea king with me.

553
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,960
If I see you

554
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,520
killing innocent people again,

555
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,000
I will not forgive you.

556
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,400
Is there any news recently

557
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,800
that the Young Minister of Mount Jiuyi

558
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,640
is killing the people of the Jiao River?

559
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,600
But someone came to explain the rumors.

560
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,000
Someone explained it

561
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,040
and asked someone to do it.

562
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,120
When you kill Tulong Ke,

563
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,640
the Jiao River will be obedient

564
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,640
and will make more contributions.

565
00:32:50,480 --> 00:33:15,200
The social order has been 뭔가

566
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,120
already.

567
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,800
Stop!

568
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,280
Your Highness,

569
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,760
there's a urgent letter from His Highness and Her Highness.

570
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,240
Now,

571
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,880
the Tianji Peak is under the attack of the Navy.

572
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,760
The several roads to the Tianji Peak

573
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,920
are also being disturbed by the Navy.

574
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,920
Please

575
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,440
return to the Tianji Peak

576
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,440
and stay in the Huotu部.

577
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,600
We'll return after we're safe.

578
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,760
The Tianji Peak is under fire.

579
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,080
How can I hide in the Huotu部

580
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,840
when I'm the successor of Mount Jiuyun?

581
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,880
I'm going back to Tianji Peak

582
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,200
to help my parents.

583
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,240
Your Highness,

584
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,560
the war is not a joke.

585
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Please listen to the arrangements of His Highness and Her Highness.

586
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,360
We were going back to the city

587
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,680
to find Yu Ji and Su Mo.

588
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,320
We should go back now.

589
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,520
Prepare the horses for me.

590
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,120
Yes.

591
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,600
Help!

592
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,600
Help!

593
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,320
Help!

594
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,280
Miss.

595
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,360
Your Highness, you're here.

596
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,600
Eunuch Zhang,

597
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,680
can you replace the horses

598
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,000
and help us to get through the night?

599
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,440
The Navy came to the city a few days ago

600
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,040
and took away many of our horses.

601
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:25,880
Now,

602
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,480
there's no more horses to replace.

603
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,560
The Navy is too rampant.

604
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,720
Yes.

605
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,440
They even took the lower city.

606
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,040
The navy is there these days

607
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,440
to check the situation.

608
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,360
The large number of horses

609
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,080
that Her Highness has brought

610
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,160
must be unable to pass.

611
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,200
Why do they want to besiege the lower city?

612
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,000
They're trapped in the lower city

613
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,360
because of the large number of foodstuffs

614
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:45,840
that are used to block the Tianji Peak.

615
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,480
They even dared to take away

616
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,920
my father's foodstuffs.

617
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,200
Fine.

618
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,920
I'll go and remove this nail

619
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,640
to ease the burden of the Tianji Peak.

620
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,200
Your Highness, you can't do that.

621
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,040
Although you have many people,

622
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,720
the Songhun Corps is not strong enough.

623
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,880
It's hard to fight against

624
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,920
the navy that is used to train the navy.

625
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,960
If we get caught,

626
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,720
it'll be a trouble for Prince Chi.

627
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,120
I don't believe in evil.

628
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,680
There must be a way.

629
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,760
Your Highness.

630
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,880
Your Highness.

631
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,520
Master.

632
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
Why are you here?

633
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,960
There's only one way out of Huotu部.

634
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Isn't it normal

635
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,840
to meet you here?

636
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,640
Do you think

637
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,560
I'm trapped in Huotu部?

638
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,760
Master said that

639
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,760
the magic is great.

640
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,400
He asked me to train myself

641
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,200
to get out of the trap.

642
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,880
Now the Tianji Peak is sealed

643
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,160
and the navy is besieging it.

644
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,520
As a daughter,

645
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,520
I'll rush back to help my father

646
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,560
and my father.

647
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,000
I'll go to the lower city

648
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,960
to check the situation.

649
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,120
I'll go to the lower city

650
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,760
to help my father.

651
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,040
Isn't it normal?

652
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,400
Are you going to

653
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,680
set a barrier

654
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,760
to trap me?

655
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,480
Is there any other station nearby?

656
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,600
There's no other station

657
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,960
in the 100 miles of the square.

658
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,040
Chu Ming.

659
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,280
If so,

660
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,680
let's hurry up

661
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,920
and leave.

662
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,880
Master.

663
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,840
Do you really think you're strong?

664
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,480
You're injured

665
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,840
and you want to enter the wild.

666
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,200
No matter what you do,

667
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,280
I have to

668
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,680
take care of my beauty.

669
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,160
I'm going to sleep in the inn.

670
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,320
Master.

671
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,840
Why do you have to

672
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,200
set a barrier to trap me?

673
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,680
I know everything in my heart.

674
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,960
I'll set off tomorrow morning.

675
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,120
Master, don't worry.

676
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,600
Let's have a drink.

677
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,840
Master.

678
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,720
I...

679
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,480
I just followed the magic

680
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,440
and the calligraphy

681
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,920
for a few days.

682
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,440
My power has increased so much.

683
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,560
All right.

684
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,280
I'll take the responsibility.

685
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,880
I'll stay here tonight.

686
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,520
Be careful.

687
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,160
If you say anything else,

688
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,160
she'll find out.

689
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,200
No.

690
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,400
Master and Chu Ming

691
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,800
have traveled thousands of miles.

692
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,480
If there's no barrier,

693
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,560
why did they step on this place?

694
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,320
What happened?

695
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,800
Who is it?

696
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,240
Young Minister.

697
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,600
I'm the maid of the Princess.

698
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,200
I don't know what happened to her.

699
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,640
She suddenly passed out.

700
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,080
Can I ask you to check on her?

701
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,160
I'm sorry.

702
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,360
I felt something wrong yesterday.

703
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,400
Today, I made a mistake.

704
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,920
Master, you're really smart.

705
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,480
How did you get hurt?

706
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,440
Did you get hurt

707
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,520
when you were standing in the big room?

708
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,040
What's this?

709
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,560
It's a piece of gemstone

710
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,880
on the magic circle.

711
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,760
How can it be a piece of gemstone?

712
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,000
There must be something dirty

713
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,480
on it, right?

714
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,760
Since she has found out,

715
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,640
I'll be honest.

716
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,560
The pieces of gemstone

717
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,560
are made of the power of the Demon God

718
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,520
and the power of the Heaven and Earth,

719
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,920
if we don't take them out in time,

720
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
it'll take longer

721
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,640
and harm our body.

722
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,360
What should we do?

723
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,120
I've asked the bird.

724
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,160
There's an old doctor named Xu

725
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,240
in the lower city.

726
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,480
He's specialized in healing

727
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,560
and treating all kinds of diseases.

728
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,440
Okay.

729
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,440
Let's go to the lower city

730
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,680
and find a doctor tomorrow.

731
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,480
You don't have to

732
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,560
take care of this.

733
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,360
You...

734
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,880
How dare you trap me?

735
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,440
You...

736
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,880
You're so bold.

737
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,080
You're so reckless, aren't you?

738
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,080
Didn't you say that

739
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,560
to me before?

740
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,920
Now you've said it back.

741
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,120
If you want to leave,

742
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,440
you can stay here

743
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,400
and take care of yourself.

744
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,160
Then you can get out of the trouble.

745
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,320
Yan is right.

746
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,400
I have something urgent.

747
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,640
Let me go.

748
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
Now,

749
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,000
nothing matters

750
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,960
but my body.

751
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,480
Be good.

752
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,480
We'll take you

753
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,160
to the doctor tomorrow.

754
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,200
Chong Ming.

755
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,600
You can't mess around with Zhu Yan.

756
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,120
Unlock the barrier.

757
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,040
The Sea King of Jiao Ran

758
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,640
has started to act.

759
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,360
He must be angry

760
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,960
and start to act stupidly.

761
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,440
We should act more carefully

762
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,680
and find the Sea King immediately

763
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,920
to find a solution.

764
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,960
All right.

765
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,200
Don't make excuses.

766
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,480
The direction of the turtle's movement

767
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,440
is the same as Zhu Yan's

768
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,960
direction of going back to Tianji.

769
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,880
Besides,

770
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,840
the lower city

771
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,720
has been occupied by the Sea King of Jiao Ran.

772
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,040
The turtle's you're after

773
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,360
is also in the lower city.

774
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,200
You must go to the lower city to chase after it.

775
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,880
It's because there are many

776
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,480
Sea King in the lower city.

777
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,880
If they find out

778
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,640
that I'm the so-called Tulu Ke,

779
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,400
Zhu Yan will be in danger

780
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,080
if I go to the lower city.

781
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,960
Listen to me.

782
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,600
Unlock the barrier.

783
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
But even if I unlock the barrier,

784
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,680
can you escape from

785
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,560
the powerful Gui Gaozuo?

786
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
The one with the best magic

787
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,240
is amazing.

788
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,840
Chong...

789
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,440
Chong Ming.

790
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,640
Master, don't stare at me like that.

791
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,240
It's no use.

792
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,000
This time,

793
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,680
it's different from escaping from the marriage.

794
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,920
Since I can lock you up,

795
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,680
I will

796
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,400
definitely win.

797
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,600
I'm sure.

798
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,600
I'm sure.

799
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,720
I'm sure.

800
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,800
I'm sure.

801
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I'm sure.

802
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,240
I'm sure.

803
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,400
I'm sure.

804
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
I'm sure.

805
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,720
I'm sure.

806
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
I'm sure.

807
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,080
I'm sure.

808
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,280
I'm sure.

809
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
I'm sure.

810
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,640
I'm sure.

811
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,440
There must be a way.

812
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,760
Here.

813
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,040
Take it to get some water.

814
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,960
Thank you.

815
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,760
It's time to take the medicine.

816
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,400
I'm no match for the Gui Gaozuo.

817
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,760
Besides,

818
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,200
as you said before,

819
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,920
everything in the world is a cycle.

820
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,560
You have to return

821
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,240
all the benefits you borrowed.

822
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,760
You will return

823
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,000
all the benefits you had to others.

824
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,520
I dare not interfere.

825
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
I'll get retribution.

826
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:27,760
Yes.

827
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,240
Chong Ming is right.

828
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,400
Here.

829
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,480
Master.

830
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,760
I made the medicine myself.

831
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,400
It needs to be taken three times a day

832
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,360
on time

833
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,880
to get well as soon as possible.

834
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,720
Here.

835
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,800
Why don't you drink it?

836
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,000
You've held it all the way.

837
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,520
How can it open its mouth?

838
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,440
It's getting late.

839
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,200
We can reach the end

840
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,440
half a step ahead.

841
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,080
Master.

842
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,880
You have to persuade him

843
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,080
to cooperate with us.

844
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,400
Then our plan will be implemented.

845
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,440
I see.

846
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,800
I'll do it.

847
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,480
Master.

848
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,120
Let me untie the mirror.

849
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,240
Master.

850
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,720
Excuse me.

851
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,080
I made a mistake.

852
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,080
Master

853
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,000
should have terriiorated me.

854
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,720
Okay.

855
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,480
Okay.

856
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,280
crooked.

857
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,720
He was already scolding me.

858
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,040
I see.

859
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,000
This should describe you in finds.

860
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,800
Could

861
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,800
could

862
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,280
Welt

863
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,360
les

864
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,480
Back

865
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,720
It's bad today.

866
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,880
Let me repeat.

867
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,440
Once more.

868
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,960
Eh,

869
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,080
Da xingук

870
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,240
It's the other way round.

871
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,400
What are you talking about?

872
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,880
You want me.

873
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,200
What's going on?

874
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,040
You actually repeated a small spell

875
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,120
three times.

876
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,560
I'm sorry.

877
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,040
I've hurt you three times.

878
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,800
Master, how about this?

879
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,720
I'll untie the spell for you.

880
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,200
It'll make you feel better.

881
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,800
I swear

882
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,320
I'll make it this time.

883
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:25,760
No.

884
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,840
Long신을

885
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,360
opinions.

886
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,160
Sitting on the ground,

887
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,920
standing alone

888
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,600
and sitting like this.

889
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,440
Wait,

890
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,320
I'm sorry.

891
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,120
I'm sorry.

892
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:56,880
I'm sorry.

893
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,720
I'm sorry.

894
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,480
I'm sorry.

895
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,480
I'm sorry.

896
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,480
I'm sorry.

897
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,480
I'm sorry.

898
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,480
I'm sorry.

899
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,480
I'm sorry.

900
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,480
I'm sorry.

901
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,480
I'm sorry.

902
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,480
I'm sorry.

903
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,480
I'm sorry.

904
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,480
I'm sorry.

905
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,480
I'm sorry.

906
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,480
I'm sorry.

907
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,480
I'm sorry.

908
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,480
I'm sorry.

909
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,480
I'm sorry.

910
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,480
I'm sorry.

911
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,480
I'm sorry.

912
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,480
I'm sorry.

913
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,480
I'm sorry.

914
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,480
I'm sorry.

915
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,480
I'm sorry.

916
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,480
I'm sorry.

917
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,480
I'm sorry.

918
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,480
I'm sorry.

919
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,480
I'm sorry.

920
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,480
I'm sorry.

921
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,480
I'm sorry.

922
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,480
I'm sorry.

923
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,480
I'm sorry.

924
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,480
I'm sorry.

925
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,480
I'm sorry.

926
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,480
I'm sorry.

927
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,480
I'm sorry.

928
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,480
I'm sorry.

929
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,480
I'm sorry.

930
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,480
I'm sorry.

931
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,480
I'm sorry.

932
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,480
I'm sorry.

933
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,480
I'm sorry.

934
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,480
I'm sorry.

935
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,480
I'm sorry.

936
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,480
I'm sorry.

937
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,480
I'm sorry.

938
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,480
I'm sorry.

939
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,480
I'm sorry.

940
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,480
I'm sorry.

941
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,480
I'm sorry.

942
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,480
I'm sorry.

943
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,480
I'm sorry.

944
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,480
I'm sorry.

945
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,480
I'm sorry.

946
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,480
I'm sorry.

947
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,480
I'm sorry.

948
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,480
I'm sorry.

949
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,480
I'm sorry.

950
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,480
I'm sorry.

951
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
I'm sorry.

952
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,480
