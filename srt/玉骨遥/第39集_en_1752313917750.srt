00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000

I'm sorry.

63
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,520
It's just a misunderstanding.

89
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,700
Did he shock the world with Lord Ping Ting's wives?

90
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,860
You put this letter here for Lord Ping Ting?

91
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,180
Reading!

92
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,280
How could you do this?

93
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,720
I need to call my master.

94
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,120
Your Highness,

95
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,440
I should leave, too.

96
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,120
I'm with you.

97
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,760
I took off my robe

98
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,720
to be with you.

99
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,280
No.

100
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,920
You can't.

101
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,760
Why not?

102
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,000
Because I killed Zhiyuan.

103
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,400
No.

104
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,440
Yuan told me that

105
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
he didn't blame you,

106
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,240
and he didn't want me to blame you.

107
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,280
I said those words

108
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,160
just to let you

109
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,680
save his life.

110
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,280
Your Highness,

111
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,880
I don't know

112
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
if I should

113
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,080
kill Zhiyuan or not.

114
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,320
I didn't even

115
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,400
notice

116
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,200
your feelings for me.

117
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,080
So,

118
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,880
you did it for the fate.

119
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm worried

120
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,880
that I might do something stupid.

121
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,440
I just don't know

122
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,080
if there is anything I should do.

123
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,360
You should beat him.

124
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,560
And kill him.

125
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,880
You should.

126
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:18,960
You 의.

127
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,200
Look,

128
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,600
I am just a normal person

129
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,080
standing here at front of you.

130
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,720
If you really kill me,

131
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,920
you actually

132
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,880
bring me back to human world.

133
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,480
Besides,

134
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,120
I always accept you

135
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,960
just as the burning lights from the darkness of night.

136
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,320
I died long ago in Heaven.

137
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,680
Just like how I was consumed

138
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,720
by the Taoism,

139
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,080
because of you

140
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,640
I was brought back to life.

141
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,280
That makes for

142
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,880
something that cannot be changed.

143
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,560
But

144
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,560
that was just a speculation,

145
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,480
not a flare.

146
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,420
Not in army.

147
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,600
Yan.

148
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,960
Is that enough?

149
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,920
With the noble people,

150
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,420
we'll live long.

151
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,740
How did he get things like this?

152
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,760
He left this in the 25th of September.

153
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,640
Eleven years ago

154
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,800
11 years ago

155
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,520
the night fallen on Da lazy.

156
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,580
His family is very poor now.

157
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,440
I only hope that he could GT back soon.

158
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,400
It would be good for us to live in peace.

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,280
Yuan.

160
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,400
innych.

161
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Don't worry about it.

162
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,040
Yuan.

163
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,880
This baby is a princess.

164
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,800
Go.

165
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:32,020
if you find he wasASaL intersected in the

166
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,100
This is called eager for trouble.

167
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,900
Never say no but no.

168
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,340
To the centaurs that can rebuild their horses from scratch.

169
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,480
I have thought

170
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,360
this movement is over

171
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:55,280
Beggars anywhere

172
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,900
Since the stranger now termsift.

173
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,060
So it's dangerous to be alone in the brackets.

174
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,820
I hope you can forgive me for my misdeed.

175
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,980
Your Highness,

176
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,140
although you're in the red dust,

177
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,220
no matter what happens in the future,

178
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,540
I'm willing to be your sword

179
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,620
and shield.

180
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,780
If you have any request,

181
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,260
I'll be there to answer it.

182
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,820
Now that I've taken off my robe

183
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,300
and walked through hell,

184
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,980
I have no face left

185
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,340
to disturb you

186
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,180
and the peace in the mountain.

187
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,940
I swear to protect Yunhuang

188
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,340
for the rest of my life.

189
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,780
I won't let you down.

190
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,020
Please be careful on your way.

191
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,220
Elders,

192
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,140
take care.

193
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,480
Então Currently

194
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,020
Then let me help you.

195
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,020
I'm not an brains teacher,

196
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,180
It's not easy to practice with me.

197
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,860
I'm not afraid of hardship.

198
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,740
You'll be lonely.

199
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,180
No.

200
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,260
There used to be only dead people in the valley.

201
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,500
Master would be lonely by himself.

202
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,020
But from now on,

203
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,140
I'll be with you forever.

204
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,180
Too many things have happened here.

205
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,820
The most important thing

206
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,220
is that you take me as your disciple

207
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,620
in Qingxiu Hall.

208
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,620
This is the most correct decision

209
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,580
I've ever made in my life.

210
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,300
It's also the luckiest thing

211
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,820
I've ever had in my life.

212
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,200
I want to

213
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,960
do everything all alone.

214
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,380
Chong Ming,

215
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,060
what's your plan?

216
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,460
Are you willing

217
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,100
to go with us?

218
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,580
No.

219
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,500
As theектор of the Mountain of 그리고,

220
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,580
I'm amigo of the gods and fairies.

221
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,780
I must be sure

222
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,700
that we can leave each other

223
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,060
and eliminate them as a companion.

224
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,420
I'm not a casual bird.

225
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,540
Little Spider.

226
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,940
You're leaving tomorrow, right?

227
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,660
After you leave the mountain,

228
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,940
you must treat Xiao Ying well.

229
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,060
Do you understand?

230
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,220
Won't you come with us?

231
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,420
I knew from the first time I saw you

232
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,660
that you would take Xiao Ying

233
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,420
from me

234
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,500
when you were young.

235
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,660
But she's happy now.

236
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,140
My wish has been

237
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,380
fulfilled.

238
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,180
Why are you crying?

239
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,900
From now on,

240
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,300
if you dare to let Xiao Ying

241
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,460
lose a hair,

242
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,620
I will

243
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,100
fly to Tianji and Fengcheng

244
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,980
to settle your score.

245
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,340
Do you hear me?

246
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,780
It's a deal.

247
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,900
You must take care of yourself.

248
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,780
We will miss you.

249
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,940
What are you talking about?

250
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,900
I will always be your friend.

251
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,220
If you need anything,

252
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,460
remember to come to me.

253
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,700
By the way,

254
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,300
don't tell Xiao Ying

255
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,900
about my crying.

256
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,140
It's embarrassing.

257
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,900
You must leave the mountain happily.

258
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,340
Don't tell Xiao Ying that I cried.

259
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,860
You're the most beautiful fairy bird I know.

260
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,740
We will miss you.

261
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,780
Chong Ming.

262
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,620
You've been bothering me for so long.

263
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,180
I've been looking at your face

264
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,140
for years.

265
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,260
I'm tired of it.

266
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,380
Besides,

267
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,500
you always disobey me

268
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,140
and don't care about your health.

269
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,860
I'm like an old woman.

270
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,700
I keep talking about you

271
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,020
and I'm getting too many wrinkles.

272
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,620
Go down the mountain.

273
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,740
I've been...

274
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,380
Alright.

275
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,620
You're a man.

276
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,660
Don't be so nosy.

277
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,180
I'm leaving.

278
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,060
Don't miss me anymore.

279
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,060
I'm leaving.

280
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,740
Shi Yi.

281
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,460
Are you really leaving with nothing?

282
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,820
When I came to Mount Jiuyi,

283
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,060
there was nothing.

284
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,380
When I left Mount Jiuyi,

285
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,780
I felt empty.

286
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,140
Mount Jiuyi

287
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,380
can bring you to me

288
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,820
and go back to Hong Chen with you.

289
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,980
I'm satisfied.

290
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,420
After the Yin Qi enters the body,

291
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,940
within nine days,

292
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,260
it should correspond to the spiritual power of the five elements

293
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,380
and the magical weapons

294
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,940
to protect the heart and pulse

295
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,140
and keep the sense.

296
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,340
Yi'er.

297
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,580
Nine days have passed.

298
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,180
I can't find a way to do it.

299
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,820
It's okay, Mr. Shi.

300
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,860
I'll find a way.

301
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,860
I'll find a way.

302
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,860
I'll find a way.

303
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,860
I'll find a way.

304
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,860
I'll find a way.

305
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,860
I'll find a way.

306
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,860
I'll find a way.

307
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,860
I'll find a way.

308
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,860
I'll find a way.

309
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,860
It's okay.

310
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,180
I'm used to it now.

311
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,380
If you miss the best time,

312
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,780
you can only see

313
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,980
the will and fortune of the one who is locked by Yin Qi.

314
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,380
What you know is beyond the sky.

315
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,540
What you wish for

316
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,860
will come true.

317
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,980
What does it mean?

318
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,500
If I guess it right,

319
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,500
it should mean the strongest wish in your heart

320
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,420
to break the barrier of Yin Qi.

321
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,980
The strongest wish?

322
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,980
It's not true.

323
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,220
No wonder

324
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,580
I felt something

325
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,060
when we were in the woods that day.

326
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,500
That day and me?

327
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,620
Do you have any other wishes?

328
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,300
I mean

329
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,660
maybe we can use the same method

330
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,420
to help you find your sense of taste and touch.

331
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,860
I don't think

332
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,100
I have any other wishes.

333
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,860
I'm not saying I want to

334
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,420
be with you.

335
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,380
No, no.

336
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,140
I'm not saying I'm thinking about it.

337
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,100
Then what do you think most?

338
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,220
I...

339
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,420
Yan Er.

340
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,700
What you think

341
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,020
is also what I want.

342
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,120
Senior Earth

343
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,260
Yan Er.

344
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,180
Trust me,

345
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,060
I will help you find your feelings.

346
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,060
I will be all right.

347
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,140
I...

348
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,420
I'm thinking of going back to Tianji Feng City

349
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,860
to see my parents.

350
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,860
They must be worried.

351
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,140
Maybe

352
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,580
I'll have a meal with Yan Feng Long

353
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,420
and catch some meat.

354
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,580
I'll smell the fresh sand

355
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,180
and I'll be relieved.

356
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,220
Bai Feng Lin.

357
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,820
You colluded with the Jiao people

358
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,140
and spread military news.

359
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,940
What else do you have to say?

360
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,140
I know my crime.

361
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,500
Bai Feng Lin colluded with the enemy to sell the country.

362
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,380
He is unforgivable.

363
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,300
He was imprisoned and executed after the fall.

364
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,900
Bai Jing An took the throne and was demoted to a commoner.

365
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,060
Bai Xue Lu.

366
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,100
Your Majesty.

367
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,740
Xue Lu is the wife of the Qing and Wei families.

368
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,700
Although she is Bai Feng Lin's sister,

369
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,620
she is no longer her.

370
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,140
If she is involved in this,

371
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,660
I'm willing to take the punishment.

372
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,100
I'm willing to take the punishment.

373
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,540
Take the punishment?

374
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,100
Are you willing to demote her

375
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,140
and put her in jail?

376
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,140
Yes.

377
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,820
I'm willing to take the punishment

378
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,940
for any punishment.

379
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,900
Good.

380
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,180
I helpful you.

381
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,140
Bai Xue Lu,

382
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,540
you bowed politely and didn't go against the culture.

383
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:36,560
I will

384
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,940
Thank you for your kindness.

385
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,740
I have a request.

386
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,420
Tell me.

387
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,420
I want to take my mother's memorial tablet

388
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,980
to Prince Bai's Mansion.

389
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,300
Okay.

390
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,020
I agree.

391
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,620
You may rise.

392
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

393
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,420
Your Majesty.

394
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,100
I want to bring you

395
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,860
to justice for all dynasties.

396
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,300
I because of campus for mitzvah

397
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:33,120
and

398
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,020
I also want to ruin yourself

399
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,440
and even bring the split-brain

400
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,680
Princess Zhu Yan

401
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,480
committed a crime against the nine clans of the Zhu Lian clan.

402
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,400
During the war,

403
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,480
I asked the painting of Hai Huang

404
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,120
from the Fulu of the Haiguo Army.

405
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,720
I've sent someone to Tianji City

406
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
to confirm his identity.

407
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Hai Huang

408
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,480
is the housekeeper of the Chis.

409
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,440
He hid in the Chis

410
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,840
200 years ago

411
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,840
and had a close relationship with Princess Zhu Yan.

412
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,160
No one in the West Kingdom knew about it.

413
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,560
There are evidence and evidence.

414
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,760
I hope Your Majesty can investigate

415
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,720
the relationship between the Haiguo Army and the Chis.

416
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,980
tensioned by it.

417
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,840
Master, come on.

418
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,320
Yan'er, look.

419
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,760
Yan'er.

420
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,440
Why are you so thin?

421
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,440
Here.

422
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,240
This is your favorite, milk tofu.

423
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Eat more.

424
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,160
Thank you, mother.

425
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,920
Thank you, mother.

426
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,960
It's so delicious.

427
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,000
Mother, you made this, right?

428
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,680
It's the best dish in the family.

429
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,000
I hope I can always be by your side

430
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,320
and eat your food.

431
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,160
Silly girl.

432
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,360
It's the best dish in the family.

433
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,840
Xinmei, brother pigs are more or less the same.

434
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,600
Hurry up, add the milk.

435
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,360
Right, two cups.

436
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,120
First, the whey is milk vocals,

437
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:02,660
then I add ну

438
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,560
Do it slowly with me

439
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,080
and let the routes increase.

440
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:26,440
Your Highness balm дог

441
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Maybe you should go find more tea

442
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,880
If you can'tGap interception

443
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,440
I will order

444
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,360
Yan'er, what are you doing?

445
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,000
Yan'er, you're being ridiculous.

446
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,800
I apologize on behalf of my daughter.

447
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,040
How honorable you are!

448
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,360
How dare you call her by her name

449
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,880
and steal her wine!

450
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,080
You're so rude!

451
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,360
Prince Zhi, please sit.

452
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,960
I'm glad that Yan'er is willing to help me out.

453
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,360
Why are you being rude?

454
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,240
Sit.

455
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,240
Yan'er and I are in love.

456
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,640
We share our life and death.

457
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,240
Actually, I've prepared a wedding gift

458
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,600
according to the custom of the Chis.

459
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,200
Prince Zhi, please

460
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,720
marry Yan'er to me.

461
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,200
I'm willing to.

462
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,320
I'm willing to.

463
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,120
Your Highness, Yan'er is willful.

464
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,160
We've been too strict on her.

465
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,120
If there's anything wrong with her,

466
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,280
just let us know.

467
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,720
We'll discipline her

468
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,960
and make her change everything before the wedding.

469
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,080
Father.

470
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,920
I'm fine.

471
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,440
No need to change anything.

472
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,800
He's been against

473
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,840
our engagement to him.

474
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,240
As his mother,

475
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,320
I have a guess.

476
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,520
I'm sure he has

477
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,400
someone in his heart who is deeply in love with him.

478
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,080
I didn't expect that he's

479
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,760
the Prince.

480
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,800
But you're hasn't changed a bit.

481
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,640
maan

482
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,240
As parents,

483
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,440
we want to

484
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,040
keep Yan'er in our heart,

485
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,880
safe and happy.

486
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,400
We're willing to entrust

487
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,640
Yan'er to you.

488
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,960
May you seconds to her

489
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,760
and온in as well.

490
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,960
I'm willing to be like theries

491
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,320
with Yan'er.

492
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,920
I will never leave you.

493
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,720
I'm willing to be with you

494
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,640
like the two stars in the sky.

495
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,680
I will never leave you.

496
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Never.

497
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,760
Never.

498
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,840
Prince.

499
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,360
Couldn't you have told

500
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,680
His Majesty

501
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,120
about our wedding.

502
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,680
As long as you nod,

503
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,880
nobody in this family

504
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,000
could haveasi Nice to be with us.

505
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,400
You're not aware

506
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,640
what our wedding banquet

507
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,040
will be like?

508
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,120
Your Highness,

509
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,960
the Electric Central Hall

510
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
and the Imperial dissemination house

511
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,160
I will help you realize

512
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,160
as long as you like it.

513
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,920
Then I will invite

514
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,600
all the people in Tianji Feng City

515
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
to come for a drink.

516
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,040
After all,

517
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,440
they watched me grow up.

518
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:05,880
Okay.

519
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,800
I will invite

520
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,720
Xue Ying,

521
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,880
Shi Yu,

522
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,000
Qing Gang,

523
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,000
and Xue Lu.

524
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,600
They probably didn't expect

525
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,800
that we would get married

526
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,160
before they did.

527
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,160
They are not that slow.

528
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,960
I will invite them

529
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,680
to have a drink.

530
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,080
They are not that slow.

531
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,640
We won't wait for them.

532
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,040
I will go to Yan Feng House

533
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,120
to discuss with Master Wu

534
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,520
the new recipe for you.

535
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,600
He has been hiding the 20-year-old female red

536
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,880
and should have taken it out.

537
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,840
Thank you for saving Su Mo.

538
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,360
Please tell me

539
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,160
when Su Mo will wake up.

540
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,040
This child

541
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,600
is the one you are waiting for.

542
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,600
But it's not time for him to wake up yet.

543
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,240
When he returns to the Biro Sea,

544
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,160
I will enter the long Zhe Fu

545
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,320
and wait for him to wake up after 70 years.

546
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,480
The beauty returns to the form of a dragon.

547
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,600
The dragon is awake and the Biro is light.

548
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,680
It's a pity

549
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,480
that it's not time for the family's destiny to be revealed.

550
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,480
Yuan.

551
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,040
I finally got happiness.

552
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,960
You will bless me,

553
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,880
right?

554
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,680
Yuan.

555
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,080
Did you hear my voice

556
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,480
and send me blessings?

557
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,440
I'm sorry.

558
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,520
Why is the Ghost Blood Star rising again?

559
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,560
Is the Biro still alive?

560
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,560
Although the army of the Biro is in chaos,

561
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,960
you are the Biro

562
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,680
they have been waiting for for 70 years.

563
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,160
The Jiao people are obedient to you.

564
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,000
As long as you are determined,

565
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,600
you can't do anything.

566
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,080
Unless you are not the Biro at all.

567
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,600
Is Zhiyuan really not the Biro?

568
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,160
She is just trying to protect

569
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,480
the real Jiao people.

570
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,000
Yuan.

571
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,440
Get out of the way, all of you.

572
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,760
Put him down.

573
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
The Biro

574
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
is a family of the Biro.

575
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,320
They are ungrateful and are disloyal.

576
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,720
They have been colluding with the Jiao people for hundreds of years.

577
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,880
The Imperial Army of the Biro

578
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,840
has hidden the imperial decree in the mansion.

579
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,640
They are treasonous and guilty.

580
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,160
You can't count them.

581
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,720
In the will of Zhao Yun Du,

582
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,640
the Biro's criminal, Zhu Gao Zhao,

583
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,840
the daughter of Zhu Yan,

584
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,280
colluded with the empty army of the Biro

585
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,200
to kill the Jiao people.

586
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,880
It's ourilla because sesi

587
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,440
has already這樣子 brought his father

588
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,080
back on peace and home.

589
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,720
Serves him right.

590
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,600
A son is trapped by his father.

591
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,120
Zhiyuan scenes g manages the family

592
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,760
but no one from his clan

593
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,560
knows he is the maternal son of Leng Yi chester Documentestacy.

594
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,880
She was鏗t破 st GRM

595
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,840
and the Jiao Clan.

596
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,280
As for Zhao Yun Du,

597
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,800
I was the one who did it.

598
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,560
It has nothing to do with the Chis.

599
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,160
If Zhiyuan is really the Emperor of the Sea,

600
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,160
I'm the King of Chis. I can't blame myself.

601
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,040
Zhu Yan is young and ignorant.

602
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,760
He's blinded by the evil.

603
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,200
I'll take all the blame.

604
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,440
Father.

605
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,840
What a father-son relationship.

606
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,000
It's a pity that

607
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,080
this is a big crime of the Ten Clans.

608
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,200
The Emperor's decree clearly states

609
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,400
that you must take the post of the King of Chis.

610
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,280
Guards.

611
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,160
Yes.

612
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Take him down.

613
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,720
Ying.

614
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,480
Stop.

615
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,760
Your Highness.

616
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,960
Your Highness, why are you here?

617
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,200
You have no right to take the Emperor to the capital

618
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,280
and make a punishment for them.

619
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,160
If we go to Jialan,

620
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,120
they can't lose a hair.

621
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,920
Yes.

622
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,680
Your Highness.

623
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,000
Your Highness, please get up.

624
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,560
Yan.

625
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,920
Yan.

626
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,520
I'll take the Emperor to the capital.

627
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,120
Wait for me.

628
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,800
Yan.

629
00:31:36,240 --> 00:32:03,140
Directly lead the Emperor-to-heal

630
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,920
I've already taken Bai Wang as my successor.

631
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
I will take over Xiaoqi Camp from now on.

632
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
Please give me your blessing.

633
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Please bless my daughter.

634
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,640
Your Majesty.

635
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,800
Ying'er, let me take a good look at you.

636
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
You're finally back.

637
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
I've let you down.

638
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,680
I've let your mother down.

639
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,400
Your Majesty, I came here to discuss the matter of the Chifu family.

640
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,800
You wronged me and my mother back then.

641
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,000
Don't interrupt the Chifu family matter today.

642
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I know that you're not going to let me go.

643
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You know it.

644
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
How could I not know that Princess Chizu is your new lover?

645
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You're willing to go to hell for her.

646
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But the Chifu family colluded with the Sea Emperor.

647
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
There are many rumors in the court.

648
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
The evidence is like a mountain.

649
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I can forgive you.

650
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But I can't let go of Chizu family.

651
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Ying'er, I promise you.

652
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I promise you.

653
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I can spare Zhu Yan's life.

654
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Your Majesty.

655
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Do you think everyone is like you?

656
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You judge a matter by your feelings.

657
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
If so, Zhu Yan doesn't have to stop.

658
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
With his current power,

659
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
he can take the whole Chifu family away.

660
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Not to mention the prison.

661
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
There are few people in the whole Yunhuang.

662
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
They are his opponents.

663
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
The leader of the Jiao people in the Night City, Zhiyuan,

664
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
he was a steward in Chifu family.

665
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But he went back to the Jiao family after leaving Chifu family.

666
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Zhiyuan has been trying to pacify the war between the Kongsang Army and the Sea King.

667
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
He signed the ceasefire agreement with me.

668
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
In the end, he even risked his life to exchange for peace.

669
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Ying'er, it's all your words.

670
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's hard to convince everyone.

671
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Not to mention, you and Zhu Yan have a very close relationship.

672
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I am guilty.

673
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But I am willing to risk my life to make a guarantee.

674
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I only want half a month.

675
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Your Highness, Princess Zhu Yan is here.

676
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Ying'er.

677
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You suffered.

678
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's okay.

679
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
A'Yuan is the matter of the Sea King.

680
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I will explain it to His Majesty personally.

681
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
If he must be punished,

682
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I will bear the responsibility.

683
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
The star sea is the first night of the cloud.

684
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Zhiyuan is determined to use her body to get the night.

685
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I will wait for her.

686
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I will wait for her.

687
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I understand.

688
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You are the guardians of the Kongsang and the Sea Kingdom.

689
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
This is your responsibility.

690
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I was too simple at that time.

691
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But Zhiyuan is not the Sea King at all.

692
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I am not the Sea King.

693
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I am the King of the Sea.

694
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I am the King of the Sea.

695
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Zhiyuan is not the Sea King.

696
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Look.

697
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
The blood letter appears again.

698
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But I killed an innocent person.

699
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
A'Yuan is not the Sea King.

700
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
There are other people in the Sea King.

701
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
But you have no power now.

702
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I will not chase after the Sea King anymore.

703
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Even a person's life

704
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
will be controlled by countless forces.

705
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Not to mention

706
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
it is the fate of a country.

707
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Yan'er.

708
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
In the prophecy,

709
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
you are my destiny.

710
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But in the end,

711
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
you saved me.

712
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It can be seen that everything is in the hands of people.

713
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Not bad.

714
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Since we can change the destiny once,

715
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
we can change it countless times.

716
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
With you by my side,

717
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I am not afraid of anything.

718
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I don't believe

719
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
that Kong San and the Sea Kingdom

720
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
will not be able to do anything.

721
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Zhiyuan risked her life to protect that person.

722
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
She must not be

723
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
the devil who caused Kong San to bleed.

724
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yan'er.

725
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I asked the Emperor for half a month.

726
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Let's go to the Cangwu Abyss

727
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
to see Dragon God.

728
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Maybe Dragon God can help us.

729
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Okay.

730
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The future of the world is in my hands.

731
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Why do you destroy the world?

732
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I can use the power of the Qingbi

733
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
to restore the world

734
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and the world will be destroyed.

735
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Since I will lead you

736
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
to the land of destruction,

737
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I will give you the new life.

738
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
We will follow the land to the end of life.

739
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I will never regret in this life.

740
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I will never regret in this life.

741
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I will never regret in this life.

742
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
The sea of death,

743
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
the bloodless and the unruly,

744
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
the bloodless and the unruly,

745
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
the bloodless and the unruly.

746
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Your Majesty,

747
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
is there any mistake?

748
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
The Dragon God's Seal.

749
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
This is the Dragon God's Seal.

750
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You are so useless.

751
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The Emperor of the White Blood

752
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
is holding the Dragon God's Seal in his hand.

753
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
How dare you use the Dragon God's Seal on the Gou Mountain?

754
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Your Majesty, what should we do?

755
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Now,

756
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
we need the blood of the Sea Emperor

757
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
to break the Dragon God's Seal.

758
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I will never give up on destroying the land of destruction.

759
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I thought the Sea Emperor was dead,

760
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
but I never thought that seven thousand years ago,

761
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
the Sea Emperor would be buried in the river.

762
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Look.

763
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
The Ghost Blood Star came to tell me

764
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
where the Sea Emperor is.

765
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
No one can stop me from destroying the land of destruction.

766
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

767
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Dragon God,

768
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
the Emperor of the Black Blood is here.

769
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm afraid that you will be late.

770
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I'm sorry.

771
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm sorry.

772
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I'm sorry.

773
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm sorry.

774
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I'm sorry.

775
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm sorry.

776
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I'm sorry.

777
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm sorry.

778
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm sorry.

779
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm sorry.

780
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm sorry.

781
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
The Sea Emperor is threatening us.

782
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Maybe after 70 years,

783
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
they will still go to the King of the Night.

784
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Dragon God,

785
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
we are not here to find out the truth about the Sea Emperor.

786
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
The mistake of killing Zhiyuan

787
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
made me understand that

788
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
the prophecy is just a trap in people's hearts.

789
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
We can't decide the fate of a country at all.

790
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
If the king is safe,

791
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
the state is peaceful,

792
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
then no one can take advantage of the situation.

793
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
If the king is in a panic,

794
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
the people will not be healed.

795
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Even if it's not the Sea Emperor,

796
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
other people will do it.

797
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm not here for the Sea Emperor.

798
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
What do you want?

799
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Dragon God,

800
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
everything in this world

801
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
can't escape your eyes.

802
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Everything that Yuan

803
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
has done for the Jiao Clan,

804
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
you already know.

805
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Now, he is accused of

806
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
killing the Empty Sang Clan.

807
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
No matter it's Yuan or the Empty Sang Clan,

808
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
they shouldn't be framed like this.

809
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I beg you to tell the truth.

810
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You came to ask me to save the lives of the Empty Sang Clan.

811
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Seven thousand years ago,

812
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
the Empress of Baiwei ran away for the sake of the Sea Empire,

813
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
and stopped the destruction of the Jiao Clan.

814
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Two hundred years ago,

815
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
the bandits of the Jiao Clan

816
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
stood in the battle for their beloved

817
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
to restore the peace of the two clans.

818
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
A month ago,

819
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Zhiyuan and Yan

820
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
were framed again and again,

821
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
so that the two clans were not at odds.

822
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The clouds and mountains were covered with the clouds,

823
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
and the people were in danger.

824
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Everything had a soul.

825
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
For thousands of years,

826
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
the Empty Sang Clan and the Jiao Clan were friends.

827
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
They were not separated from each other.

828
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So,

829
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I beg you to tell the world

830
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
that Zhiyuan and the Chis

831
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
are innocent.

832
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Why didn't you let Zhiyuan

833
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
tell the truth?

834
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Zhiyuan is not dead yet.

835
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
How is that possible?

836
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It was me in the Star Sea Cloud Hall that day.

837
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Zhiyuan is not dead yet.

838
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
How is that possible?

839
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
There is still room for him in the sea.

840
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So,

841
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I planted the dragon seed

842
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
on him long ago.

843
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Zhiyuan.

844
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So,

845
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Zhiyuan was hurt

846
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,900
by the

847
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yunting.

848
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
But he was not only

849
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
destroyed by the dragon seed,

850
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
but also

851
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
trapped in a safe place.

852
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Where is he now?

853
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
The Jieling Han Xu Xieling

854
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
is the Empty Sang Clan

855
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
that he has been thinking about for years.

856
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
The one who can wake him up

857
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
is you.

858
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
The Jieling Han Xu Xieling

859
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Use the magic I taught you

860
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
to break his seal.

861
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I will use my power

862
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
to bring him back to life.

863
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Did I succeed?

864
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Yuan.

865
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yuan.

866
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I am not dead yet.

867
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I am not dead yet.

868
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I am not dead yet.

869
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I am not dead yet.

870
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yuan.

871
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Xiao Yi.

872
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Did we meet in the heaven?

873
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
No.

874
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Yuan, you are not dead yet.

875
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Shao Simian.

876
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Shao Simian.

877
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I have returned to the Chen clan long ago.

878
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I am not the Shao Simian anymore.

879
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Shi Ying.

880
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Princess.

881
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Congratulations on your friendship.

882
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But Shi Ying.

883
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Why did you let me go?

884
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The Dragon God

885
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
planted the dragon seed

886
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
on you and protected you.

887
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
He also told us

888
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
that you were here.

889
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And you shouldn't have died.

890
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
The real King of Sea

891
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
is someone else.

892
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Isn't it?

893
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yuan.

894
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Don't worry.

895
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Shi Ying didn't plan

896
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
to kill the King of Sea.

897
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
After the life and death

898
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
we have seen the prophecy.

899
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It's in the human's hands.

900
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Nothing in the world

901
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
can be reversed.

902
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
You really want to let the King of Sea go?

903
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
You want to escape?

904
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I will kill you,

905
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
the King of Sea.

906
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Don't hurt the child.

907
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
So the King of Sea

908
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
is really the child

909
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
you held in the Night City.

910
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
He was unconscious

911
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
and lost his life.

912
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
He was unconscious

913
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
and lost his mother.

914
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
He was unconscious

915
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
and lost his mother.

916
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Su Mo.

917
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's Su Mo, right?

918
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So that child is Su Mo.

919
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Yan.

920
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Think about it.

921
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
That child is not a normal person.

922
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
That's right.

923
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
He can be one with

924
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
the dragon blood of A Yuan Sun Wu.

925
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Su Mo.

926
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So Su Mo is the King of Sea.

927
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Let's go find Su Mo immediately.

928
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Actually, he has been hiding

929
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
near the Cang Wu Abyss.

930
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Shi Ying.

931
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Didn't you say that you don't believe

932
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
the prophecy anymore?

933
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I won't hurt anyone

934
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
because of that prophecy.

935
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But that child is very important

936
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
to you,

937
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Yan,

938
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Jiao, and the people of Kong Sang.

939
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I want to see him

940
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
return to the Bilo Sea.

941
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You're right.

942
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Even if you let him go,

943
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
but the people of the heart found

944
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
that the turtle's feet were re-created

945
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
and the sea was still in Kong Sang.

946
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
It's going to be another

947
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
bloody battle.

948
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So, the dragon god

949
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
is going to be the king of the sea.

950
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I want to help the King of Sea.

951
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
This is related to Su Mo.

952
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
What day is it today?

953
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Today is the day of the full moon.

954
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Let's go back to the Red Whale Lake.

955
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Otherwise, it will be too late.

956
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Ruyi.

957
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Sir.

958
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Are you all right?

959
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
You came to pick us up.

960
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Su Mo.

961
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Sir.

962
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Why did you bring two people from Kong Sang

963
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
here?

964
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm afraid that

965
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
they are not here.

966
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I'm afraid that

967
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
they will find us.

968
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Ruyi.

969
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Do you recognize me?

970
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I'm Zhu Yan.

971
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I'm not a

972
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
big person.

973
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I'm yours.

974
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Princess.

975
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I will explain to Ruyi later.

976
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Shi Ying.

977
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Is there a way to let Su Mo

978
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
regain his mind?

979
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
What he's hit

980
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
is the dream-changer.

981
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
He can't sleep.

982
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Zhiyuan.

983
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
You are a dragon blood-sucking branch.

984
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
You can help him to wake up.

985
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
At the same time, Yan'er will protect his heart.

986
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Su Mo should be able to wake up.

987
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
He won't be rebelled.

988
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Great.

989
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Su Mo is finally saved.

990
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
But

991
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
he has been hit for too long.

992
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Plus, we don't know the details

993
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
of the dream-changer.

994
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
The dark history of the County Elder is deeply rooted in him.

995
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I'm afraid that we can't

996
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
get rid of it together.

997
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
If we are too excited,

998
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
we can't help but to do it.

999
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
As long as Su Mo can wake up,

1000
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Ruyi and I will teach him

1001
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and encourage him.

1002
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
He will be fine.

1003
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
It's me.

1004
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Zhiyuan, you should help him to wake up.

1005
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yan'er, remember to keep your promise.

1006
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Okay.

1007
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I will remember it.

1008
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yan'er.

1009
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I...

1010
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Su Mo.

1011
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Uncle Yan.

1012
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Uncle Yan.

1013
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Yan'er.

1014
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Yan'er.

1015
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Yan'er.

1016
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Yan'er.

1017
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Yan'er.

1018
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Where am I?

1019
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Su Mo.

1020
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Sister?

1021
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Su Mo.

1022
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
No.

1023
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
You abandoned me.

1024
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You don't want me anymore?

1025
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I hate you!

1026
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I hate you!

1027
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,920
I love you!

1028
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,880
I've been looking for you.

1029
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,760
Let me go!

1030
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,280
I love you!

1031
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,000
I miss you so much.

1032
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:28,840
I love you!

1033
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,000
I miss you so much, Su Mo.

1034
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,200
I love you!

1035
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,000
Su Mo.

1036
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,640
I love you!

1037
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,800
I'm sorry, Su Mo.

1038
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,360
I'm sorry.

1039
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,000
It's okay.

1040
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,960
It's okay.

1041
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,240
It's okay.

1042
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,280
I'm sorry.

1043
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,520
It's my fault.

1044
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,400
I'm sorry.

1045
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,720
I'm glad you're okay.

1046
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,720
Baby,

1047
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,720
let me take you home on this day.

1048
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,320
Your Highness,

1049
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,400
they're supposed to be home.

1050
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,240
That's great.

1051
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,200
to open the passage to the Bilo Sea

1052
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,600
for a short time.

1053
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,960
If he doesn't leave this time,

1054
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,400
he'll have to wait for years.

1055
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,600
It's a long journey.

1056
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,120
Let's go home.

1057
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,920
Su Mu.

1058
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,400
My Lord.

1059
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:42,760
What about you?

1060
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,360
Won't you go back with us?

1061
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,120
I'm going home.

1062
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,640
I'll explain to Kong Sang

1063
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,880
and then I'll try to go back to Bilo Sea to find you.

1064
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,120
Don't worry about me.

1065
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,160
I'll go with you.

1066
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,120
Uncle Yuan.

1067
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,760
I'm leaving.

1068
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,400
Sister.

1069
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,960
Su Mu.

1070
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,600
You have to promise me

1071
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,360
to listen to me.

1072
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,800
Don't be fooled by bad people.

1073
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,000
Kong Sang

1074
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,560
still has many good people

1075
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,200
like you.

1076
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,960
As long as we're alive,

1077
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,160
when you grow up,

1078
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,880
come to me.

1079
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,000
Okay?

1080
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,680
I promise

1081
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,400
to live a long life.

1082
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,240
Okay.

1083
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,960
I'll watch Su Mu

1084
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,400
grow up.

1085
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,320
You must grow up safely.

1086
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:47,720
Let's go.

1087
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,320
See you.

1088
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,560
No.

1089
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,560
Yu.

1090
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,240
Chu晏.

1091
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,400
There's a surprise.

1092
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,840
There's a surprise?

1093
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,000
Yes.

1094
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,480
Come now.

1095
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,240
Come over here.

1096
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,240
Today is your first night here.

1097
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,560
Your first day?

1098
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,920
Yes.

1099
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:50,960
Today?

1100
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,960
Isn't it one of the two gods of Shanggu?

1101
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,960
It's opposite to the god of creation.

1102
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,960
The god of destruction.

1103
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,960
Why does it enter Yuan's body?

1104
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,960
Where did I feel this kind of smell?

1105
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,960
The eighth god.

1106
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,960
I lost the blood of the sea king.

1107
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,960
But this dragon blood is good for me.

1108
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,960
If he is here,

1109
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,960
I can't control the future sea king.

1110
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,960
You are dead.

1111
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,960
So you controlled the star village that day.

1112
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,960
Why do you have to find the blood of the sea king?

1113
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,960
Stop struggling.

1114
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,960
You are not my opponent.

1115
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,960
You have no right to be a god of destruction

1116
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,960
when you are in the empty.

1117
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,960
Why do you waste your time on me?

1118
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,960
I...

1119
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,960
I have a rightful person.

1120
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,960
I...

1121
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,960
I won't be defeated by you.

1122
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,960
Do you think Zhu Yan is a stone that can be used to break the glass?

1123
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,960
What are you doing?

1124
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,960
Zhiyuan,

1125
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,960
is this the desire in your heart?

1126
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,960
Zhu Yan killed the last demon of the demon.

1127
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,960
If you want to die,

1128
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,960
let him pay you.

1129
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,960
Just turn Zhu Yan into a demon.

1130
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,960
You are the god of dragon blood.

1131
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,960
Only you can take me to the sea of Bilo.

1132
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,960
Let's make a deal.

1133
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,960
You take me to the sea king.

1134
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,960
I will help you fulfill your wish.

1135
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,960
Yuan.

1136
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,960
No.

1137
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,960
He is not Zhiyuan.

1138
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,960
The demon has already entered his body.

1139
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,960
Old Master.

1140
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,960
Come back.

1141
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,960
What are you talking about?

1142
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,960
I am Zhu Yan, not the demon.

1143
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,960
From now on,

1144
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,960
you are my demon.

1145
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,960
I am the most capable of

1146
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,960
inspiring Yuan's most dark and selfish obsession.

1147
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,960
I am the one who has it.

1148
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,960
I used the great emperor's love for the queen of Baiwei.

1149
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,960
Now I use Zhiyuan's obsession with the demon.

1150
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,960
Demon.

1151
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:08,960
Miaoyi.

1152
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,960
You left me.

1153
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,960
Where are you going with this man?

1154
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,960
Can you escape from my palm?

1155
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,960
How about

1156
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,960
using my new power?

1157
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,960
Shi Yan.

1158
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,960
Shi Yan.

1159
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,960
Shi Yan.

1160
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,960
Stop it.

1161
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,960
Shi Yan.

1162
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,960
Let him go.

1163
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,960
Shi Yan.

1164
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,960
Stop it.

1165
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,960
You can't hurt him.

1166
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,960
Shi Yan.

1167
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:47,960
Shi Yan.

1168
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,960
From now on,

1169
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,960
there is only me in the world.

1170
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,960
You can only have one person in your heart.

1171
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:56,960
That is me.

1172
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,960
Shi Yan.

1173
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:58,960
As for him,

1174
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,960
I want him to be like this.

1175
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:02,960
He is like this.

1176
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:04,960
Shi Yan.

1177
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,960
No.

1178
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,960
Stop it.

1179
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,960
Stop it.

1180
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:09,960
Shi Yan.

1181
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:10,960
How is it, Shi Yan?

1182
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,960
Are you convinced?

1183
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,960
If you admit that he is mine now,

1184
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,960
I can spare your life.

1185
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,960
Shi Yan.

1186
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:20,960
No.

1187
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,960
Shi Yan.

1188
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,960
The doctor you loved

1189
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,960
died 200 years ago.

1190
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,960
He is not Yan'er.

1191
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:35,960
No.

1192
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,960
Shi Yan.

1193
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,960
Shi Yan.

1194
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:52,960
He is dead.

1195
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,960
No.

1196
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,960
Yan'er.

1197
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,960
I am willing to be a doctor.

1198
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,960
From now on,

1199
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,960
I am your doctor.

1200
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:31,960
Wugong.

1201
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,960
Prepare the wedding dress for us.

1202
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:38,960
Shi Yan.

1203
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,960
Shi Yan.

1204
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,960
There are countless hidden and secret paths

1205
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,960
in the world of the dead.

1206
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,960
For thousands of years,

1207
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,960
countless dead souls have been lost.

1208
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,960
The dead souls are still wandering in despair

1209
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,960
and never see the sun.

1210
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:20,960
Doctor.

1211
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,960
No one can find us.

1212
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,960
Our new home is here.

1213
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:37,960
The old man is here.

1214
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:38,960
Let's go.

1215
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,960
I told Mu Yu

1216
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,960
that I looked like him.

1217
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,960
He took his bamboo

1218
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,960
and recognized me.

1219
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,960
No wonder Yuan was so obsessed

1220
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,960
with the wedding dress.

1221
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,960
What?

1222
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,960
The wedding dress?

1223
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,960
What?

1224
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,960
Are you not satisfied?

1225
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,960
Well.

1226
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,960
It's a bit hasty.

1227
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:24,960
Hasty?

1228
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,960
You want to be my doctor.

1229
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,960
You are hasty?

1230
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:32,960
Yuan.

1231
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,960
Is this

1232
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,960
the medicine you really want to be?

1233
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:42,960
Yuan.

1234
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,960
I am sincere.

1235
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,960
But the wedding is a big thing.

1236
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,960
I have to tell my parents.

1237
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:56,960
In the past life,

1238
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,960
everyone thought that

1239
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,960
the Jiao people were not good at being with the Kongsang people.

1240
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:00,960
But now,

1241
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,960
no one can stop us.

1242
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,960
I won't

1243
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,960
care about anyone's opinion.

1244
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:08,960
But I am a girl.

1245
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:09,960
I hope that

1246
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,960
the wedding will be more lively.

1247
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:12,960
I am sorry.

1248
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,960
Are you trying to trick me?

1249
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,960
You want to take the chance to escape from the world.

1250
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:34,960
Right?

1251
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:36,960
Let me go.

1252
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,960
You are my friend.

1253
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,960
I won't let you go.

1254
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,960
Let me go.

1255
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:42,960
I want to get you now.

1256
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,960
Let me go.

1257
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,960
What are you doing?

1258
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,960
You hurt me.

1259
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,960
Yang Yu.

1260
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,960
Yang Yu.

1261
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,960
Are you okay?

1262
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,960
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1263
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:03,960
I was too anxious.

1264
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:09,960
It's been two hundred years.

1265
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,960
We can finally be together.

1266
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:18,960
A'Yuan.

1267
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:22,960
Why don't you

1268
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:24,960
tell me

1269
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,960
what happened between you and the doctor?

1270
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,960
This way,

1271
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,960
I can be a better doctor.

1272
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:32,960
I will be a good doctor.

1273
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:41,960
Then

1274
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:42,960
we will get married.

1275
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:54,960
This heart

1276
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,960
is meant to be happy.

1277
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:02,960
Look.

1278
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,960
The two people in the mirror

1279
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,960
are very perfect.

1280
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,960
In this heavy rain,

1281
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,960
I was seriously injured.

1282
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,960
I have to find a way to escape.

1283
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,960
What are you thinking?

1284
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:24,960
I...

1285
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:26,960
I am just thinking

1286
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:28,960
that I can't

1287
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,960
get out of this.

1288
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:31,960
I am just thinking

1289
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:33,960
that it's been two hundred years

1290
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,960
and A'Yuan still remembers

1291
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,960
how to draw this heart.

1292
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,960
A'Yuan's memory is really good.

1293
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,960
After the doctor's death,

1294
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,960
I will remember it.

1295
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:54,960
In the future,

1296
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,960
you should also remember it.

1297
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,960
I will never forget it.

1298
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:26,960
A'Yuan.

1299
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,960
Do you not have Yan'er's position in your heart?

1300
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,480
A'Yuan.

1301
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,520
Go away.

1302
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,280
Although you and my Zhu Yan's relationship

1303
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,680
is not as moving as you and Grandmother Gao,

1304
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,280
but to me,

1305
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,920
you are extremely precious.

1306
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,640
You are the Yuan Chief Steward who watched me grow up,

1307
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,080
accompanied me,

1308
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,360
cared for me,

1309
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,600
and understood me.

1310
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,240
You are like a father to me.

1311
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,280
Like a father to you?

1312
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,960
Like a father to you?

1313
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,600
Are you

1314
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,480
really in love with me?

1315
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,920
So at that time,

1316
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,200
you misunderstood that I was about to die,

1317
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,760
and said nothing.

1318
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,120
You just faced it alone.

1319
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,840
To me,

1320
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,600
you are equally important.

1321
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,600
I want to protect Yan'er.

1322
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,840
I want you to come back.

1323
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,640
A'Yuan.

1324
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,640
I want to protect Yan'er.

1325
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,640
A'Yuan.

1326
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,640
I want to protect Yan'er.

1327
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:40,640
A'Yuan.

1328
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,040
I will come back to save you

1329
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,040
if I find Baile.

1330
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,440
I want to protect Yan'er.

1331
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,440
I want to protect Yan'er.

1332
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,440
A'Yuan.

1333
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,200
I will definitely find Baile

1334
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,200
and come back to save you.

1335
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,480
I want you to come back.

1336
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,680
It's not that simple.

1337
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,480
I have no thoughts.

1338
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,480
I have no intention to find him.

1339
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,080
Come out.

1340
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,080
This is the final formation of our Ice Tribe.

1341
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,680
You can't escape.

1342
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,480
Yan'er.

1343
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,680
It turns out that you have been

1344
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,080
in the Ice Tribe for a long time.

1345
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,080
You are not afraid of me.

1346
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,080
You are not afraid of me.

1347
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,080
It turns out that you have been lying to me.

1348
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,280
I accidentally

1349
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,880
got hurt by your knife.

1350
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,880
But

1351
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,480
how can I let the medicine

1352
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,280
that I'm about to get

1353
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,080
go away from me?

1354
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,280
I really can't bear to tell you

1355
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,480
that everything you did

1356
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,880
was in vain.

1357
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,880
Shiyi has lost all her power

1358
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,680
and has been attacked by me.

1359
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,280
I'm afraid that

1360
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,880
her organs, organs, and meridians have been broken.

1361
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,480
Just like this.

1362
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,080
Look.

1363
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,280
So what's the use of finding her?

1364
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,880
I'm afraid that

1365
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,880
she is not fit to be a human.

1366
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,880
Wuguo.

1367
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,280
Why don't you

1368
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,880
go and take care of Shiyi?

1369
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,480
If she is lucky

1370
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,280
and still alive,

1371
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,280
kill that woman for me.

1372
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,080
Yes.

1373
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,280
Yuan.

1374
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,680
When did you

1375
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,880
become such a monster?

1376
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,480
Yuan.

1377
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,480
Now

1378
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,880
I'll tell you

1379
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,880
that you can only become a monster

1380
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,480
If you don't eat and drink,

1381
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,480
don't blame me for forcing you.

1382
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,480
How is it?

1383
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,480
Wearing the clothes of a medicine doctor

1384
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,280
smelling her favorite incense

1385
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,280
and drinking her favorite wine,

1386
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,480
do you feel like you can't be a medicine doctor?

1387
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,880
I've lost my sense of smell and sense of smell.

1388
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,480
I can't smell anything.

1389
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,680
I can't taste anything.

1390
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,680
You're working hard.

1391
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,680
The person who loves you is a medicine doctor.

1392
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:28,880
Not me.

1393
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,080
You forced me

1394
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,680
to marry a beggar.

1395
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,480
No, no, no.

1396
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,880
From now on,

1397
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,680
you will become my medicine doctor.

1398
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,480
What are you going to do?

1399
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,880
I'm going to make you a medicine doctor.

1400
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,880
You want to turn me into another person.

1401
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,480
Are you crazy?

1402
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,880
Zhu Yuan.

1403
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,280
Didn't you lose your sense of smell and sense of smell?

1404
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,480
Now I turn you into another person.

1405
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,480
Your sense of feeling will come back.

1406
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,880
Then you can enjoy

1407
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,280
everything in this world with me.

1408
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,080
Let go of me.

1409
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,480
No.

1410
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,280
I'm Zhu Yuan.

1411
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,280
I don't want to be anyone.

1412
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,680
I'm in heaven.

1413
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,080
I have my own wish.

1414
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,080
From now on,

1415
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,080
you will forget your Zhu Yuan's identity.

1416
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,680
You want to live

1417
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,080
in the name of a medicine doctor.

1418
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,080
I'm going to make you a medicine doctor.

1419
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,080
I'm going to make you a medicine doctor.

1420
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,080
I'm going to make you a medicine doctor.

1421
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,080
No.

1422
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,680
I'm the City Leader of Tian Ji Feng,

1423
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,080
Chizhu Feili.

1424
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,080
You can call me medicine doctor.

1425
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,080
Okay.

1426
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,880
Since you have treated me as a teacher,

1427
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,880
you should remember my text.

1428
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:19,880
Yuan.

1429
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,080
You've sent the message.

1430
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,480
Wait for me to come back.

1431
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,280
I'll wait for you to pass away.

1432
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,680
I'm going to make you a medicine doctor.

1433

I'm going to make you a medicine doctor.

1436
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,080
I'm going to make you a medicine doctor.

1437
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,080

I'm going to make you a medicine doctor.

1468
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,080
Yin!

1469
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,080
What did you do to me?

1470
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,080
You've recovered your power.

1471
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,080
Now you're going to die.

1472
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,080
Let go of me!

1473
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,080
Yin!

1474
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,080
Yin!

1475
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,080
Yin!

1476
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,080
Yin!

1477
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,080
Yin!

1478
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,080
Yin!

1479
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,080
Yin!

1480
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,080
Yin!

1481
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,080
Yin!

1482
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,080
Yin!

1483
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,080
Yin!

1484
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,080
Yin!

1485
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,080
Yin!

1486
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,080
Yin!

1487
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,080
Yin!

1488
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,080
Yin!

1489
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,080
Yin!

1490
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,080
Yin!

1491
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,080
Yin!

1492
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,080
Yin!

1493
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,080
Yin!

1494
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,080
Where did you get this?

1495
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:31,080
She's already become my medicine doctor.

1496
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,080
You came to find me?

1497
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,080
Yin!

1498
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,080
If the sky doesn't die, let me kill you!

1499
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,080
Then you don't have to think about anything

1500
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,080
and you'll always be my medicine doctor.

1501
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,080
Yin!

1502
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,080
Yin!

1503
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,080
Yin!

1504
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,080
Yin!

1505
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,080
Yin!

1506
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,080
Yin!

1507
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,080
Yin!

1508
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,080
Yin!

1509
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,080
Yin!

1510
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,080
Yin!

1511
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,080
Yin!

1512
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,080
Yin!

1513
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,080
Yin!

1514
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,080
Yin!

1515
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,080
Yin!

1516
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,080
Yin!

1517
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,080
Yin!

1518
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,080
Yin!

1519
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,080
Yin!

1520
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,080
Yin!

1521
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,080
Yin!

1522
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,080
Yin!

1523
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,080
Yin!

1524
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,080
Yin!

1525
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,080
Yin!

1526
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,080
Yin!

1527
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,080
Yin!

1528
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,080
Yin!

1529
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,080
Yin!

1530
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,080
Yin!

1531
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,080
Yin!

1532
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,080
Yin!

1533
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,080
Yin!

1534
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,080
Yin!

1535
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,080
Yin!

1536
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,080
Yin!

1537
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,080
Yin!

1538
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,080
Yin!

1539
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,080
Yin!

1540
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:02,080
Yin!

1541
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,080
Yin!

1542
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,080
Yin!

1543
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,080
Yin!

1544
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,080
Yin!

1545
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,080
Yin!

1546
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,080
Yin!

1547
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,080
Yin!

1548
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,080
Yin!

1549
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,080
Yin!

1550
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,080
Yin!

1551
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,080
Yin!

1552
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,080
Yin!

1553
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,080
Yin!

1554
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,080
Yin!

1555
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,080
Yin!

1556
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,080
Yin!

1557
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,080
Yin!

1558
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,080
Yin!

1559
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,080
Yin!

1560
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,080
Yin!

1561
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:22,840
Ying'er

1562
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,260
Yitian

1563
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:51,720
Ying'er

1564
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,080
Yan'er, I...

1565
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,080
Yan'er, I...

1566
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,080
I can't hurt you.

1567
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,080
It's impossible.

1568
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,080
I won't hurt you.

1569
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,080
How is Yan'er?

1570
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,080
Baiyuan,

1571
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:05,080
are you feeling better now?

1572
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,080
Yan'er, I...

1573
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,080
I...

1574
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,080
I...

1575
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,080
I...

1576
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,080
I...

1577
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,080
I...

1578
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,080
Yan'er.

1579
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,080
Leave now.

1580
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,080
Leave now!

1581
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,080
Yan'er,

1582
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,080
are you okay?

1583
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,080
I'm fine.

1584
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,080
But just now,

1585
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,080
Xu Yao wanted to turn me into a medicinal doctor.

1586
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,080
Luckily, you arrived in time

1587
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,080
and stopped the magic.

1588
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,080
Don't worry.

1589
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,080
I'll be fine.

1590
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,080
I'll be fine.

1591
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,080
I'll be fine.

1592
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,080
I'll be fine.

1593
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,080
I'll be fine.

1594
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,080
I'll be fine.

1595
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,080
I'll be fine.

1596
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,080
I'll be fine.

1597
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,080
I'll be fine.

1598
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,080
I'll be fine.

1599
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,080
If you feel uncomfortable,

1600
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,080
you must tell me.

1601
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,080
What about you?

1602
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,080
Xu Yao said

1603
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,080
you were buried with your body

1604
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,080
and your gold pendant was broken.

1605
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,080
I should have done that.

1606
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,080
But

1607
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,080
when I was in the critical moment,

1608
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:47,080
I felt your fire.

1609
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,080
I was able to support you.

1610
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,080
But the thunder struck me.

1611
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,080
It broke my golden pulse.

1612
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,080
It made me regain

1613
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,080
the lost spiritual power.

1614
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,080
But I really didn't expect

1615
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,080
Xu Yao would turn Yuan

1616
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,080
into another person.

1617
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,080
Xu Yao has now

1618
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,080
mastered the power of the heavens.

1619
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,080
In a few days,

1620
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,080
his ability to bewitch people

1621
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,080
will only get stronger.

1622
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:16,080
By then,

1623
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,080
he can even control the army

1624
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,080
at will.

1625
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,080
The army?

1626
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,080
That's right.

1627
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:25,080
What's more terrifying is

1628
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,080
if Xu Yao finds the Sea Emperor

1629
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,080
through the paper,

1630
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,080
then he can open the two realms

1631
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,080
to absorb the power of the heavens

1632
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,080
and destroy the clouds.

1633
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,080
So we must never

1634
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,080
leave the ring in Xu Yao's hands.

1635
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,080
We must find a way

1636
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,080
to get it back.

1637
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,080
But Yuan is still

1638
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,080
a living person.

1639
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,080
We can't defeat him.

1640
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,080
And

1641
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,080
we can't control

1642
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,080
the spell of the ring.

1643
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,080
Yan,

1644
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,080
with the current power of the paper,

1645
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,080
we can't fight against Xu Yao for long.

1646
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,080
So

1647
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,080
we must leave this place as soon as possible

1648
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,080
and go back to Jialan

1649
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,080
to think of a way.

1650
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,080
This is a calamity

1651
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,080
that will befall the whole world.

1652
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,080
The whole clouds

1653
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:09,080
will be caught in a fire.

1654
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:57,080
Love and hate are not clear.

1655
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:02,080
How can we part with the dust?

1656
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:07,080
How can we face the fate?

1657
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,080
How can we not see

1658
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,080
the light of dawn?

1659
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:13,080
The more beautiful the valley,

1660
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:17,080
the more the tears burn.

1661
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:22,080
The bottom line of your heart

1662
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:27,080
is a wind that dares to break my soul.

1663
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:32,080
Lock me in your heart

1664
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:37,080
and never leave you.

1665
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:42,080
The bottom line of your heart

1666
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:47,080
is a wind that dares to break my soul.

1667
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:52,080
The heart can be broken into pieces.

1668
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:57,080
You and I just walk face to face.

1669
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:02,080
The bottom line of your heart

1670
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:07,080
is a wind that dares to break my soul.

1671
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:12,080
The heart that blocks my way

1672
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:17,080
is not by your side.

1673
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:22,080
The bottom line of your heart

1674
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:27,080
is a wind that dares to break my soul.

1675
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:32,080
The heart can be broken into pieces.

1676
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:37,080
You and I just walk face to face.
