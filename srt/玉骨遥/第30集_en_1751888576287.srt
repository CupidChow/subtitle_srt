1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please give me a life of shining fortune

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to be the one for you

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But I want to spend the rest of my life with you

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But I want to spend the rest of my life with you

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to be the one for you

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But I want to spend the rest of my life with you

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 11

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm willing to tell you everything I know

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Chase

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is a fantasy

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's a strange feeling

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I used the 10,000-li incense just now

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I should be able to find the entrance by following the smell

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Master

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Who are you?

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't you already know, Shi Ying?

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's really you

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm the one for you

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm the one for you

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm the one for you

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm the one for you

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm the one for you

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm the one for you

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I killed them

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The empty-handed soldiers for customers

29
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,000
They are nothing access to me

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Even they won't go against me

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You are really alive

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm still alive

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,200
Because this is my obsession with Bai Wei.

35
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,440
So I have been living for a thousand years

36
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
like a walking corpse.

37
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,800
Since you have an obsession with her,

38
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
why did you collude with the Ice Tribe

39
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,760
to destroy the empty funeral ceremony

40
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,840
you started together?

41
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,880
The empty funeral ceremony has been cancelled.

42
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,720
There is no such thing as a ceremony.

43
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,200
I can't just watch

44
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,720
the painstaking effort Bai Wei and I have put in.

45
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,280
So I have to destroy her myself.

46
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,560
I have to see the truth again.

47
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,960
Only then can I return her to Bai Wei.

48
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,000
She will never forget

49
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,360
the flourishing cloud

50
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,280
that she has been missing until her death.

51
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,280
You have such a deep love for Bai Wei.

52
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,000
Not a deep love,

53
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,360
but a deep love.

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,360
Are you here to kill me?

55
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,120
You have ignited the fire of the Ice Tribe.

56
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,080
I am the Young Minister of Mount Jiuyi,

57
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,040
and also the son of the empty funeral.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,560
Anyone who is an enemy of the empty funeral,

59
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,400
even...

60
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,800
Even if it is you,

61
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
I will fight for it.

62
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,880
Yes.

63
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,800
You are the son of the empty funeral.

64
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,640
You are the son of the Heaven-Declared.

65
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,920
You are the son of the Emperor-Demon King.

66
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,480
I am not.

67
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,400
Back then,

68
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,160
I let Bai Wei down

69
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,040
and I let her misunderstand me.

70
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,880
I let her get further and further away from me.

71
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,520
I spent decades to love her,

72
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,520
but it took me a thousand years

73
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,880
to regret my mistakes.

74
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,320
Do you know the pain of this accident?

75
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,120
You will not understand.

76
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,720
Once,

77
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,600
I was in the same place with her.

78
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,840
I was in the same place with her.

79
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
I was in the same place with her.

80
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,320
I asked her

81
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,960
if the star that is closest to us

82
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,600
is a distance that is inseparable.

83
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,480
She hugged me.

84
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,440
She comforted me and said,

85
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,280
no,

86
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,560
as long as you reach out your hand,

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,280
you can get rid of it.

88
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,320
I was the one

89
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,160
who pushed her

90
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,280
to the far side step by step.

91
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,240
Now you see me like this.

92
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,560
I have been

93
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,360
wandering in this world for a thousand years.

94
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
I am very tired.

95
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,720
I know you will come to me.

96
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,520
I have been waiting for you.

97
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,720
I know everything

98
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,080
you have done.

99
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,960
Today you are here.

100
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,280
I can finally

101
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,560
let go of you.

102
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,960
You can choose to become an emperor

103
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,720
or

104
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,240
become a person who supports the emperor.

105
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,080
I am afraid that

106
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,160
there is only one chance.

107
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,320
Then I can go to see her

108
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,840
in peace.

109
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,280
Do it.

110
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,040
Do it.

111
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,440
My child.

112
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,160
Come on.

113
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,320
Star King,

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,160
rest in peace.

115
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,880
Star King, rest in peace.

116
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,040
It's annoying.

117
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,520
I am so worried.

118
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,480
Are you okay?

119
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,600
I am fine.

120
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,800
Let's go.

121
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,240
What is that?

122
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,560
Where is the evil spirit?

123
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,880
Have you seen the healer?

124
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,800
The healer is the new emperor.

125
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,120
He was obsessed with the Empress

126
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,760
because of Bai Wei.

127
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,160
because of Bai Wei.

128
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,160
So he used the Ice Tribe's hand

129
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,520
to deal with Kong Sang.

130
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,040
Then...

131
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,320
Then where is he now?

132
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,440
He has already passed away.

133
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,440
The Ice Tribe lost his friend.

134
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,720
Wu Xian, the leader of Shiwu,

135
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,280
was killed by him.

136
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,600
Shiwu, Jianghui and the Ice Tribe

137
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,200
are not afraid of him anymore.

138
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,240
The only danger that Kong Sang

139
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,160
is currently facing is the Imperial Army.

140
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,800
Stop.

141
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,160
These prisoners

142
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
are afraid of trouble

143
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,760
and will be in danger.

144
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,000
How about

145
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,640
I take them back to Ye City

146
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,880
and interrogate them?

147
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,280
Chief Bai.

148
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,400
Chief Bai,

149
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,280
I am ordered by Prince Shi Yu

150
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,880
to find out the identities of these Imperial Army.

151
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,360
If they are just ordinary soldiers,

152
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,320
I will send them back home

153
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
and reunite with my family.

154
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,680
Thank you, General Qin.

155
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,200
But these Imperial Army

156
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,400
are all sinister and cunning.

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,760
You are good at leading troops to war.

158
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,560
But you are good at using your martial arts.

159
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,200
If you use your martial arts wrongly,

160
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,480
you will be defeated by the enemy.

161
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,120
I think the number of prisoners of the Imperial Army

162
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,840
is at least 10,000.

163
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,200
It's not even 8,000.

164
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,440
I am willing to share some of your burden.

165
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,880
No need.

166
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
The country has its laws.

167
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,080
The army has its rules.

168
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,480
Besides, the Minister of War has ordered

169
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,280
that no one should use these people

170
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,680
for personal gain.

171
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,040
Chief Bai,

172
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,200
these Imperial Army are numerous.

173
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,680
I need to deal with them immediately.

174
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,280
Take them away.

175
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,120
Go.

176
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,960
If we meet them at home,

177
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,800
this war will break out

178
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,040
very soon.

179
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,920
I can't use my power to make a living.

180
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,440
Shiyi and your good apprentice

181
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,520
are given my money.

182
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,720
I will take it.

183
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
you need your time to gather the army

184
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,080
or to manifest your delegation.

185
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,520
You did it.

186
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,220
My life is on the line.

187
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,780
Shi Yu

188
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
is leading the party.

189
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,240
I need some time

190
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,760
to bones the two tribes' relationship

191
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,360
till now.

192
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,840
But I have Şeyng's order

193
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,280
Whether you're a Jiao or a Kongsang,

194
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,080
you're all the same.

195
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,840
Thank you for considering for us, Young Commander.

196
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,960
I hope that after this,

197
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,400
the two tribes will have no more disputes

198
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,640
and the world will be peaceful.

199
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,680
After the war,

200
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,040
do you have to fulfill your promise?

201
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,000
The one who cuts the grass has its field.

202
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,000
The one who knows the grass has its house.

203
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,240
The one who lives in the grass has its stove.

204
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,440
The one who is old and young has his clothes.

205
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,280
The one who has no fear of danger has no fear of danger.

206
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,320
All of them are talented and have a strong heart.

207
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,680
The peace of our people will last for a long time.

208
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,600
The state of our country will be as bright as the stars.

209
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,600
Since the matter of the turtle blood has been resolved,

210
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,400
shall we take off our robe now?

211
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,480
Luckily, I have the name of the Immortal Sword

212
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,000
to make you a good name.

213
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,520
Xiao Yinzi.

214
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,480
How is it?

215
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,200
It sounds like you and the little pig are a good match.

216
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,960
What little pig?

217
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,920
What little pig?

218
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,320
Of course it's Zhu Yan.

219
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,960
After you took off your robe,

220
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,200
your relationship has changed.

221
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,920
Shouldn't your names change too?

222
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,240
Stop talking.

223
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,000
You dare to say that you took off your robe not for him?

224
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,800
You dare to say that you took off your robe

225
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,240
not to be with him forever?

226
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,040
I want to.

227
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,760
That's right.

228
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,800
But Zhu Yan has been chasing you all the time.

229
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,600
You are always pure and unpretentious.

230
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,840
How are you going to make him a good name?

231
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,920
I didn't do it on purpose.

232
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,040
If I express my feelings to him rashly,

233
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,680
I'm afraid I'll scare him.

234
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,160
Why don't we make a plan after the ceremony is over?

235
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,560
What are you joking about?

236
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,880
Are you afraid of scaring him?

237
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,200
What kind of gentle woman do you think he is?

238
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,360
Are you afraid of scaring yourself?

239
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,680
Young Commander,

240
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,200
Lord Chongming,

241
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,120
I heard you talking about Princess Zhu Yan.

242
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,480
If she didn't meddle in this time,

243
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,080
maybe we might not be able to trust each other.

244
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,000
The war is not so fast.

245
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,480
There is room for change.

246
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,440
Yes.

247
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,520
Thanks to her, the war stopped.

248
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,640
Young Commander,

249
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,000
I know I shouldn't say something.

250
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,840
But I have to say it.

251
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,560
When Princess Zhu Yan was happy,

252
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,520
she was under your door.

253
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,720
She spent the day with you in Mount Jiuyi.

254
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,720
But when she was in pain,

255
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,200
she was kicked out of Mount Jiuyi for you.

256
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,920
She thought she would never see you again.

257
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
I watched her grow up little by little

258
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,600
and took care of her as my family.

259
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,600
Now I'm going to help my family.

260
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,000
I can't take care of her all the time.

261
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,560
Young Commander,

262
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,600
you are the one who can make her happy.

263
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,640
Since the sea and the river are clear in the future,

264
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,440
I hope she won't cry anymore.

265
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,160
This is my only wish.

266
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,640
I said something I shouldn't have said.

267
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,480
I'll drink to my own pleasure.

268
00:15:50,420 --> 00:16:19,720
《Ran

269
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,720
that I've been hiding from the West for more than 200 years?

270
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
I remember.

271
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Last time Kong Sang and the Jiao Clan signed the peace treaty.

272
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,720
The one who led the alliance was my beloved woman.

273
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
The head of the Chizu clan,

274
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Chizu Feili,

275
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
also Zhu Yan's great-grandmother,

276
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
was more than two hundred years ago.

277
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
The first time I saw her

278
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
was when she was wearing a red dress,

279
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
and she was wearing a white dress,

280
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
and she was wearing a red dress.

281
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
I can't forget her.

282
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
That's why you stayed in the Chizu clan.

283
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Chizu Feili,

284
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Kong Sang was the first to win.

285
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,720
He fought with the Jiao Clan,

286
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
and he drove the army of the Ru Qing clan.

287
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
The demon was from a noble family.

288
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,720
He was as bright as the stars in the clouds,

289
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
and he attracted the attention of many noble families

290
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
and the six sons.

291
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
We were separated by the clouds,

292
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
but we shouldn't have any dream.

293
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
This is the sword

294
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
that we, Jiao Clan,

295
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
have been saving with our souls.

296
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
You are my sword-gatherer.

297
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
From that day on,

298
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
she accompanied me to the west

299
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
and helped us fight in the north.

300
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
But I never thought

301
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
what her name would be.

302
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Just now,

303
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
I decided to name her

304
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Tianji Biluo.

305
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
Tianji Biluo?

306
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Because of your Tianji Phoenix,

307
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
it's where my heart belongs.

308
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Yaoyi,

309
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
my appearance

310
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
has made you weak.

311
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
But I will use my whole life to repay you,

312
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,720
and be your sword-gatherer and armor.

313
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Then it's a deal.

314
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
You have to repay me with your whole life.

315
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
I just think my whole life is too short.

316
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Tianji Biluo

317
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
Tianji Biluo

318
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Tianji Biluo

319
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
Tianji Biluo

320
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Tianji Biluo

321
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
Tianji Biluo

322
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Tianji Biluo

323
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Tianji Biluo

324
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
is the most important thing

325
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
in my life.

326
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
I don't know when

327
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
I will be separated from her.

328
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
I decided to show my heart

329
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
to her without any care.

330
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
Even if I die,

331
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
I will still love her.

332
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
The best thing I've done in my life

333
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
is to tell her

334
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
I love her.

335
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
Shiyi,

336
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
you can tell her

337
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
in this life.

338
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
The moon is shining again.

339
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Who has picked up the thoughts?

340
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
The moon is not yet over.

341
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
The love is not over.

342
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Love is still in the air.

343
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,720
It's like a dream.

344
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,720
A guest is in a dream.

345
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
I don't know

346
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
what Master is doing now.

347
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Waiting for the life to turn into a sword,

348
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
but it's still in the ice.

349
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,720
The most beautiful poem is written.

350
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
When time and time

351
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
have your face,

352
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,720
I will stay in the past forever.

353
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Let me go.

354
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
You can't go.

355
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
I can't go.

356
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Kill me.

357
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
Kill me.

358
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
I can't go.

359
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Kill me.

360
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Let me go.

361
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Let me go.

362
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Kill me.

363
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
Kill me.

364
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Kill me.

365
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I can't go.

366
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Let me go.

367
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Hurry up.

368
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
I can't go.

369
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Yan.

370
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Master.

371
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
I've been busy these days.

372
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
I haven't seen you.

373
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
How are you?

374
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
How can you

375
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
see me so sloppy?

376
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
Yan.

377
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
What?

378
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
Master.

379
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
I'm fine.

380
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
But

381
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,720
I'm not used to the water and soil here.

382
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
Could you write me a prescription?

383
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
I was careless.

384
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Wait a minute.

385
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
Yan.

386
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Yan.

387
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Here you are.

388
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
So beautiful.

389
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,720
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

390
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Master.

391
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
I'm fine.

392
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
If you have anything important,

393
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
just go ahead.

394
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
I said before

395
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
no matter what you said

396
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
or where you are,

397
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
I won't have any

398
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
bad intentions.

399
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
About withdrawing the army,

400
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
it's because

401
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
I'm not good at it.

402
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Actually,

403
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
it's because

404
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Master's words in the hall

405
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
when I was in the alley,

406
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
I saw many people

407
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
clapping their hands.

408
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,720
My master is so good.

409
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,720
I'll let Shiyu

410
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
handle the withdrawal of the army.

411
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
The matter of the Navy

412
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
will be done.

413
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,720
I have nothing else to do.

414
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
By the way,

415
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,720
tomorrow is the festival.

416
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Would you like to

417
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,720
go to the market with me?

418
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Master, do you have

419
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
anything to buy?

420
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
Tell me.

421
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
I'll buy it.

422
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
You once said

423
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
you would take me

424
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
to the Sky-climbing City.

425
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
I couldn't go there.

426
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
How about

427
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
going to the Night City?

428
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Go to the market with me?

429
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Yes.

430
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
That kind of person

431
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
has no purpose

432
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
but to play.

433
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Are you willing to?

434
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
I'm willing.

435
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Okay.

436
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
See you tomorrow.

437
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
See you tomorrow.

438
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Miss.

439
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
I saw it.

440
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
My master came to see me.

441
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
Yes.

442
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,720
Young Commander just left.

443
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
So

444
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
what I saw

445
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
was really not a fantasy.

446
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,720
It's my master.

447
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
He's here.

448
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
No.

449
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Did someone

450
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
deliberately come to see me

451
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,720
in the way

452
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
that my master

453
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
is portrayed?

454
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
No.

455
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
He was just kidding.

456
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Miss.

457
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
What are you talking about?

458
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
No.

459
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
What am I talking about?

460
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
Yes.

461
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
It's my master.

462
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
He came to my room

463
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
and said he would go to the Sky-climbing City.

464
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
Miss.

465
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
Isn't it a good thing?

466
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Go to the Sky-climbing City.

467
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Why do you look like

468
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
a disaster?

469
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Yes.

470
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
It's a good thing, Concubine Yun.

471
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
Master is taking me

472
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
to the Sky-climbing City.

473
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Miss.

474
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Miss.

475
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
So I came to see you.

476
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Look.

477
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Miss.

478
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
This one.

479
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
This one.

480
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Yes.

481
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Take it.

482
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Yes.

483
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Take it.

484
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Look.

485
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Master.

486
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Long time no see.

487
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,720
I want to go back to Mount Jiuyi.

488
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,720
This is the place you want to go.

489
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,720
Of course.

490
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
I like Master.

491
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
I like what Master likes.

492
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Look. This is nice.

493
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Yes.

494
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Master.

495
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
This painting

496
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,720
was painted by Master He Yu.

497
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
It was called the painting of the dead.

498
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
It's called

499
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
the family's clever plan

500
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
and the clever laugh.

501
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
It's a good omen.

502
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
It's the most famous.

503
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
This is one of his representative works,

504
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
the painting of the dead.

505
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
It's said that

506
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
the woman in this painting

507
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
was accidentally met

508
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
in a trip in the spring.

509
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
It's a pity that

510
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
she didn't show her feelings at that time.

511
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
After she finished this painting,

512
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
she went to find this woman.

513
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
But she found that

514
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
she was married long ago.

515
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
Master is satisfied.

516
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
I worked hard yesterday.

517
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
It's true that I didn't waste my time.

518
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Which famous artist from the painting shop

519
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
is the best at painting?

520
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,720
I'll remember them all

521
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
to prepare for the need of knowledge.

522
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
The most famous ancient painting

523
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
in the book is

524
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,720
Master He Yu.

525
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,720
He is good at drawing beautiful pictures.

526
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Beautiful pictures?

527
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Master He Yu?

528
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Are you serious?

529
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
I'm serious.

530
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
This painting

531
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
is made by Gu Ruibai.

532
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Which part of the painting is beautiful?

533
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
People say it's in the clouds.

534
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
It's said to be the forest by the mountain.

535
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,720
It should be Tianque Mountain in the east.

536
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
It's Tianque Mountain.

537
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Tianque Mountain?

538
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
This is the first time I heard about it.

539
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
It's this.

540
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,160
There are so many people here.

541
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,840
Master,

542
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,880
why are they looking at us like this?

543
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,440
I'm afraid they think you're

544
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,200
the end user of this book store.

545
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,600
Let's see how I can get rid of them.

546
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,520
May I ask you two

547
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,960
what's the origin of this painting?

548
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,320
This painting

549
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,760
is named after a famous family.

550
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,520
It's a very special name.

551
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,080
It's called

552
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
The Morning Sun.

553
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,680
It's very famous these years.

554
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,760
Nonsense.

555
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,960
What's the Morning Sun?

556
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,600
This painting

557
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,520
is Qin Zhang's

558
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,800
Moon and Sea.

559
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,480
What's the Morning Sun?

560
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
These are so big.

561
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
We're really...

562
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,760
This painting was painted by Qin Zhang

563
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,760
during the time he was living in Xishan.

564
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,520
He gave this painting

565
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,200
to his friend, Li He Zhi.

566
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,400
Li He Zhi

567
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
gave him a painting

568
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,200
of the early moon in Xishan

569
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,960
and the early morning of the spring in the sea.

570
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,120
The painting is also known as the Morning Sun.

571
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,640
It's early in the morning

572
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
but it's a bit old.

573
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,920
And

574
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,720
it's the best evidence

575
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,640
of their love.

576
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,760
I'm so lucky

577
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,120
that even my master can paint for me.

578
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
What else can't he do?

579
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,800
May I ask you two

580
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,920
what's the origin of this painting?

581
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,240
This painting

582
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,600
is one of Master Lian'an's works.

583
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,080
It's called

584
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,560
Rong.

585
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,360
Rong?

586
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:42,920
Rong?

587
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,600
This is obviously

588
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,520
Master Lian'an's

589
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,000
Zhilan Artwork.

590
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,840
What does it have to do with Rong?

591
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,600
It's true.

592
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,760
Rong

593
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,960
has its own reason.

594
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,040
What reason?

595
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,920
My master will tell you.

596
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,960
Master Lian'an

597
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,200
has a unique style of writing.

598
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,720
It can be written in a straight,

599
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,600
a side,

600
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,720
or a horizontal way.

601
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,520
And

602
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,200
he often hides the real title

603
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,440
in the writing.

604
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,440
When he was making this painting,

605
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,960
it was in front of me.

606
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,640
The real name of this painting

607
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,640
is Rong.

608
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,520
It's the meaning of the birth

609
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:24,980
of the

610
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,820
Rong.

611
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,580
If there is no Rong,

612
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,220
what is the meaning of Zhilan Artwork?

613
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,020
Look carefully.

614
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,580
The second needle

615
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,780
on the third branch of the left.

616
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,620
The ink on it is a little lighter.

617
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,140
It's the one I gave to my right hand.

618
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,140
It's true.

619
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,780
This...

620
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,620
May I ask who you are?

621
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,980
I'm just an ordinary person.

622
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,180
I have nothing to say.

623
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,700
Lian'er.

624
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,220
It's time to go.

625
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,660
This is definitely a master.

626
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,180
Let me see.

627
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,660
Come on.

628
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,180
Look.

629
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,580
This is a real treasure.

630
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,300
This...

631
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,180
It's here.

632
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,380
It's really a real treasure.

633
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,740
Let's go.

634
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,180
Master.

635
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,540
I admire you so much.

636
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,780
Is there anything

637
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,180
you can't make up in this world?

638
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,580
Fortunately, I know Li Hezhi and Lin An.

639
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,140
If I stay longer,

640
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,420
I will be exposed.

641
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,740
I'm so naughty.

642
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,900
Master has always been strict with me.

643
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,860
I didn't expect him to be so naughty with me.

644
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,300
I'm really shocked.

645
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,260
What can I do?

646
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,820
Leave you to sing the solo?

647
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,740
But I didn't expect

648
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,700
it's interesting to talk nonsense with you.

649
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,540
So you don't have to

650
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,700
see me as your master.

651
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,460
No.

652
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,860
It's a joke.

653
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,700
I'm your master for a day.

654
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,180
I'll be your master forever.

655
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,100
As a disciple,

656
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,540
I should have my own rules.

657
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,980
But, master.

658
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,740
Why do you say that?

659
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
I know.

660
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,380
Because you think you are an outsider.

661
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,660
You don't want to reveal your identity in the red dust.

662
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,180
It's okay to think so.

663
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,060
That's...

664
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,860
Then, where do you want to go next?

665
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,940
I'll go with you.

666
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,820
I'll go with you.

667
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,100
Okay.

668
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,540
When I was a kid,

669
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,100
I saw a shadow play.

670
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,620
But I didn't understand the ending.

671
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,100
I have regrets about it.

672
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,340
How about this?

673
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,660
You go with me.

674
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,940
If you can find this shadow play,

675
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,460
it's a good thing

676
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,460
for me.

677
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,220
Okay.

678
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,780
I will find it.

679
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,300
So you don't forget master

680
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,300
and fulfill my wish.

681
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,340
Let's take a look here.

682
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:53,860
Okay.

683
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,300
I've looked for several streets.

684
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,660
But I can't find the fish.

685
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,060
Master, do you remember

686
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,460
what color the fish is?

687
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,700
I remember it's red.

688
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,180
Red?

689
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,820
Maybe it's been too long.

690
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,820
It's gone too soon.

691
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,100
Do you remember

692
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,580
what the place looks like

693
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,780
when you perform the shadow play?

694
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,580
I only remember

695
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,900
two big fish swimming around.

696
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,900
They look happy.

697
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,700
Good.

698
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,900
Good.

699
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,620
Good.

700
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,420
If I find it,

701
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,900
what reward will you give me?

702
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,180
Good.

703
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,700
You want me to promise you again?

704
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,500
Stop.

705
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,700
Your body's wound has just healed.

706
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,460
Don't run.

707
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,100
I know, master.

708
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:05,980
It's beautiful.

709
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,100
Be good.

710
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,020
It's beautiful.

711
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,780
appointment

712
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,940
Give me some tickets.

713
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,580
Come here.

714
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,060
What the hell are you doing?

715
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,700
So lively.

716
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,340
So lively.

717
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,540
Just take me with you.

718
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,740
Don't run.

719
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,580
Got it.

720
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,860
So数字在哪?

721
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,700
How to calculate this number?

722
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,500
When the record里的数字,

723
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,420
The number on this problem.

724
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,060
Help him out.

725
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,700
Write it down.

726
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,260
Copy.

727
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,780
Are you taking down the book?

728
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,500
After a while.

729
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,460
What is she doing bedила?

730
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,100
Yes.

731
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,580
Yes.

732
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,460
It must be because there are many people.

733
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,100
Master, look.

734
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,020
These two fish.

735
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,260
It might be because

736
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,100
the lights in the shadow play are on the fish.

737
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,940
So it looks like they are just wandering around.

738
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,500
I finally found it.

739
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,260
Yan, thank you.

740
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,140
Don't forget to owe me one thing.

741
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,300
Okay, I remember.

742
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,420
Boss.

743
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,780
Do you know

744
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,100
any places near here where the shadow play is?

745
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,380
I remember you.

746
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,340
You are the boss of the shadow play.

747
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,540
I have been acting for more than ten years.

748
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,700
The shadow play is a piece of cake.

749
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,660
Ten years ago, I watched you play

750
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,340
half of the play here.

751
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,660
Ten years ago?

752
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,140
The most popular play was The Turn of the Ghost.

753
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:16,860
Boss.

754
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,740
Can you play it for us again?

755
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,380
There is a big show.

756
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,020
Miss, you know it.

757
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,100
The other day, Consort Qing

758
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,260
asked the princess of the Chizu family

759
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,860
to come to the palace to listen to the news

760
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,700
and make a painting.

761
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,860
It caused the people to suffer.

762
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,820
Now, these love books

763
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,060
can't be published.

764
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,660
Now, the business of the young master

765
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,860
has been halved.

766
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,900
It caused the people to suffer.

767
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,260
I'm sorry.

768
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,660
Since you are old friends,

769
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,380
you can come to my stall.

770
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:55,940
How about this?

771
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,980
I'll pick a portrait for you.

772
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,740
Thank you.

773
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,460
Why don't you teach me?

774
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,500
I can do it myself.

775
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,860
Okay.

776
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,900
� vos

777
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,780
Master is thanking him

778
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,300
because we don't have a choice

779
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,260
to deal with his business.

780
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,700
� in doubt about it.

781
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,020
He,

782
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:46,960
please, take a look.

783
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:54,260
I've never seen such a spiritual and exquisite work

784
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,260
in my life.

785
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,260
Since the little portrait is done,

786
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,260
let's pick another marriage proposal.

787
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,260
Mar...

788
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,260
Marriage proposal?

789
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,260
Look.

790
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,260
These words are written by the two of you.

791
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,260
They are written by the two of you.

792
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,260
Marriage proposal?

793
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,260
Look.

794
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,260
These words are written by the two of you.

795
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,260
They are written by the two of you.

796
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,260
And some literary furniture.

797
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,260
You can put the paper on the paper

798
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,260
you like.

799
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,260
You misunderstood.

800
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,260
We are not...

801
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,260
Family and children are like family.

802
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,260
They are far apart.

803
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,260
Isn't this the marriage proposal you wrote to me?

804
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,260
These words are from the novel of the two girls.

805
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,260
It's about a girl named Liang Nu

806
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,260
who is in love with her lover.

807
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,260
But her parents are not in good terms.

808
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,260
They failed to get married.

809
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,260
The lover died.

810
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,260
They became stars.

811
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,260
The story is good.

812
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,260
But the ending is not good.

813
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,260
Good.

814
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,260
You gave me this marriage proposal

815
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,260
to make up for the past.

816
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,260
I guess I'm going to lose my husband.

817
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,260
If a man like you

818
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,260
is not a cultivator,

819
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,260
how many women in the world should you seduce?

820
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,260
Which one do you like?

821
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,260
I like...

822
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,260
Marriage proposal.

823
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,260
I like...

824
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,260
This is a love story.

825
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,260
It's from the novel of the two girls.

826
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,260
Two of them

827
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,260
are called Zhilan and Yushu.

828
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,260
Then they

829
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,260
got married and got married.

830
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,260
They are married.

831
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,260
Zhilan and Yushu

832
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,260
we just met.

833
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,260
It seems like

834
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,260
they are destined to be together.

835
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,260
A life and a life.

836
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,260
A life and a life.

837
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,260
A life and a life.

838
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,260
Don't forget.

839
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,260
Don't leave.

840
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,260
I understand.

841
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,260
What do you understand?

842
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,260
Why do you read the wedding proposal again?

843
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,260
Maybe

844
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,260
you want to choose this one

845
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,260
when you send me the wedding proposal again.

846
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,260
Yan.

847
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,260
I actually plan to

848
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,260
take off the robe

849
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,260
after the withdrawal.

850
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,260
I will resign as a judge.

851
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,260
Shiyou.

852
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,260
Shiyou.

853
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,260
Shiyou.

854
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,260
Chu Tongning.

855
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,260
I finally found you.

856
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,260
Something happened to your brother.

857
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,260
I heard that

858
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,260
he was carried back to Jialan.

859
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,260
I met you.

860
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:18,260
How can this be called fate?

861
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,260
How can the flow of flow be so beautiful?

862
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,260
Love and hate are not clear.

863
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,260
How can the willow tree be so deep?

864
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,260
How can the wishful thinking be so far away?

865
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:42,260
How can the shadow be so bright?

866
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,260
The more lonely, the more tears are shed.

867
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,260
Your heart is cut off.

868
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,260
A wind is in my soul.

869
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:03,260
The heart is in my feet.

870
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:07,260
I don't care about you.

871
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,260
Your heart is cut off.

872
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,260
A wind is in my soul.

873
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,260
The heart can be cut into pieces.

874
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,260
You and I are just like a necklace.

875
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,260
Your heart is cut off.

876
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,260
A wind is in my soul.

877
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,260
The heart is in my feet.

878
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,260
I don't care about you.

879
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,260
Your heart is cut off.

880
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,260
A wind is in my soul.

881
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,260
The heart can be cut into pieces.

882
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,260
You and I are just like a necklace.

883
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:12,260
How can we meet?

884
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:18,260
How can this be called fate?
