1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please give me a life of shining fortune

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want to be your rain

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to be your rain

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But I ask you to give me the courage

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I want to be your rain

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But I ask you to give me the courage

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to be your rain

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But I ask you to give me the courage

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I guess it's right

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:17,820
The

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I was swallowed by chaos when I was traveling with my husband

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Now, my husband has already turned into a white bone

14
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I am the only one who can do this

15
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I haven't seen my friends for a long time

16
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There are also ghosts here

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
They are so fierce

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You should go into the house with me

19
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Grandma, be careful

20
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hurry up

21
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Come

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Children, you must be tired

23
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Come, wipe your sweat

24
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Come, wipe your sweat first

25
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Thank you, grandma

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Good

27
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have been searching for the secret for twenty years

28
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But I can't find a way to escape

29
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Come, drink some water

30
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I am so happy to meet you

31
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Grandma, someone is waiting for us outside

32
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why don't you go out with us?

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What's good about being outside?

34
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The young master beside you is not a child

35
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Only here can you two be together forever

36
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
From now on, he will always see you

37
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He will never tolerate anyone else

38
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Isn't it good?

39
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Grandma, you are wrong

40
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't want to stay with him forever

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's only half a day

42
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Right?

43
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Come

44
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
She is right

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We are going to stay here

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What did you say?

47
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
She doesn't want to stay

48
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You are hungry after walking for a long time

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Come

50
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Have some cake

51
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We shouldn't eat strangers' food

52
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Since we are going to stay here forever

53
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
How can she be a stranger?

54
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes, you are right

55
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Come

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Open your mouth, I will feed you

57
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You two can stay here forever

58
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Come

59
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't worry, it's not poisonous

60
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's dust

61
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's a food spirit

62
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We need to break its food to deal with it

63
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Most people can't satisfy its desire because they are cautious

64
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The more it refuses, the more it eats

65
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Why don't you eat it?

66
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let me eat it

67
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There is no fast food here

68
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How can I eat it?

69
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ok

70
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You are noble, I am wild

71
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I deserve to eat earth

72
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes, you have tasted earth

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If it's not delicious, why should I eat it?

74
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You

75
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I am so unlucky to see the imperial edict today

76
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's the dead room

77
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The moon is full, the water is full

78
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The one who is angry will be angry, the one who is angry will be angry

79
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What does it mean?

80
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Greed, hatred, and eating

81
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Three rules have been broken

82
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This should be a way to escape

83
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But I haven't figured it out yet

84
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Did you think about it when you came here?

85
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can't get out of here with me

86
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Shao Siming

87
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You are so noble and decent

88
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You risk your life for a reckless and reckless person like me

89
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Is it true?

90
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I am talking to you

91
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I am talking to you

92
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't need to give you this answer

93
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Because we can get out

94
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Look, that's the exit

95
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes, it's not

96
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What does it mean?

97
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
There is no exit

98
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There is no exit

99
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No exit

100
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
There is no exit

101
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
No exit

102
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
No exit

103
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No exit

104
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No exit

105
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I can escape safely if I push you into the cave and trap you in the chaos

106
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What did you say?

107
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I came here to help me cultivate myself through the power of the chaos

108
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So you came to save me and lied to me

109
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You are just lucky to be sucked into the chaos

110
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But you are just right to use me

111
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Anyway, something happened to you during the reading contest

112
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's just an accident

113
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I won't blame myself in the future

114
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't believe it

115
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't believe it

116
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I lied to you before

117
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This time, you are still so easy to lie to

118
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You

119
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Either I push you down or you jump down yourself

120
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Anyway, you have no other way to go

121
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You can only fool me

122
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You play tricks on me

123
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You look down on me

124
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I hate you

125
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I hate you

126
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I hate you

127
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You are so brilliant

128
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How can you guess the way to escape?

129
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You are so brilliant

130
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Everything is in your expectation

131
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You will lose if you win

132
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You will lose if you win

133
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You will lose if you win

134
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You will lose if you win

135
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
This cave is closed by many grudges

136
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It will only open for those who hate you to the end

137
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If I don't let him hate me to the end

138
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
How can he have a chance to turn the dead into living and return to the human world?

139
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But you are so attentive

140
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He will not know when he jumps down

141
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He will only hate you when he passes through that cave

142
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He can't wait for you to die

143
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
His strong resentment will reflect on you

144
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And put you in this place

145
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And be destroyed by me

146
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Zhu Yan

147
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Zhu Yan

148
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Qingge

149
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Where is this?

150
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Qingyuan Peak

151
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
How long has it been?

152
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The time of Yizhu Xiang

153
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You were swallowed by that black fog

154
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
How did you escape?

155
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I was so scared

156
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
How did you escape?

157
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
One day in the cave

158
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
One moment in the world

159
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm still alive

160
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
When he knows what you did just now

161
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It was to save him

162
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But because of his resentment

163
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
He will be sad

164
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This is the hope I'm looking forward to

165
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm here

166
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
How could it be good thoughts?

167
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I've never seen anyone jump down and die

168
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What's left is good thoughts

169
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
When did you get the news of his secret?

170
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is all your eardrums

171
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I naturally have no chance to tell him everything

172
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You said

173
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He said his feelings

174
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
As long as it's because of me

175
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Will return to me

176
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Just didn't expect

177
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's all good thoughts

178
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I think he must have guessed my mind

179
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Whether it's the crown prince or Shao Siming

180
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He believed in me

181
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm not good at gambling

182
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But I can't be disappointed today

183
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I can't be disappointed

184
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He saved me

185
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I didn't guess

186
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Either I push you down

187
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Or you jump down yourself

188
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Anyway, you have no other way to go

189
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You will only fool me

190
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Cheat me

191
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Look down on me

192
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I hate you

193
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I hate you

194
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But why don't I believe you will be like this?

195
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Then how should you escape?

196
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Where are you now?

197
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Zhu Yan

198
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Zhu Yan, what's wrong with you?

199
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We can't afford to delay

200
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Let's go now

201
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Go find Yugu

202
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Aren't you unwilling to be defeated by the Jiuyi Mountain?

203
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

204
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Maybe Yugu can find his master

205
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Stop talking nonsense

206
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Let's go

207
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Report

208
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Sir, Shao Siming wants to go down the mountain again

209
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What's the excuse this time?

210
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Shao Siming wants to go to the market

211
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Go to the beauty group

212
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Order afternoon tea and coffee milk tea

213
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Send it home

214
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Report

215
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Sir, Shao Siming wants to eat fresh fruit

216
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
He has to go down the mountain to pick it up

217
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Still go to the beauty group

218
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Fresh fruit cut

219
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Delivery in 30 minutes

220
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Report

221
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why do you go down the mountain again?

222
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He has a beauty group to order a bouquet of flowers for you

223
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Beauty group

224
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
A little helper in a beautiful life

225
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I invite you to continue watching Yugu Yao

226
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Honorable master

227
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
A little princess

228
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Is it worth your life?

229
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
How can you endure the new king's wolf liver?

230
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Back then, I didn't get any advantage

231
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
from that chaos

232
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You, on the other hand

233
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You don't even want to think about it and you just throw it in

234
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If it's a natural disaster

235
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I will never intervene

236
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But that chaos is coming after Qiong Qi

237
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And that Qiong Qi is deliberately guided

238
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
To attack them

239
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I can't just ignore it

240
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's what I mean

241
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Qing Gang

242
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Is the one who was sent by the Qing family

243
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
To see you die

244
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I will not show mercy

245
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Although he is not your opponent

246
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But the Qing family is good at poisoning

247
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If you leave him in the mountains

248
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You and Yanzhi will not be fooled by his scheme

249
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Whether Qing Gang wants to kill me or not

250
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's all about the future

251
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But if I didn't do it

252
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The children of the Liao family

253
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Someone will lose their lives today

254
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Since the opening of the mountain

255
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
When there was a slaughter

256
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Such a terrible thing happened

257
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I was the first to kill myself

258
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Such a bloody case happened

259
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Then what will I do in the future?

260
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
To be slaughtered and slaughtered

261
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Bastard

262
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Their lives are more than half as important as yours

263
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Even if something happens

264
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You don't have to worry

265
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I promise no one dares to tell the truth

266
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Honorable master

267
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Cultivation is to protect the people

268
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
How can you use people's lives as grass?

269
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
If you want to be a good person

270
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
To become a person who is not good

271
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Then I won't accept it

272
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I will not accept it

273
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Good

274
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I will not interfere with your selection in the future

275
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But what you said just now

276
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I was suspicious

277
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You and Zhu Yan

278
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Have you ever been in a relationship?

279
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
This is what you do to save him

280
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Honorable master, you worry too much

281
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The disciple and Zhu Yan are not even

282
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And with his ability

283
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It is impossible to stay on the mountain in the future

284
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Follow me to practice

285
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yin

286
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yin

287
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I know you are kind

288
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Don't want others to be burdened by your cause

289
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But you also have to know

290
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
If you have seen him before

291
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
He is the one you are destined to

292
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I will not keep him

293
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So I also believe you

294
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I won't keep him in the mountains either

295
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Right?

296
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Since the disciples no matter how to explain

297
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Honorable master is always in a fight

298
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Then listen to the teacher

299
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I will not keep him

300
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I will not keep him

301
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I will not keep him

302
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I will not keep him

303
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I will not keep him

304
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I will not keep him

305
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I will not keep him

306
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I will not keep him

307
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I will not keep him

308
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I will not keep him

309
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I will not keep him

310
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If he can still let me go

311
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Then he should be fine

312
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Get out of chaos

313
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Brother Qing, please

314
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You and me are together

315
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
We will bring a good time

316
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Don't let me down

317
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's a good opportunity

318
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,920
Hurry up.

319
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,320
Yan.

320
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,980
Yan.

321
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Why is Snow White not brought back?

322
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
This barrier should be set by the person who helped me.

323
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,000
The jade Valley is mine now.

324
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,360
Which group can reach the summit first

325
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,480
and get the jade valley?

326
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,840
The winner of this group

327
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,480
can become the first disciple of Mount Jiuyi.

328
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,120
Oh no.

329
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
I forgot to say something about the last life.

330
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,080
I'm sorry.

331
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,160
I forgot to say something about the last life.

332
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,360
Jingjing.

333
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,080
Jingjing.

334
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,280
Jingjing.

335
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,920
Jingjing.

336
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,480
Jingjing.

337
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,400
Jingjing.

338
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
Jingjing.

339
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,640
Infanta Snow Northern.

340
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,720
sis.

341
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,760
Infanta Snow Northern.

342
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,960
Sister.

343
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,080
Bai Xue Lu, everything is caused by the jade bone.

344
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
You must destroy it.

345
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
No, the jade bone is mine.

346
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,080
The hand-pulling is mine too.

347
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,080
I will never give up on the jade bone.

348
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Sister, let go of me!

349
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Qing Ge! Qing Ge!

350
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
Qing Ge! Qing Ge!

351
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Sister!

352
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080
Shen Ying!

353
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Bai Xue Lu, destroy the jade bone!

354
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
You will cause a big fight!

355
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
Stop stealing the jade bone from me!

356
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
It's not the time!

357
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
You will die too!

358
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,080
Even if I die, I will die with the jade bone.

359
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,080
Bai Xue Lu!

360
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
Sister!

361
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,080
Hao Yan!

362
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,080
Sister!

363
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,080
You...

364
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,080
So it was just a fantasy.

365
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,080
I know.

366
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,080
This is the Second Pond.

367
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,080
A Yan, you would rather destroy the jade bone than sacrifice yourself.

368
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
You also want to save us.

369
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
You are very kind.

370
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,080
Kindness is the most important thing.

371
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,080
Shao Si Ming wanted to find someone kind to be his first disciple.

372
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
He wanted to save us.

373
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,080
He wanted to save us.

374
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
He wanted to save us.

375
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,080
He wanted to save us.

376
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,080
He wanted to save us.

377
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,080
He wanted to save us.

378
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
For helping someone become his first disciple,

379
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,080
the jade bone chose you.

380
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,080
Congratulations, A Yan!

381
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,080
I was the one who got the jade bone.

382
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Give it back to me.

383
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,080
Why should I give it to you?

384
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Whether it's strength or character,

385
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,080
you are not qualified to be Shao Si Ming's first disciple.

386
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,080
Qing Gang got hurt because he was trying to save you.

387
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,080
This jade bone belongs to Qing Gang.

388
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,080
Give it to me!

389
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,420
I have to go burn some bang

390
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,080
you

391
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:30,520
Talk to it

392
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,440
Da

393
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,200
смыс歉

394
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,040
Are you all right

395
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,760
Where is sister and general Qing

396
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,640
Sister.

397
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,560
Bai Shui Lu.

398
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
Hold on tight.

399
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,600
Sister.

400
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,080
So stupid.

401
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,920
Every today,

402
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,200
He is indeed out of trouble.

403
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,840
After the ceremony,

404
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,560
I can go down the mountain with peace of mind.

405
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,880
According to the rules of the competition,

406
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,520
all the disciples who reach Qianyue Peak

407
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,040
can enter my Jiuyishan.

408
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,680
You can be the disciple of the Young Minister

409
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,520
and practice the art of magic with him for a month.

410
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,080
Yes, Your Highness.

411
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

412
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,680
The winner who gets the Yugu branch

413
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,040
can be the disciple of the Young Minister.

414
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,640
After the ceremony,

415
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,200
you can stay in the mountain

416
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,520
and practice with the Young Minister for a long time.

417
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,840
I'm weak in magic.

418
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,240
I'm embarrassed by this.

419
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,520
I'm willing to quit the position of the Young Minister's disciple.

420
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,640
Xueying.

421
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,440
In that case,

422
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,680
I'll take the Baixue Road as my first disciple.

423
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,240
Thank you, Young Minister.

424
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,360
Wait.

425
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,080
Greetings, Young Minister.

426
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,000
Your Highness.

427
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,480
I think

428
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,920
Princess Zhuyan

429
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,360
is close to the Yugu branch

430
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,680
but she can give up the Yugu branch to save her friend.

431
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,720
She can't even hold a single iron

432
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,360
on the way to the mountain

433
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,480
but she can defeat Qiongqi.

434
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,040
She shouldn't be chosen.

435
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,080
What do you think of the Young Minister?

436
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,080
I know

437
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,560
you're kind-hearted

438
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,120
and don't want others to be hurt because of you.

439
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,880
If you meet her before,

440
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,720
she'll be your destiny.

441
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,360
I won't keep her.

442
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,720
So,

443
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,720
I believe

444
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,960
you won't keep her in the mountain.

445
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,960
You're right.

446
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,640
I was not considerate.

447
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,320
In that case,

448
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,560
I'll take Princess Zhuyan

449
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,040
as my first disciple.

450
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,240
You can follow me.

451
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,720
The rule is

452
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,400
the Yugu branch

453
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,840
can't be changed

454
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,160
and can't be used as a game.

455
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
How about

456
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,400
delaying the selection?

457
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,920
You can observe their

458
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,320
moral and moral values during this period.

459
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,120
After a month,

460
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,320
you can select the first disciple.

461
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,400
Then,

462
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,080
you'll have both love and etiquette.

463
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,440
What do you think?

464
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,840
I'll do as you say.

465
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,000
Thank you, Young Minister.

466
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,400
The first disciple.

467
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,640
Take it.

468
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,120
You often use the brush

469
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,800
to test the identity of your disciple.

470
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,960
If it's your mound,

471
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,800
kill myself.

472
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,620
The

473
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,620
result

474
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,120
Yuan, can't you get bored inside this mountain just waiting here?

475
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,920
Why did you come to this mountain? Has your pass been passed the exam?

476
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,020
Don't mention it

477
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,560
This Nine-Therads Ring is alwaysiam humdrum-humideo

478
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,880
What I've worked on was more rumored than this

479
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,920
Tell me about it

480
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,600
I met the little Divine Officer before.

481
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,240
He is the new Minister of the Imperial Court.

482
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,040
How is it?

483
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,680
Do you feel surprised?

484
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,440
What's your plan next?

485
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,240
Although I passed the preliminary exam

486
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,520
for some reasons,

487
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,760
I can't...

488
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,400
I can't be his disciple.

489
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,120
Yuan, are you okay?

490
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,880
I'm fine.

491
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,040
Maybe I'm a little tired recently.

492
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,400
Yuan,

493
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,440
I recently learned a technique

494
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,680
of the God of Green Heart on Mount Jiuyi.

495
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,200
Let me try it for you.

496
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,080
God of Green Heart

497
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,440
What's this?

498
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,400
Water Mirror.

499
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,160
I never thought I could see it again

500
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,760
in my life.

501
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,760
This is...

502
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,600
How did you make it?

503
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,520
When the spiritual energy

504
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,240
cook into consultant,

505
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,880
this illusion will appear in a short time

506
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,040
on the Jinhua bodies of the ODES.

507
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,240
People can actually

508
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,720
feel the water flow,

509
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,760
but it's just an illusion.

510
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,280
So, you won't die from it.

511
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,760
This is amazing.

512
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
You're the first time seeing the Mirror Flower Water Moon.

513
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Of course.

514
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
My Niling is not something that anyone can touch.

515
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Really?

516
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
You don't believe it?

517
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
I don't believe it.

518
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
I just want to see it.

519
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
You can't see it.

520
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
You can't see it?

521
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
I can't see it.

522
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
You can't see it?

523
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
You can't see it?

524
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
I can't see it.

525
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
You can't see it?

526
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
You don't believe it?

527
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
The Water Sword

528
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
is the weapon that we use to teach people to live with their souls.

529
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Only when the Mirror Flower Water Moon appears for the first time

530
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
can we draw it out.

531
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
This Water Sword

532
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
was drawn by you.

533
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
If that's the case,

534
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
this sword will follow you from now on.

535
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
I also hope

536
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
that I am the first

537
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,600
and the last person to see your Mirror Flower Water Moon.

538
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Move it four steps forward and turn.

539
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
The third energy beam

540
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,600
that appeared

541
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
is called Dwarf Shift.

542
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
It Kitty can bye to her mother.

543
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:14,500
The

544
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,500
one

545
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,060
100

546
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,560
audience

547
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,040
introducing

548
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,400
taking

549
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,000
it

550
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:28,720
into

551
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,260
his

552
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,460
hands

553
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,520
Your Highness.

554
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,360
I don't want to disappoint her.

555
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,000
Thank you, An Yuan.

556
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,000
I wanted to help you get rid of your troubles,

557
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,480
but you comforted me again.

558
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,040
In the water,

559
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,000
I feel very peaceful

560
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,320
and at ease.

561
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,640
I've figured out a lot of things.

562
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,840
People's emotions are the same as the water.

563
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,880
They can't be controlled by force.

564
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,440
They can go wherever they want.

565
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,080
That's the most free and comfortable way.

566
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,200
Emotions are like the water.

567
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,440
I have to follow my heart

568
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,120
and ask Young Commander to say thank you.

569
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,760
No matter how much he said to me before,

570
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,000
he saved me this time.

571
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,960
Although I really don't want to go back to Mount Jiuyi,

572
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,640
I have to do what I should do.

573
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,760
He saved you?

574
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,120
Are you all right?

575
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,520
Why is the route to Mount Jiuyi so dangerous?

576
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,720
No, no, it's nothing.

577
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,160
An Yuan, it's all in the past.

578
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,440
I'm going back to the mountain now.

579
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
You have to take good care of yourself.

580
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,720
I'll come to you after I say thank you to Young Commander.

581
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,520
Your Highness.

582
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,520
Your...

583
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,080
The one who was killed

584
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,120
actually stayed to listen to the school.

585
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,040
If I had known, I shouldn't have let him go.

586
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,040
I even made him ally with Qinggang.

587
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,240
Otherwise,

588
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,120
even if you kick him out of the Chaos Manor,

589
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,480
he won't be able to reach the top of the mountain.

590
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,160
I really regret it.

591
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,400
I would have a lot of curse words if I regret it.

592
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,760
If you really die in the hands of that one who was killed,

593
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,600
I would have no control over the world

594
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,320
and no one would be able to see it.

595
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,640
Forget it.

596
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,440
I don't want to

597
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,520
accept the curse words.

598
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,960
He will go down the mountain after the month of the fish.

599
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,000
But didn't you say

600
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,720
you would make him your disciple?

601
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,520
That was because you were suspicious

602
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,560
about my saving him

603
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,040
and told me on purpose.

604
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,760
That's why I agreed.

605
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,640
Look.

606
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,720
Didn't he regret it immediately?

607
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,080
Then...

608
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,040
What if a miracle really happens?

609
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,000
What if Zhu Yan really becomes your disciple?

610
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,280
Besides,

611
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,120
I don't think you have

612
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,040
any...

613
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,240
With his ability,

614
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,280
how can he be my disciple?

615
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,200
You're right.

616
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,640
The Chis are on the edge of the earth.

617
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,840
Even if the King of Chis spent a lot of money

618
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,520
to find a skilled craftsman,

619
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,120
he can't stay long.

620
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,280
He can only be taught three moves

621
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,080
by the way of watering the pavilion.

622
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,800
His power can be used in the West Desert.

623
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,920
But if he is placed in the empty pit

624
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,040
and compared with the other six generations,

625
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,320
he can only be considered

626
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,040
a man who can do everything.

627
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,720
Yes.

628
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,560
I...

629
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,280
A man who can do everything?

630
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,320
How dare you talk about me like that?

631
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,720
Forget it.

632
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,200
I'm here to talk about what I want to talk about.

633
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,720
It has nothing to do with you.

634
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,680
Why are you here?

635
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,440
I'm here to ask you

636
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,880
how you escaped from the chaos.

637
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,000
When did you know that I wanted to save you?

638
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,800
When did I escape?

639
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,160
If I didn't know that you were trying to save me,

640
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,080
wouldn't you have been buried in the midst of chaos?

641
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,800
Don't you really think

642
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,160
I would put myself in danger

643
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,760
to save you?

644
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,120
Since I can be buried in the midst of chaos,

645
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,960
I will have a way to get out of it.

646
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,040
Good.

647
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,280
That's good.

648
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,200
No matter why you saved me,

649
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,040
you always saved me from the chaos.

650
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,960
I, Zhu Yan, am not an unreasonable person.

651
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,960
I'm here to thank you.

652
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,440
Thank you.

653
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,480
The second reason I'm here

654
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,240
is to say goodbye to you.

655
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,920
Mount Jiuyi is a sacred place of empty-sand art.

656
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,200
You are a master with a high level of skill.

657
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,680
Since you think

658
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,280
I'm stupid, reckless,

659
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,840
and shallow-minded,

660
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,160
I don't have to stay in Mount Jiuyi.

661
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,440
Although I'm not as good as others,

662
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,640
I will find a master who will recognize me

663
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,080
and appreciate me

664
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,880
and teach me high-level art.

665
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,720
You always smile.

666
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
He wants to leave.

667
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,600
He will do something about it.

668
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
He can't leave.

669
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,520
There's a saying in Mount Jiuyi.

670
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,640
Those who seek knowledge but can't be used,

671
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,480
those who fail to learn, will not leave.

672
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,760
If you want to leave,

673
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,160
you can wait until a month later,

674
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,440
and go back home after the school is full.

675
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,480
But not now.

676
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,440
Even if I don't stop you,

677
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,960
the legal world will stop you.

678
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
The Grand Minister of War will stop you even more.

679
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,600
Those who seek knowledge but can't be used,

680
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,360
those who fail to learn, will not leave.

681
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,480
This is the rule.

682
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,680
So, Lord Chongming,

683
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,720
is it also a rule to interfere in the election?

684
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,480
You...

685
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,080
I made the decision

686
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,240
and it has nothing to do with you.

687
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,000
Besides, you've punished me.

688
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,400
Okay.

689
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,960
But when you

690
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,280
were a little officer in the King's Valley,

691
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,560
you also said

692
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,320
you can't follow the rules.

693
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,600
You still followed my rules.

694
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,160
It shows that

695
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,000
you can't change the rules.

696
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,800
That's a different matter.

697
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,040
You made a vow

698
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,200
not to leak the matter of the Grand Minister of War.

699
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,760
I, Zhu Yan, am a man of my word.

700
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,200
I will keep my word

701
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,840
about what I promised.

702
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,040
That's good.

703
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,080
But the Grand Minister of War

704
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,240
said he would never see me again.

705
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,440
But because of a word of the Grand Minister of War,

706
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,400
he wants to make me the chief disciple.

707
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,960
I am a human.

708
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,920
I'm not a heartless bird

709
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,480
whose legs are hvad and hlas so защound My Lady!

710
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,760
You little girl...

711
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,880
My Lord.

712
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,960
How can I be with you?

713
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,960
How can I never love you?

714
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:05,960
Why do tears come to my eyes?

715
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,960
You are the one who is in my heart

716
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,960
You can't be wrong about me

717
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,960
I have been waiting for you for thousands of years

718
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,960
I am by your side

719
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,960
The cold blood of your heart

720
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,960
You can't be wrong about me

721
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,960
I am more sincere than you

722
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,960
You are the one who is in my heart

723
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,960
I am by your side

724
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,960
The cold blood of your heart

725
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,960
You can't be wrong about me

726
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,960
I am more sincere than you

727
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,960
You can't be wrong about me
