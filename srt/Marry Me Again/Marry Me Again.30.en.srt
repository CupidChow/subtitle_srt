00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,920
He's strapped explosives on me.

4
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,400
Explosives!

5
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,360
Run...

6
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,430
Mu Huaijin, are you crazy?

7
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,350
Stop talking!

8
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,200
You'd better let us go.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,640
Or I'll blow you all up.

10
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,480
Sister, you go first.

11
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,870
Nianbai,

12
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,150
be careful.

13
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,360
She is Hua Ruoyu's biological sister.

14
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,590
If Hua Ruoyu were alive,

15
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,280
would she want this?

16
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,560
Yu...

17
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,390
Yu will be back soon.

18
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,920
I'm about to get my Yu back.

19
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,790
It's all because of you.

20
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,640
Now she's not Yu anymore.

21
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,440
She'll never become Yu.

22
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,200
Tang Jingxing,

23
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,390
you ruined everything.

24
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,640
I should've ended you back then!

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,920
Huaijin,

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,710
come at me.

27
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,790
Let Hua Ruoyi go.

28
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,950
Spare Hua Ruoyu.

29
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,480
Don't you hate me?

30
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,550
Come at me.

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,270
You want to save her, huh?

32
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,670
Alright.

33
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,330
If you want to save her,

34
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,510
stab yourself with this.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,950
No, don't listen to him, Tang Jingxing.

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,880
Don't listen to him.

37
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,280
Mu Huaijin, are you crazy?

38
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,200
Stop arguing!

39
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,320
Huaijin, I'm begging you.

40
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,910
I'll become my sister.

41
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,120
I'll marry you, okay?

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,830
- Hurry up!
- Don't push him!

43
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,230
Tang Jingxing!

44
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,200
I beg you, let him go.

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,760
Tang Jingxing!

46
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,310
Tang Jingxing,

47
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,550
don't listen to him.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
- I beg you.
- Hurry up.

49
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,640
You can't leave me again.

50
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,280
- Stay calm.
- I beg you.

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,110
Don't listen to him, okay?

52
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,950
Mu Huaijin!

53
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,600
Chuxia,

54
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,440
I said I wouldn't lie to you anymore.

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,670
I'm begging you.

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,480
Be good.

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,270
Close your eyes.

58
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,750
No.

59
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,670
No!

60
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680

90
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,350
How is he?

91
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,760
Just finished surgery.

92
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,200
The doctor said
he'd wake up in a few hours.

93
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,340
I heard Mu Huaijin

94
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,990
confess everything
at the police station.

95
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,920
Actually,

96
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,590
he had always loved my sister.

97
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,950
They were about to get married.

98
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,320
After she passed away,

99
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,350
he couldn't handle it.

100
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,440
That's why he changed his mind.

101
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,080
When I appeared later,

102
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,840
he wanted

103
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,200
to make me her substitute.

104
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,950
That's why he acted that way.

105
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,560
I always thought he was crazy,

106
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,000
but surprisingly,

107
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,350
he was a romantic fool.

108
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,710
Yi,

109
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,080
I'm sorry for what happened before.

110
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,750
I admit defeat.

111
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,680
It's not for you

112
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,730
but for him.

113
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,590
He truly loves you.

114
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,870
Treat him well.

115
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,030
The doctor said your right leg...

116
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,630
It might stay like this forever.

117
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,040
Maybe it's karma

118
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,670
for my past bad deeds.

119
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,990

123
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,830
I bought it long ago.

124
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,520
I was going
to leave it to you in my will.

125
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,030
I know you have management skills.

126
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,590
But I can't give you the Hua Group.

127
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,840
