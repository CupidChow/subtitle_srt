=Episode 10=

3
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,720
You?

4
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,390
You'd better not disturb me
while I'm working.

5
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,790
I need to find new influencers
to collaborate with quickly.

6
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,360
Only then can my work continue.

7
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,980
You're not looking
for Louis anymore?

8
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,760
I've already tried so many methods.

9
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,120
I'm about to give up.

10
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,870
Huaijin recommended

11
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,640
a few new influencers to me.

12
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,840
I'm planning to pick a few
and chat with them.

13
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,000
You've invested so much already.

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,030
How can you just give up like that?

15
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,040
I think Huaijin has a point.

16
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,790
I can't keep clinging
to one option, can I?

17
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,080
Do you believe everything
Mu Huaijin says?

18
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,920
Can't you have your own ideas?

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,890
Look at the kind of people
he's finding for you.

20
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,280
They're nothing compared to Louis.

21
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,640
Why are you so upset?

22
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,000
I forgot.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,430
You're a fan of Louis, right?

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,000
I can't arrange a meeting for you two.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,860
I'm really sorry.

26
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,840
You must be disappointed.

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,120
But it's okay.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,590
There'll be another chance.

29
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,900
(Louis)

30
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,420
(Louis)

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,880
(With such obvious evidence,)

32
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,040
(surely you'd realize I'm Louis.)

33
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,160
What's wrong with you?

34
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,440
Why are you in such pain?

35
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,190
- I'll take you...
- Don't...

36
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,000
move.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,920
I...

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,110
I'm the heiress of the Hua family.

39
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,040
I absolutely can't let anyone
take unflattering photos of me.

40
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,150
What's the situation?

41
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,290
And you're doing your makeup?

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,640
Let's go to the hospital.

43
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,790
Hold on.

44
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,420
Shoes...

45
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,510
Stop shaking, you'll mess it up.

46
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,860
(Clinic Building)

47
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,790
Nurse,

48
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,230
I know what's wrong with me.

49
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,440
Just ask the doctor
to prescribe me some medicine.

50
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,430
The doctor said

51
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,320
your condition

52
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,630
can't be treated conservatively anymore.

53
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,990
You need surgery immediately.

54
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,230
What?

55
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,200
My hemorrhoids are that serious already?

56
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,270
Get a family member to sign the consent.

57
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,190
Sign it?

58
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,430
Let him?

59
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,240
No...

60
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,160
If he signs it,

61
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,800
I'd rather die from the pain.

62
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,750
If you don't get the surgery,

63
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,680
the wound could get infected and worse.

64
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,830
Still no.

65
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,920
He can't sign it.

66
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,040
Your hemorrhoids have ruptured,

67
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,960
why worry now?

68
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,000
How dare you eavesdrop?

69
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,590
You were so loud! Who couldn't hear?

70
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,950
Yi, about the budget,

71
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,740
I've already helped you
apply for approval.

72
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,670
The factory can
start production anytime.

73
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,270
Great, thanks!

74
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,830
Why are you hiding?

75
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,640
No...

76
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,310
No!

77
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,320
Is it Nianbai?

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,750
Aunt Nianqi, I have to go.

79
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,710
I'll hang up now. Bye.

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,720
Hello?

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,720
Are you a snail?

82
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,120
Isn't it hot under the covers?

83
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,390
I don't want to see you.

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,630
I'll come out when you leave.

85
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,550
Alright.

86
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,830
Then I won't leave.

87
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,600
Let's see how long you can hold out.

88
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,800
Lu Nianbai,

89
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,320
if that's how it is,

90
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,390
don't blame me
for silencing you permanently.

91
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,480
You won't leave?

92
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,510
You won't leave now?

93
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,430
I'll make you leave!

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,040
She just had surgery.

95
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,700
You couple should
be careful of her wound.

96
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,240
We're not a couple.

97
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,200
He's my uncle.

98
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,760
Your uncle looks really young.

99
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,100
What happened to your hand?

100
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,950
It's nothing, just a burn.

101
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,350
Let me help you with that.

102
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,720
No need.

103
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
It's fine.
Just a few minutes. No trouble.

104
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,930
Can I add you on WeChat?

105
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,720
No?

106
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,910
Well, maybe it's okay.

107
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,760
Nurse,

108
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,350
don't be fooled
by how young my uncle looks.

109
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,560
He's actually over 50.

110
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,050
And he's been divorced twice.

111
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,150
Don't fall for his appearance.

112
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,190
Forget it then.

113
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,560
You should walk more after surgery.

114
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,590
It helps with passing gas.

115
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,350
I'm over 50

116
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,770
and twice divorced?

117
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,870
What?

118
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,240
Did I ruin your plan?

119
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,910
Why are you upset today?

120
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,840
Am I?

121
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,020
Didn't you tell me to quit drinking?

122
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,440
I'm having withdrawal symptoms.

123
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,180
Really?

124
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,020
Move aside.

125
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,420
Why was I angry just now?

126
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,620
Was I jealous?

127
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,460
No way.

128
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,620
How could I possibly
be jealous over Lu Nianbai?

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,620
It must be the anesthesia
messing with my head.

130
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,660
I'm not fully awake yet,

131
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,060
so I mixed up Tang Jingxing
and Lu Nianbai.

132
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,220
Mi Chuxia,

133
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,300
get a grip.

134
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,580
He's Lu Nianbai,

135
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,740
not Tang Jingxing.

136
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,980
Nice.

137
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,220
Suddenly,

138
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,900
I'm in an excellent mood.

139
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,300
I'm not afraid to face him anymore.

140
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,500
Why are you still here?

141
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,620
You've been in there so long.

142
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,840
If you hadn't come out in 30 seconds,

143
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,120
I'd have barged in to rescue you.

144
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,380
Come on, I was just using the bathroom.

145
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,620
It's not like it was dangerous.

146
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,020
No need to exaggerate.

147
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,500
Don't you know after hemorrhoid surgery,

148
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,050
sitting too long can tear the wound?

149
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,940
You sure know a lot.

150
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,060
I have to.

151
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,830
As your elder,

152
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,100
it's my responsibility
to take care of you.

153
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,760
Of course,
I'd learn about your condition.

154
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,230
It sounds like you went out of your way

155
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,100
to research it.

156
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,180
Of course.

157
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,220
I've seen lots of pictures.

158
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,300
- Chuxia!
- Just like your...

159
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,780
If you tell anyone else

160
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,060
about my hemorrhoids,

161
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,940
I'll take you down with me.

162
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,710
Blink if you understand.

163
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,580
What are you two...?

164
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,630
Uncle said his tooth hurts.

165
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,200
Let me take a look.

166
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,820
It seems like a cavity.

167
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,070
Let me see.

168
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,020
It's all in your head,

169
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,940
Uncle.

170
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,200
Huaijin,

171
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,100
why are you here?

172
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,850
Ms. Lu told me you were ill,

173
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,480
so I rushed over.

174
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,660
What's wrong?

175
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,020
Where are you sick?

176
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,190
She just had...

177
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,580
Well, it's not a big deal.

178
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,940
Just had a useless

179
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,980
secondary tissue removed.

180
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,660
- Her removal...
- It wasn't a major surgery.

181
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,980
Look at me now.

182
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,980
Perfectly healthy,

183
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,830
right?

184
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,740
Totally fine,

185
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,660
right?

186
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,140
(Quick, hide that cushion.)

187
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,660
(Aren't you tired?)

188
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,900
(It's just hemorrhoids.)

189
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,980
(What's the big deal?)

190
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,300
(Why are you frozen?)

191
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,220
(Hurry up!)

192
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,360
(Do you care that much)

193
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,500
(about his opinion?)

194
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,140
(Come on!)

195
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,460
(I don't want anyone else to know)

196
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,380
(I have hemorrhoids.)

197
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,300
(Why can you share secrets
with Lu Nianbai)

198
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,660
(but not with me?)

199
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,890
Chuxia, are you hungry?

200
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,580
Should I get you something to eat?

201
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,820
I can't eat much yet.

202
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,460
But I'm tired of lying down.

203
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,540
I want to walk around.

204
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,940
Then I'll take you...

205
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,540
No need.

206
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,380
Uncle and I
still have things to discuss.

207
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,340
You must be busy too.

208
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,420
Don't worry about me.

209
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
He's here, that's enough.

210
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,500
Right, Uncle?

211
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,260
Yes.

212
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,340
Let's go then.

213
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,580
(No way.)

214
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,180
(Not here.)

215
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,940
(Hold it in.)

216
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,420
(Hold it in!)

217
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,660
(Wait until we're outside.)

218
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,580
Chuxia,

219
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,740
what's wrong?

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,200
- You don't look...
- Don't...

221
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,060
Don't touch me.

222
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,980
She said don't touch her.

223
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,060
What's it to you?

224
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,140
I'm her uncle.

225
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,500
Of course, I'll protect my niece.
