2
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,940
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,040
I'm willing.

4
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,280
I said I'd be willing
to promote Honey Love.

5
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,230
Really?

6
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,590
Really.

7
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,590
Really?

8
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,640
That's great!

9
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll get you a band-aid.

10
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,950
It just occurred to me
we don't have any at home.

11
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,560
It's fine. The bleeding has stopped.

12
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,680
Let's have breakfast.

13
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,920
It stopped so quickly?

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,840
Are you really okay?

15
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,040
This was custom-made
by a traditional craftsman.

16
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,860
Tang Jingxing seems
to have a glass puppy.

17
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,420
It's made by glassblowing,

18
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,760
a traditional technique.

19
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,710
That's why it looks so special.

20
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,950
(Chuxia,)

21
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,480
(I'm sorry.)

22
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,040
(I still can't tell you
I'm Tang Jingxing.)

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,790
(A year ago)
(A year ago, I narrowly escaped death.)

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,600
(It was Lu Nianqi who saved me.)

25
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,200
You're finally awake.

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,360
That's great.

27
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,270
I thought you'd never wake up.

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,510
(You were the first I wanted to see.)

29
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,550
(But Lu Nianqi told me)

30
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,790
(your father)

31
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,390
(was the mastermind
behind the plot to kill me.)

32
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,920
Do you remember me?

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,200
Sister... Nianqi.

34
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,670
Right, it's me.

35
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,680
My fiancee is back home.

36
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,970
I want to call her.

37
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,350
No, you can't.

38
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,670
Absolutely not.

39
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,790
Do you know

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,190
your fiancee, Mi Chuxia,

41
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,080
is the long-lost heiress
of the Hua family?

42
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,550
Hua Rucheng wants to reclaim her now.

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,670
But he's always been suspicious.

44
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,360
He thinks you got close to Mi Chuxia

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,000
to seize the Hua family's assets.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,600
That's why he sent assassins after you.

47
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,880
(I couldn't believe it was true.)

48
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,960
(But I really saw)

49
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,360
(the news about your return
to the Hua family.)

50
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,550
(I miss you.)

51
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,270
(I couldn't help
but sneak back to find you.)

52
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,760
The sparrow turned
into a golden phoenix.

53
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,990
The Hua Group's Chairman
found his lost daughter.

54
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,990
Miss Hua was already engaged.

55
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,950
And her fiance died overseas.

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,320
(Chuxia,)

57
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,440
(if you had to choose
between your father and me,)

58
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,040
(what would you do?)

59
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,440
(If I'm dead to you,)

60
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,270
(how could I ever face you again?)

61
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,600
(Chuxia,)

62
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,930
(I miss you so much.)

63
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,160
Where did you go?

64
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,110
I'm back home now.

65
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,360
Back home?

66
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,010
What if Hua Rucheng finds out?

67
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,100
You'll be killed.

68
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,200
I know what I'm doing.

69
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,960
I'll return once it's done.

70
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,720
- Hello.
- Hi.

71
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,950
What did that lady order?

72
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,510
She ordered two cocktails.

73
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,640
Could you switch hers to non-alcoholic?

74
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,960
But...

75
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,240
We just separated.

76
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,640
She can't handle much alcohol.

77
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,840
Alright.

78
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,280
Thanks.

79
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,240
(After a year apart,)

80
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,360
(you've gotten bolder)

81
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,350
(and started drinking heavily.)

82
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,280
(I'm really worried.)

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,080
(If I'm not around,)

84
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,270
(who will protect you if you get drunk?)

85
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,960
(Silly girl.)

86
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,150
(Still as confused as before.)

87
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,000
(You even lost the necklace I gave you.)

88
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,680
(If you can't find it later,
you'll cry.)

89
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,270
(Chuxia,)

90
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,590
(please forgive me.)

91
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
(I'm struggling myself now.)

92
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,590
(I can't drag you into this.)

93
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,240
(Please be patient with me.)

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,880
(I'll bring the culprit to justice)

95
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,910
(and come back to you.)

96
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,440
♪I truly hope♪

97
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,580
♪I could have been there
for you all those years♪

98
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,500
I've decided to go back.

99
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,160
Tang Jingxing,

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,470
I can't call you that any more.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,910
I got a fake death certificate for you.

102
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,270
From now on,

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,510
you'll be my younger brother,

104
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,430
Lu Nianbai.

105
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,510
Nianbai,

106
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,830
over the years, I've saved some money
while staying close to Hua Rucheng.

107
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,320
I also found you
a new place in Los Angeles.

108
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,830
In the future,

109
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,030
we can even start our own company.

110
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,170
I can't wait around anymore.

111
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,240
I have to uncover the truth.

112
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,950
We do need to start the company.

113
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,090
It'll be perfect for shorting Hua Group.

114
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,350
If he finds out you're alive,

115
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,640
he won't let you go.

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,150
Tang Jingxing is dead.

117
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,050
Now I'm Lu Nianbai.

118
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,680
I won't spare those who hurt me.

119
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,120
Have a lifelike dummy custom-made.

120
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,560
Make sure everyone witnesses my burial.

121
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,310
Only this way,

122
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,320
when I appear as Lu Nianbai,

123
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,680
no one will suspect me.

124
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,870
(Chuxia,)

125
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,840
(I know meeting you alone is risky.)

126
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,120
(But seeing you cry for me,)

127
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,950
(I couldn't resist coming.)

128
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,150
(You have no idea)

129
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,320
(how much I've missed you
this past year.)

130
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,830
(Things spiraled)

131
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,760
(out of my control.)

132
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,640
(I tried so hard to stay away from you.)

133
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,640
(Yet I couldn't resist your teasing.)

134
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,080
(I wanted to hug you)

135
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,280
(and kiss you.)

136
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,350
(Chuxia,)

137
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,880
(you can't imagine
how much I missed you.)

138
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,240
(You snuck off to drink again)

139
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,150
(and got so drunk)

140
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,590
(that you forgot
you can't handle spicy food.)

141
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,680
(That time, I still couldn't resist
dancing with you.)

142
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,390
(You've improved)

143
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,310
(on the steps I taught you.)

144
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,990
Tang Jingxing!

145
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,880
(Even with a mask,)

146
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,760
(you still recognized me.)

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,150
(But I couldn't respond.)

148
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,480
(Chuxia,)

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,920
(I'm sorry.)

150
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,390
(I can't reveal myself to you yet.)

151
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,560
(There are too many secrets
I haven't uncovered.)

152
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,080
(For your safety,)

153
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,510
(I can't tell you the truth yet.)

154
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,440
(Forgive me.)

155
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,800

as soon as I can.)
