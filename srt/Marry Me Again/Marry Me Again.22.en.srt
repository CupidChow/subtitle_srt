=Episode 22=

3
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,360
Lu Nianbai.

4
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,590
Lu Nianbai...

5
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,870
Lu Nianbai!

6
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,400
Hello, Mr. Mu.

7
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,320
Hello,

8
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,430
are the new items there?

9
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,990
Not yet, Mr. Mu.

10
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,790
Alright, for now.

11
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,630
Hello, Chuxia.

12
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,550
Hello, Huaijin.

13
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,710
The new batch of Honey Love
has already been sent over.

14
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,310
Really?

15
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,310
That's great.

16
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,330
I'll arrange for someone

17
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,310
to handle it immediately.

18
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,320
Sorry about that.

19
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,440
I didn't mean to trouble you.

20
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,630
No worries.

21
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,890
I'm glad the goods have arrived.

22
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,230
There are still a few batches
to be stored.

23
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,880
By the way, is the diamond supplier

24
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,990
still the one Lu Nianbai recommended?

25
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,240
Huaijin,

26
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,080
I'm dating Lu Nianbai now.

27
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,670
So he's handling these matters now,

28
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,790
and I trust him.

29
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,390
If any issues arise,

30
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,920
we'll handle them together.

31
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,630
I see.

32
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,000
Well...

33
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,510
Congratulations.

34
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,760
Thank you.

35
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400
Are you hungry?

36
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,640
Try my signature pasta.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,080
Your cooking is amazing.

38
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,000
If you like it, I'll cook for you daily.

39
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,440
Eating it every day might get boring.

40
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,510
I'll switch up the recipes for you then.

41
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,950
Oh, I have a surprise for you.

42
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,480
What surprise?

43
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,480
Lu Nianbai.

44
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,000
Why are you laughing?

45
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,240
It took a lot of courage to do this.

46
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,390
Why are you suddenly performing for me?

47
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,910
Who's performing?

48
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,640
I just thought that

49
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,070
since you grew up in the U.S.,

50
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,000
your former girlfriends
must've been very open.

51
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,040
I...

52
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,450
I didn't want you to find me boring.

53
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,160
Yi,

54
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,800
I would never think you're boring.

55
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,470
You're the most special person to me.

56
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,320
You don't need to change for me.

57
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,000
Just be your true self.

58
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,040
Really?

59
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,440
Then I'll take your word for it.

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,350
Attorney Wang, take a look at this.

61
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,480
Okay.

62
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,340
(Test subject: Diamond raw materials)

63
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,720
Is this your shared overseas company

64
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,080
with Ms. Lu Nianqi?

65
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,270
The evidence shows that

66
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,430
the materials from your company
show no issues.

67
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,960
I suspect

68
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,800
someone might have swapped them.

69
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,670
Exactly.

70
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,910
But we lack proof of the swap.

71
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,150
I'd like you to act

72
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,630
as a mediator

73
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,370
and file a lawsuit
against me and Lu Nianqi.

74
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,120
You secretly swapped

75
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,100
these substandard diamonds
into the Honey Love batch, right?

76
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,910
So what if I did?

77
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,000
I did all of this for you!

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,150
I'll take back Wanmao myself.

79
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,000
Stay out of my affairs.

80
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,640
And don't harm Mi Chuxia.

81
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,910
If you keep sneaking around,

82
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,440
we're no longer allies,

83
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,550
but enemies.

84
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,120
You've been watching me for so long.

85
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,240
Aren't you going to act?

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,350
I wish I could
watch you like this forever.

87
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,960
Yi,

88
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,350
do whatever you want.

89
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,950
I'll always be here for you.

90
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,340
(Clinic Building)

91
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,470
Slow down.

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,080
Slow down!

93
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,350
Wait for me.

94
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,870
No, I can't.

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,920
I can't.

96
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,320
I really can't run anymore.

97
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,720
You convinced me before

98
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,600
that when promoting Wanmao,

99
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,100
you could even keep up with me
in high heels.

100
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,830
So why is it different now?

101
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,560
Because our relationship
is different now.

102
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,080
So is the treatment.

103
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,080
Let's go.

104
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,880
No, I can't walk anymore.

105
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,660
I'm out of energy. Need a recharge.

106
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,240
Come on, let's go!

107
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,430
Look at this one.

108
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,510
This one's nice.

109
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,430
This one's good too.

110
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,870
The clarity is perfect.

111
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,660
This shot of their eye contact
is amazing.

112
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,270
It truly captures their emotions

113
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,520
and unspoken chemistry.

114
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,560
Shut up!

115
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
Send all your photos

116
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,630
to the media

117
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,660
and hire some people to boost them.

118
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,470
I want Hua Ruoyi to trend again.

119
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,240
Hello.

120
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,200
Ms. Hua, something big has happened.

121
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,510
What's wrong?

122
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,200
Isn't today the Honey Love launch event?

123
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,510
We've rehearsed twice already.

124
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,520
Everything's ready, right?

125
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,960
It's not about the launch.

126
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,350
You should check online now.

127
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Ms. Hua,

128
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,440
our Honey Love has always been

129
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,350
based on your love story with Mr. Tang,

130
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,880
(Shock! President of Wanmao's New Lover!)
promoting the idea of forever love.

131
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,830
Now that people have seen the photos,

132
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,360
- they're saying...
- Saying what?

133
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,280
They're saying that
you betrayed Mr. Tang

134
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,520
and you're using

135
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,630
the deceased for profit.

136
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,680
Everyone has seen the photos now.

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,440
They say
our Honey Love's campaign is fake.

138
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,360
It's just marketing.

139
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,620
They're telling people not to buy it.

140
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,500
Should we issue a statement

141
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,040
to refute the rumors?

142
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,470
You're up.

143
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,120
What's going on?

144
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,150
Ms. Hua,

145
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,270
did I just hear

146
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,920
a man's voice?

147
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,160
Are you really in a relationship?

148
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,120
Yes,

149
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,310
I'm in love.

150
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
What now?

151
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,080
We can't just call it a rumor now.

152
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,160
The company's in chaos

153
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,750
and our phones are ringing off the hook.

154
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,720
Even Louis is affected.

155
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,080
What happened to Louis?

156
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,190
They've found out?

157
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Found out what?

158
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
People are saying online

159
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,110
that Louis shouldn't have promoted us.

160
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,710
All of his past promotions
are being boycotted

161
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,870
and his fans are demanding he

162
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,350
terminate the contract.

163
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,120
Ms. Hua,

164
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,990
with such a huge scandal,

165
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,800
are we still going ahead
with the launch today?

166
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,320
Everyone has worked hard to prepare.

167
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,510
Of course, it's still on.

168
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,390
Don't worry.

169
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,680
Just focus on your tasks.

170
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,130
Sorry,

171
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,480
because of me, you're getting hate too.

172
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,600
Luckily, they don't know

173
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,750
it's you in the photo.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,820
Otherwise,

175
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,860
your reputation would be ruined.

176
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,190
Actually,

177
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,400
not everything they say online is wrong.

178
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,520
I did move on.

179
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,470
In a way,

180
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,470
I let Tang Jingxing down.

181
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,320
You didn't wrong Tang Jingxing.

182
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,680
- Actually, I...
- Lu Nianbai,

183
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,230
I'm so tired.

184
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,560
Let me hug you for a recharge.

185
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,830
Don't worry about me.

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,360
So what if I'm getting hate online?

187
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,720
It's just

188
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,800
Honey Love was Tang Jingxing's legacy.

189
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,680
I don't want it to be ruined
because of me.

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,020
I'll go to the launch with you.

191
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,200
No way, online folks are sharp now.

192
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,630
Luckily, they didn't recognize you
in the photos.

193
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,030
Though you didn't show your face,

194
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,080
if you go and get photographed,

195
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,630
they'll surely figure it out.

196
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,200
Don't you still need
to keep your identity

197
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,120
a secret?

198
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,030
Stay at home today.

199
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,400
I'll handle everything.

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,920
This time,

201
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,470
I'll protect you.

202
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,160
(Chuxia, don't worry.)

00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,040
