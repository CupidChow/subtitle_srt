You changed your style today.

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,070
Cosplay?

5
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,550
You don't even know this classic outfit.

6
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,030
How do I look? Cool or not?

7
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,790
Cool, very cool.

8
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,840
Absolutely cool.

Is it that funny?

13
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,360
Just... a little funny.

14
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,280
Just a bit.

15
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,630
These dandelions are hard to blow.

Convinced now?

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,870
If you have poor lung capacity,

21
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,280
admit it. It's no big deal.

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,870
Just admit you're weak.

23
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,920
I won't mock you.

I'm perfectly healthy.

I've heard that
when you blow away dandelions,

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,160
your sadness and worries
go with the wind.

33
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,080
I want to see if it's true.

34
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,390
You're my guinea pig.

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,840
How can you comfort and annoy me

36
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,040
at the same time?

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,510
But it's okay.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,080
I appreciate your intention.

39
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,620
Actually, I've been really down
these past few days.

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,510
Honey Love isn't selling well.

41
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,880
I even wondered if I should give up.

42
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,630
But thanks to you,

43
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,600
I'm fully recharged now.

44
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,600
So I'm going back to work right away.

45
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,950
First, let's set a small goal.

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,320
You...

Doctor!

50
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,830
Doctor, my dad is awake.

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,390
Hello.

52
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,430
Aunt Nianqi, my dad is awake.

53
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,040
Really?

54
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,680
That's great! I'm coming over.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,840
The old man's quite the survivor.

56
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,800
(CENTER)
Ms. Hua, here's last week's sales.

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,270
This bracelet sold five times more

58
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,360
than the other designs.

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,950
And just now, Mr. Mu called to say

60
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,680
the warehouse is
completely out of stock.

61
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,950
We need to restock immediately.

62
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,920
So you're saying

63
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,120
Louis's like
made this bracelet explode in sales?

64
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,240
Yes, I checked the timing of his like.

65
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,390
The sales spike started

66
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,480
right after

67
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,120
he liked it.

68
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,390
Louis's influence

69
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,880
is truly unmatched.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,080
If he'd agree to endorse us,

71
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,750
maybe even collaborate

72
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,030
on a new design,

73
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,430
Honey Love could

74
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,440
make a stunning comeback.

75
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,870
But I've heard

76
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,710
Louis never takes commercial deals.

77
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,120
This is Honey Love's last chance.

78
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,640
No matter what happens,

79
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,390
I have to find a way to convince him.

80
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,160
Alright.

81
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,000
(Hua Ruoyi)
Hello, Mr. Louis.

82
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,510
I'm Hua Ruoyi,
President of Wanmao Group.

83
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,590
I'd love to communicate with you

84
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,030
and hope we can meet soon

85
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,080
to discuss a potential collaboration.

86
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,440
Thank you, Mr. Louis.

87
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,830
(If I agree too easily,)

88
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,240
(I'd seem cheap)

89
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,350
(and undignified.)

90
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,640
My uncle works as a security guard
in Tianhong Community,

91
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,680
where Louis lives.

92
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,760
He's registered Louis's ID once

93
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,510
and said he's incredibly handsome

94
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,880
and stylish.

95
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,710
(Even someone as clueless as her
should recognize me now.)

96
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,560
(Who knew this place
had such tight security?)

97
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,590
(How do I sneak in?)

98
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,560
(Lu Nianbai lives here too?)

99
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,200
(Perfect.)

100
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,520
Lu Nianbai!

101
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,510
Lu Nianbai,

102
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,800
hey, look at me.

103
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,750
You live here too?

104
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,630
That's great!

105
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,160
I need to get in here
for something important.

106
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,470
Take me in.

107
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,710
Are we that close?

108
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,390
Why should I help you?

109
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,160
At least I call you Uncle.

110
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,640
That makes us half-related.

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,590
Oh, so you do know I'm your uncle?

112
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,830
Who calls their uncle by his full name?

113
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,390
I was just being precise,

114
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,000
so you'd know I was talking to you.

115
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,190
Really?

116
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,000
Say it properly then.

117
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,040
Uncle.

118
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,830
Uncle...

119
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,910
Uncle...!

120
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,750
Do you like it?

121
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,800
Since I'm your elder,

122
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,440
I'll help you this once.

123
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,350
My niece.

124
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,040
My uncle.

125
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,390
Your community's pretty big.

126
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,350
How many buildings are there?

127
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,190
How would I know? I'm not the developer.

128
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,160
I heard a big influencer

129
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,800
named Louis lives here.

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,920
Have you ever seen him?

131
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,560
I don't interact with people here.

132
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,720
Uncle,

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,880
how many bedrooms are in your place?

134
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,950
Two. Why?

135
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
I was thinking,

136
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,120
until I find Louis,

137
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,360
could I stay in one?

138
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,270
It's such a hassle

139
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,320
commuting every day.

140
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,270
No way.

141
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,080
I don't like disruptions.

142
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,000
That's easy.

143
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,880
Just don't treat me as a person.

144
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,040
Think of me as a smart home tech.

145
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,350
I'm here when you call,

146
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,040
yet invisible

147
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,390
like air

148
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,910
when you don't.

149
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,430
That won't work.

150
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,660
Uncle...

151
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,750
Uncle,

152
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,870
it really won't work?

153
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,800
No, it won't.

154
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,390
- Really?
- No, it won't.

155
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,630
Uncle...

156
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,720
I'm begging you, please.

157
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,750
I'm just a girl,

158
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,720
all alone in a strange place.

159
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,600
So pitiful, really.

160
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,800
Alright, just be normal.

161
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,360
So pitiful, really.

162
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,920
Okay, stop.

163
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,520
Let me set the rules first.

164
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
No disruptions

165
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,320
and respect each other's space.

166
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,400
Move out the second you find him.

167
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,280
No problem.

168
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,640
Let's go.

169
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,870
I knew you wouldn't

170
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,200
abandon me.

171
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,200
Slow down.

172
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,800
I don't even know where we live yet.

173
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,830
You'll stay here.

174
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,350
Have you already set it up for me?

175
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,350
So thoughtful, Uncle.

176
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,720
Don't overthink it.

177
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,930
I just don't want your presence

178
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,510
to ruin my home's aesthetic.

179
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,840
If you're staying,

180
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,680
you should follow my style and taste.

181
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,030
Are you serious?

182
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,910
So

183
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,150
even my hair ties,

184
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,440
clothes,

185
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,320
and towel colors

186
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,710
need your approval?

187
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,910
If you want to play that way,

188
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,680
I'll gladly pick them for you.

189
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,320
Though I don't know your...

190
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,670
measurements.

191
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,360
Lu Nianbai,

192
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,920
if you're like this,

193
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,590
I'll have to be wary.

194
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,440
Good.

195
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,470
And move out immediately.

196
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,910
Are you trying to kick me out?

197
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,950
But let me tell you,

198
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,480
until I find Louis,

199
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
I'm not leaving.

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,110
I'm sticking here.

201
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,920
It's so soft.

202
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,630
Sister, what brings you here?

203
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,990
Aunt Nianqi?

204
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,200
I saw your address leaked online,

205
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,120
so...

206
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,640
Yi?

207
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,590
Why are you here?

208
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Aunt Nianqi,

209
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,160
why are you here?

210
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,470
She said Louis lives in my area

211
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,000
and she won't leave

212
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,040
until she finds him.

213
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
Yi,

214
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,590
I need to talk to Nianbai.

215
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,790
You...

216
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,200
I was just heading out to explore.

217
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,360
You two can chat at home.

218
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,270
Remember to eat.

219
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,560
Don't overwork.

220
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,720
Goodbye, Aunt.

221
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,680
Goodbye, Uncle.

222
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,710
(What's the drama now?)

223
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,440
I know what you'll say.

224
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,350
I leaked the address on purpose.

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,920
You...

226
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,160
You did it on purpose?

227
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,400
Why?

228
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,200
Since Hua Rucheng left Hua Group

229
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,270
to Hua Ruoyi in his will,

230
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,320
he'd definitely build a team

231
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,830
to secure her position.

232
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,910
To take over Hua Group,

233
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,120
we need to know our enemy

234
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,400
to ensure nothing goes wrong.

235
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,510
The best way

236
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,870
is for me, as Louis,

237
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,350
to establish a partnership with her.

238
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,590
But Louis

239
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,400
never does commercial deals.

240
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,080
If you suddenly work with Wanmao,

241
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,700
rumors will fly.

242
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,340
Hua Ruoyi will get suspicious.

243
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,320
So I'm making her come to me

244
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,430
and beg me.

245
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,000
She'll be too thrilled

246
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,470
about the partnership

247
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,630
to doubt my motives.

248
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,040
Sister,

249
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,440
trust me.

250
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,390
Alright,

251
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,920
let's go with your plan.

252
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,720
By the way,

253
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,680
why did you change your lock?

254
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,590
I threw out that old key lock.

255
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,800
I've got a keypad now.

256
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,190
- And the code...
- Sister,

257
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,150
I'm not a kid anymore.

258
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,590
I can remember a code.

259
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,280
Alright.

260
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,630
Trash bins can reveal the most secrets.

261
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,990
If I dig through
the neighborhood's bins,

262
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,750
I'll definitely find clues about Louis.

263
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,470
I'm terrifyingly good at this.

264
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,830
Wait, this looks like...

265
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,830
Who's there?

266
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,670
I can't leave you alone
for a second, right?

267
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,870
Are you digging through trash?

268
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,080
I'm tracking Louis.

269
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,560
Is Louis in the trash?

270
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,870
Is Louis garbage?

271
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,630
No, think about it, he's a foreigner.

272
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,600
There must be
English stuff in here, right?

273
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,360
Maybe some international packages.

274
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,390
Follow the trail,

275
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,710
and I'll find him.

276
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,980
I can't believe you thought of this.

277
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,350
Aren't you afraid of the mess?

278
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,200
For Honey Love's sales, it's worth it.

279
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,640
Lu Nianbai!

280
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,520
If you're not afraid of the mess, I am.

281
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,150
- Let's go home.
- Lu Nianbai,

282
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,630
I need to find Louis.

283
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,790
And Honey... Honey Love's sales!

284
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,400
Put me down...

285
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,800
I'll bite you!

286
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,350
What are you doing?

287
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,990
Wash it
