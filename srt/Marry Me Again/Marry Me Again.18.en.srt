=Episode 18=

3
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,870
Look at me.

4
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,200
Who said you could stare?

5
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,720
Close your eyes.

6
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,120
Is it you?

7
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,350
Talking behind my back all day long.

8
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,200
Say it to my face if you dare!

9
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,590
Look at me.

10
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,920
How dare you speak...

11
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,630
Look at me.

12
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,120
Huaijin.

13
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,430
Huaijin!

14
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,390
There's a thief in your house.

15
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,320
Huaijin.

16
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,280
I'm here.

17
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,990
Huaijin.

18
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,430
Huaijin?

19
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,430
I'm here.

20
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,790
Here.

21
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,390
Someone's watching you.

22
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,220
No, that's just pottery...

23
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,080
But I'll help you keep an eye on it.

24
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,830
We're watching each other.

25
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,760
Do you know why?

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,110
Because I'm

27
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,740
a female agent.

28
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,230
Chuxia.

29
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,640
Chuxia, you've had too much to drink.

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,080
I'll help you watch it.

31
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,510
Sorry,

32
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,120
the number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

33
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,400
Please try again later.

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,320
Sorry...

35
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,600
Sorry,

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,600
the number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,160
Sorry,

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,670
the number...

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,280
Since this afternoon,

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,600
why hasn't she answered her phone?

41
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,840
Peipei, has Ms. Hua returned?

42
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,800
No, not yet.

43
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,660
She went to Mr. Mu's company
in the afternoon

44
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,830
and hasn't come back since.

45
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,440
(Mu Huaijin is back now.)

46
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,830
(What about Chuxia?)

47
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,440
(Something's wrong.)

48
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,360
You're finally going to be mine.

49
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,450
Mu Huaijin, I know you're home.

50
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,390
Open the door!

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,920
Mu Huaijin!

52
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,360
I know you can hear me, don't pretend.

53
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,280
Mu Huaijin!

54
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,040
Is Yi with you?

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Mu Huaijin!

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,520
Yi!

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,720
Can you hear me, Yi?

58
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,960
Yi!

59
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,950
Mu Huaijin, I'm talking to you!

60
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,230
Mu Huaijin!

61
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,030
I'm talking to you!

62
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,960
Open the door!

63
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,840
Mu Huaijin!

64
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,910
Lu Nianbai!

65
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,160
What's going on?

66
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,710
Huaijin,

67
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,200
why are you bleeding?

68
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,230
Ask him.

69
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,320
Lu Nianbai, why did you hit him?

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,390
Do you know what he did to you earlier?

71
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,320
What could I do?

72
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,560
Chuxia, you were drunk just now.

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,910
I helped you to the sofa.

74
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,270
Then he barged in

75
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,740
and started hitting me without a word.

76
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,910
Lu Nianbai, what's wrong with you?

77
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,950
Do you have any iodine at home?

78
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,160
Let me disinfect it for you.

79
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,200
Does it hurt?

80
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,640
You're bleeding.

81
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,880
Chuxia, it's fine.

82
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,240
You're bleeding. Does it hurt?

83
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,440
He said it's fine now.

84
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,510
Lu Nianbai!

85
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,270
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

86
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,550
Hua Ruoyi.

87
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,740
Why did you turn off your phone?

88
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,390
What's up?

89
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,310
Need something?

90
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,430
Here.

91
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,270
I don't even have the negatives.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,200
How did you manage that?

93
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,830
Do you like Tang Jingxing that much?

94
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,870
Give me the photo back.

95
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,710
Hand it over.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hand it over now!

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,920
Answer me!

98
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,920
Do you like Tang Jingxing that much?

99
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,840
Yes!

100
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,080
I do like Tang Jingxing.

101
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,910
I think about him every day.

102
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,710
Is this really fun for you?

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,030
Do you enjoy this?

104
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,590
I can't erase your past.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,320
But your future can only have me.

Nothing happened between us.

114
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,550
Wait.

115
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,430
Hangover medicine.

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,350
Or you'll have a headache tomorrow.

117
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,390
From now on, report to me at night
when you come back.

118
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,840
Report?

119
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,320
What gives you the right to control me?

You must follow my rules.

122
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,040
We have a curfew at home.

123
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,370

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,470
Why didn't it hurt during the day,
but at night it hurts so much?

135
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,480
Where are you going?

136
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,040
I'm off to work at Huaijin's.

137
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,940
You're not allowed.

138
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,710
It's past curfew now.

139
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,630
Come on, I'm just going next door.

140
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,110
I'm not going far at all.

141
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,370
My hair...

142
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,280
You promised

143
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,830
to follow my rules at home.

144
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,750
Got it.

145
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,440
I'll go tomorrow morning.

146
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,070
Wait a moment.

147
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,520
What's up now?

148
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,710
Why are you dressed
like a purple eggplant?

149
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,040
Eggplant?

150
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,910
I'm not like you city folk

151
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,700

152
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,930
and outfit coordination, even at home.

154
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,600
I wasn't criticizing you.

155
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,910
I just think our Yi

156
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,870
looks cute

Who's an eggplant?

160
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,630
And who's yours?

161
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,440
