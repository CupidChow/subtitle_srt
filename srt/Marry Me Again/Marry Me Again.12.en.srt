But if you can't go on,

00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,790
that's okay too.

00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,920

But I won't give up.

Sorry,

15
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,230
I got your clothes wet.

00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,950
You're not trying to touch me, are you?

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,430
If I wanted to, would I need an excuse?

18
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,900
I'd do it openly.

19
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,230
Thank you.

20
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,460
Your button pattern is unique.

21
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,920
This was custom-made
by a traditional craftsman.

22
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,460
Traditional craftsmanship?

23
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,120
Tang Jingxing seems
to have a glass puppy.

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,860
It's made by glassblowing,

25
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,890
a traditional technique.

26
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,920
That's why it looks so special.

27
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,440
This might be a new opportunity
for Honey Love.

28
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,630
Worth a shot.

29
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,440
Yes.

30
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,160
But first, we need to find the traitor.

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,200
Traditional craftsmanship...

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,390
Why didn't I think of that?

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,990
Traditional craftsmanship...

34
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,680
(Luo Group's product strategy)

35
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,760
(has always been steady,
with long cycles.)

36
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,440
(But this time, they launched)

37
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,100
(this jewelry line in just a month.)

38
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,990
(There must be something wrong.)

39
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,600
Hello, Mr. Luo.

40
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,120
Louis,

41
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,830
I didn't expect you to call me.

42
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,230
I saw the new jewelry line
you released.

43
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,280
What do you think?
Interested in collaborating?

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,760
The design is good,

45
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,870
but not good enough

46
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,120
to justify stealing it

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,600
from Wanmao.

48
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,440
So you're not here to collaborate.

49
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,640
What do you really want?

50
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,230
No, Mr. Luo.

51
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,870
Why would Luo Group
snatch an obscure design

52
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,390
from Wanmao?

53
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,990
If Hua Ruoyi finds evidence,

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,440
would it be worth it?

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,600
Since you don't want to collaborate,

56
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,200
there's nothing to discuss.

57
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,200
Mr. Luo,

58
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,880
I recall you're the actual
controlling shareholder

59
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,040
of Yuecheng Group, right?

60
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,880
Misusing investors' money

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,150
to secretly run your own company...

62
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,520
That's a serious charge.

63
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,400
You...

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,320
What do you want?

65
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,600
I want you to listen to me.

66
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,270
The source files were clearly deleted.

67
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,430
How did Mr. Luo even hear

68
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,000
they weren't fully erased?

69
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,360
So it was you who leaked the designs

70
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,350
to Luo Group?

71
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,590
Was this all a setup?

72
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,040
According to Mr. Luo,

73
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,750
this person used a fake name

74
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,040
and contacted the Luo Group via email.

75
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,000
He also had the source files,

76
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,150
proving he was
from the Design Department.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,920
Exactly.

78
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,800
I've contacted Mr. Luo to help us.

79
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,950
You know Mr. Luo?

80
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,760
What exactly do you do?

81
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,760
Take a guess.

82
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,590
I've dropped you many hints.

83
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,240
You're always idle,

84
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,830
meaning you have plenty of time.

85
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,510
Your clothes are decent,

86
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,200
meaning you're not short of money.

87
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,240
And you have a lot of connections...

88
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,350
I figured it out!

89
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,390
You rely on your sister.

90
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,620
Rely on what?

91
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,040
Isn't that true?

92
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,000
There's no such thing

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,540
as a job that's both easy and lucrative.

94
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,830
This time,
was it Aunt Nianqi helping me?

95
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,200
You can think of it that way.

96
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,590
Then how do we lure him out?

97
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,080
Considering your youth,

98
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,120
I'll give you a chance to confess.

99
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,200
I deleted the surveillance footage.

100
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,560
There are no source files
on this computer.

101
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,510
You have no evidence.

102
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,150
Even if you sue, you won't win.

103
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,800
You've done this terrible thing,

104
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,710
yet you show no remorse.

105
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,590
I'm definitely not turning myself in.

106
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,830
Sue me if you want.

107
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,640
Chuxia, the deleted footage

108
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,880
has been restored for you.

109
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,800
You arrived just in time.

110
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,200
Is this you?

111
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Ms. Hua,

112
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,920
I was just momentarily tempted.

113
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,800
Just a moment of confusion.

114
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,830
You're fired.

115
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,910
The company will pursue legal action

116
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,150
for the damages you caused.

117
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,200
Ms. Hua, please give me another chance!

118
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,270
Everyone should pay for their choices.

119
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,390
You'd better start

120
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,950
looking for a defense lawyer.

121
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,430
Thanks to you two,

122
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,480
we found the leaker

123
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,510
so quickly.

124
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,360
Huaijin,

125
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,400
I really need to thank you.

126
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,910
You have no idea how arrogant she was
before you came.

127
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,650
Once the footage arrived,

128
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,480
she backed off.

129
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,680
Only because you called me

130
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
that night,

131
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,880
saying you'd only trust me.

132
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,800
Of course, I wouldn't let you down.

133
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,720
Ms. Hua,

134
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,950
what do we do now?

135
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,000
The board expects

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,830
a solution in four days.

137
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,350
No worries.

138
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,910
I've got a plan.

139
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,160
I can't believe

140
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,440
we caught the traitor so fast.

141
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,240
I really have a talent for leadership.

142
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,160
Wasn't it me and Mu Huaijin
who helped you?

143
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,880
What does this have to do
with your talent?

144
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,390
That's not fair.

145
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,920
Why did you two help me?

146
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,350
Because I'm likable.

147
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,910
That's part of leadership too.

148
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,510
Besides,

149
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,430
I was the one
who thought to ask Mu Huaijin

150
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,760
to restore the footage.

151
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,710
Even without you, we'd have managed.

152
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,390
But thanks to you,

153
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,800
the process was

154
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
more dramatic.

155
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,240
It also helped me

156
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,680
see her true colors.

157
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,920
So why did you involve Mu Huaijin?

158
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,030
Wasn't I enough?

159
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,200
Are you jealous?

160
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,510
You came to me first,

161
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,950
saying you'd only trust me.

162
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,300
I helped you sincerely,

163
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,820
and then you turned around and told him

164
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,710
you'd only trust him!

165
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,240
I feel betrayed.

166
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,830
I'm really upset.

167
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,270
Don't be mad, okay?

168
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,590
I was wrong, alright?

169
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,200
I'm sorry, smile for me.

170
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,390
Come on.

171
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,750
(Why should I coax him?)

172
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,110
(Why do I care if he's mad?)

173
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,910
I'll let it go this time.

174
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,830
But no next time.

175
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,470
Ms. Lu, the plan's exposed.

176
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,160
I got it.

177
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,470
Hua Ruoyi,

178
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,430
I won't let you off easy!

179
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,270
You can go.

180
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,390
I won't agree to this.

181
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,320
Mr. Zhang,

182
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,910
we really want to collaborate with you.

183
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,440
If you have any requests,
we can discuss them

184
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,630
in detail.

185
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Over the years,
countless bosses have come to me

186
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,920
with sweet talk.

187
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,840
In the end, they just want to profit off

188
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,970
my title as an
Intangible Cultural Heritage Inheritor.

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,770
They don't respect
traditional craftsmanship.

190
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,080
Our company would never do that.

191
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,440
We can sign a contract in advance.

192
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Contracts?

193
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,630
I don't understand those.

194
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,710
In the end, it's all up to you.

195
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,130
Forget it, go away.

196
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,910
I won't believe even a word

197
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,240
from you business folks.

198
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,830
Mr. Zhang...!

199
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,440
Lu Nianbai, is your hand okay?

200
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,920
Do you realize how dangerous that was?

201
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,630
Are you worried about me?

202
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,990
Mr. Zhang, I...

203
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,720
Let's drop the collaboration.

204
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,680
I won't agree to it.

205
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,950
You should leave now.

206
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,910
But it's getting late today.

207
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,870
I wonder if we could

208
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,280
stay here for one night.

209
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,610
My hand really hurts.

210
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,560
Oh no, is it that bad?

211
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,190
Alright.

212
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,990
There's a guest room next door.

213
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,150
You can stay there tonight.

214
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,160
But tomorrow morning,

215
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,520
you must leave.

216
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,200
Mr. Zhang, it's just...

217
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,680
one room?

218
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,400
You're not a couple?

219
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,270
Then I can't host you.

220
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,440
You should go.

221
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,340
No...

222
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,090
We're a couple.

223
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,530
One room is fine.
