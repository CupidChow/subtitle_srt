00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,940
=Episode 27=

3
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,230
Chuxia,

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,030
I actually have another idea.

5
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,600
What idea?

6
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,150
We could get married.

7
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,200
Get married?

8
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,510
We can share stocks publicly.

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,520
But don't worry.

10
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,710
I won't meddle in Hua Group's business.

11
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,350
If we get married...

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,560
Chuxia,

13
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,640
if you're hesitating

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,560
because of Tang Jingxing...

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,760
Huaijin,

16
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,590
I know you mean well,

17
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,790
but

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,710
please let me think about it.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,840
I'll see if there's a better way.

20
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,630
Dad,

21
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,840
why are you back?

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,070
With such a big incident,

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,960
how can I stay in the hospital?

24
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,550
You know everything?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,840
Ruoyi,

26
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,000
we were both deceived by them.

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,120
The biggest shareholder behind
the foreign company

28
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,800
acquiring Hua Group's shares

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,400
is Lu Nianqi and Tang Jingxing.

30
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,750
What are you saying?

31
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,520
I can confirm

32
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,190
that the last failed bid

33
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,190
was also their manipulation.

34
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,310
Lu Nianqi and Tang Jingxing

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,960
have always wanted

36
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,840
to take over our Hua Group.

37
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,470
But

38
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,800
could there be something more to this?

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,240
Yi,

40
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,710
I've been married to Lu Nianqi
for so many years.

41
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,710
But I still don't know what she's like.

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,400
You've been apart
from Tang Jingxing for a year.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,360
Do you still trust him?

44
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,430
Yes.

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,430
He deceived me again.

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,080
But

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,280
I can't believe that he'd commit murder.

48
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,870
It's all my fault.

49
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,270
I failed to see the danger
and let the villain in.

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,590
The Hua Group's legacy

51
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,240
might be ruined by me.

52
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,510
Dad...

53
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,960
Dad, are you okay?

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
Where's the medicine?

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,840
Dad, here.

56
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,030
Feeling better?

57
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,270
How are you?

58
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,590
Feeling better?

59
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,000
Dad, don't worry.

60
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,630
I'll find a solution.

61
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,520
No matter what happens,

62
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,800
I'll protect our Hua Group.

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
Trust me.

64
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,870
Alright, stop apologizing.

65
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,920
I don't know what you're facing now,

66
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,750
but I'm willing to trust you.

67
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,630
If you ever deceive me again,

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,160
I won't forgive you.

69
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,150
Huaijin,

70
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,000
you...

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,600
you mentioned marriage

72
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,360
and jointly holding shares.

73
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,870
Is that proposal still valid?

74
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,000
Ms. Hua.

75
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,320
Ms. Hua,

76
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,390
the stock price temporarily stabilized

77
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,480
after your engagement announcement
with Mr. Mu.

78
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,600
But since the news about Mr. Tang broke,

79
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,630
Honey Love's products
have faced massive returns.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,190
Now all the agents

81
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,680
are demanding explanations from us.

82
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,680
Let the Legal Department

83
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,000
prepare a breach response plan.

84
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,620
I'll handle each case subsequently.

85
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,790
Alright.

86
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,030
Ms. Hua,

87
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,480
did you really give up on Mr. Tang?

88
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,910
Mr. Mu.

89
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,880
Chuxia.

90
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,790
Chuxia,

91
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,390
although we've publicly announced

92
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,680
the wedding next week,

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,680
if you truly don't want this,

94
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,850
we can cancel it anytime.

95
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,120
I don't want to force you.

96
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,720
You're not forcing me.

97
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,360
It's my fault.

98
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,960
Chuxia,

99
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,240
I'm willing to be used by you.

100
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,910
Huaijin,

101
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,190
just give me some more time.

102
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,360
I can surely sort out my feelings.

103
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,040
The best way to say goodbye

104
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,600
to the past

105
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,480
is to change your present self.

106
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,960
Chuxia,

107
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,070
let's get you a new look

108
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,720
to refresh your mood,

109
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,520
okay?

110
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,590
Huaijin,

111
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,630
thank you for today.

112
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,800
That must've been expensive.

113
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,150
Not at all.

114
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,870
But

115
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,950
I don't think it suits me.

116
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,710
Nonsense.

117
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,030
You look beautiful.

118
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,140
Sorry.

119
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,310
No, it's fine.

120
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,080
By the way,

121
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,420
are there always reporters

122
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,000
camping outside the Hua family
these days?

123
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,420
Since the media attention
hasn't died down,

124
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,720
I've sent Dad back to the hospital
for recovery.

125
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,510
Why don't you come to my place?

126
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,800
I mean

127
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,200
we're getting married,

128
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,750
so I can look after you.

129
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,390
Is that okay?

130
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,120
Chuxia, dinner's ready.

131
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,280
Come and eat.

132
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,480
I'm not used
to that hairstyle and clothes,

133
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,600
so I changed...

134
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,320
No worries, let's eat.

135
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,800
You eat too.

136
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,870
Okay.

137
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,000
Is there wasabi in this dish?

138
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,990
Yes.

139
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,510
Wasabi is good for health.

140
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,240
(Oh my,)

141
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,720
(how could every dish have wasabi?)

142
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,440
How is it?

143
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,080
Is it delicious?

144
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,040
Delicious.

145
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,230
Huaijin,

146
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,670
I'm already full.

147
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,630
No way.

148
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,870
I'm starving.

149
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,600
Grilled rice cakes?

150
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,120
Alright, I'll order from this place.

151
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,560
This is my order.

152
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,200
Barbecue isn't healthy.

153
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,750
