3
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,390
(How could I have such a dream?)

4
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,030
(So embarrassing.)

5
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,080
You look great today.

6
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,230
Really?

7
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,790
I heard from the makeup artist

8
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,480
that you designed this look yourself.

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,390
I had no idea you could do this.

10
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,990
What if I said
I learned it just for you?

11
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,760
Would you believe me?

12
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,080
You always joke with me.

13
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,430
Practicing on me, huh?

14
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,480
So you can do
your girlfriend's makeup later, right?

15
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,000
No,

16
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,670
the color is wrong.

17
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,490
- Okay.
- Come on.

18
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,070
(Mr. Louis, we cordially invite you
to our masquerade ball.)

19
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,080
Mr. Louis, please come in.

20
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,360
Ms. Hua,

21
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,280
Louis is here.

22
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,680
He's wearing a silver Venetian mask.

23
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,200
Alright, got it.

24
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,510
Let's split up.

25
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,630
Okay.

26
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,110
Nianbai?

27
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,480
It's really you.

28
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,550
What are you doing here?

29
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,830
I've tried many ways
to hint to Hua Ruoyi,

30
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,080
but she just couldn't figure out
I'm Louis.

31
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,490
This time, since she knows
my mask and outfit,

32
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,320
she should find me.

33
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,920
(Lu Nianbai is actually Louis!)

34
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,360
(He deliberately lured Chuxia
into looking for him,)

35
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,670
(then hid his identity
and lived with her.)

36
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,640
(He must have ulterior motives.)

37
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,390
Get some people to the ball

38
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,830
and dress them like my photo.

39
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,830
I'll send the photo soon.

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,240
(Lu Nianbai,)

41
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,910
(whatever your scheme is,)

42
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,240
(I won't let you succeed.)

43
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,400
Found him!

44
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
Why is there another one?

45
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,430
And another one?

46
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Here's yet another.

47
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,430
There are so many people

48
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,710
dressed exactly like Louis.

49
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,270
This can't be the standard

50
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,440
for finding him anymore.

51
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,030
Isn't that Mi Chuxia?

52
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,080
Got it.

53
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,870
I'm really curious

54
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,640
to see your face
when you find out I'm Louis.

55
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,310
Louis,

56
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,270
this is the song you prepared
for the masquerade ball.

57
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,080
When you hear it,

58
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,590
you should show up, right?

59
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,680
Didn't he come?

60
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,270

Why is he still alive?

105
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,920
Didn't I ask you to handle it cleanly?

121
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,510
Those abs are full
of industrial artificiality.
