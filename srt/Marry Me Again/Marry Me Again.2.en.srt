00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,020
(Fresh toast)

4
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,430
Sister, you go rest first.

5
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,230
I need a private word with Miss Hua.

6
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,710
Alright.

7
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,630
I'll head to bed then.

8
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,000
You two should rest early too.

9
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,200
What are you doing?

10
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,590
So it really was you.

11
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,640
Six months ago, I went

12
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,740
to the cemetery to visit a friend.

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,200
A crazy woman grabbed me and kissed me.

14
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,630
Was that you?

15
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,200
This isn't an illusion.

16
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,000
It was you that day.

17
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,280
Clearly, you kissed...

18
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,120
(Oh no.)

19
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,440
(Don't tell me)

20
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,390
(I mistook him for Tang Jingxing
and kissed him.)

21
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,750
(So embarrassing.)

22
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,190
Yeah.

23
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,400
But your kissing skills were terrible.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,640
Too bad I'm your uncle,

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,590
or I could've taught you more.

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,840
Are you really not Tang Jingxing?

27
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,980
This way, please.

28
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,570
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

You actually remember today?

35
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,000
Of course, I did.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,680
This day is important to you.

37
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,590
18 years ago today,

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,840
Aunt Mi found you.

39
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,360
It was the day
you officially became Mi Chuxia.

40
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,150
Even though I was brought back
to the Hua family

41
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,860
as the heiress of a listed company,

42
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,800
that home still feels

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,900
unfamiliar to me.

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
But thanks to you,

45
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
these past years,

46
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,930
I'm grateful you were with me.

47
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,960
What a beautiful night sky.

48
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,520
Huaijin, look!

49
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,460
There's a shooting star!

50
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,270
Where?

51
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,850
I didn't see it.

52
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,820
It was right there,

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,200
just passed by.

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,520
Chuxia,

55
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,800
that shooting star

56
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,750
might be Tang Jingxing,
who's no longer with us.

57
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,560
That's why only you could see it.

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
Even if he's gone,

59
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,630
he's probably still watching over you

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,000
in another way.

61
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,880
This is for you.

62
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,910
A birthday gift.

63
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,600
HRY.

64
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,830
Hua Ruoyi.

65
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,110
That's my name.

66
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,390
I just want you to know

67
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,600
that Tang Jingxing is gone,

68
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,030
and you're

69
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,780
no longer the Mi Chuxia from before.

70
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,160
You need to move forward.

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,760
Alright?

72
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,710
Thank you,

73
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,760
Huaijin.

74
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,430
Where were you so late?

75
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,040
Do you know the time?

76
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,640
Why are you back this late?

77
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,870
Since when do you police me like this?

78
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,360
With your parents away,

79
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,510
I'm your elder.

80
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,600
Your safety is my responsibility.

81
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,190
Acting all high-and-mighty
at your age, huh?

82
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,560
What?

83
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,120
I said it was my birthday,

84
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,600
so I went out with friends.

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,270
Is that excuse good enough
for you, Uncle?

86
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,950
(I must get that contract today.)

87
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,040
(I need a plan.)

88
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,960
Wait!

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,430
It's your birthday.

90
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,310
As your uncle,

91
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,000
I didn't prepare a gift,

92
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
but I brought a bottle of

93
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,220
vintage wine from the U.S.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's open it

95
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,330
to celebrate.

96
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,190
Were you scammed?

97
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,630
This vintage wine

98
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,360
tastes like the stuff
from the convenience store.

99
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,300
I didn't know you were
such a good drinker.

100
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,360
I used to be a lightweight.

101
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,350
Years of practice,

102
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,040
I guess.

103
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,720
It seems getting you drunk
won't be easy.

104
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,630
No worries, it's nothing.

105
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,390
Since this,
I have had two more Remy Martins.

106
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,880
Let's drink them together.

107
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,760

(One year ago)

127
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,600
I had this custom-designed.

128
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,560
It's a knotted rope necklace.

129
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,550

130
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,790

Honey Love, okay?

135
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,430
It's inspired by the homophone

136
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,680
of our last names.
