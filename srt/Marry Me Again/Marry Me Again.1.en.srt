(Tang Jingxing,)

(three days ago,)

4
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,000
(it was supposed to be our wedding.)

5
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,800
(You said)

6
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,520
(after dealing with the listing
of Honey Love abroad,)

7
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,070
(you'd come back to plan with me.)

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,030
(But what I waited for with joy)

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,840
(turned into the news of your death.)

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,280
(In an instant,
I went from being an envied bride)

11
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,920
(to a pitiful widow.)

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,790
(I admit I'm not strong.)

13
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,200
(Even so,)

14
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,070
(I can't let you go.)

15
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,150
(Tell me,)

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,510
(should I resent you)

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
(or keep loving you?)

=Episode 1=

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,400
Tang Jingxing!

35
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,550
Chuxia,

36
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,140
you're awake.

37
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,320
Why am I here?

38
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,580
(Mu Huaijin, President of Garden Venue)

39
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,800
You suddenly fainted

40
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,280
at the event yesterday.

41
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,000
(But that kiss felt so real.)

42
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,310
Chuxia,

43
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,630
we can't bring the dead back.

44
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,910
The living must move forward.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,750
I booked you an international cruise.

46
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,360
Consider it

47
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,150
a chance to heal.

48
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,700
(Six months later)

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,680
(Six months at sea)

50
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,560
(did nothing to numb the pain.)

51
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,240
(I can't hide anymore.)

52
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,390
(I'll try to live in the city)

53
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,390
(without you.)

54
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,720
What are you doing?

55
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,880
A hallucination.

56
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,630
It's happening again.

57
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,110
- Hello, I'm...
- Wait, don't speak.

58
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,330
Let me search this first.

59
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,040
Hallucinations are sensory disorders

60
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,480
including auditory, visual,
and tactile illusions.

61
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,680
It's common in bipolar disorder

62
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,160
and post-schizophrenia episodes.

63
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,110
Schizophrenia?

64
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,830
Oh no...

65
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,120
Am I really this sick?

66
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,560
But it feels so real.

67
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,630
Are you Hua Ruoyi?

68
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,830
I can't hear you...

69
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,190
This voice isn't real.

70
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,790
Fake...

71
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,120
Such madness.

72
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,400
Tang Jingxing!

73
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,950
Even though I love you so much,

74
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,360
I have to accept

75
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,830
that you've passed away.

76
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,120
If this continues,

77
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,800
I'll really lose my mind.

78
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,540
(Lu Nianqi, Lu Nianbai's sister)
Nianbai?

79
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Is it you returning?

80
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,800
Can you see him too?

81
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,920
Why didn't you tell me
you were back, Brother?

82
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,110
Brother?

83
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,920
That's your brother?

84
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,200
Why does he look
exactly like Tang Jingxing?

85
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,590
Yi,

86
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,190
since you're back,

87
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,480
stay and join us for dinner.

88
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,020
Oh, right,

89
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,000
let me introduce you properly.

90
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,430
This is my brother,

91
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,480
Lu Nianbai.

92
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,870
By family hierarchy,

93
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,600
you should call him Uncle.

94
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,720
(Uncle?)

95
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,720
(How is that possible?)

96
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,000
(He's identical to the late)

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,040
(Tang Jingxing.)

98
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,430
Two identical people

99
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,160
can't exist in the world.

100
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,040
What's going on?

101
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,180
Am I projecting Tang Jingxing

102
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,930
onto Lu Nianbai

103
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,550
because I miss him too much?

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,920
Mi Chuxia, wake up.

105
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,160
He's Lu Nianbai, not Tang Jingxing.

106
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,340
Though

107
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,170
that arrogant smirk

108
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,710
is uncannily similar.

109
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,270
Severe trauma may cause
significant memory loss

110
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,430
prior to the incident.

111
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,040
Amnesia?

112
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,360
That's so cliche.

113
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,820
But what if...

114
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,510
he's Tang Jingxing with amnesia?

115
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,380
No way.

116
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,940
I need to confirm this tomorrow.

117
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,040
(Round 1)

118
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,340
(If he wears
Crayon Shin-chan underwear,)

119
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,420
(he might really be Tang Jingxing.)

120
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,900
(Only Tang Jingxing)

121
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,860
(would wear that as an adult.)

122
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,020
He actually wears them.

123
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,670
(Will it be too bright at night?)

124
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,450
(Round 2)

125
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,610
(If he's Tang Jingxing,)

126
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,790
(he'd remember this veil.)

127
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,090
Tang Jingxing,

128
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,900
marry me again!

129
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,330
(That hug,)

130
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,770
(that warmth,)

131
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,940
(and that exact movement.)

132
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,100
(I know it's you!)

133
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,620
Tang Jingxing.

134
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,260
You're Tang Jingxing, right?

135
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,900
You remember everything.

136
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,300
Are you proposing to me,

137
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,140
aren't you?

138
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,140
Hua Ruoyi, are you insane?

139
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,020
Why do cosplay at noon?

140
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,020
A person's memory can be erased,

141
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,780
but the body doesn't lie.

142
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,950
(Round 3)

143
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,140
If you accept my apology,

144
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,900
have this glass of milk.

145
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,420
(Tang Jingxing is lactose intolerant.)

146
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,460
(He can't drink milk.)

147
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,100
You're lactose intolerant.

148
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,940
You're Tang Jingxing!

149
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,020
Why did you deceive me?

150
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,700
Is this organic milk?

151
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,860
I drank it and accepted your apology.

152
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,900
Why aren't you happy?

153
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,140
Happy.

154
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,340
I'm very happy.

155
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,980
A DNA test is

156
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,940
more reliable.

157
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,940
(Final round)

158
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,780
So self-absorbed?

159
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,260
What are you doing?

160
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,460
Hangovers cause headaches.

161
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,170
Uncle, let me give you a massage.

162
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,460
Since when are you filial?

163
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,480
I'm just trying to make it up to you.

164
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,660
Uncle,

165
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,620
trust me.

166
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,660
Give me a chance,

167
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,060
I'll help you relax.

168
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,150
Shh...

169
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,060
Wait for me.

170
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,020
I'll be right back.

171
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,380
I'll get the essential oil.

172
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,220
Alright, no need.

173
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,540
But I'm not done yet.

174
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,300
It's fine, I've accepted your apology.

175
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,410
Listen to me,

176
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,180
I have more techniques to try.

177
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,420
No, it's okay.

178
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,300
Come on,

179
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,780
I'm not finished yet.

180
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
I'm really fine now.

181
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,180
I didn't finish it. Really.

182
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,060
Uncle,

183
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,100
trust me, you can try...

184
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,170
Uncle,

185
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,090
need help drying your hair?

186
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,560
To show my apology,

187
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,880
let me help you.

188
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,060
Nianbai,

189
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,820
you're back.

190
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,980
Hua Ruoyi, you're dead!

191
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,140
What's going on here?

192
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,780
He said his towel broke

193
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,140
and asked me to fix it.

194
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,900
(Unusual)

195
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,740
Okay, I'm heading over now.

196
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,380
Sister, I made a detailed plan

197
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,060
to dismantle Hua Group
and seize its shares.

198
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,220
Step one is

199
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,460
targeting Hua Rucheng's secretary.

200
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,500
His secretary?

201
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,360
What's your plan?

202
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,380
Sir, your pen.

203
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,510
Oh, thank you.

204
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,260
The Hua Group has invested heavily

205
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,740
in bidding
for Xihe Group's diamond mines.

206
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,540
I'll extract their bottom price

207
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,700
from the secretary.

208
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,100
Then we'll offer higher to outbid them,

209
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,600
prevent their auction success,

210
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,390
and take over their biggest project

211
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,990
for the next half year.

212
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,260
(I thought revenge could be gradual,)

213
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,100
(but Miss Hua's sudden return)

214
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,540
(is quite unpredictable.)

215
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,400
(To keep her from ruining the plan,)

216
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,460
(I must speed things up.)

217
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,340
I've checked their chat records.

218
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,080
The diamond bid document
isn't at the office.

219
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,500
It's in your husband's study.

220
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,060
The study is always locked.

221
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,900
I'll find a way to get the key.

222
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,460
It's up to you now.

223
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,620
Nianbai.

224
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,100
Sister, did you get it?

225
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,180
This is Hua Rucheng's study key.

226
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,460
In the diamond mining project,

227
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,580
our biggest competitor is

228
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,580
Hua Group.

229
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,620
Once we know their lowest offer,

230
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,300
we'll have the upper hand.

231
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,540
But your husband is at home.

232
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,900
I can't get into the study.

233
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,220
(Fresh toast)

234
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,780
You've come at the right time.

235
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,070
Tomorrow,
I have to accompany Hua Rucheng

236
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,630
for market research for a few days.

237
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,800
Then you can act accordingly.

238
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,380
The Hua family's assets

239
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,330
will eventually belong to Lu.

240
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,220
I'm just a bit hungry.

241
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,120
I'll grab something to eat.

242
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,140
No worries, you can chat.

243
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,980
Don't mind me.

244
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,860

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:25,930
