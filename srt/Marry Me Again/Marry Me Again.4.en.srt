This is the DNA Testing Center.

The comparative analysis

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,750
you submitted is complete.

Alright, thank you.

(0% chance of the same person.)

14
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,590
So it's really not him.

15
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,560
Boss!

16
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,680
Coming!

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,420
Five signature skewers, please.

18
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,360
We're out of them.

19
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,790
Would you like something else?

20
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,760
But I really want them right now!

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,230
Tang Jingxing loved those.

22
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,510
The last portion

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,080
was just bought
by that customer over there.

24
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,870

- That one.

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,080
Let's have some fun tonight.

32
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,160
Sure.

33
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,950
Sister, why are you here?

34
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,790
It's nothing.

35
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,950
I just realized

36
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,640
you've grown up.

37
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,280
The memory

38
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,120
of bathing you as a child

39
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,590
still feels so vivid.

40
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,980
Let me take these dirty cups for you.

41
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,010
Get some rest early.

42
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,190
Thanks, Sister.

43
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,000
(The sad vacation is over.)

44
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,680
(For the sake of mine
and Tang Jingxing's shared business,)

45
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,880
(I must pull myself together)

46
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,050
(to be worthy of being
President of Wanmao.)

47
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,550
(Tang Jingxing,)

48
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,680
(it's been so long since you left.)

49
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,800
(I thought I'd moved on,)

50
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,430
(but Lu Nianbai's arrival)

51
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,310
(made me realize)

52
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,150
(I've been drowning in grief,)

53
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,200
(and unable to face your absence.)

54
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,430
(Maybe...)

55
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,030
(it was too sudden.)

56
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,390
(I'm just suffering
from love withdrawal.)

57
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,550
(Today,)

58
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,320
(let's say a proper goodbye.)

59
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,120
(Who knew this girl could)

60
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,680
(dress so well?)

61
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,710
Miss Hua, going out tonight?

62
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,520
Meeting friends.

63
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,430
Be careful on the road.

64
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,470
(Tang Jingxing, goodbye.)

65
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,150
(I can't keep wallowing like this.)

66
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,440
(I need to pull myself together)

67
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,720
(and live properly.)

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,190
I heard you grew up abroad,

69
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,560
so I went with

70
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,390
a Western-style greeting.

71
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,240
Isn't cheek-kissing

72
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,560
also a thing overseas?

73
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,240
But that'd be

74
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,510
awkward for us.

75
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,520
I'd just smear
the foundation on your face.

76
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,360
Well...

77
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,280
bye!

78
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,710
(She is still crazy.)

79
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,620
(Hua Rucheng, Hua Ruoyi's father)
Darling.

80
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,800
Nianqi, you're back.

81
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,640
Why does your head hurt again?

82
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,470
We lost the diamond mining bid.

83
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,390
That's just business.

84
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,350
Isn't this normal?

85
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm just a bit frustrated.

86
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,800
After all that preparation,

87
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,190
some no-name

88
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,270
American company

89
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,950
snatched it with a 0.5% higher offer.

90
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,040
Can you believe it?

91
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,350
How's that even possible?

92
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,640
Darling,

93
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,590
profits can wait.

94
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,510
Your health matters more.

95
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,470
(Nianbai, well done.)

96
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,420
(Notarial Will)

97
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,560
He always wanted to leave the group

98
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
to his eldest daughter, Hua Ruoyu.

99
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,240
Now that Hua Ruoyi's back,

100
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,560
the inheritance will

101
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,320
definitely go to her.

102
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,070
She's his biological daughter.

103
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,640
She'll definitely inherit.

104
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,160
As for the amount,

105
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,710
it depends on the will.

106
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,120
It's odd though,

107
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,790
I've searched the house and the office,

108
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,390
but I can't find the will.

109
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,760
Who knows where he hid it?

110
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,990
If it favored Hua Ruoyi,

111
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,600
he'd have given it to her

112
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,520
to keep safe.

113
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,160
That old man is infuriating.

114
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,710
Help me get into Wanmao Group,

115
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,850
and I'll help you find the will.

116
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,860
(Wanmao Group)

117
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,150
Since Honey Love was launched,

118
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,350
its sales have been sluggish.

119
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,470
It is a three-year-old design.

120
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,950
We should update it.

121
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,800
But the brand story

122
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,400
is based on your love with Mr. Tang.

123
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,160
If we're making changes...

124
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,440
We won't change
Mr. Tang's original designs.

125
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,000
However,

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,790
we can add

127
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,910
a new line

128
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,390
to complement

129
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,790
Honey Love.

130
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,800
In this way...

131
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,310
Yi.

132
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,910
Aunt Nianqi, what brings you here?

133
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,790
Wanmao

134
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,830
is now a Hua Group subsidiary.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,910
As the director,

136
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,080
I'm here to inspect.

137
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,300
Carry on with the meeting,

138
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,240
I'll just listen in.

139
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,400
Verification failed.

140
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,170
(Need Mi Chuxia's fingerprint.)

141
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,790
Okay, I'll find a backup for you now.

142
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,520
I'll look for the documents.

143
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,750
(Mi Chuxia, what are you thinking?)

144
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,350
(He's not Tang Jingxing.)

145
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,470
Why are you here?

146
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,470
I'm here with my sister.

147
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,000
Then why follow me

148
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,920
instead of her?

149
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,920
You keep saying
I look like Tang Jingxing.

150
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,910
So I wanted to see

151
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,400
how alike we really are.

152
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,110
His fashion sense is mediocre

153
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,560
and nowhere near mine.

154
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,510
What nonsense are you talking about?

155
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,280
He was more interesting
and better-looking.

156
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,110
You're way off.

157
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,470
Really?

158
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,350
What are you up to?

159
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,120
Hua Ruoyi,

160
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,350
I won't be anyone's stand-in.

161
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,680
You're really confusing me.

162
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,200
Who said you were?

163
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,280
Then why did you kiss me that time?

164
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,750
It really was a misunderstanding.

165
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,080
I was drunk

166
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,560
and craving skewers.

167
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,700
And why did you sneak into my room

168
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,630
to peep at me showering?

169
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,750
I wasn't peeping! It was...

170
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,520
It wasn't what you think.

171
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,590
