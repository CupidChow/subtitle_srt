=Episode 17=

3
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,120
I don't need to do anything on purpose.

4
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,320
That guy tries to take advantage
of me the moment he sees me.

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,360
Actually, between you and me,

6
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,110
we don't even have to talk about money.

7
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,920
So it seems you were the one

8
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,260
who made the deal with the killer.

9
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,320
Who are you?

10
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,400
What do you want?

11
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,070
Someone, help!

12
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,150
Help me!

13
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,140
Help!

14
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,170
You forged this document, right?

15
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,690
What's this?

16
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,670
I don't know.

17
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,670
Someone, help me!

18
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,830
Help!

19
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,420
(Cooling)

20
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,700
Forging contracts,

21
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,300
framing me,

22
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,780
and falsely accusing me.

23
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,420
You nearly got me killed overseas.

24
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,060
Speak up.

25
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,380
Who ordered you?

26
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,820
If you don't speak,

27
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,710
I'll make you talk.

28
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,820
No rush.

29
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,860
Think it over.

30
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,740
I'll tell you!

31
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,580
I'll tell you.

32
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,540
I forged it.

33
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,540
Someone made me.

34
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,560
Write down the name and number
of the person who ordered you.

35
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,700
Louis has agreed to this collaboration.

36
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,660
So we need a great plan

37
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,860
to seize this opportunity

38
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,860
and make Honey Love a success.

39
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,780
Okay.

40
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,180
Louis has a lot of female fans.

41
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,140
Let's have him record a voice greeting

42
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,020
as an alarm tone

43
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,340
and include it as one of the freebies
for Honey Love.

44
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,100
The fans would love that.

45
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,980
Ms. Hua, what do you think?

46
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,700
Ms. Hua?

47
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,820
I... I think it's great.

48
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,780
By the way, how's the preparation

49
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,860
for the launch event going?

50
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,700
We've selected a high-end shopping mall

51
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,260
that aligns with our brand's

52
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,620
affordable luxury positioning.

53
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,080
The timing is almost set,

54
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,400
about 10 days from now.

55
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,780
- Then get everything ready quickly.
- Okay.

56
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,860
Louis doesn't want too much interaction,

57
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,940
so I'll handle everything this time.

58
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,220
Alright, no problem.

59
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,500
(Wanmao Group)

60
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,700
(Project)

61
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,300
(Copying progress)

62
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,180
What are you doing on my computer?

63
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,700
(Sorry,)

64
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,980
(Chuxia.)

65
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,700
I'm helping you clean up some messes.

66
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,140
Don't tear it.

67
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,540
Are you crazy?

68
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,020
Why are you tearing my stuff?

69
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,620
It's because you keep

70
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,980
these useless things

71
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,940
that you're stuck in the past.

72
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,620
Move on to a new love.

73
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,140
Tang Jingxing is dead.

74
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,260
Why keep his photos?

75
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,900
Are you afraid to face your feelings?

76
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,260
You think you know me so well, huh?

77
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,740
How dare you say that?

78
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,740
Even if Tang Jingxing is gone,

79
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,220
I'll always love him,

80
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,140
not you!

81
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,460
Really?

82
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,660
I don't think so.

83
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,620
How could I ever have feelings
for someone like you?

84
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,500
You really let me down.

85
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,220
You're selfish,

86
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,220
arrogant,

87
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,700
and completely lacking in empathy.

88
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,140
You don't even deserve

89
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,680
to share the same face as Tang Jingxing.

90
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,260
I must've been blind.

91
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,260
Leave.

92
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,260
I never want to see you again.

93
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,260
Yi, I...

94
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,180
Get out!

95
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,700
It's ruined.

96
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,900
It's ruined...

97
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,500
(Was I too harsh just now?)

98
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,620
Mr. Tang,

99
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,520
did you find the documents?

100
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,700
Yes, I did.

101
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,420
Chuxia.

102
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,060
Chuxia?

103
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,260
What's wrong?

104
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,340
Your eyes are red.

105
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,370
Have you been crying?

106
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,660
No,

107
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,400
I've just got pollen allergies lately

108
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,490
and a bit of conjunctivitis.

109
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,380
Huaijin,

110
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,200
why did you call me here?

111
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,220
I had the secretary draft the contract.

112
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,820
A three-way collaboration with Louis

113
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,460
would be great for our platform too.

114
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,620
Thanks so much, Huaijin.

115
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,340
You're always so supportive.

116
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,410
No problem.

117
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,900
It's just that this month

118
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,610
I'll be busy with offline merchants
for online work.

119
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,860
I'll be running around during the day,

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,860
so I can only discuss things
with you at night.

121
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,970
No worries.

122
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,460
We're neighbors now.

123
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,230
I can visit you in the evening.

124
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,000
Sure.

125
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,980
Chuxia,

126
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,180
are you free tonight?

127
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,100
I...

128
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,820
I bought some ingredients.

129
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,020
I'd like to cook for you

130
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,740
to celebrate the collaboration
with that influencer, Louis.

131
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,940
Sounds great.

132
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,300
But since you've helped me so much,

133
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,900
maybe I should cook for you instead.

134
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,100
No, let me cook for you.

135
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,020
I'll do it.

136
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,620
Chuxia,

137
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,540
let me handle it.

138
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,860
Alright.

139
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,940
Here we go.

140
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,860
I didn't expect you

141
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,820
to be such a good cook.

142
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,820
They look amazing.

143
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,340
Look amazing?

144
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,540
Not just good-looking,

145
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,790
they're delicious too.

146
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,930
Here.

147
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,900
Let me try some.

148
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,420
Chuxia,

149
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,260
cheers to your successful
collaboration with Louis.

150
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,300
Thanks.

151
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,740
But honestly,

152
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,620
he's kind of disgusting.

153
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,340
If it weren't for the collaboration,

154
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,230
I wouldn't bother with him.

155
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,940
I heard he's mysterious.

156
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,380
Haven't you met him?

157
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,900
No, I haven't.

158
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,580
We only had a voice conference before.

159
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,380
He's hard to understand
and communicate with.

160
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,780
He's quite repulsive.

161
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,000
Signing a contract without meeting him?

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,580
Isn't that risky?

163
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,980
I don't think so.

164
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,340
I signed directly with his company.

165
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,560
The chance of being scammed is low.

166
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,580
I'll head to the restroom.

167
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,340
(You're still siding with Lu Nianbai?)

168
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,780
(Even now,
you're covering for his identity.)

169
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,660
(Nianbai)

170
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,140
Sorry for the wait.

171
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,460
Huaijin, have you seen my phone?

172
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,540
Your phone?

173
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,460
It was out of battery.

174
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,060
So I took it to charge in the bedroom.

175
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,630
Alright.

176
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,080
Chuxia.

177
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:10,990
Here is

178
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
a toast to you.

179
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,860
This cocktail is my special mix.

180
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,940
Give it a try.

181
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,660
It's tasty!

182
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,940
Tasty? Then have another sip.
