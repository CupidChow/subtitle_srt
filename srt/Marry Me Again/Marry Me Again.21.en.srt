A gift for the neighbor.

5
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,030
I really like it.

6
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,390
It's so beautiful.

(If I'm unhappy, neither are you.)

11
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,320
Chuxia.

12
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,110
Chuxia!

13
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,450
I'll go answer the door first.

14
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,830
Chuxia.

15
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,350
Chuxia!

16
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,040
Chuxia!

17
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,480
I haven't brushed my teeth.

18
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,880
I can help you.

19
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,670
Hello, Huaijin.

20
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,280
What's up?

21
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,320
What?

22
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm heading over now.

23
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,040
What's going on?

24
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,680
Huaijin said there was a problem
with the quality

25
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,800
of the Honey Love jewelry series
sent to Garden Venue.

26
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,150
I need to handle it.

27
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,310
I'll go with you.

28
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,830
No need, it's a minor issue.

29
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,040
I'll be back soon.

30
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,100
Go ahead, come back early.

31
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,280
Wait for me.

32
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,070
Ms. Hua, we've tested it.

33
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,070
This batch of products
does have some differences

34
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,100
from the previous samples.

35
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,430
Save the test materials

36
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,630
and contact the supplier.

37
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,200
Okay, I'll do it now.

38
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,800
I hope you can focus more on the goods

39
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,510
and don't let other things distract you.

40
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,800
This incident was due to our oversight.

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,030
Sorry for the trouble.

42
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,120
Give me some time.

43
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,240
I'll resolve it soon.

44
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,480
Don't stress too much.

45
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,430
I've said it before,

46
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,590
we can overcome

47
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,240
any challenges together.

48
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,440
Thank you so much, Huaijin.

49
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,680
Then I'll go contact

50
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,310
the factory director right away

51
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,550
about the diamond raw materials.

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,570
(Fire Report)
According to reports,

53
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,750
the fire was caused
by an accidental short circuit

54
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,030
in the supermarket's warehouse.

55
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,880
The exact source is
still under investigation.

56
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,390
Our reporters will keep you updated.

57
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,260
If you want to know
who tried to kill you,

58
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,440
come to this place.

59
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,080
(This fire wasn't accidental.)

60
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,680
(It was aimed at me.)

61
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,620
(Is the person
who summoned me the killer?)

62
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,150
(No matter who you are,)

63
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,150
(I'll track you down.)

64
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,920
I've contacted the factory director.

65
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,830
This batch of diamonds
is of mixed quality.

66
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,750
If we separate
the high-quality diamonds,

67
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,680
we should have enough

68
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,430
for the first batch

69
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,400
of Honey Love production.

70
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,270
The only issue is time constraints.

71
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,070
So, Huaijin,

72
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,800
I'm thinking if we can

73
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,000
make the first batch a presale.

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,800
Limit the initial quantity,

75
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,720
then fully release sales

76
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,000
after the launch event.

77
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,030
That could work.

78
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
I'll transfer some staff

79
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
from the Garden Venue

80
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,640
to secure two-thirds of the supplies.

81
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,560
Thank you, Huaijin. Really.

82
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,030
No need to be polite to me.

83
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,680
I'll arrange the staff now.

84
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,350
Then I'll handle the materials.

85
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,190
(Chuxia,)

86
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,350
(I've always been by your side.)

87
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,910
(Why are you with Lu Nianbai instead?)

88
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,390
(Think of it)

89
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,000
(as punishment for your betrayal.)

90
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,800
(Why hasn't Yi returned yet?)

91
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,590
(Is there a problem with the diamonds?)

92
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,520
Leon,

93
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,210
send me the shipping records
and quality reports

94
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,450
for the diamonds sold to Wanmao.

95
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,430
- Now.
- Yes.

96
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,440
(The diamond quality is fine.)

97
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,460
(So why did
Honey Love's quality control fail?)

98
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,950
Why's the door closed?

99
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,310
What's going on?

100
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,920
It's locked?

101
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,470
Anyone here?

102
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,560
Is anyone outside?

103
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,420
(CAMERA 01)

104
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,120
It's locked.

105
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,430
No one's here?

106
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,680
Huaijin should be back soon.

107
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,790
I'll wait.

108
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,740
(Handle with care)

109
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,470
(There shouldn't be anyone here.)

110
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,520
(Unless it's a ghost?)

111
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,520
(Impossible.)

112
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,870
(Ghosts don't exist.)

113
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,640
Help!

114
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,670
Stay away.

115
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,760
Open the door!

116
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,260
- Chuxia,
- Someone help!

117
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,800
you'll soon find out

118
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,000
who truly protects you

119
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
when you're in danger.

120
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,950
Help, open the door!

121
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,190
This is terrifying!

122
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,550
Stay back!

123
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,400
Help! Anybody there?

124
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,440
Chuxia,

125
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,110
I'll protect you.
