2
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,940
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Why are you here?

4
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,640
- Hi.
- Didn't you promise no drinks?

5
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,920
I said only when you were around,

6
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,070
I wouldn't drink.

7
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,560
You plan to drink alone with him?

8
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,120
No way.

9
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,680
Why did you do this to me?

10
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,600
Why?

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,230
You're asking me why?

12
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,760
How can you drink alone with a grown man

13
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,590
in a hotel room?

14
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,430
Wasn't I alone with you,

15
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,790
a grown man, in a room yesterday?

16
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,150
You ordered quite a lot of drinks.

17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,120
Can't finish them? Count me in.

18
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,840
This is ridiculous.

19
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,440
The rule still stands.

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,270
No drinking for you.

21
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,390
Let's play a game.

22
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,080
Sure, what game?

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,600
"I have,

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,040
you don't."

25
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,950
So cliche.

26
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,230
So cliche?

27
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,710
Uncle, are you scared to play?

28
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,680
Uncle is, after all, the elder.

29
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,990
It's fine if he doesn't know how.

30
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,520
You two keep calling me Uncle,

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,670
are you teasing me?

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,150
You're overthinking.

33
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,310
Uncle, it's fine if you don't.

34
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,990
Huaijin and I can still play.

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,680
Let's stick to the usual rules.

36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,990
Whoever folds all five fingers first
gets to drink.

37
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,550
Alright.

38
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,990
Who said I was scared?

39
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,230
Uncle,

40
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,830
don't force yourself.

41
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,920
Games like this can expose secrets,

42
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,710
especially for someone
with a lot to hide.

43
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,790
Let's start.

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,200
What are we waiting for?

45
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,670
I'll go first.

46
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,160
I once drank 15 bottles
of beer in one go.

47
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,280
Seriously?

48
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,870
I drown my sorrows alone,

49
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,320
but why did you two drink so much?

50
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,600
You're proud of being an alcoholic?

51
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,350
My turn.

52
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,560
I once liked a girl

53
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,670
for over five years.

54
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,200
I once shared a bed with Hua Ruoyi.

55
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,150
Huaijin,

56
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,390
when did we...?

57
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,520
You forgot?

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,430
The last time I was sick,
you took care of me.

59
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,400
You were so tired

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,950
that you fell asleep on my shoulder.

61
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,390
Does that count too?

62
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,800
By your logic,

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,520
I share a bed with myself every night.

64
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,760
Does that count too?

65
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,040
My turn.

66
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,310
I once ate a love bento

67
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,560
made especially for me by Mi Chuxia.

68
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,910
Hua Ruoyi once drooled on my suit.

69
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,910
Let's skip that part.

70
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,950
I once carried a drunken Mi Chuxia home.

71
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,710
That was an accident, Huaijin.

72
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,680
And we even...

73
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Stop talking.

74
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,080
Even...

75
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,560
What else did you do?

76
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,430
Nothing.

77
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,680
I think this game is getting boring.

78
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,760
Let's switch.

79
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,200
Okay, switch it up.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,920
Uncle, come on.

81
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,590
What's up with you?

82
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
Mu Huaijin carried you home too.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,180
What happened between you two?

84
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,790
We...

85
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,350
None of your business.

86
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,980
Hua Ruoyi,

87
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,870
no one knows better than me

88
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,270
how unruly you get when drunk.

89
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,510
Tell me,

90
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,680
did you treat him like you treat me?

91
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,030
Lu Nianbai,

92
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,360
there's nothing
between me and Mu Huaijin.

93
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,590
And there never will be.

94
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
Besides, you're

95
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,710
so focused on us two.

96
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,270
Why?

97
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,200
Jealous?

98
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,800
Yes, I'm jealous.

99
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,710
Hua Ruoyi, listen up.

100
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,310

Morning.

118
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,800
Did you enter the wrong room?

119
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,840
I think

120
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,410
we're all adults.

121
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,990
These things happen.

122
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,840
You should leave.

123
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,720
Why?

124
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,360
Don't want to be responsible?

125
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,030
Shouldn't you be responsible?

126
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
Alright, forget it.

127
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,880
We were both drunk last night.

128
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,310
It was a mistake.

129
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,680
I'll act like nothing happened.

130
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,940
Chuxia, are you awake?

131
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,400
Why is he here?

132
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,040
Go, quick!

133
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,230
Hurry, get moving.

134
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,270
Go...

135
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,680
Am I that embarrassing?

136
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,750
No.

137
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,990
If he sees us,
how do I explain nothing happened?

138
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,120
Please, just go.

139
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,560
- Go quickly.
- You...

140
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,670
Chuxia,

141
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,200
I thought I heard

142
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,160
something fall in your room.

143
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,750
No, it was just an accident.

144
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,720
I'll be there soon.

145
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,600
Chuxia,

146
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,520
I have some material on Mr. Zhang.

147
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,920
Let's discuss.

148
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,680
Sure, I'll be right there.

149
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,800
Please...

150
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,560
- Chuxia.
- Huaijin, why are you here?

151
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,000
Did you have breakfast?

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,080
Want to grab some together?

153
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,030
No need.

154
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,200
What were you saying about Mr. Zhang?

155
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,830
Take a look.

156
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,620
(Looking for Filigree Inlay
Heritage Inheritor)

157
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,440
Now I know

158
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,080
how to approach him.

159
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,960
Right?

160
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,950
Let's go together then.

161
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,120
Chuxia,

162
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,400
why is he here?

163
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,990
How did you get here?

164
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,080
He said his shower broke,

165
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,040
so he came

166
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,350
to borrow mine.

167
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,640
Chuxia,

168
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,750
I just remembered there's work.

169
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,590
I should go.

170
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,840
Alright, no problem.

171
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,950
Handle your business.

172
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,600
If you're done with the shower,

173
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,710
shouldn't you leave too?

174
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,280
