2
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,980
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,110
For the launch event,

4
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,720
I plan to hold it in the city center.

5
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,120
There's a big shopping mall there.

6
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,650
It's perfect for...

7
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,990
Chuxia.

8
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,930
Didn't sleep well last night?

9
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,760
No,

10
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,760
I was too anxious about work
and couldn't sleep.

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,930
Let me get you some coffee.

12
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,950
Iced Americano, thanks.

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,940
I can't erase your past.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,360
But your future can only have me.

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,200
(Mi Chuxia, have you no self-respect?)

16
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,120
(Just because of Lu Nianbai's words,)

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,150
(you couldn't sleep all night.)

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,840
(Your top priority right now
is Honey Love's promotion.)

19
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,000
(Lu Nianbai, stay back.)

20
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,850
You're really thirsty, huh?

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,710
- Let me...
- Thanks a lot.

22
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,270
Let's continue then.

23
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,310
We have another issue now.

24
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,310
Although this big screen
is the same size

25
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,760
as we booked,

26
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,760
it has a thicker frame around it.

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,000
So the setup has to be adjusted.

28
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,120
Otherwise, it won't fit.

29
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,310
Did you notice it?

30
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,510
Sorry, I got your pants wet.

31
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,720
No worries, just a little wet.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,510
Wearing wet pants can get you cold.

33
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,430
Chuxia, I have a sample
of women's clothes

34
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,710
from our company.

35
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,830
I'll get it for you.

36
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,520
Huaijin, it's just a tiny spot.

37
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
How can I catch a cold?

38
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,440
It's fine.

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,040
(Looks so similar.)

40
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,270
(If the hair were a bit shorter,)

41
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,860
(it would be even more alike.)

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,120
Our clothes suit you nicely.

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,000
Really?

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,710
I thought they were a bit tight.

45
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,600
No worries, let's continue.

46
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,940
I think this big screen in the middle

47
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,360
can be moved to the left.

48
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,200
Then we only need
to set up the right side.

49
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,150
Also, I wasn't satisfied

50
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,270
with the background images.

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,910
So I found some other images online

52
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,110
to replace them.

53
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,710
How do you like them?

54
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,390
Huaijin, what do you think?

55
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,040
What's up?

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,120
It's nothing.

57
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,950
I just think your shampoo smells nice.

58
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,070
Which brand is it?

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,390
As for the shampoo,

60
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,230
I'll get you a bottle next time.

61
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,320
Hello.

62
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,670
Hua Ruoyi,

63
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,880
get back here now!

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,920
What did you buy?

65
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,320
I hate mess at home the most.

66
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,390
Come back!

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,670
What did I buy?

68
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,230
What did I get?

69
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,390
I've never seen this outfit before.

70
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,410
New purchase?

71
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,520
No, I spilled coffee on my clothes.

72
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,840
So Huaijin gave me an outfit

73
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,760
to change into for now.

74
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,430
You're a girl,

75
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,990
changing at another man's place?

76
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
Aren't you overreacting?

77
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,420
I changed in the bathroom,

78
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,640
not in front of him.

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,760
What are all these?

80
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,440
This is pepper spray.

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,640
This is a smart alarm.

82
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,380
This is a portable stun stick.

83
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,310
I got you various sizes.

84
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
Keep this in your bag.

85
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,310
Carry this with you.

86
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,600
Why did you buy these?

87
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,670
Let me tell you,

88
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,950
men are not trustworthy.

89
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,760
You should be cautious.

90
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,710
Should I be wary of you?

91
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,940
We're living together

92
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,320
under the same roof every day.

93
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,440
I haven't even said anything.

94
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,490
And you bought these.

95
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,800
Didn't you already have a crush on me?

96
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,000
So why be cautious?

97
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,310
Don't flatter yourself.

98
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,330
When did I have a crush on you?

99
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,840
Get lost.

100
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,040
Get up!

101
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,350
Are you leaving or not?

102
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,150
Are you getting up or not?

103
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,190
- Oh my gosh, are you okay?
- My eyes!

104
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,200
Are you alright?

105
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,870
How are you doing?

106
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,150
You won't lose your sight, right?

107
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,800
Oh dear, let's get you to the hospital.

108
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,720
Hurry, hurry!

109
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,150
You're so worried about me.

110
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,680
If I really went blind,
I'd cling to you for life.

111
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,840
You're fine?

112
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,940
You tricked me!

113
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,790
You fool!

114
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,680
Good thing I dodged quickly.

115
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,920
Or I might've really gone blind.

116
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,160
But

117
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,950
this is how you should use it.

118
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,660
If someone does this to you,

119
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,510
just spray them.

120
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,870
That's a new house rule.

121
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,310
If you want to stay here,

122
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,870
you must follow the rules. Got it?

123
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,040
Got it.

124
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,590
Hi, Uncle.

125
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,200
Come here.

126
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,270
Hua Ruoyi, why is he here?

127
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,870
Huaijin helped me
move the materials back.

128
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,290
Huaijin, just put them on the table.

129
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,190
- Okay.
- Let me help you.

130
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,600
Thanks.

131
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,910
I should be thanking you.

132
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,440
Still not leaving?

133
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,980
Guests are always welcome.

134
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,270
Can't you be nicer?

135
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,480
Huaijin, I haven't returned

136
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,310
your external hard drive.

137
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,270
I'll go grab it.

138
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,720
Alright.

139
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,060
You work out often?

140
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,000
I go to the gym too.

141
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,770
When I'm busy, I train at home.

142
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,200
How many push-ups can you do?

143
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,000
Push-ups, huh?

144
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,220
I don't train push-ups much.

145
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,850
About 1,000.

146
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,720
1,000...

147
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,390
I'm around the same.

148
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,330
I haven't met a push-up rival
in a long time.

149
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,720
Let's compete.

150
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,540
Perfect timing.

151
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,370
I could use some exercise too.

152
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,500
Huaijin.

153
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,360
Chuxia,

154
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,790
be our referee.

155
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,360
Ready?

156
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,440
Go!

157
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,290
578...

158
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,870
579...

159
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,640
I know you two are strong.

160
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,870
But it's too late today.

161
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,800
How about

162
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,000
we call it here?

163
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,790
600...

164
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Right.

165
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,800
It's too late today.

166
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,320
Let's continue next time.

167
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,040
I'm ready anytime.

168
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,280
Huaijin,

169
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,650
your clothes from last time.

170
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,990
No need, Chuxia.

171
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,800
Just take them back.

172
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,770
The size is too small.
I can't wear them.

173
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,420
I probably won't wear them again.

174
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,510
You should take it back.

175
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,750
Alright.

176
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,760
Chuxia,

177
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,500
goodbye.

178
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,470
Men...

179
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,350
(No...)

180
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,790
(Mi Chuxia,)

181
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,440
(don't act like a pervert.)

182
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,710
What's up?

183
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,680
Is there something on my face?

184
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,590
Hua Ruoyi!

185
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,520
Tang Jingxing is so good to me.

186
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,870
How could I betray him?

187
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
From now on,

188
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,320
I must stay fully alert

189
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,920
and keep a safe social distance

190
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,280
