00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,940
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,400
You're not a couple?

4
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,260
Then I can't host you.

5
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,340
You should go.

6
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,660
No...

7
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,180
We're a couple.

8
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,460
One room is fine.

9
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,900
The stars are beautiful.

10
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,620
Yeah.

11
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,420
Living in the city,

12
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,020
it's been ages
since I've seen a view like this.

13
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,260
Mr. Zhang

14
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,620
probably chose to become a craftsman

15
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,340
to get away from the noise of the city.

16
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,060
He won't even give us a chance to talk,

17
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,780
let alone collaborate.

18
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,900
What's the plan now?

19
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,540
If there's no opportunity,
we'll create one.

20
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,340
Aren't we already

21
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,540
staying at his house?

22
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,100
Mr. Zhang seems kind-hearted.

23
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,540
So next,

24
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,540
I'll persist strongly

25
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,900
and make him agree.

26
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,180
I know this one,

27
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,020
the Big Dipper.

28
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,660
And that one,

29
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,860
Polaris.

30
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,700
That's Venus.

31
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,700
Venus?

32
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,290
How do you know?

33
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,130
Look,

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,180
if you point this camera at the sky,

35
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,290
it can identify the stars for you.

36
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,020
This is quite useful.

37
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,480
It's getting late.

38
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,570
I'll head back to rest.

39
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,910
You should rest early too.

40
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,100
I'm here.

41
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,150
You're over there.

42
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,370
If you dare cross the line, you're dead.

43
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,340
What are you doing?

44
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,060
There are mosquitoes.

45
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,570
I attract them.

46
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,460
Let them bite me instead of you.

47
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,500
You're so cold-blooded.

48
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,470
Would they bite you?

49
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,130
I'm cold-blooded?

50
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,340
Dare you flick me again?

51
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,420
You care about your hair, huh?

52
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,060
Getting bold, huh?

53
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,050
Lu Nianbai, you're shameless
at your age.

54
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,060
So annoying!

55
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,660
Help me!

56
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,860
I'll show you what vigor is.

57
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:17,980
Mr. Zhang.

58
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,460
Why are you still here?

59
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,280
I told you to leave early.

60
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,900
The weather forecast says

61
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,060
it'll rain today.

62
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,620
Weather forecasts are never accurate.

63
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,570
It's raining.

64
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,140
Let me help you with that.

65
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,820
Please have a seat.

66
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,580
Mr. Zhang,

67
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,220
what you're doing now

68
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,260
is the stacking technique
in filigree inlay, right?

69
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,420
You did some homework

70
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,780
just to impress
an old man like me, huh?

71
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,620
Mr. Zhang,

72
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,540
I hope you can see our sincerity.

73
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,220
We genuinely want
to promote traditional craftsmanship.

74
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,980
Please give us a chance.

75
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,340
This is the simplest piece
of filigree work.

76
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,420
If you can make

77
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,750
an exact replica today,

78
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,740
I'll discuss it with you.

79
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,180
This craftsmanship is complex.

80
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,420
How can we finish it in one day?

81
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,420
Can't do it?

82
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,300
Then forget it.

83
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,380
Take care, goodbye.

84
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,860
Rest assured.

85
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,300
We'll do our best.

You call this an exact replica?

100
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,260
Mr. Zhang,

101
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,780
for such a high-level technique,

102
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,780
meeting your requirements today

103
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,220
is truly challenging.

104
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,980
I thought you were testing

105
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,780
our patience and sincerity.

106
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,860
The piece is ruined.

107
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,020
No more discussion.

108
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,340
Is the ring really the point?

109
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,000
Isn't this situation supposed

110
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,380
to test our patience and sincerity?

111
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,020
Even if the result isn't perfect,

112
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,180
shouldn't he be moved

113
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,460
by our efforts

114
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,780
and agree in the end?

115
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,920
Cut down on
those wish-fulfillment web novels.

116
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,780
It's all your fault.

117
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,580
If you hadn't fussed yesterday,

118
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,740
I wouldn't have been so tired,

119
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,130
and I would've made a better ring.

120
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,780
We slept separately last night.

121
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,620
How did I bother you?

122
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,340
I was the one kept awake

123
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,140
by the two of you past midnight!

124
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,060
Huaijin? What are you doing here?

125
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,110
Chuxia.

126
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,780
Mr. Mu, how did you know where we were?

127
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,100
Mr. Mu isn't like you two.

128
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,660
He's genuinely here

129
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,340
to help our village.

130
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,780
Online platforms
shouldn't just serve cities.

131
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,300
Our Garden Venue is expanding

132
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,620
offline operations now.

133
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,340
Since Mr. Zhang represents this area,

134
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,780
I came to talk to him.

135
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,420
Mr. Mu,

136
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,020
the village's stance

137
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,420
is clear.

138
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,180
The Village Party Secretary
will discuss the rest with you.

139
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,840
Alright.

140
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,900
You two, pack up and leave quickly.

141
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,580
Mr. Zhang...

142
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,540
Chuxia,

143
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,740
I booked a suite at the hotel
before coming.

144
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,700
It has three bedrooms.

145
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,110
- If that's okay...
- What a coincidence!

146
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,940
That's wonderful.

147
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,660
We came in such a rush
and didn't prepare anything.

148
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,100
Huaijin, thank you so much.

149
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,580
We'd have been lost without you.

150
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,420
