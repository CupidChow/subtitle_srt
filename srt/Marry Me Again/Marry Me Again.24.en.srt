=Episode 24=

3
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,240
Turn it off, it's too noisy.

4
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,220
You should give it a try.

5
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,920
But I really don't like it.

6
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,240
You'll get used to it.

7
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,360
I just don't like it, okay?

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,200
Why force me to change?

9
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,000
Huaijin, you're acting odd today.

10
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,030
You've never pushed me.

11
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,990
You're right.

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,760
Don't listen if you don't want to.

13
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,230
Sorry, Huaijin.

14
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,230
I've had too much to handle today. So...

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,840
I'm not feeling well.

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,870
I'll leave first.

17
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,430
Chuxia,

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,640
if you need anything,

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,000
call me anytime.

20
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,150
Thanks, Huaijin.

21
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,100
I feel like I've been bothering you.

22
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,460
If you really think you're troubling me,

23
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,360
promise me one thing.

24
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,560
Sure, tell me.

25
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,480
What is it?

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,350
I'll tell you next time.

27
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,310
Alright, next time.

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,560
I'll go now.

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,870
Chuxia,

30
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,510
you'll be mine someday.

31
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,140
(Mandarin Rock)

32
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,480
I know Lu Nianbai is Tang Jingxing.

33
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,800
Nianbai just resembles Tang Jingxing.

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,830
They're identical.

35
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,230
Actually, I suspected it before.

36
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,560
I even took Lu Nianbai's hair

37
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,080
for comparison with Tang Jingxing's.

38
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,520
But I don't know

39
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,560
why the test results

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,760
showed they weren't the same person.

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,960
Now I understand.

42
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,920
So

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,640
why did you acknowledge Tang Jingxing
as your brother

44
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,790
and help him fake his identity?

45
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,320
Honestly,

46
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,420
I didn't want to hide it from you.

47
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
It was Nianbai...

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,880
No,

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,110
it was Tang Jingxing
who insisted I keep it a secret.

50
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,050
Did you

51
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,700
know each other before?

52
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,860
Of course.

53
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,300
We grew up together

54
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,540
as childhood friends.

55
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,660
I didn't expect
you to wear dresses as a kid.

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,320
So cute.

57
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,060
Who let you see my photos?

58
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,740
Why so angry? Let me see.

59
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,420
Just a peek.

60
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,580
No peeking.

61
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,700
Jingxing used to tell me everything
when we were young.

62
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,380
I don't know

63
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,300
why he made me
keep such important things from you.

64
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,580
But when he asks for help,

65
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,060
I can't refuse.

66
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,100
(Tang Jingxing,)

67
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,100
(what happened to you?)

68
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,820
(Why share things with her)

69
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,140
(but not with me?)

70
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,460
Hello, Director Li.

71
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,380
It's me.

72
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,370
Regarding your concerns
about the Hua family's shares

73
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,200
and management rights

74
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,380
in Wanmao Group

75
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,350
during the board meeting,

76
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,540
I have an idea.

77
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,700
Would you have time to discuss it?

78
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,940
Alright, Director Li.

79
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,860
Goodbye.

80
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,180
(The probability of being
the same person is 99.9999%.)

81
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,540
Hua Ruoyi submitted two hair samples

82
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,420
showing they're from the same person.

83
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,060
Give this to them.

84
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Alright.

85
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,520
Have them prepare a report

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,020
with the opposite conclusion
for Hua Ruoyi.

87
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,420
Okay.

88
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,940
Mi Chuxia,

89
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,180
even though he's no longer
the old Tang Jingxing,

90
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,980
you still fell for him.

91
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,140
Ms. Hua, Honey Love's new collection
from Wanmao

92
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,860
has become
a seasonal hit on e-platforms.

93
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,900
Any comments?

94
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,910
Now Mr. Tang has returned,

95
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,980
when will you two marry?

96
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,660
- Yes, Ms. Hua.
- Indeed.

97
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,580
Please share.

98
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,940
Thanks for your concern.

99
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,340
We'll announce once we set

100
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,340
the wedding date.

101
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,780
Planning to marry this year?

102
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,660
Where's the venue?

103
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,300
- Who's invited?
- Any thoughts?

104
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,220
What's the exact date?

105
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,180
Please tell us.

106
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,660
Here they come. Release!

107
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,300
Congratulations!

108
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,620
Congrats on Honey Love's success!

109
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,620
Cheers to Ms. Hua
and Mr. Tang reuniting!

110
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,660
Great, congrats!

111
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,820
Tell me, what's your plan?

112
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,460
You think I can't do anything

113
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,860
with everyone watching, huh?

114
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,940
Chuxia,

115
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,500
I was wrong to hide my identity.

116
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,020
You don't have to forgive me.

117
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,380
But I won't leave you again.

118
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Fine.

119
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,420
Then tell me

120
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,940
why you lied before.

121
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,900
Just say it.

122
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,300
I had no choice.

123
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,900
Trust me. When the time comes,

124
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,100
I'll explain everything.

125
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,860
I gave you a chance,

126
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,020
but you didn't take it.

127
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,620
Chuxia.

128
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,340
Huaijin,

129
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,420
why are you here?

130
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,300
I came because you promised

131
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,140
to accompany me

132
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,260
to do something.

133
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,580
Right.

134
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,140
But I'm not feeling well. Could we...?

135
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,180
Today is my birthday.

136
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,540
Could you stay with me?

137
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,460
Sorry, Huaijin.

138
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,500
I forgot.

139
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,740
It's okay.

140
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,340
I know you've been busy lately.

141
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,380
But could you set things aside

142
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,540
and stay with me today?

143
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,700
After carving the doll,

144
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,220
let it dry in a ventilated area.

145
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,940
The first step is done.

146
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,900
I never knew

147
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,420
you did pottery all these years.

148
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,480
It's been many years.

149
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,820
I come here every year.

150
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,340
Chuxia,

151
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,820
thanks for accompanying me.

152
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,780
This clay looks hard

153
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,180
but feels soft.

154
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,060
Slow down.

155
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,180
Slow down, like this?

156
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,780
Chuxia,

157
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,260
let's make pottery together
next year too.

158
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,820
If I can manage to do it well...

159
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,100
(Wanmao Group)

160
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,300
Mr. Tang, please enjoy.

161
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,060
Why is he here?

162
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,620
Louis got an invitation
from "Hear Your Voice"

163
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,860
for a dating show

164
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,580
to promote Honey Love jewelry.

165
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,340
I really love this show!

166
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,860
This season's influence is huge,

167
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,420
and their audience matches

168
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,460
Honey Love's target group.

169
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,260
I've heard of it too.

170
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,820
It's great for promotion.

171
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,980
Anyway,

172
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,620
we must secure this deal.

173
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,190
For the partnership,

174
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,300
the show has one condition.

175
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
They want us

176
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,900
to appear as a couple

177
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,380
in the studio as guest stars.

178
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,780
Chuxia,

179
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,220
we need to act as lovers.

180
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,700
If people see we're not close,

181
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,180
it will affect Honey Love.

182
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,260
Yeah, it will.

183
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,780
The act must be thorough.

184
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,500
Just like you did before.

185
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,540
My Honey Love couple!

186
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,620
You're finally here!

187
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,620
I'm a fan of you two.

188
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,580
Can we take a photo?

189
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,020
Move a bit closer.

190
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,700
I'm feeling a bit uneasy.

191
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,980
I need to visit the restroom.

192
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,660
Ms. Hua,

193
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,660
where's Mr. Tang?

194
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,910
He was here earlier.

195
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,970
Mr. Tang said he had urgent business.

196
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,220
He hasn't come back yet.

197
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,100
But the show is about to start.

198
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,060
How irresponsible.

199
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,660
Mr. Tang is back.

200
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,540
All departments, attention.

201
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,540
We're starting.

202
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,900
Where did you go?

203
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,220
Here's your brown sugar water.

204
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,060
(I didn't expect)

205
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,540
(he still remembered.)

206
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,460
What are you doing?

207
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,820
Don't move, your heels are red.

208
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,140
Guest stars will only be filmed

209
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,160
from the waist up during talks.

210
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,380
Wear these for the chat.

211
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,560
Don't do that.

212
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,780
Everyone's watching.

213
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,620
Don't mind me. I like to watch.

214
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,860
Wow, this is so sweet.

215
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,900
Find me some people.

216
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,100
Chuxia, let me take you home.

217
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,980
Today's act is over, right?

218
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,420
I'm heading home now.

219
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,700
Let me take you back.

220
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,700
Tang Jingxing!

221
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,580
I haven't forgiven you yet.

222
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,820
The boss said

223
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,980
just ruin this woman's reputation.

224
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,180
Later,

225
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,180
I'll go first.

226
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,100
Alright.

227
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,700
Hey girl, why are you out so late?

228
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,060
What do you want?

229
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,900
What do I want?

230
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,740
Stay back.

231
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,860
I'll show you...
