=Episode 5=

3
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,600
And why did you sneak into my room

4
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,540
to peep at me showering?

5
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,640
I wasn't peeping! It was...

6
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,310
It wasn't what you think.

7
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,400
Really?

8
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,870
Then why are you blushing?

9
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,080
Did I hit the mark?

10
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,990
Enough!

11
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,820
I've realized now.

12
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,040
You're not Tang Jingxing.

13
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,870
And I would never treat anyone

14
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,970
as his substitute.

15
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,070
You'd better not be.

16
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,260
(Notarial Will)

17
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,160
(Notarial Will)
He left everything to Hua Ruoyi

18
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,790
and not a single penny to you.

19
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,510
Here's the copy.

20
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,260
(Signed by Hua Rucheng)

21
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,340
(Notarial Will)

22
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,440
That old man.

23
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,110
He could practically be my dad!

24
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,630
After all these years

25
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,790
of serving him dutifully,

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,110
this is how he repays me?

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,550
What's your plan?

28
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,080
I've found you a new place.

29
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,280
Here's the address.

30
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,390
You should move out tonight.

31
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,030
Why?

32
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,480
Hua Rucheng isn't trustworthy.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
I don't trust you staying with him.

34
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,350
- Sister...
- Nianbai,

35
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,510
don't worry.

36
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,790
The Hua Group

37
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,590
will be ours

38
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,160
sooner or later.

39
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,750
(Emergency)
Yi,

40
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,520
Sister Li said your dad fainted
and was hospitalized.

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,600
Okay, I'm heading over now.

42
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,230
That annoying Sister Li.

43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,630
She came back just in time.

44
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,450
If not for her first aid,

45
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,460
the old man would've died.

46
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,790
She made me cry for nothing

47
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,310
and ruined my eyeliner.

48
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,280
Hello, which room is Hua Rucheng in?

49
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,670
- 102.
- Thanks.

50
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,070
Aunt Nianqi!

51
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,840
- Aunt Nianqi.
- Yi!

52
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,750
How's Dad?

53
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,990
He's still in critical care.

54
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,110
It's all my fault.

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,240
I was washing dishes

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,160
and didn't notice his heart attack.

57
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,560
I blame myself.

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,870
I wish it were me,

59
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,040
not him...

60
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,760
Are you okay?

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,080
Don't overthink it.

62
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,750
Go home and get some rest.

63
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,790
I'll stay here.

64
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,510
But...

65
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,270
I want to stay with him a little longer.

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,630
I know you're close to Dad,

67
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,390
but your health matters too.

68
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,590
Please listen to me.

69
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,190
Go back and rest for now.

70
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,800
I'll update you immediately.

71
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,720
Alright?

72
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,400
Okay.

73
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,560
I'll check on him first.

74
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,750
Make sure you go home.

75
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,540
(Emergency)

76
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,440
He's stabilized for now,

77
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,830
but is still in a coma.

78
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,240
Whether he pulls through is up to him.

79
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,600
The family should

80
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,720
prepare for the worst.

81
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,840
We can't bring the dead back.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,310
The living must move forward.

83
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,870
Ms. Hua, Honey Love's sales

84
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,390
have been dropping for months.

85
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,430
At this rate,

86
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,050
we'll have to shut down the line.

87
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:55,950
The company can't hold out.

88
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,440
This is the St. Mary Police Station.

89
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Your husband, Tony,

90
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,390
was fatally shot at dawn yesterday.

91
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,880
Whether he pulls through is up to him.

92
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,640
Girls who smile often have good luck.

93
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,080
Dad will definitely recover.

94
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,920
Hello.

95
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,760
Ms. Hua,

96
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,310
the Design Department has sent

97
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,450
the new drafts to your email.

98
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,710
Alright, I'll check now.

99
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,270
What a coincidence.

100
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,870
I just finished cooking as you returned.

101
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,240
How do you have a key to my place?

102
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,880
I'm your sister.

103
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,190
Besides,

104
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,470
I rented this place for you.

105
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,510
Come on, have a taste.

106
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,140
I made your favorite steak today.

107
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,360
My cooking's way better

108
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,080
than back abroad.

109
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,100
Let's toast in advance.

110
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,620
The Hua family's fortune

111
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,340
will soon be ours.

112
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,620
What... What's going on?

113
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,980
After years of cooking for Hua Rucheng,

114
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,300
I finally gave him a heart attack.

115
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,540
He's in critical care now,

116
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,020
but with his health,

117
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,540
he won't last long.

118
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,620
With something this big,

119
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,520
shouldn't you be there?

120
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,020
I don't want to see him.

121
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,380
Let's make it convincing.

122
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,620
At least keep up appearances.

123
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,100
Don't worry.

124
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,380
I've been acting perfectly.

125
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,860
They all think I'm unwell

126
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,020
and resting at home.

127
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,940

her father's care and work?

137
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,980
Right.

138
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,420
With Honey Love's poor sales,

139
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,380
she's rushing

142
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,180
So she's managing

144

and work.

Despite such a huge family crisis,

146
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,820
she hasn't shed a tear.

147
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,540
She looks delicate

148
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,940
but is tougher than expected.

149
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,140

Come down when you wake up.

154
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,860
Hua Ruoyi!

155
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,540
I know

156
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,980
our mission is to protect the dandelion.

157
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,780
Mission?

158
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,180
There's a snake!

159
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,140
Where...?

160
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,140
Where is it? Where?

161
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,950
You think
you can protect dandelions like that?

162
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,140
No...

163
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,500
I played along, and you scared me.

164
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,780
And I played along too.

165
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,340
Agents often face

166
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,060
unexpected situations.

Your drool?

173
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,660

00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,570
♪Yet I feared the light you shone♪

192
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,690
♪Singing lightly, tinged with sorrow♪

193
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,610
♪I return to every place we knew♪

194
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,850
♪My growth, your reflection♪

195
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,290
♪I truly hope♪

196
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,410
♪I could have been there
for you all those years♪
