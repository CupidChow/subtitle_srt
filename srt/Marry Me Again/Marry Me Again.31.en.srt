3
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,580
(Room 1111)

4
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,910
Tang Jingxing,

5
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,430
you're awake!

6
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,760
Finally, you're awake.

7
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,550
Who are you?

8
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,560
I'm Mi Chuxia.

9
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,920
Don't you remember me?

10
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,460
You wouldn't lose your memory
after a few days

11
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,710
of fainting, right?

12
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,430
Then you must remember
your name is Tang Jingxing.

13
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,870
What about Lu Nianbai?

14
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,120
You must have some idea about this name.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,230
When we first met,

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,920
it was pouring rain that day.

17
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,000
I even kissed you at your funeral.

18
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,600
Did you forget?

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,040
How did you kiss?

20
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,350
Just like this.

21
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:10,130
♪Today, the sky outside is gray♪

22
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,780
♪It's the color of missing you♪

23
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,100

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,960
You...

32
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,270
How...?

33
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,750
What happened to your neck?

34
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,420
Mu Huaijin strangled you before?

35
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,680
Great, you lied to me again.

36
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,520
I'm sorry, Chuxia.

37
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,490
The killer chasing me wasn't found.

38
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,150
I feared you'd be in danger if knew.

39
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,300
That's why I didn't tell you.

40
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,710
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,680
I won't lie to you again.

42
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,430
Really?

43
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,150
Then I'll trust you one last time.

44
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,680
Hello, everyone.

45
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,190
I'm Hua Ruoyi,
President of Wanmao Group.

46
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,750
Since the Honey Love jewelry series
launched last year,

47
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,510
(Melody and warmth)
it has gained wide praise.

48
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,680
The cultural designs became last year's

49
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,600
sales champion.

50
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,910
So this year,

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,040
we plan to launch
the Year of the Dragon collection.

52
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,830
Now I declare

53
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,240
that the new product launch event
officially begins.

54
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,680
- Great!
- Great!

55
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,160
Peipei, I've received the contract.

56
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,040
About the strategic direction adjustment

57
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,920
and major shareholder changes...

58
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,190
Peipei, I won't talk about it now.

59
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,470
What are you doing?

60
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,960
Go to sleep.

61
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,510
I haven't finished my work yet.

62
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,950
Dad plans to retire next year.

63
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,800
I'll inherit the Hua Group eventually.

64
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,680
Behave yourself for now.

65
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,590
I'm heading to work.

66
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,800
We're legally married now.

67
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,350
Shouldn't we give Dad

68
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,800
a healthy heir first?

69
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,870
Aren't you slacking off?

70
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,860
(Chuxia, camp in the park tonight.
By Tang Jingxing.)

71
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Snapped me secretly, huh?

72
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,670
Is it that funny?

73
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,720
Just... a little funny.

74
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,560
Just a bit.

75
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,160
These dandelions are hard to blow.

76
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,200
Don't believe me? Try it...

77
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,120
He actually kept this.

78
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,470
Chuxia,

79
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,320
those boxes held our past.

80
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,440
This box holds our future.

81
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,840
Would you like to open it?

82
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,200
Chuxia,

83
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,870
this year without you,

84
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,630
whenever I saw couples walking together,

85
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,720
or night stars,

86
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,510
or autumn leaves, I thought of you

87
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,630
and missed you.

88
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,870
I thought we'd be separated forever

89
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,710
and miss each other.

90
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,390
Until I came back,

91
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,550
you were still single and missing me.

92
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,870
Do you know how happy I was?

93
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,960
Luckily, you returned.

94
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,750
I almost gave up.

95
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,440
Yeah.

96
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,670
I'm so glad I returned.

97
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,920
From now on,

98
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,080
I want to wake up with you every day.

99
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,000
Let's share meals and seasons.

100
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,750
I'll be with you every moment

101
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,550
and we'll begin a long journey together

102
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,270
until our hair turns grey

103
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,110
and wrinkles appear.

104
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,080
We'll walk through a lifetime.

105
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,120
When I get wrinkles, I'll be ugly

106
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,200
with blurred vision, deaf ears,

107
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,440
and a bad temper.

108
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,870
You'll surely find me annoying.

109
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,150
I swear I absolutely won't.

110
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,630
Do you know

111
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,840
why I chose this ring?

112
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,800
Why?

113
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,750
Its heart shape shows my sincerity.

114
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Only one, just for you.

115
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,550
More importantly,

116
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,670
this DR ring

117
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,720
can only be given to one person
in a lifetime.

118
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,120
We'll be each other's only.

119
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,440
So,

120
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,200
this is

121
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,000
Matchmaker's red thread.

122
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,760
Once tied,

123
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,200
it's forever.

124
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,720
A lifetime to love only you.

125
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Through rich or poor, health or illness,

126
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,320
we'll face it all together.

127
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,870
Chuxia,

128
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,480
will you marry me?

129
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,550
