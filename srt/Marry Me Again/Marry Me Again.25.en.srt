00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,940
=Episode 25=

3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,430
What do I want?

4
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,520
Stay back.

5
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,640
I'll show you...

6
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,710
Get after them!

7
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,230
Where are they?

8
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,870
They were just here.

9
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,870
Look for them!

10
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,960
Over there!

11
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,920
Have they left?

12
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,480
No, not yet.

13
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,040
Don't flatter yourself.

14
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,960
Don't think my coming back with you

15
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,900
means I've forgiven you.

16
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,800
It was because you got hurt for me.

17
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,200
I felt guilty,

18
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,440
so I stayed to look after you.

19
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,790
What are you doing?

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,670
Trying to charm me into forgiving you?

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,920
Will seduction work?

22
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,510
Don't go. It's too late.

23
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,760
Let me go back.

24
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,200
Let me go back!

25
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,360
Though my arm hurts now,

26
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,880
I can manage by myself.

27
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,230
Alright, alright.

28
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,710
Rest early then.

29
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,640
I'll sleep in my old room.

30
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,680
What are you doing?

31
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,480
I'm hungry.

32
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,480
I'm really hungry.

33
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,910
Mr. Tang,

34
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,830
behave yourself.

35
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,310
What's wrong?

36
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,510
Didn't we make up yesterday?

37
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,480
You don't really think

38
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,880
that means I've forgiven you, right?

39
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,240
How can you be so cold?

40
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,700
You act indifferent afterward.

41
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,350
We're all adults.

42
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,470
These things happen

43
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,710
when the mood is right.

44
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,310
Tang Jingxing,

45
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,200
I'm glad you came back safely.

46
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,600
But I can't forgive

47
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,680
your lies.

48
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,390
So even now,

49
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,120
you still won't tell me

50
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,200
what really happened?

51
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,680
The Hua Group is coming
to the briefing today.

52
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,440
I'll attend alone.

53
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,230
I'll join you.

54
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,400
The Hua Group's stock

55
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,440
has been oddly fluctuating.

56
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,410
Keep an eye on it for me.

57
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,280
Stop following me.

58
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,870
I'm sticking with you.

59
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,600
My arm still really hurts.

60
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,440
Why didn't you mention it last night?

61
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,750
You've made up?

62
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,070
Huaijin?

63
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,000
Of course.

64
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,510
Couples don't hold grudges overnight.

65
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,350
Let's go to work.

66
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,790
Bye.

67
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,240
Wanmao finally starts making money,

68
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,360
but

69
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,640
Tang Jingxing returns.

70
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,880
What should we do now?

71
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,440
So, you suggest

72
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,590
increasing everyone's dividends
from Wanmao.

73
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,200
The board wants to forcefully acquire

74
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,910
Tang Jingxing's shares
at last year's price.

75
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,030
When Hua Group invested in Wanmao,

76
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,910
we already adjusted
the dividends fairly.

77
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,000
A forced acquisition would be unfair

78
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,190
to Tang Jingxing.

79
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,120
Then it's unfair to our Hua Group.

80
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,040
Ms. Hua,

81
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,310
the Hua Group

82
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,560
isn't your father's private property.

83
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,270
If you can't acquire
Tang Jingxing's shares,

84
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,390
you're unfit to inherit Hua Group.

85
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,080
Either acquire them

86
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,350
or forget about the board

87
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,640
approving your chairmanship.

88
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,590
Has anyone asked my opinion?

89
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,310
Mr. Tang,

90
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,470
when did you arrive?

91
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,120
I'll voluntarily transfer
all my Wanmao shares

92
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,680
to Ms. Hua without any conditions.

93
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,320
Any leads on yesterday's thugs?

94
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,450
Look into the people around Lu Nianqi

95
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,650
and see if there's an issue.

96
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,900
(Notarial Will)

97
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,660
(Signed by Hua Rucheng)

98
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,540
(Analysis. Evaluation)

99
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,680
(Lu Nianqi said Hua Rucheng feared
I'd use Mi Chuxia's name)

100
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
(to seize the Hua family's assets,)

101
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,440
(so he sent killers after me.)

102
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,680
(But the DNA report date)

103
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,080
(shows Hua Rucheng)

104
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,750
(only learned)

105
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,350
(Mi Chuxia was his daughter
after the attack.)

106
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,800
(The real murderer remains unknown.)

107
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,070
(So Chuxia,)

108
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,160
(I can't tell you why.)

109
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,040
(I can't put you in danger.)

110
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,240
Tang Jingxing!

111
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,120
You gave up shares to help me stabilize

112
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,800
in the Hua Group, right?

113
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,870
Wanmao was your life's work.
How could you...?

114
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,440
Anyway, I'm broke now.

115
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,870
I'll have to beg you,
Miss Hua, for mercy.

116
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,950
Let me live off your wealth.

117
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,470
Chuxia,

118
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,670
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,080
I really wanted to return earlier.

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,920
Do you know?

121
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,590
I came back secretly before.

122
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,800
But I couldn't face you.

123
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,270
Every time I saw you grieving,

124
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,320
crying, and mourning,

125
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,400
my heart broke.

126
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,440
But I could only hide in the shadows.

127
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Do you know how badly I wanted

128
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,630
to rush over and hold you?

129
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,750
