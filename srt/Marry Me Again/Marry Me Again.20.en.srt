Yi,

4
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,310
what's been up with you lately?

5
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,790
I feel like you've been avoiding me.

6
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,480
Not at all.

7
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,430
Really?

8
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,770
Then what were you doing just now?

9
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,670
I just wanted to say

10
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,510
that I'll be busy with work tonight,

11
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,150
so please don't disturb me.

(But no matter how I change,)

14
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,360
(she'll still fall for me.)

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,920
No way.

16
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,280
If I stay under the same roof with him,

17
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,950
I can't help but think...

18
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,000
No way.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,620
Working hard can help me
stop thinking about him.

20
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,560
Lu Nianbai?

21
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,830
Didn't you want to kiss me?

22
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,540
No way, I'm seriously unwell.

23
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,750
If this keeps going,

24
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,080
I really can't hold back anymore.

25
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,320
