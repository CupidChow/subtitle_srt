=Episode 15=

3
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,510
You had us
try making filigree yesterday.

4
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,470
Are you assessing our potential

5
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,080
to be inheritors?

6
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,280
Traditional craftsmanship
needs successors,

7
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,120
but apprentices don't earn any income

8
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,050
before mastering the skills.

9
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,760
That's why so many people give up.

10
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,070
Mr. Mu found out this morning

11
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,150
that you even went
to the newspaper office yesterday,

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,040
asking them
to post recruitment ads online

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,230
to find the right successor.

14
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,150
Am I right?

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,590
Young city folks like you

16
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,950
can't handle the apprentice life.

17
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,150
Maybe I'm not skilled enough

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,710
to learn your craft,

19
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,280
but Wanmao could establish a foundation

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
and set up scholarships

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,560
to cover apprentices' expenses
before they master the craft.

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,080
We could help you train successors.

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,390
You business folks
just throw money around.

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,760
Mr. Zhang,

25
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,840
you're an Intangible Cultural
Heritage Inheritor.

26
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,080
The government gives you subsidies
every month,

27
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,920
but new apprentices get nothing,

28
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,590
not even basic living support.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,920
Without spending,
no one will come to learn.

30
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,910
You...

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,200
Right.

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,080
Our traditional craftsmanship

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,710
will eventually fade away.

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,320
That's not true, Mr. Zhang.

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,310
There are many people

36
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,710
who are interested in this

37
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,630
exquisite traditional craft.

38
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,430
If our company's Honey Love

39
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,200
could incorporate filigree inlay,

40
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,800
it would also help promote

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,110
your craftsmanship.

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,510
Promotion

43
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,880
might not even bring anyone.

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,040
Mr. Zhang,

45
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,310
is this the home of Mr. Zhang,

46
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,550
the filigree inlay inheritor?

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,600
What do you want?

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,260
I'm here to apprentice under you
and learn filigree inlay techniques.

49
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,310
Is this Mr. Zhang's home?

50
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,390
I want to learn
filigree inlay techniques.

51
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,070
Are you really here

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,120
to apprentice?

53
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,000
I saw Louis' promotional video

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,010
about the filigree inlay craft
and its inheritance,

55
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,390
so I came to check it out.

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,390
Many in our group wanted to come.

57
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,670
We were the first to arrive.

58
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,710
(When did Louis post that?)

59
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,630
Mr. Zhang,

60
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,550
you see?

61
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,730
If you collaborate with us,

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,840
more people will learn about

63
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,160
Intangible Cultural Heritage.

64
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,810
Finding the right person

65
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,680
to inherit your legacy

66
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,860
will just be a matter of time.

67
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,760
You'd better keep your word

68
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,390
or I'll make you regret it.

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,790
You've agreed?

70
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,280
- Agreed.
- Thank you.

71
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,640
Mr. Zhang, can you show us your work?

72
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,630
Alright...

73
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,990
Come, I'll show you.

74
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,190
This way.

75
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,110
Alright.

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,710
Why would Louis post this?

77
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,320
It really helped us.

78
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,600
Let me see.

79
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,420
(Louis)

80
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,480
How did he get this picture?

81
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,480
Louis updated his social media.

82
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,710
- Really?
- Check it out.

83
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,790
Doesn't this scenery look familiar?

84
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,670
It looks just like our community.

85
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,920
You might've seen this view too.

86
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,080
This looks familiar.

87
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,740
Louis seems to have one just like it.

88
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,440
It's a high-quality replica.

89
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,640
You're Louis.

90
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,590
You've finally figured it out.

91
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,120
I gave you so many hints.

92
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,240
I thought your thick brain

93
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,760
would never get it.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,820
No,

95
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,210
I've always wanted to work with you.

96
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,800
And you know Honey Love so well.

97
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,710
You even liked our posts as Louis.
I'm really...

98
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,830
Set aside your little schemes.

99
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,240
I won't give you special treatment.

100
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,910
When I evaluate clients,

101
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,760
besides product quality,

102
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,720
sincerity in collaboration

103
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
is my top criterion.

104
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,800
I...

105
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,830
I'm the most sincere client.

106
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,760
Really, you can make any request.

107
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,760
Any request is fine?

108
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,430
I'm

109
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,270
the President

110
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,200
of Wanmao!

111
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,560
If I say it, it counts.

112
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,310
Sincerity isn't something you just say.

113
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,000
How to measure it? How to show it?

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,920
Figure it out yourself.

115
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,640
Lu Nianbai.

116
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,030
Louis...

117
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,390
Our latest cultural designs are out

118
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,200
and perfect for any occasion.

119
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,480
Uncle.

120
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,600
Uncle!

121
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,040
Uncle,

122
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,880
can you pay attention to me?

123
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,430
Look at me.

124
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,040
Our new product

125
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,120
has incredible details,

126
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,270
simple yet elegant.

127
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,270
It works with both formal

128
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,640
and casual outfits.

129
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,390
(Watch me save the day.)

130
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,390
(He'll definitely see my sincerity.)

131
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,150
(No, this dress is rented.)

132
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,240
Sorry...

133
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,510
There's a reason for this.

134
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,830
I can explain.

135
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,390
Let me wipe it for you.

136
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,800
That was just an accident.

137
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,040
Don't mind it.

138
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,800
Mind what?

139
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,200
It seems you're the one who minds.

140
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,440
Why should I mind?

141
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,590
It's just a forehead kiss.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,120
You must do that often abroad, right?

143
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,640
Yeah.

144
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,020
Among friends overseas,

145
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,320
there are many kissing greetings.

146
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,750
Really?

147
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,190
Like this...

148
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,640
And like this.

149
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,350
This is a hand kiss.

150
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,680
This is an Eskimo kiss.

151
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,550
And also...

152
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,910
Okay...

153
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,440
I get it.

154
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,160
Lu Nianbai did it on purpose.

155
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,200
Who kisses like that as a greeting?

156
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,120
But maybe he just doesn't care,

157
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,040
so he does whatever he wants.

158
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,560
Am I the only one feeling different?

159
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,030
No way.

160
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,040
Chuxia, don't overthink it.

161
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,190
But

162
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,000
if I act like nothing happened,

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,520
he really will treat it as nothing.

164
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,910
I'm going crazy.

165
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,040
Why am I thinking about this?

166
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,440
Your feelings
for Lu Nianbai aren't real.

167
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,990
It's just because he looks
like Tang Jingxing.

168
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,350
What should I do?

169
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,160
What am I supposed to do?

170
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,350
You're back from running already?

171
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,840
Weren't you going
to show me your sincerity?

172
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,590
Why slack off after just two days?

173
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,120
(Right.)

174
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,790
(I can't keep dwelling on nonsense.)

175
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,910
(He's Lu Nianbai.)

176
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,750
(And he's Louis.)

177
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,590
(Honey Love's deal matters most.)

178
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,350
I'll do it...

179
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,110
I've got it...

180
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,230
Like this?

181
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,950
I'm going...

182
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,520
Wait, I'm going.

183
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,630
Huaijin?

184
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,550
Come in quickly.

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,920
What brings you here?

186
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,330
The last time I came to this area,

187
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,040
I thought it was pretty nice.

188
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,910
I wanted to move closer

189
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,440
to the company,

190
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,710
so I chose this place

191
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
to be your neighbor.

192
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,750
You moved here too?

193
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,120
Right across from you.

194
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,040
Across?

195
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,560
That close?

196
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,110
A gift for the neighbor.

197
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,590
I really like it.

198
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,830
It's so beautiful.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,480
Breakfast is ready, aren't you coming?

200
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,510
Sorry about that,

201
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,440
I only made enough for two.
We can't host you.

202
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,360
No problem.

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,750
I have things to do anyway.

204
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,840
Chuxia,

205
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,830
I'll head back now.

206
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,950
If you need anything, just...

207
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,140
- Bye.
- Bye.

208
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,630
Come visit often.

209
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,950
What happened?

210
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,120
What's wrong?

211
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,080
What happened?

212
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,800
It's nothing. Just a small cut.

213
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,160
Your hand is bleeding.

214
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,510
So what if it's a small cut?

215
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,670
Do you have band-aids at home?

216
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,950
In my bedroom cabinet.

217
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,240
I'm willing.
