00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,940
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,930
You often help other girls
wash their hands, don't you?

4
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,170
Are you interested in my private life?

5
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,270
No, just asking.

6
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,280
Keep washing, my hands will wrinkle.

7
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,890
You're quite skilled at the process.

8
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,400
Hands are a girl's second face.

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,480
Your second face is way too rough.

10
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,000
Sorry about that.

11
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,030
I can't compare to your wives' hands.

12
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,030
Wives?

13
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,590
You think I charm many women?

14
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,150
Do you feel regret

15
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,400
that you're my niece?

16
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,960
Cut it out.

17
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,530
I don't want to be a fish in your pond.

18
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,310
I'm not like this with every girl.

19
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,750
Only when I'm interested.

20
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,910
(I must've mistaken him
for Tang Jingxing again.)

21
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,560
How could I be moved
by such a frivolous man?

22
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,750
It seems that
if I want her to realize I'm Louis,

23
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,390
I'll have to drop some obvious clues.

24
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,350
Uncle!

25
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
Louis updated his social media.

26
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,560
- Really?
- Check it out.

27
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,310
Doesn't this scenery look familiar?

28
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,840
It looks just like our community.

29
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,080
You might've seen this view too.

30
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,120
Louis lives here!

31
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,360
That's right, I'm...

32
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,200
Uncle!

33
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,360
Louis is your neighbor.

34
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,680
Look!

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,300
The scenery and the angle in this photo,

36
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,310
and the buildings outside.

37
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,710
They're identical to ours.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,890
What does that mean?

39
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,840
It means he lives in our building.

40
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,430
And on the same floor, above or below.

41
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,600
I'll go check now.

42
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,560
How's it going?

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,430
Upstairs is an 80-year-old man.

44
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,000
Downstairs is a college girl.

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,950
Neither is Louis.

46
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,600
So what's the problem?

47
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,770
Yeah.

48
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,920
The answer's so obvious.

49
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,360
How could we miss it?

50
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,600
Let me think again.

51
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,630
What did I overlook?

52
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,160
It's clearly the same.

53
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,390
Louis has been updating a lot lately.

54
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,740
Hello.

55
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,660
Chuxia,

56
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,200
I've compiled the sales data

57
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,960
for the last three months
of affordable luxury goods.

58
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,110
Should I deliver it to you?

59
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,800
No need.

60
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,060
I've been staying with my uncle lately.

61
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,510
I'll have my assistant pick it up.

62
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,590
Uncle?

63
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,190
I never heard you had an uncle.

64
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,770
He just came back from the U.S.

65
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,910
Oh, I see.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,980
Then give me the address.

67
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,270
I'll deliver it myself

68
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,870
and visit your uncle too.

69
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,250
Sure, come over.

70
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,480
Huaijin, you're here?

71
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Come in, why are you standing outside?

72
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,760
You're here.

73
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,430
Let me formally introduce you.

74
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
This is my aunt's younger brother,

75
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,440
Lu Nianbai.

76
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,600
Doesn't he look like Tang Jingxing?

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
That's what I thought at first,

78
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,920
but it's not him.

79
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,030
Hello.

80
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,240
Hello,

81
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,460
sorry for my earlier mistake.

82
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,360
When Chuxia said
she was staying with her uncle,

83
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,120
I imagined an older uncle.

84
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,800
I didn't expect someone so young.

85
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,790
Really?

86
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,180
Why have I never heard her mention you?

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,560
Maybe you're not that close.

88
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,800
We're very close.

89
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,830
She shares everything with me.

90
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,240
I just think

91
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,680
our Chuxia is a straightforward girl,

92
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,870
a bit unlucky in love

93
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,070
and sometimes misjudges people.

94
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,310
But now that she has me as her uncle,

95
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,120
every man around her

96
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,960
will have to

97
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,310
pass my strict test.

98
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,950
Huaijin, did you bring
the documents for me?

99
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,350
Yes, I did.

100
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,900
You've been a huge help.

101
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,920
Let me treat you to dinner.

102
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,800
Sure.

103
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,920
- Let's eat out then.
- Let's go.

104
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,900
A guest should be hosted.

105
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,720
Let's eat at home.

106
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,680
I'll cook.

107
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,120
Is your cooking even edible?

108
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,750
Don't end up loving it too much.

109
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,350
Chuxia,

110
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,950
I've highlighted the key points for you.

111
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,010
Thank goodness for your help.

112
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,080
Thank you, Huaijin.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,840
No problem.

114
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,880
Yi,

115
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,770
could you pass me the pepper?

116
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,320
Wait for me.

117
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,480
Pepper, right?

118
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,970
Isn't the pepper right here?

119
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,750
I'm back.

120
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,480
Let me continue.

121
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,750
Here's what we're trying...

122
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,600
Yi, could you chop some onions for me?

123
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,590
Fine.

124
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,760
Wait a moment.

125
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,950
The kitchen's smoky.

126
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,080
I can handle it.

127
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,690
Looks good, huh?

128
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,790
Pretty doesn't mean tasty.

129
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,960
It's delicious.

130
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,740
So tasty!

131
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,960
Huaijin, your portion's too small.

132
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,690
I haven't touched this side.

133
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,510
Want some of mine?

134
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,200
Chuxia, no need.

135
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,790
If you like it, go ahead.

136
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,630
I've got enough.

137
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,150
Don't be polite.

138
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,990
Come on, take some.

139
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,550
It's really okay.

140
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,970
I haven't touched this at all.

141
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,280
Chuxia,

142
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,320
thank you.

143
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,680
No need to thank me.

144
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,390
I heard Uncle Hua is ill.

145
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,770
If no one to look after you at home,

146
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,630
you can try staying with me.

147
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,320
You've misunderstood.

148
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,830
I'm here to collaborate with Louis.

149
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,880
I heard he lives in this area.

150
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,480
The famous influencer Louis?

151
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,180
The Honey Love bracelet
clearance happened

152
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,650
because he liked it.

153
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,870
So I believe

154
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,750
if he partners with us,

155
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,300
Honey Love's sales will soar.

156
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,080
But even though Lu Nianbai
is your uncle in name,

157
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,910
you're not blood-related.

158
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,120
Living together like this

159
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,450
isn't appropriate, is it?

160
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,200
You're overthinking it.

161
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,720
Sure, he's a bit of...

162
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,040
a flirt,

163
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,120
but he's actually a good person.

164
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,320
How long have you known him

165
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,960
to trust him so much?

166
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,960
I think he's the type

167
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,320
who's cold outside but warm inside.

168
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,840
Anyway, he's a good person.

169
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,630
Regardless,

170
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,550
he's still a stranger.

171
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,200
If you ever feel unsafe,

172
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,500
call me immediately.

173
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,030
Got it.

174
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,750
Alright, you can just leave me here.

175
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,790
Head back now.

176
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll go then. Bye.

177
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,960
Bye.

178
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,270
Look into someone
named Lu Nianbai for me.

179
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,870
You're back!

180
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,870
I made you lemonade. Want some?

181
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,960
I'm thirsty.

182
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,600
Thanks a lot.

183
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,750
Is this lemonade

184
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,120
or concentrated lemon extract?

185
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,080
So sour!

186
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,510
How does it taste?

187
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,360
Of course, it's awful. Why even ask?

188
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,240
I'm glad you know.

189
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,080
Why are you acting odd today?
