2
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,940
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,350
This clay

4
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,280
is different from what you used before.

5
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,390
There's a type of pottery
called bone china

6
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,640
that incorporates animal bone powder.

7
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,150
Some people

8
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,560
mix their beloved pets' ashes into it

9
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,480
after they die.

10
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,030
And make them into memorial dolls.

11
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,150
If I die one day,

12
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,400
you can use my ashes

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,790
into porcelain to keep you company.

14
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,040
You're crazy to say such things.

15
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,000
Stop it.

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,320
Sister?

17
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,230
Happy birthday, Huaijin.

18
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,840
Let's come here every year
on your birthday

19
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,200
and make dolls together,

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,120
okay?

21
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,350
Do you like it?

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,000
I never knew

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,510
you did pottery all these years.

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,640
It's been many years.

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,230
I come here every year.

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,040
Chuxia,

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,790
let's make pottery together
next year too.

28
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,600
Yu, let's go.

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,720
Let's go play outside.

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,200
Go outside?

31
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,680
Huaijin,

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,100
will you still

33
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,880
watch my favorite horror movie
with me today?

34
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,350
Sure.

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,790
I want to watch it!

36
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,880
This one.

37
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,550
What's this?

38
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,590
It's called "A Wicked Ghost".

39
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,760
You haven't heard of it?

40
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,030
Hurry, help me put it on.

41
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,950
Here.

42
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,160
This is for you.

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,200
A birthday gift.

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,160
HRY.

45
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,270
Hua Ruoyi.

46
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,600
That's my name.

47
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,110
(HRY)

48
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,790
(isn't Hua Ruoyi.)

49
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,640
(It's Hua Ruoyu.)

50
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,510
Huaijin,

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,920
am I pretty?

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,510
It's so pretty.

53
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,230
Do you like it?

54
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,830
I scratched it while showering?

55
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
Is it nice?

56
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,390
You must be wondering

57
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,280
why there's a red mole

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,040
on your shoulder just like hers.

59
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,300
(Nianbai)

60
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,640
Tang Jingxing...

61
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,440
If it weren't for you,

62
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,270
Chuxia would have been mine

63
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,350
and fallen for me long ago.

64
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,640
Don't move!

65
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,030
Stay still.

66
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,800
If you move,

67
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,350
you'll be different from her.

68
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,550
Mu Huaijin,

69
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,190
you're terrifying.

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,910
You're literally insane!

71
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,430
- Come back!
- Let me go!

72
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,350
Let me go!

73
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,350
Mu Huaijin,

74
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,200
let me go!

75
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,440
You're so different from Yu.

76
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,710
Yu likes wearing edgy jackets,

77
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,240
but you always wear

78
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,120
those girly dresses.

79
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,470
Yu loves wasabi,

80
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,150
but you never do.

81
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,640
Yu loves horror movies,

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,240
rock music,

83
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,120
and ceramics,

84
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,710
but you can't do any of them.

85
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,470
I used to wonder

86
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,080
if you could ever become Yu.

87
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,640
Until the day

88
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,080
I saw you walk out wearing Yu's clothes.

89
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,120
You looked stunning in that dress.

90
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,950
I thought it would be buried forever.

91
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,760
Thankfully, it found you.

92
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,680
I've spent

93
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,870
so much effort,

94
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,720
bit by bit...

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,560
transforming you

96
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,080
little by little.

97
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,950
Now you almost resemble her.

98
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,950
You probably have noticed

99
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,000
that Yu has a burn scar on her hand.

100
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,390
She got it on a college camping trip.

101
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,150
When she was cooking for me,

102
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,560
she accidentally burned herself.

103
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,230
Be good.

104
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,840
Don't move.

105
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,270
I'll give you an identical burn.

106
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,710
Let's welcome the couple.

107
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,240
Chuxia,

108
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,160
you're finally my wife.

109
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,550
Chuxia!

110
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,070
Chuxia,

111
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,670
I'm here.

112
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,880
Tang Jingxing,

113
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,640
run!

114
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,200
The police are coming.

115
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,910
You killed Lu Nianqi.

116
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,920
There's no escape for you.

117
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,430
Right.

118
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,750
Whoever truly wanted Lu Nianqi dead

119
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,870
can't escape.

120
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,640
Aunt Nianqi?

121
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,760
Aunt Nianqi.

122
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,120
Lu Nianqi?

123
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,560
Why aren't you dead?

124
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,870
You wanted to kill Tang Jingxing
all along, didn't you?

125
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,800
What are you talking about?

126
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,710
I don't understand.

127
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,920
Stop pretending.

128
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,590
I've found the evidence.

129
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,600
You set the supermarket on fire.

130
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,440
You wanted him dead, right?

131
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,880
Oh, really?

132
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,830
It seems you're not completely useless.

133
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,350
Tang Jingxing is my obstacle.

134
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,560
I have to eliminate him.

135
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,990
Mu Huaijin,

136
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,980
I warned you
that if you touch Tang Jingxing,

137
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,350
I'll kill you!

138
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,070
Lu Nianqi...

139
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,190
Lu Nianqi!

140
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,860
(Nianbai)

141
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,920
Sister.

142
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,550
Sister!

143
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,190
Sister!

144
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,280
Mu Huaijin,

145
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,400
you didn't expect this?

146
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,520
I'm still alive.

147
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,320
You failed to finish me.

148
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,830
Tang Jingxing saved me.

149
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,190
Lu Nianqi...

150
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,800
You have secretly loved
Tang Jingxing for years,

151
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,680
so you'll say anything.

152
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,210
Mu Huaijin,

153
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,710
stop lying.

154
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,600
I now have solid proof

155
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,520
that you're

156
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,670
the one who tried

157
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,950
to murder me last year.

158
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,400
But you deceived Chuxia
and claimed I was the killer.

159
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,710
Chuxia,

160
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,830
I promised you

161
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,470
I'd tell you the truth.

162
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,520
Stay back!

163
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,230
He's strapped explosives on me.
