3
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,220
Here they come.

4
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,100
Ms. Hua,

5
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,920
regarding the online exposure
of your new relationship,

6
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,000
do you have any comments?

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,920
Can you share his identity?

8
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,400
Everyone,

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,120
today is Honey Love's launch event.

10
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
I hope we can focus

11
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,530
on questions related to Honey Love.

12
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,440
Thank you.

13
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,300
Some say you've moved on,

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,560
but you're using your late lover

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,420
to launch the new Honey Love
jewelry series for profit.

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,400
It's highly unethical.

17
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,640
What's your response?

18
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,780
Does your new boyfriend

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,440
understand the significance
of Honey Love?

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,310
Does he endorse

21
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,850
your commercialization of a deceased ex?

22
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,920
Honey Love's slogan
"Love as sweet as honey"

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,200
derives from the combination
of your and Tang Jingxing's surnames.

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,430
Many consumers supported this brand

25
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,510
because of your love story.

26
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,120
Do you consider

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,720
your current actions deceptive?

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,230
You're desperate to make money.

29
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,300
Don't drag Louis into this!

30
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,980
Right, terminate your contract
with Louis!

31
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,180
Do you know how many fans
Louis has lost because of you?

32
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,680
Louis is cursed
for getting involved with you.

33
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,640
You shrew, stay away from Louis!

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,950
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

35
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,870
Keep your distance!

36
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,580
(Love as sweet as honey)

37
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,270
- Quite handsome.
- A tall guy.

38
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,230
Greetings, friends from the press.

39
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,480
Let me introduce myself.

40
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,110
I'm Louis.

41
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,870
He's Louis?

42
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,950
That's Louis?

43
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,270
I didn't know he was Louis.

44
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,520
Why are you here?

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,440
Hurry back.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,680
The man in the photo

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,160
with Ms. Hua Ruoyi is me.

48
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,520
They're not the same person, right?

49
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,440
Why?

50
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,880
I'm Louis,

51
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,040
also Tang Jingxing.

52
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,990
Tang Jingxing is dead, isn't he?

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,960
What's really going on?

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,820
Are they dating?

55
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,150
- No idea.
- Aren't they just partners?

56
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,070
A year ago,

57
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,440
I was assaulted by criminals overseas.

58
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,040
Though severely injured
during the struggle,

59
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,960
I never imagined rumors

60
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,790
of my death would spread domestically.

61
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,200
I never expected

62
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,790
when I finally returned

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,440
to be reunited with my beloved,

64
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,000
I would be mistaken for another man.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,910
Mr. Tang,

66
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,760
why have you been absent this past year?

67
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,760
You vanished online too.

68
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,110
I think I'm quite active.

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,790
Haven't I been collaborating
with Honey Love?

70
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,320
So he really is Louis.

71
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,480
Mr. Louis, could you comment?

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,630
Please share something.

73
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,170
How will you collaborate moving forward?

74
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,420
Tell us more.

75
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,580
Please elaborate.

76
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,560
Mr. Louis...

77
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,230
Oh no, what now?

78
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,240
The world thinks you're Tang Jingxing.

79
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,510
How do we resolve this?

80
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,670
Don't worry about it.

81
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,230
How could I not worry?

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,320
Lies will eventually be exposed.

83
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,270
You can't be Tang Jingxing forever.

84
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,840
I haven't lied. Actually, I...

85
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,760
Nianbai!

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,990
What's going on?

87
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,710
Lu Nianbai pretended

88
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,230
to be Tang Jingxing to help me.

89
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,350
Yi,

90
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,270
I need to speak with Nianbai privately.

91
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,470
Okay,

92
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,350
I'll return to the venue first.

93
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,800
Have you lost your mind?

94
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,710
First, you keep helping Mi Chuxia,

95
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,760
and now you expose
your identity for her.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,830
Have you forgotten her father
is your enemy?

97
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,230
I've said it before,

98
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,000
Hua Rucheng and Mi Chuxia

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,510
are separate entities.

100
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,680
You really separate them clearly.

101
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,680
Then dare you tell her

102
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,150
it was her father who tried to kill you?

103
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,280
Lu Nianqi,

104
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,480
didn't I warn you

105
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,830
to stop interfering?

106
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,360
Don't think I don't know

107
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,150
you leaked our photos!

108
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,110
I also warned that

109
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,800
if you dare hurt her again,

110
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,680
we're done for good.

111
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,120
Do you even have a conscience?

112
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,750
Without my rescue last year,

113
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,080
you'd be long gone!

114
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,160
Nianbai,

115
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,510
I did everything for you.

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,030
If you dislike it,

117
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,080
I'll leave Mi Chuxia alone.

118
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,520
Besides,

119
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,560
she still thinks
you're my biological brother.

120
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,390
If we break ties now,

121
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,880
what will she think?

122
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,030
I'll explain it to her myself.

123
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,840
Stay out of it.

124
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,640
Ms. Hua!

125
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,750
The news of Mr. Tang's resurrection
as an influencer

126
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,830
has gone viral.

127
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,680
We're all over the internet now.

128
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,680
Public opinion has completely shifted.

129
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,920
They say

130
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,720
you two are adorable.

131
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,560
Look at

132
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,000
the live data.

133
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,760
(Trending)
Honey Love's fame is recovering too.

134
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,800
Rest assured.

135
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,120
The sales will boom!

136
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,080
(The higher we soar now,)

137
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,390
(the harder we'll fall)

138
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,030
(when the truth emerges.)

139
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,740
(Louis)

140
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,590
Lu Nianbai's wallet.

141
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,830
How's it going?

142
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,350
Did I perform well today?

143
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,790
Tang Jingxing.

144
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,030
It's really you.

145
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,600
Chuxia.

146
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,540
Chuxia...

147
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,590
You've been lying to me all along.

148
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,990
Chuxia,

149
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,470
I had my reasons.

150
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,090
Okay.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,030
Tell me

152
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,200
why.

153
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,240
You survived,

154
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,590
but you stayed away

155
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,030
for a whole year.

156
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,510
Even after returning,

157
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,070
you pretended

158
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,800
to be a stranger.

159
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,880
You watched me grieve,

160
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
and you watched me struggle

161
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,680
with guilt every day
over possibly loving

162
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,830
someone else.

163
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,880
Yet you still

164
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,200
kept silent.

165
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,590
What's really on your mind?

166
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,280
Don't you love me?

167
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,920
Or don't you trust me?

168
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,830
Speak!

169
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,190
Chuxia...

170
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,440
Chuxia, listen to me.

171
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,360
- Let me go!
- Listen, Chuxia.

172
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,560
Release me!

173
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,630
- Hear me out!
- Let go!

174
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,720
- Listen!
- Let go!

175
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,640
Tang Jingxing!

176
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,350
Mi Chuxia told you to let go.

177
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,950
Don't come closer!

178
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,240
Chuxia.

179
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,470
I never want to see you again.

180
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,590
Let's go.

181
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,000
Chuxia.

182
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,470
Thank you.

183
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,280
Chuxia,

184
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,020
you said you wanted to stay in a hotel,

185
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,920
but I was worried.

186
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,400
So I brought you to my place.

187
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,110
If you don't feel like staying,

188
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,080
I'll take you back to the Hua family.

189
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,470
I don't want Dad to worry.

190
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,080
Plus, many things

191
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,350
feel strange.

192
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,240
If Lu Nianbai

193
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,950
is Tang Jingxing,

194
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,750
why did Aunt Nianqi help him

195
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,160
pose as her brother?

196
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,710
Chuxia,

197
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,230
people change.

198
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,230
In the year Tang Jingxing was away,

199
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,200
you have no idea
how many secrets he holds.

200
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,680
Then what's their true relationship?

201
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,870
I think you shouldn't stress now.

202
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,800
The launch has just ended.

203
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,400
You deserve a good rest.

204
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,900
(Mandarin Rock)

205
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,590
Some rock music

206
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,440
would help you unwind.

207
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,120
Turn it off, it's too noisy.

208
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,100
You should give it a try.

209
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,960
But I really don't like it.

210
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,270
You'll get used to it.

211
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,400
I just don't like it, okay?

212
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,160
Why force me to change?
