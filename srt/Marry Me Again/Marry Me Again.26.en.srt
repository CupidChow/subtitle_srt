=Episode 26=

3
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,310
Chuxia, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,280
Alright, stop apologizing.

5
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,750
I don't know what you're facing now

6
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,430
or what you're hiding,

7
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,090
but I'm willing to trust you.

8
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,020
If you ever deceive me again,

9
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,200
I won't forgive you.

10
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,950
Your eyelashes are still long

11
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,310
and your mole is still here.

12
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,200
I was so clueless before

13
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,270
that I didn't even recognize you.

14
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,640
When did you wake up?

15
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,390
Before you woke up.

16
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,760
Chuxia,

17
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,270
I can finally be good to you openly.

18
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,480
You fool,

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,160
you always mess things up.

20
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,240
You want Tang Jingxing?

21
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,080
Alright.

22
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,160
Handle him yourself.

23
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,790
I've told you before,

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,360
Chuxia is mine.

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,990
You can't touch her.

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,390
I did all this

27
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,040
just to separate them.

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,080
And then?

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,550
You sent thugs to attack Chuxia.

30
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,790
Did it work?

31
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,320
They actually grew closer.

32
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,880
Who are you to judge me?

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,990
What have you done?

34
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,790
You're right.

35
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,200
You're right.

36
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,390
If I do it myself, it'll be faster.

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,200
Mu Huaijin,

38
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,320
I've warned you.

39
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,630
Don't touch Tang Jingxing,

40
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,830
or you'll regret it.

41
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,270
Why pretend to be nice now?

42
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,160
Don't forget.

43
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,830
You were involved

44
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,080
in that car accident a year ago.

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,040
It was you...

46
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,840
You sent someone to kill him.

47
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,590
But you helped, right?

48
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,310
You even hid the recording
of Hua Rucheng talking to the killer,

49
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,440
lying to him that Hua Rucheng
wanted him dead.

50
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,110
This whole year,

51
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,230
you've been by his side,

52
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,550
hiding the truth and deceiving him.

53
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,080
It was you...

54
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,880
You forced me to do this.

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,990
I forced you?

56
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,320
I forced you!

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,880
I wonder who got married

58
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,670
and still posts
on alt accounts every day

59
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,190
about how much

60
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,560
she loves

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,040
Tang Jingxing.

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,590
Wasn't my proposal exactly

63
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,880
what you wanted?

64
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,150
Right.

65
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,830
That's right.

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,030
How do you think Tang Jingxing

67
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,720
would react if he learned

68
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,070
the mastermind who ruined him

69
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,350
was actually his savior "sister"?

70
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,080
Mu Huaijin,

71
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,430
don't forget

72
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,270
that we're in this together now.

73
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,350
How dare you?

74
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,850
Mi Chuxia,

75
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,680
I ended up like this

76
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,320
because of you!

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,520
Do you think

78
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,910
protecting Wanmao

79
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,320
means you can protect the Hua Group?

80
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,720
Hello.

81
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,600
How are Hua Group's shares now?

82
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,080
Good.

83
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,470
Keep buying shares.

84
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,640
The more, the better.

85
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,480
Sister.

86
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,400
Sister!

87
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,680
Sister,

88
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,600
what's wrong?

89
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,080
Say something, Sister!

90
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,560
Tang Jingxing.

91
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,870
Mom,

92
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,880
I want to study abroad.

93
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,510
How can I afford to send you?

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,030
Paying for your college
is already hard enough.

95
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,080
You should graduate soon
and start working

96
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,200
to ease my burden.

97
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,120
But Tang Jingxing

98
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,800
is about to attend high school overseas.

99
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,320
How can you compare?

100
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,150
He's from a wealthy family.

101
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,430
Only they

102
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,800
can waste money
sending their children abroad.

103
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,390
Jingxing...

104
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,590
Hello, where are you?

105
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,590
There's an emergency
at the U.S. company.

106
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,920
I need to handle it now.

107
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,440
Besides running Louis' account
this past year,

108
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,560
you started a company too?

109
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,440
I'm boarding soon.

110
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,040
Let's talk when I'm back.

111
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,470
(He's hiding things again.)

112
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,830
(Tang Jingxing,)

113
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,040
(you've changed.)

114
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,870
(You're not the same as before.)

115
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,230
Chuxia, check this out.

116
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,750
Police found massive amounts

117
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,640
(Police Hunt Tang over Lu's Killing)
of Lu Nianqi's blood in a bar.

118
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,590
The volume suggests

119
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,560
that she's dead.

120
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,440
There are no cameras in the bar,

121
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,830
but nearby footage shows

122
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,800
Tang Jingxing carrying her
into a car's backseat.

123
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,280
He's now wanted by the police.

124
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,990
How is that possible?

125
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,080
He told me last night

126
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,830
he had urgent business in the U.S.

127
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,630
He should be on a plane by now.

128
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,350
If I confirm this,

129
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,920
I can prove his innocence.

130
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,560
Hello, Peipei.

131
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,920
Help me check

132
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,950
if Tang Jingxing booked
a flight to the U.S.

133
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,520
He didn't go.

134
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,920
He lied again.

135
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,980
(Wanted: Tang Jingxing
for the alleged murder of Lu Nianqi)

136
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,200
How's the company?

137
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,160
With Mr. Tang's scandal,

138
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,280
reporters have been camped
at the door all day.

139
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,400
I know you're upset,

140
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,000
but the board sent

141
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,110
critical documents.

142
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,480
I've emailed them to you.

143
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,520
You must review them.

144
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,950
(Hua Group Stock Decline Analysis)
Hua Group's stock has been dropping,

145
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,510
but today we found

146
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,910
a foreign company

147
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,520
has been acquiring shares.

148
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,830
They're about to be the top shareholder.

149
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,550
Isn't this the company

150
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,110
that stole Hua Group's
bidding project before?

151
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,120
That's right.

152
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,120
At this rate,

153
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,440
they'll devour Hua Group.

154
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,040
No way.

155
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,440
This was Dad's life's work.

156
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,640
It can't collapse.

157
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,600
By the way,

158
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,390
Garden Venue has also bought

159
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,480
a lot of Hua Group's shares.

160
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,150
If they're willing

161
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,590
to transfer their equity,

162
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,670
Chairman Hua would
remain the largest shareholder.

163
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,950
Previous stock prices
were artificially suppressed.

164
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,680
Now it's rebounding.

165
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,400
It's tough for us

166
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,600
to reclaim such a massive stake

167
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,800
from other funds quickly.

168

This agreement now

169
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,790
offers Hua Group's

170
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,710
highest feasible price.

171
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,700
(Equity Transfer Agreement)
Please consider it.

172
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,040
Chuxia,

173
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,590
I understand your dilemma,

174
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,630
but this isn't my company alone.

175
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,870
I have to prioritize its interests.

176
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,470
Chuxia,

177
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,350
I actually have another idea.

178
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,990
What idea?

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,520
We could get married.
