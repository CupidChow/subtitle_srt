=Episode 28=

3
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,040
This is my order.

4
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,720
Barbecue isn't healthy.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,150
Let me throw it away for you.

6
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,120
Don't throw it away,
even if you don't want it.

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,000
What a waste.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,080
I want to eat it.

9
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,430
If you really want to eat,

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,250
there are plenty of ingredients
in the kitchen.

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,870
I can cook for you.

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,480
No need!

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm not that hungry now.

14
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,560
How come I never noticed it before?

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,390
Mu Huaijin is so stubborn.

16
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,790
I'm starving.

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,840
My barbecue.

18
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,670
Tang Jingxing,

19
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,320
where are you?

20
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,040
I've already cooked your meal.

21
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,050
I have something
to attend at the company.

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,490
I'll be back soon to be with you.

23
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,990
The suspect, Tang Jingxing,
hasn't been captured yet.

24
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,710
How long has it been?

25
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,830
Why is there no news at all?

26
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,070
Tang Jingxing!

27
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,390
Where have you been all this time?

28
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,050
Don't you know the police
are hunting for you everywhere?

29
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,200
Why are you hiding from me?

30
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,230
Don't marry Mu Huaijin.

31
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,540
I saw your wedding announcement.

32
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,950
Don't marry him.

33
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,730
Chuxia,

34
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,190
I didn't hurt Lu Nianqi.

35
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,240
It was someone else.

36
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,280
Really?

37
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,560
But you'd already colluded with her

38
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,390
and shorted Dad's company.

39
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,950
I didn't do that.

40
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,080
I did cooperate with Lu Nianqi,

41
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,790
but I never participated
in shorting Hua Group.

42
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,710
Chuxia,

43
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,160
trust me.

44
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,240
I would never hurt you.

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,440
But you lied to me again.

46
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,150
I'm sorry, Chuxia.

47
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,910
I miss you so much.

48
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,240
Operation failed.

49
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,760
Operation failed.

50
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,710
Operation failed.

51
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,470
Chuxia, it's me.

52
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,840
Please open the door.

53
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,320
I left my phone in the living room.
I just heard it.

54
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,640
Why did you lock the door?

55
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,080
When I'm home alone,

56
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,710
it feels safer locked.

57
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,440
It seems recent events

58
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,880
have made you anxious.

59
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,270
When we get married,

60
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,240
I'll take good care of you.

61
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,320
Why did you come back suddenly?

62
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,830
My afternoon meeting was canceled.

63
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,450
I can spend time with you at home.

64
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,310
Huaijin,

65
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,350
let's go watch a movie.

66
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,680
It's your first time
to invite me to a movie.

67
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,510
No idea why,

68
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,200
I just felt like watching a movie.

69
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,120
I'll go change my clothes.

70
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,510
Okay.

71
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,430
Wait for me.

72
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,870
Hold on.

73
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,630
Are you crazy?

74
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,870
If he finds out you're here,

75
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,920
he'll call the police.

76
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,200
Don't trust Mu Huaijin.

77
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,830
And definitely don't marry him.

78
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,270
There are

79
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,440
many unresolved matters here.

80
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,880
Give me a week.

81
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,660
I'll definitely give you an answer.

82
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,160
Come with me, let's leave here first.

83
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm not leaving.

84
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,880
It's not just about us anymore.

85
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,710
I need to protect Dad's company.

86
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,350
- Chuxia...
- Are you ready, Chuxia?

87
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,720
I'm almost ready.

88
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,760
Just wait a bit.

89
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,870
Why is your face so red?

90
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,910
I'm too excited.

91
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,830
Let's go.

92
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,510
There's a new Gothic horror movie on.

93
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,530
You'll definitely like it.

94
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,280
Chuxia, today's horror movie

95
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,470
has a prequel.

96
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,110
I can download it for you later.

97
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,040
Actually,

98
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,680
I'm not that into horror movies.

99
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,360
That's alright.

100
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,560
With horror movies,

101
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,790
the more you watch them,

102
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,950
the more you'll like them.

103
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
By the way,

104
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,280
I have some DVDs

105
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,310
of horror movies too.

106
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,950
Let's watch them together later, okay?

107
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,870
Huaijin,

108
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,110
I'm a bit tired today.

109
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,440
I want to rest first.

110
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,560
I'll head in now.

111
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,340
Take a look.

112
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,950
This is Hua Ruoyu, Hua Ruoyi's sister.

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,550
The original heiress of the Hua family,

114
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,350
also Mu Huaijin's college girlfriend.

115
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,230
Hua Ruoyu has been extremely sheltered

116
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,280
by her family since childhood.

117
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,180
(Personal Profile Records)

118
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,710
Therefore, there's very little

119
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,350
public information about her.

120
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,920
Mi Chuxia told me about this.

121
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,800
Her sister should have died
in a car accident abroad

122
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,350
eight years ago.

123
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,590
That's right.

124
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,320
After Hua Ruoyu's death,

125
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,750
Mu Huaijin took a break from school.

126
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,680
The medical records show

127
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,800
he underwent psychological treatment
for a while.

128
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,830
Though he was her sister's boyfriend,

129
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,470
he later pursued Mi Chuxia persistently.

130
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,070
And this.

131
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,200
It's Mu Huaijin's

132
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,500
(Mu Huaijin)
travel records for the past three years.

133
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,160
He was in the U.S.

134
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,500
when you were being hunted.

135
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,830
Your suspicion is correct.

136
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,470
Mu Huaijin is highly suspicious.

137
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,350
But these aren't solid proofs.

138
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,700
With these, we can't prove
he's the direct perpetrator

139
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,750
trying to kill me.

140
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,870
We need more evidence.

141
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,950
Pick a movie from the table.

142
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,300
We'll continue watching tonight.

143
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,040
This clay is different

144
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,830
from what you used before.

145
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,990
There's a type of pottery
called bone china

146
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,350
that incorporates animal bone powder.

147
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,750
Some people

148
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,150
mix their beloved pets' ashes into it

149
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,800
