00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,940
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,790
What are you doing?

4
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,550
Didn't you think the mood

5
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,490
was perfect for a kiss?

6
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,110
I thought we were on the same page.

7
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,590
Who said I was thinking like you?

8
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,340
Fine, we're not.

9
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,300
Lucky you.

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,080
Scumbag.

11
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,630
(He's not Tang Jingxing.)

12
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,960
(Why did my heart flutter?)

13
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,310
I don't like strangers at home.

14
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,120
Without my permission,

15
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,190
don't bring anyone back.

16
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,080
Says who?

17
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,910
I can invite whoever I want.

18
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,000
This is my place.

19
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,750
If you won't obey then move out.

20
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,850
(Your account was credited.
Check the app.)

21
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,910
Here's half the rent.

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,310
From now on,

23
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,750
I'm half-owner here too.

24
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,080
I can invite anyone I want.

25
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,100
I won't accept it.

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,670
You have to take it.

27
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,380
I'll just transfer it directly
to your bank account.

28
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,420
If you return it,

29
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,460
I'll transfer it again.

30
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,160
Money shapes home dynamics.

31
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,120
Starting now,

32
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,910
I'm half-owner of this place.

33
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,240
Forcing sales, huh?

34
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,280
So what if I am?

35
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,430
This looks familiar.

36
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,550
Louis seems to have one just like it.

37
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,800
Its selling point is uniqueness.

38
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,710
So,

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,100
it's a high-quality replica.

40
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,100
If you can't buy the same one,

41
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,870
getting a high-quality replica
is impressive.

42
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,000
But I didn't expect

43
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,580
you to actually like Louis.

44
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,360
When I collaborate with him,

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,620
I'll arrange for you to meet.

46
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,990
Thanks a lot.

47
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,360
No need to thank me.

48
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,430
Why so polite?

49
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,870
But you know,

50
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,180
Louis' influence is really strong.

51
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,030
Even someone like you buys his style.

52
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,120
So I'll definitely
overcome all obstacles

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
and collaborate with him.

54
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,800
I'll get his autograph for you.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,240
No need to thank me at all.

56
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,980
(Wanmao Group)

57
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,010
The design is finalized.

58
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,080
Remember to apply for the budget
from headquarters.

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,920
Okay.

60
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,800
Huaijin?

61
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,080
What brings you here?

62
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,630
Weren't you looking for
that influencer, Louis?

63
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,710
Did you find him?

64
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,580
Chuxia, I actually thought of a plan.

65
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,980
Our Garden Venue

66
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,240
is hosting an anniversary celebration.

67
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
I want to hold an industry gala,

68
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,540
inviting brands, celebrities,

69
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,740
as well as influencers.

70
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,780
We could invite Louis too.

71
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,980
His return this time

72
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,860
must mean he wants
to break into the domestic market.

73
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,420
This is a great networking chance.

74
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,100
I think he wouldn't miss it.

75
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,460
But Louis hasn't made any appearances

76
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,380
for so long.

77
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,620
He keeps a low profile.

78
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,140
Even with

79
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,560
such a high-exposure event,

80
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,980
he might not want to come.

81
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,420
But what if it's a masquerade ball,

82
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,300
would he agree then?

83
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,340
A masquerade ball?

84
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,980
That's a great idea!

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,690
While you're at it
help me think of a theme too.

86
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,890
Okay.

87
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,700
I'll send out invites right away.

88
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,620
What's that smell?

89
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,660
Why is it so strong?

90
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,180
Wasabi.

91
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,120
It's a new product

92
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,140
from the cafe next to my place.

93
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,980
Wasabi latte.

94
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,100
Wasabi?

95
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,740
When you came to our company
to discuss collaboration before,

96
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,580
you liked wasabi tea crisp, right?

97
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,980
Don't like wasabi anymore?

98
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,900
You said
it was for company collaboration.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,250
Of course, I had to pretend to like it,
even if I didn't.

100
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,700
So it was just an act?

101
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,700
But wasabi's not bad.

102
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,990
It's refreshing and lowers fat.

103
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,940
You'll grow to like it if you eat more.

104
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,620
I can't handle it.

105
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,260
How does this dress look?

106
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,380
Too revealing.

107
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,700
What exactly do you have to show?

108
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,220
It seems a bit empty, huh?

109
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,300
I'll go change again.

110
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,760
(She looks quite good
dressed like that.)

111
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,580
Sir, may I have this dance?

112
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,460
Your skirt is so short.

113
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,460
Are you afraid

114
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,900
people won't notice your short legs?

115
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,870
Short skirts make legs
look longer, right?

116
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,990
I think it's not suitable.

117
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,480
The skirt doesn't look good?

118
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,500
Not good at all.

119
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,740
Change it.

120
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,940
Then I'll try another one.

121
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,340
(This one looks better.)

122
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,420
This one's okay, I guess.

123
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,940
I'm talking to you.

124
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,780
It's alright.

125
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,300
Well, my back zipper seems stuck.

126
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,330
Can you help me with it?

127
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,300
Did you just blush?

128
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,100
Thinking about me, aren't you?

129
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,660
It's too bad the zipper moved too fast.

130
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,500
Nothing could happen.

131
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,870
Should I help you again?

132
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,500
It's just my clothes reflecting.

133
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,980
I'm heading home tonight
to get something.

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,930
I won't be staying here.

135
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,500
