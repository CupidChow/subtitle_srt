3
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,230
(No way.)

4
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,720
(Not here.)

5
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,400
(Hold it in.)

6
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,880
(Hold it in!)

7
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,150
(Wait until we're outside.)

8
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,150
Chuxia,

9
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,190
what's wrong?

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,040
- You don't look...
- Don't...

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Don't touch me.

12
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,000
She said don't touch her.

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,720
What's it to you?

14
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,790
I'm her uncle.

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,640
Of course, I'll protect my niece.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,070
What's that smell?

17
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:34,990
So stinky.

18
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,630
That was me.

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,960
Sorry.

20
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,870
I... I did it.

21
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,920
(Chuxia, be good.)

22
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,510
(Do it again.)

23
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,400
(You...)

24
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,480
(do it again right now,)

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,230
(or I'll kill you.)

26
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,040
Stop staring at me.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
I really don't have anymore.

28
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,230
Don't follow me.

29
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,320
Do you like Chuxia?

30
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,160
What's it to you?

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,400
Regardless,

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,710
you're her uncle in name.

33
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,950
You should watch your behavior.

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,550
Don't trouble her.

35
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,000
Why do you assume

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,880
she feels troubled by me?

37
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,390
Maybe she's already fallen for me.

38
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,670
The only reason she's close to you now

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,600
is that you look like Tang Jingxing.

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,230
But sooner or later,

41
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,760
I'll make her let go.

42
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,200
We'll see about that.

43
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,030
Peipei,

44
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,080
you sounded urgent on the phone.

45
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,400
- What's wrong?
- Ms. Hua,

46
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,320
this design was clearly our original.

47
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,590
How can they match us

48
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,780
in both the pattern and the ad copy?

49
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,840
(Lively Petals, Stolen Hearts)

50
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,360
I think someone leaked it.

51
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,920
This must be punished seriously.

52
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,320
But they've launched it already.

53
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,190
We can't use this design now.

54
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,880
Inform the factory to stop production,

55
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,740
then check the surveillance footage
for me.

56
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,030
But the announcement for Honey Love II

57
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,230
is already out.

58
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,920
Headquarters wants us
to resolve this within a week.

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,320
There will always be a way.

60
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,230
The priority is to find the leaker.

61
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,230
We can't let him
betray the company again.

62
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,960
Alright, I'll check the footage now.

63
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,880
Let's go.

64
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,490
Ms. Hua,

65
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,500
here's all the surveillance footage
from last week.

66
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,950
I'll get back to work.

67
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay.

68
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,360
There's so much footage.

69
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,400
How can I watch it all?

70
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,670
Don't look at me.

71
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,640
My time is valuable.

72
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,840
I can't waste it here.

73
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,750
Really?

74
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,600
From what I see,
you're either working out

75
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,560
or online.

76
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,680
You seem pretty free to me.

77
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,270
What you see is just the surface.

78
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,320
But

79
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,150
we still haven't found the traitor,

80
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,590
and everyone's a suspect.

81
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,710
You're the only one I can trust now.

82
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,580
Don't try emotional manipulation on me.

83
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,760
It won't work.

84
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,390
Then tell me, what will make you agree?

85
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,720
Satisfied?

86
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,810
I was just thinking.

87
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,300
I didn't expect you to want
to kiss me so badly.

88
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,710
No, I didn't.

89
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,830
I just accidentally

90
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,270
mistook you for Tang Jingxing.

91
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,270
It was an accident, don't dwell on it.

92
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,520
An accident?

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
Is a kiss like a car crash?

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,050
Consider it a compensation.

95
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,110
That's hilarious.

96
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,550
You called it an accident.

97
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,120
You're the one at fault.

98
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,830
Fine, I'm in a good mood.

99
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,900
I'll help you check it out.

Let's do something to wake up.

115

What do you think?

116
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,710
Doesn't it wake you up instantly?

117
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,560
Come on, flick me.

118
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,450
Hua Ruoyi.

119
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,160
I'm suddenly wide awake.

120

(He's Lu Nianbai.)

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,830
(Don't get carried away.)

124
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,670
No, I'm still not clear-headed.

125
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,830
I need to go for a walk.

126
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,380
There's a missing segment here.

127
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,470
The culprit must have deleted it.

128
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,630
What are you thinking?

129
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,280
You've sighed
over a dozen times already.

130
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,950
Ever since I took over Wanmao,

131
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,320
I haven't brought the company
any real profits.

132
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,610
Honey Love isn't selling well either.

133
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,950
Maybe I'm not cut out for business.

134
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,590
Yeah,

135
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,800
maybe you should give up.

136
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,630
If only Tang Jingxing were here.

137
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,240

138
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,160
to pretend I'm him,

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,520

I'm not by your side.

144
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,280
It's tough managing Wanmao alone.

145
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,630
You've done an amazing job.

146
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,990
Without you, Wanmao would've been gone.
