1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,960
   

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,670
   

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,890
   

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,550
   

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,730
   

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,030
   

7
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,110
   

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,940
   

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,810


10
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,040
Help me!

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,000
Help me!

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,060
Mom! Mom...

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,720
Mom! Mom!

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,460
Mom...

15
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,400
Help me...

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,140
Mom! Dad!

17
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,900
Mom! Dad...

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:23,560
 Dad, if Brother and I are both in danger, who are you going to save first? 

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,690
 Obviously, it's you, Eun Gyeol. 

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:33,110
 Because you are the voice that connects our family to the world. 

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,760
 You're an angel. 

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,810
 You're lying. 

23
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,590
 You couldn't even hear me yelling out for help. 

24
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,340
 You wouldn't know even if I died. 

25
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,290
 So this is what it's like not to be able to hear. 

26
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,680
 Feeling like being drowned deep in the sea. 

27
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,420
   

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,550
 Why did you come out? 

29
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,770
Are you guarding me?

30
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,430
 You must've been so scared earlier. 

31
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,510
 I'm sorry. 

32
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,150
You can't even hear.

33
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,820
How did you know I drowned?

34
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,690
 I might not hear you, but I can see you. 

35
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,400
How?

36
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,370
 The Little Mermaid gave her voice to the witch, 

37
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,030
 but she gained two legs instead. 

38
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,100
 I lost my voice, 

39
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,170
 but I begged to God over and over again 

40
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:03,730
 and I got one, two, three. The third eye. 

41
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,850
 It's a mighty eye that can watch and protect you guys anywhere. 

42
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,710
 This scar is the evidence of that. 

43
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,070
 He got that scar for losing his voice. 

44
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,690
Hold on.

45
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,380
Hey, watch out.

46
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,560
 If the accident that gave Dad the scar involved a gun... 

47
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,030
My gosh, my gosh. Hey!

48
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,590
Hey, what are you doing?

49
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,320
Are you crazy? Are you a pervert?

50
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,560
He doesn't have a scar.

51
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,390
What scar?

52
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,300
 The accident Dad mentioned hasn't happened yet. 

53
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,820
What scar am I supposed to have?

54
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,580
 If I prevent that accident, I might be able to change his fate. 

55
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,720
What?

56
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,960
What's with your fiery eyes?

57
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,240
Why are your eyes all fired up?

58
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,320
Listen to me carefully right now.

59
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,070
Be careful from now on.

60
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,490
Don't get distracted by silly things

61
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,370
and just focus on me.

62
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,150
By from now on, how long do you mean?

63
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,420
Just a year.

64
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,910
Geez, you mean you'll leech off me for a year?

65
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,170
What are you trying to pull exactly?

66
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,750
Just for a year.

67
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,660
Don't get out of my sight just for a year.

68
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,020
Don't go far away or disappear.

69
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,380
Stay right next to me.

70
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,820
Excuse me.

71
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,720
Did I tell you I like Choi Se Kyeong?

72
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,710
How many times did I say she's no good?

73
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,390
Am I supposed to get your approval or something?

74
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,600
Please. Listen to me just this once.

75
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,050
You just need to be safe this year.

76
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,810
I'll make sure to protect you.

77
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,280
Please don't.

78
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,510
I'm begging you. You don't have to protect me.

79
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,980
I like women! Okay?

80
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,450
You said Brother and I were gifts from the heavens.

81
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,840
It's an order from the heavens. It's a divine intervention.

82
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,130
So listen to me, please!

83
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,980
- What the hell are you talking about? 
 - Watch out for the cars.

84
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,230
I can take care of myself.

85
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,050
Don't run!

86
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,330
 The accident definitely happened this year. 

87
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,850
 What kind of accident was it? 

88
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,110
 When did it happen? 

89
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,710
 I need to stay by his side until I find out. 

90
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,340
Shut up.

91
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,680
I haven't said anything.

92
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,050
I'm telling you to keep your mouth shut.

93
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,510
Hey...

94
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,150
You'd better not cross this line.

95
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,480
I'll break, cut off, and destroy you if you cross it.

96
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,450
- Let's do it together. 
 - Do what?

97
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,970
Starting a band.

98
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,180
I'll make the best band for you.

99
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,490
I'll make your youth shine like you wanted so badly.

100
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,520
Instead, under one condition.

101
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,880
What is it? What's the condition?

102
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,920
Just for a year. Stay on my radar for just a year.

103
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,910
Grandma. Grandma!

104
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,750
 I'll change his future no matter what. 

105
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,860
 That's the reason why I traveled to the year 1995. 

106
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,750
   

107
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,510
Choi Se Kyeong, you'd better not find another guy.

108
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,420
I'll be joining you next semester.

109
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,450
You'll come out during breaks. Right?

110
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,480
 No, I'll never come back to Korea. 

111
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,920
Se Kyeong, you need to get going now.

112
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,590
Thank you for seeing her off today.

113
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,630
Safe travels, Ma'am. You, too, Se Kyeong.

114
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,100
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

115
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,240
Hey, did you forget the promise you made with Choi Se Kyeong?

116
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,540
The festival is next month.

117
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,450
If we don't form the members by next week, we'll get disbanded.

118
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,720
We're desperate for one more. But you rejected the one who wanted to join?

119
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,350
I didn't reject him. I haven't given him the answer yet.

120
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,250
Gosh, you need to hold onto him.

121
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,400
You have to recruit him no matter what. You said he's an amazing guitarist, too.

122
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,050
His eyes get fired up all the time.

123
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,530
He's like a firebomb. A firebomb.

124
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,300
I love his passion.

125
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,080
It's a firebomb made out of butter instead of paint thinner.

126
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,150
Huh? What?

127
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,370
When I see him, my toes curl up like buttered squid on a grill.

128
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,830
Just accept it. You can just look at him squinting like this.

129
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,690
It's easy for you to say.

130
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,330
They say, "Fight a tiger, but don't even make eye contact with psychos."

131
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,490
You said he promised you the best band.

132
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,600
And you believe that?

133
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,860
That psycho can't create a band.

134
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,540
What? What?

135
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,920
What's going on?

136
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,260
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold on. 
 - What? What? What?

137
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,500
Where are you going? What's going on?

138
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,420
Let me have a sip of your milk.

139
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,820
Wait...

140
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,660
It's my milk.

141
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,740
The great Kang Hyeon Yool is having a battle with some bastard.

142
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,000
- Kang Hyeon Yool? 
 - Yes.

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,800
- With whom? 
 - I don't know. I'm leaving now.

144
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,690
What battle?

145
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,860
Live Popularity Battle on the fourth week of April.

146
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,540
What's he doing there?

147
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,600
A battle of the century to determine the fate of the school band is starting now.

148
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,210
I introduce you to the two geniuses who will steal your hearts.

149
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,170
He can play any music with just the bass.

150
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,310
The indie rock scene in Hongdae wants him.

151
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,220
Gwanggaetone the Great!

152
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,070
The genius bassist, Kang Hyeon Yool.

153
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,890
Let's move on. His vibe is epic, and his face is a genre itself.

154
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,130
The mysterious genius guitarist.

155
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,500
Ha Eun Gyeol.

156
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,040
I'll explain the rules for the battle.

157
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,620
When the person who leads starts playing,

158
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,990
the other one will play following the concept. It's a jam-style battle.

159
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,370
You'll fail if you stop playing.

160
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,550
And it's a success if the collaboration goes well.

161
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,210
It's time to determine the order.

162
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,100
Front or back?

163
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,890
- Front. 
 - Back.

164
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,490
Kang Hyeon Yool will lead.

165
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,130
Let's do it well, kid.

166
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,500
Don't just play hard. Do it well.

167
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,720
You're so cute, like a puppy.

168
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,920
I suppose you aren't old enough to be afraid of the tiger.

169
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,340
I think he'll really get you a band.

170
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,140
How did he bring the best guitarist, Kang Hyeon Yool, here?

171
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,710
Is he the fake Yoon Dong Jin?

172
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,590
 You're not too bad for an imposter. 

173
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,000
 I thought you had left the band. 

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,190
 Well, this is my personal hotel room. 

175
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,520
 You'll become homeless soon. I think it's getting disbanded. 

176
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,050
 By the way, what was that method just now? 

177
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,310
 I've never seen that before. 

178
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,830
 You expect me to just tell you? 

179
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,030
 You're so cute. You know how to say no, too. 

180
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,540
 Gosh, whatever. I can't be bothered. 

181
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,520
 There's a way to learn my method and secure your hotel room. 

182
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,860
 Do you want me to tell you? 

183
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,030
 I guess you know how to talk your way out of trouble. 

184
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,420
 It's kind of intriguing. 

185
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,020
 Tell me how, then. 

186
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,430
 Here. I'm listening. 

187
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,780
 Rejoin the band with the Baegwang band members. That will solve all your problems. 

188
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,530
 Was it Ha Lee Chan or Hachaneun? 
 (Means insignificant) 

189
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,490
 I'm not interested in being in a band with him. 

190
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,340
 What if I replace Yoon Dong Jin? 

191
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,560
 You'll replace who? 

192
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,530
 Yoon Dong Jin. This happened because I'm not him. 

193
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,370
 I'm saying I'll replace him. 

194
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,580
 I can prove myself if you want me to. 

195
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,260
 What a brave puppy. 

196
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,290
 But would you be able to handle my bass? 

197
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,380
 I don't think an imposter could keep up with me. 

198
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,660
 What's this? 

199
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,100
 It means the deal has been made. 

200
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,650
 You can choose the date for the battle. 

201
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,180
   

202
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,380
Wow, seriously.

203
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,160
   

204
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,660
How many times did I say no to you?

205
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,000
You need at least five members

206
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,560
so it gets recognized as a club. You little...

207
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,180
Little...

208
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,510
   

209
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,950
   

210
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,670
Six people?

211
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,970
You'll be finishing this masterpiece by signing it, sir.

212
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,650
♫  I hope this moment lasts forever  ♫

213
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,320
Don't get scared. Look at them intensely.

214
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,670
We can't let them overpower us.

215
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,250
Hey, brothers. You came.

216
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,210
Welcome to our scamming organization.

217
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,700
Goodness, have you eaten, Hyungnim?

218
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,540
Geez, what are we, the offering to Buddha?

219
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,290
You made the bet and want us to jump into the ocean, too?

220
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,230
His name is Lee Shi Gook. His nickname is Manggook. 
 (Means "ruined country")

221
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,970
He looks like he'd play Mahjong in Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong,

222
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,660
but he's a church boy.

223
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,550
 Surprisingly, he was raised Christian since birth. 

224
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,920
 But if his rocker spirit is released... 

225
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,770
Welcome to hell.

226
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,640
 ...he becomes the drummer from hell. 

227
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,160
Wow.

228
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,620
Calm down, Manggook.

229
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,200
He's not Yoon Dong Jin,

230
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,400
but it's true that you brought someone as good.

231
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,840
His name is No Se Beom. His nickname is Suzy.

232
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,100
 He went to Germany to become a classical pianist when he was 13, 

233
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,900
 but he failed and returned. He's an ill-fated genius. 

234
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,190
 The reason why he failed is... 

235
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,970
 his stage fright. 

236
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,500
 Whenever he makes mistakes, gets nervous 

237
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,100
 or scared, the pores on his face release oil instead of sweat. 

238
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,160
 That's why his nickname is dry (subunbujok) and oily (jiseong). In short, Suzy 

239
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,700
A bet is still a bet. I'll accept it.

240
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,090
So you're the brain of Baegwang Band.

241
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,710
Instead,

242
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,630
we'll still be called Baegwang Band.

243
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,880
What are you saying?

244
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,590
We got approved as Fake First Love Memory-Makers.

245
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,440
Change the frontman, then.

246
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,480
- What? 
 - I told you.

247
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,080
We're not a lounge band.

248
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,370
Brain, it's because I'm immature—

249
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,040
You aren't just immature. You're not qualified, either.

250
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,290
I'm not qualified? Why do you think I'm not?

251
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,740
I'm the one who started this band.

252
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,360
Hey, be reasonable. That's not true.

253
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,730
It was 99% his contribution.

254
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,800
You're right. I'd prefer that bastard to be the frontman.

255
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,790
Well, I don't even go to this school—

256
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,110
What will it take to accept me as the frontman?

257
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,730
Tell me. Brain.

258
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,040
Hyeon Yool. Shi Gook.

259
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,820
What can I do to get your approval?

260
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,400
   

261
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:22,800

262

Lee Chan, are you okay? Hey!

272
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,110
Get up. Will you give up on the frontman position?

273
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,440
Damn it.

274
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,280
Audition?

275
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,930
Audition?

276
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,570
Why do I have to audition in front of them? Why?

277
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,430
A promise is still a promise.

278
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,130
So, let's practice one more time.

279
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,780
If I practice...

280
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,840
 A frontman should know how to play at least one instrument. Right? 

281
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,580
Would I be able to do that?

282
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,000
 If you want to be the vocalist, you should be able to sing in three octaves. 

283
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,060
How...

284
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,160
How could I do that in three days?

285
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,120
It'd be faster to be born again.

286
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,850
You'd still be you even if you're born again.

287
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,120
Or I should give birth to a son and bring him somehow.

288
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,370
You'd still share the same DNA.

289
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,550
What if you end up with a son like you?

290
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,060
Gosh, it's cold.

291
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,460
M-My gosh. W-Where did that come from?

292
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,560
Was it you?

293
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,940
What the heck?

294
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,200
Well, I'm sorry.

295
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,510
Hey, what if we audition people and recruit new members instead?

296
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,430
Oh, that's it.

297
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,290
What do you mean, that's it?

298
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,980
Don't forget the festival is next month, please.

299
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,980
- Ma Joo. 
 - Huh?

300
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,070
Don't stop me.

301
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,160
I'll get born again.

302
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,690
Hey, hey, hey!

303
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,150
Hey, hey, hey!

304
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,530
Hey, Ha Lee Chan!

305
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,340
Lee Chan!

306
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,380
No!

307
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,010
I'll teach you.

308
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,100
Teach me what?

309
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,980
Anything. Whatever it is.

310
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,150
I'll teach you everything you need to know.

311
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,490
   

312
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,350
What's this?

313
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,780
Is it my first birthday? Should I grab one of them?

314
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,950
No matter which one you choose, you'll have to do the other, too.

315
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,160
Excuse me.

316
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,800
Would it kill you to explain it the way I can understand it?

317
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,920
Lee Chan,

318
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,690
do you want to be the frontman that much?

319
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,420
You saw that I almost threw up blood at the karaoke. Right?

320
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,460
Why do you think I did?

321
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,300
Okay. Got it. I'll help you, then.

322
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,480
I'll be in a band with you, teach you how to play the guitar, and everything.

323
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,200
Instead, you...

324
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,850
are going to college.

325
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,940
Why are you bringing that up suddenly?

326
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,660
I told you. I'll make money as soon as I graduate—

327
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,800
It's Grandmother's dream.

328
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,480
 What's this? 

329
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,650
 There's a tiny bit in there. 

330
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,140
 No, Grandmother. I'm just thankful you provide food and lodging. 

331
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,810
 It's a tiny bit, I said. 

332
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,260
 This isn't for the lessons. It's just spending money. 

333
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:13,130
 No, no, no. Think of it as a donation and take it. 

334
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,150
 Lee Chan is my dream. 

335
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,750
 And I'm donating this for my dream. 

336
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,500
 Because there was a bit of a situation at home, 

337
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,300
 Lee Chan grew up without his parents' love since he was a kid. 

338
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,090
 He used to get pretty good grades, but because of me, 

339
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,920
 I guess he thought an old lady was suffering. 

340
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,810
 So he's been saying he'll make money instead of studying. 

341
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,240
 He keeps saying that's what he's good at. 

342
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,970
 He thinks he's doing filial duty that way. 

343
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,670
 Running a boarding house for decades, 

344
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,260
 I've been doing laundry and making food for college students. 

345
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,780
 There isn't a college graduation cap I didn't wear at graduations. 

346
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,340
 But actually... 

347
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,980
 I don't hope for much. 

348
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,490
 I just want to see my grandson wearing a college graduation cap. 

349
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,180
 That's one thing I want to see. 

350
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,630
 Would that be possible? 

351
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:32,700
Will the colleges even accept me if I try?

352
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,880
I'll tutor you.

353
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,340
You can do it if you try starting now.

354
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,180
Why? You don't want to?

355
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,390
You can at least give it a try.

356
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,690
I've been curious for a while.

357
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,640
Why are you being so nice to me, anyway?

358
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,630
- Huh? 
 - Just think about it.

359
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,600
You showed up and helped me when I almost humiliated myself in front of Se Kyeong.

360
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,970
You saved my life.

361
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,270
You're saying you'll create a band for me.

362
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,950
And you're saying you'll tutor me and teach me guitar, too.

363
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,400
Are you worried you'd get kicked out of the boarding house?

364
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,820
- No. 
 - If not, do you want to sell me something?

365
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,810
You saved my life several times in my previous life.

366
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,530
I did?

367
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,810
I mean it.

368
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,590
 In the fire, 

369
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,850
in the water,

370
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,410
and...

371
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,630
Open the book.

372
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:02,800
Right now? Just like that?

373
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,180
This is our Day 1. Okay?

374
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,750
No, no. Please, please. Grandma!

375
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,500
Grandma, help me! Damn it!

376
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,460
Look at the book.

377
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,540
- You're hitting me again! 
 - I like a girl. I like...

378
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,450
Hey, what are you guys doing there?

379
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:44,570
I have a dream that one day this na—

380
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,060
- Nation. 
 - ...nation...

381
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,700
will rise up and live out... live out...

382
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,680
Why is "that" in there, by the way?

383
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,860
Haven't you learned about relative pronouns yet?

384
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,170
What do you mean, relative?

385
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,020
Why are you crying about something like this?

386
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,140
It's not like Chan got accepted at Seoul National University.

387
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,030
Chan will easily become a judge or a prosecutor.

388
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,490
I said he'd become successful.

389
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,630
 Hi, I'm in New York. 

390
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,890
 Did you miss me a little bit? 

391
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,970
 I was sad you didn't come to the airport, 

392
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,660
 but I'll forgive you since I'm nice. 

393
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,290
 I'll write a longer letter once I finish unpacking. 

394
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,570
 I'll just let you know I'm alive today. 

395
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,040
 I included my address. Write me sometimes. 

396
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,980
 Se Kyeong. 

397
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,490
 P.S. Everyone must've found out I left to study abroad. 

398
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,180
 It's so obvious. 

399
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,880
 They're happy they have one fewer competitor. Right? 

400
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,220
 Is anyone actually sad that I left? 

401
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:13,240
   

402
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,320
   

403
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,570
   

404
00:29:54,270 --> 00:30:00,770
♫  Tell me about loneliness  ♫

405
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:08,490
♫  This must be a feeling like a wind blowing  ♫

406
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,300
♫  I'll tell you about sadness  ♫

407
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,250
 The left hand... 

408
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,200
 only supports. 

409
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:25,350
♫  That must be a feeling like a sleeve that's getting wet in the rain  ♫

410
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:33,190
♫  In front of the days I let go  ♫

411
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:40,770
♫  I'm stopping right now  ♫

412
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,690
♫  Which way should I go?  ♫

413
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,690
♫  I'm actually afraid  ♫

414
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:56,420
♫  If only I had you to hold my hand warmly  ♫

415
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,460
Aren't you going to go in and out through that door today?

416
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,130
I'm sorry about last time.

417
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,630
I came to buy a book today.

418
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,040
Oh Ma Joo.

419
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,430
I was going to stop by the boarding house. Where are you coming from?

420
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,630
I'm buying Lee Chan's workbook. How about you?

421
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,710
I have a festival committee meeting at the burger shop.

422
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,800
After a lot of lobbying and staring contests,

423
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,200
I got us to perform the closing performance.

424
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,820
Wow! Are we ending the festival, then?

425
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,790
Of course.

426
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,810
Don't you think things will go really well somehow?

427
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,870
Wow. Amazing.

428
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,040
- Hey! Hey! Did you hear the rumor? 
 - What rumor?

429
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,010
A new member of the Baegwang Band that showed up like a comet.

430
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,480
It's the new guitarist Ha Lee Chan recruited.

431
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,080
He's apparently amazing.

432
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,640
Gosh, I heard that, too.

433
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,440
There was a battle to decide the band's future

434
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,020
and he turned the school upside down with his performance.

435
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,790
He's a good guitarist, all right,

436
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,420
and he's really handsome.

437
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,070
Really? Should we go to the festival and see him?

438
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,010
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

439
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,750
Ha Lee Chan struck gold.

440
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,740
He saved his band thanks to the new member.

441
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,360
So what? Choi Se Kyeong left to study abroad.

442
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,110
The "goddess" won't even see his performance. He's wasting his time.

443
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,240
You're right.

444
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,210
   

445
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,510
He'd be shocked if he found out she left to study abroad. ight?

446
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,310
Isn't it obvious?

447
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,570
He'd become such a mess.

448
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,760
- What about the band, then? 
 - Of course, he'd quit.

449
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,040
He started the band for her, anyway.

450
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,670
He finally formed a band.

451
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,250
I managed to get us to do the closing performance.

452
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,440
He finally set his mind to study, too.

453
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,690
If I back out, the chairman of the festival committee will try to kill me.

454
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:11,390
But do we really have to rain on Lee Chan's parade?

455
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,700
No.

456
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,750
- Let's keep it a secret. 
 - Let's keep it a secret.

457
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,340
Geez. Knock, at least.

458
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,030
Can't you tell I'm studying?

459
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,920
Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

460
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,850
- Ma Joo. 
 - Huh?

461
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,850
- What are you doing here? 
 - I...

462
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,240
came to eat Grandmother's signature spicy mixed noodles.

463
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,880
Why do you always ask her to make it?

464
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,400
Grandmother, don't make him the noodles.

465
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,330
No, Ma'ma. I'll have the extra large one.

466
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,010
Extra large...

467
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,560
Here.

468
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,850
I did the homework you gave me.

469
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,450
Wow, you really finished it.

470
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,630
Reward me like you promised.

471
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,160
Good job.

472
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,480
- What? 
 - You said you wanted to be rewarded.

473
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,670
It's a special compliment.

474
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,960
What am I, a dog?

475
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,880
I finished the homework as promised.

476
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,040
Teach me how to play the guitar now.

477
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,160
 Come out and eat the noodles. 

478
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,020
Noodles.

479
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,980
Noodles. I want the banquet noodles.

480
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,720
   

481
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,620
I made a lot so eat as much as you want.

482
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,950
 Okay. 

483
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,370
Help yourself, sir.

484
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:50,630
It must be tiring teaching a dumb student.

485
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,310
Your grandson is right here.

486
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,240
 I'm her great-grandson. Okay? 

487
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,670
Here you go.

488
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,320
I'll have a little more, Ma'am.

489
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,140
Hey, Chan.

490
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:11,170
Is Choi Se Kyeong really coming to the festival?

491
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,270
Of course. She'll come if I prepare properly.

492
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,310
Is that so?

493
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,990
I should bring all of my classmates, then.

494
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,630
I heard she's really pretty.

495
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,810
 Hey, I want to come. I want to come. I want to come. 

496
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,890
Hearing her name makes me miss her like crazy.

497
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,550
Should I go and take a peek at her?

498
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,080
- No! 
 - No!

499
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,350
Geez, so gross. What's wrong with you?

500
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,880
Are you making noodles with your mouth? What a waste.

501
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,190
You promised you won't see her before the festival.

502
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,980
A man's word is his bond. Don't you know?

503
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,990
Yes. You have to play hard to get in relationships.

504
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,720
You have to show up as the dark horse so she thinks differently of you.

505
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,440
Dark horse?

506
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,960
He's probably right, don't you think?

507
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,830
Well, I-I suppose so.

508
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,650
- Of course. 
 - Of course.

509
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,550
You can do it, Lee Chan.

510
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,150
Just wait until the festival.

511
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,870
- Eat some. 
 - No, I can't.

512
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,890
 I'm sorry, Dad. 

513
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,940
 Ahjumma left to study abroad. 

514
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,180
 And... 

515
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,830
 I went to study abroad in 11th grade and lived in the States since. 

516
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,060
 Until I heard he passed away. 

517
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,890
 She won't come back. 

518
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,000
   

519
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,050
   

520
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,410
Thank you. I forgot and left the key in the US.

521
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:20,690
For some reason, I didn't feel like closing today.

522
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:26,030
You left a few days ago. How come you're back already?

523
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:31,180
I came back briefly because of an emergency.

524
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,880
I'm sorry, Mom.

525
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:56,650
I can no longer live as the daughter you want.

526
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,900
I'm sorry.

527
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,690
I'm so sorry.

528
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,260
To be honest...

529
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,480
I'm not sorry at all.

530
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,210
How ominous.

531
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,990
That was an ominous dream.

532
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,120
Why are you still up?

533
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,910
I need to practice for the frontman audition tomorrow, obviously.

534
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,520
You can't just learn an instrument at the last minute.

535
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,900
It might be better to practice singing—

536
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,140
I should still do what I can do. I promised.

537
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,560
Geez, I'm trying to do what you taught me. Why isn't it working?

538
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,090
It sounds weird for some reason.

539
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,890
Give me that.

540
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,990
Gosh, it's so frustrating.

541
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,890
Did the wood absorb moisture because I didn't care for it for a while?

542
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,130
Wow.

543
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,050
How can I play like you?

544
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,310
You just need to learn how to talk to it.

545
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,010
How to talk to it?

546
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,690
Watch me.

547
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,410
If you speak to it truthfully,

548
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,590
it will answer truthfully.

549
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,600
And if you speak to it tenderly,

550
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,250
it will respond tenderly.

551
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,520
If I get angry,

552
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,530
the guitar gets angry with me, too.

553
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,090
If I get excited,

554
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,570
the guitar gets excited, too.

555
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,010
Wow, that's so crazy.

556
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,950
Wow, it's amazing.

557
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,830
You talk to it with your hand and hear back with tunes.

558
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:54,360
It's similar to sign language in a way...

559
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,370
What about sign language?

560
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,570
It's similar to sign language.

561
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,350
Wow, that's a great analogy.

562
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,720
Wow.

563
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,480
Techniques aren't important.

564
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,010
Sincerity is what matters.

565
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,820
If your emotions and sincerity reach the audience,

566
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,340
there's no better music than that.

567
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,900
Yes, sir.

568
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,920
   

569
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,800
Grandmother, can we have more omelets?

570
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,530
Here you go.

571
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,650
Thank you.

572
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,470
What's this now?

573
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:28,650
You're acting like you're related.

574
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,880
Come to the ice cream shop when I get out of school.

575
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,470
Why would I go there?

576
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,740
You asked me to get you a part-time job.

577
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,340
Did you find it already?

578
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,360
I'll tell the manager. Just show up on time.

579
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,280
Okay. Good luck with the audition.

580
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,700
It means I love you.

581
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,810
Yes, that's right.

582
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,210
Together. Bounce.

583
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,480
Bounce, good!

584
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,290
- Pull it. Pull it. 
 - Push it.

585
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,740
Your pants fit so perfectly.

586
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,130
He's crazy, huh?

587
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,840
Choi Se Kyeong left to study abroad. How could he not be?

588
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,570
She left without a word.

589
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:31,340
He must've gone crazy already. Don't you think?

590
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,860
Let's do it one more time.

591
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,010
Okay.

592
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,800
Bounce. Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

593
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,960
What did you just say?

594
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,890
Who...

595
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,400
went where?

596
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:31,750
♫  It's a new beginning, I breathe out  ♫

597
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:37,000
♫  A moment I've been waiting for  ♫

598
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:43,000
♫  Erase the times that have already passed  ♫

599
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,690
♫  We're here on this shining stage together  ♫

600
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,500
♫  Don't look back, you won't have any regrets  ♫

601
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,010
♫  No need to hesitate  ♫

602
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:57,790
♫  This chance won't come again  ♫

603
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,250
♫  So let's begin  ♫

604
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:03,890
♫  The days that shone so bright  ♫

605
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:07,550
♫  All our full dreams (shining, shining) just like now  ♫

606
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:11,750
♫  Don't stop here like this, right now  ♫

607
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,210
♫  Run without looking back  ♫

608
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:20,620
♫  So you can dream again, higher, higher, fly higher  ♫

609
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:24,680
♫  I hope this moment lasts forever  ♫

610
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:30,280
   

611
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,220
   

612
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,310
Me?

613
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,840
Me?

614
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,720
You were looking at the guitars. Right?

615
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,430
Which kind? Acoustic or electric?

616
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:29,590
Or classic?

617
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:30,920
Acoustic.

618
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,210
What kind?

619
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:35,710
I want a dreadnought body with a low saddle.

620
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,170
And I want one with pickups, too.

621
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,490
There's a nice one.

622
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,380
I'll bring it over. Just wait a second.

623
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,210
Wait, sir.

624
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,290
Can I just browse today?

625
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,800
I started a part-time job today.

626
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,240
I'll make sure to buy it next time.

627
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,460
Okay, then.

628
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,780
It's for you. Right?

629
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,250
No, I want to buy one for my dad.

630
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,070
We're practicing in a band together.

631
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:06,470
Wow, your dad sounds so cool. He's in a band with his son.

632
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:09,580
Look around, then.

633
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,190
Okay.

634
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,180
Choi Se Kyeong?

635
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,790
 - Oh, this! 
 - Crazy. 

636
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,640
 Classic, huh? 

637
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,680
 You don't like this, either? 

638
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,630
 - How about this? 
  - 5,000 won. It suits you perfectly. 

639
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,710
 1,000 won? Should I get it if it's 1,000 won? 

640
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:36,370
The shoes finally met their owner. Enjoy.

641
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:37,940
They're definitely authentic, right?

642
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:41,180
Of course. If you don't believe me, take it to the luxury goods shop and ask for service.

643
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,430
They're just so cheap. I hope you sell a lot.

644
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,740
Yes, have a nice day.

645
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:49,100
Wow. Not too bad.

646
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,840
Let's see.

647
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,160
Choi Se Kyeong?

648
00:47:58,110 --> 00:47:59,460
You're Choi Se Kyeong, aren't you?

649
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,230
No, I'm not.

650
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,730
You're Choi Se Kyeong. Don't you know who I am?

651
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,590
Geez. Am I supposed to know?

652
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,770
I don't care if you don't know who I am.

653
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,050
But I need to know what you're doing here.

654
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,890
Can't you tell? I'm selling stuff. It's a flea market.

655
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,910
That's not what I'm asking.

656
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:20,120
You left to study abroad without a word.

657
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,450
You weren't supposed to come back.

658
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,050
But you did. You're here.

659
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:24,980
What's going on right now?

660
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:29,240
Who told you that? That I'm not supposed to come back?

661
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,980
- Huh? 
 - Is there a reason I shouldn't come back?

662
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,810
No.

663
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,270
Do you work out?

664
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,870
Work out? Why do you ask?

665
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,390
How fast can you run 100 meters?

666
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:47,820
When people say that line in dramas, you usually have to run.

667
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,690
Bingo.

668
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:57,120
You think I'll run?

669
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,520
You probably have to.

670
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,990
You want to know why I'm in Korea.

671
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,690
Bring all of my stuff and meet me at the park cafe in 30 minutes.

672
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,830
- Fighting. 
 - Hey.

673
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:09,770
Geez.

674
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:12,740
Hey, what am I supposed to do?

675
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:15,830
 Evacuate right now. 

676
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,010
Ha Lee Chan must be so anxious right now.

677
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:22,790
You never know. There might be a miracle.

678
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:24,540
Don't sound so amateur.

679
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,510
How can a miracle happen in three days?

680
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:29,460
Why are we bothering with an audition, then?

681
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,650
It gives us a reason. A reason to purge him.

682
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:35,310
It gives us a reason to fire him and recruit the new frontman.

683
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:39,180
Gosh, you're seriously so clever.

684
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:45,560
- Where's that coming from? 
 - Who's singing so well?

685
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,740
- It's the band practice room. 
 - It's the band practice room.

686
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,300
Let's go.

688

698
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,650
Hey!

699
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:34,850
Thank you. You didn't leave anything behind. Right?

700
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,670
Tell me why you're in Korea.

701
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,650
The reason why I came back to Korea is...

702
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,470
because I was on a flight to Korea.

703
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:50,210
- Hey! 
 - Happy? I'm off.

704
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,720
I never liked you, but you're really the worst.

705
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,700
Don't you feel guilty toward Ha Lee Chan at all?

706
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,500
He formed a band for you, and he's practicing day and night, singing his heart out.

707
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,790
How could you leave without a word?

708
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,820
Is it fun to make a fool out of someone?

709
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,080
Is your life easier now?

710
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,900
You're right.

711
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,190
I did a bad thing.

712
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,460
Let's go. I'll treat you to a refreshing drink.

713
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:20,640
Damn it!

714
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,390
You shouldn't have given him the illusion of hope by betting.

715
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,330
If you were leaving to study abroad, you should've told him and made him give up.

716
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:30,190
He's an easy target, but you should have basic manners. Don't you think?

717
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,480
You're right.

718
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,810
Geez, what a terrible person.

719
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:35,500
I'm...

720
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,100
- talking about you right now. 
 - I know.

721
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,710
Listening to you makes me feel guilty.

722
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,910
I'd better see Lee Chan and apologize in person—

723
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:47,310
No.

724
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:50,030
Don't ever show up in front of Lee Chan.

725
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,930
Something's up, huh?

726
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,630
What are you talking about?

727
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,430
The reason I shouldn't have come back.

728
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,140
The reason I shouldn't see Lee Chan.

729
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,820
Whatever. It's your turn now. You promised.

730
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,870
Tell me. Why did you come back to Korea?

731
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:06,810
Would you be able to handle the truth?

732
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:11,280
It's too unrealistic that you'd find it hard to believe.

733
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,100
It can't be as bad as mine.

734
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,620
I can handle it. Tell me.

735
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,570
I came to die.

736
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,450
I went to the US and learned my dad had another woman.

737
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,980
My mom is about to go off like a ticking time bomb.

738
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,280
I'm sure she'll start drinking again.

739
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,610
And she'll obsess over me even more.

740
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:31,400
And I'll have to live as her doll again.

741
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,420
That's why I ran away.

742
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,190
To die.

743
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,910
To end everything.

744
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:39,950
- Well... 
 - But...

745
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,960
I ran into a variable.

746
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,020
It's a very interesting one.

747
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,940
I'm still considering if I should live or not.

748
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:52,890
So you'd better not tell anyone that you saw me.

749
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,110
Unless you want to die.

750
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:12,240
I'm sorry.

751
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:20,310
I'm here.

752
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:25,660
Goodness, you've been so upbeat lately. Why are you so down now?

753
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,910
Don't you make fake first-love memories for girls anymore?

754
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,610
The girl I wanted to make fake memories for left.

755
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:34,310
Right, the girl. The girl. The girl.

756
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:39,340
The girl who left just now is the one who gave you the ticket.

757
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,990
Didn't you see her? You wanted to know who it was.

758
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,240
Hey...

759
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,640
Geez, I don't know her name.

760
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,200
Hey! Seowon Arts High School's storage room!

761
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,940
Hey!

762
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,840
You remember me, right?

763
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:09,750
This.

764
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:13,220
Did you give this to me?

765
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:23,860
You wrote this, too?

766
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,350
Why?

767
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:35,600
I'm asking you why you wrote a fake letter to screw me over?

768
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,500
Do you think I'm a joke?

769
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,420
Did you find me pathetic for pursuing the goddess of Seowon Arts High School

770
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,160
when I'm just a commoner?

771
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,070
Is that why you made fun of me?

772
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:46,890
Is that why you screwed me over?

773
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,720
If so, congratulations.

774
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,050
It was a huge success.

775
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,910
Thanks to you,

776
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:56,270
Se Kyeong thinks I'm a total loser.

777
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,340
Are you happy now?

778
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,480
Answer me.

779
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,380
You should answer when someone's talking to you.

780
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,110
Are you happy now?

781
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,680
Hey, be careful. There's a car behind you.

782
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,720
Hey, be careful. There's a car behind you!

783
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:28,500
Are you crazy?

784
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,080
You should move when there's a car behind you.

785
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,780
Are your ears just accessories?

786
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,520
Are you deaf? Are you?

787
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,730
Hey.

788
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,130
How rude.

789
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,970
Did you miss her?

790
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:56,910
No, I saw her.

791
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:58,300
But I shouldn't have.

792
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,700
I might as well not have seen her.

793
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,050
Why?

794
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,990
She won't answer when I ask her a question.

795
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:05,380
She never thanks me for helping her.

796
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,580
And she always ignores me.

797
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,960
How could she be so rude?

798
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,000
Lee Chan, didn't you know?

799
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,400
Know what?

800
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,730
She can't hear.

801
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,090
 Are your ears just accessories? 

802
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,940
 Are you deaf? Are you? 

803
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:13,940
Sir, I'll step out for a second.

804
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,020
 How strange. 

805
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,250
 She definitely said she hadn't come back to Korea until 

806
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,520
 she heard about her grandfather's passing. 

807
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,130
 I came to die. 

808
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:52,100
 - Well... 
 - But... 

809
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,780
 I ran into a variable. 

810
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,270
 What's going on? 

811
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:58,040
 What is it? 

812
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,230
 It doesn't matter. I just need to prevent Dad's accident. 

813
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:05,070
 How did you and Mom first meet? 

814
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:12,570
 At a sign language class at the Association of the Deaf when I was 20. 

815
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:17,250
 I went to learn sign language and fell in love with her at first sight. 

816
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:19,870
 What about her made you fall for her? 

817
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:21,100
 Her face? 

818
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,700
 She was pretty, but it was her voice. 

819
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:27,130
 Her voice? 

820
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:30,580
 She looked so pretty doing sign language. 

821
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,730
 That's her voice, you know. 

822
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:37,230
 Hold on. 

823
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,550
 Dad learned sign language 

824
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:42,530
 because he lost hearing from an accident. 

825
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:46,030
 If I prevent the accident, he won't go to the sign language class 

826
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:49,290
 and he won't meet her there, either. 

827
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,680
 Then Brother and I won't be born... 

828
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:56,480
 This is no good. I need to find Mom and make them meet before that. 

829
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:10,070
Take this. You'll catch a cold.

830
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:33,190
   

831
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:58,650
 F

832
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:10,720
♫  I'm alone on top of the clock's hand that stopped  ♫

833
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,830
 I came too late. 

834
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,240
 I came too late. 

835
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,490
Se Kyeong.

836
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:23,060
Hi. Long time no see, Lee Chan.

837
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,150
 Se Kyeong came back. 

838
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:34,560
♫  It's happening in front of me right now  ♫

839
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,530
   

840
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:54,610
♫  Even if I look more tired than usual  ♫

841
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,580
♫  I'll be fine  ♫

842
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:03,080
♫  My tomorrow will shine even brighter  ♫

843
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:09,930
♫  Wait for me and keep an eye on me  ♫

844
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:14,640
   

845
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,970
 If I didn't lend Se Kyeong that T-shirt, 

846
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:20,260
 would I be standing in front of you now? 

847
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:21,500
 Lee Chan, hi. 

848
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,920
 Are you really the Choi Se Kyeong I know? 

849
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,070
 How could you change the song over what she said? 

850
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:26,950
 I'll do anything Se Kyeong wants. 

851
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:28,370
 Is this band a joke to you? 

852
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,800
 Fine. I'll leave, then. 

853
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,250
 Don't do anything you'll regret. 

854
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,080
 I won't take you back if you leave like this. 

855
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,620
 Did you figure out why you ended up here, sir? 

856
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,930
 I don't care why. Everything is such a mess. 

857
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:39,380
 Nothing is going the way it should. 

858
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:45,150
 Everything started changing the moment you arrived here.
