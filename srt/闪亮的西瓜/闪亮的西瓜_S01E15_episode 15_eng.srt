1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,220
   

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,230
   

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,020
   

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,660
   

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,520
   

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,270
   

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,000
   

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,320
   

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,020
Guys, let me play with you!

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,150
 Hi. 

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,100
   

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,020
 Today was the 40th Memorial Day on the 50th anniversary of the National Liberation. 

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,230
    
 Goodness, you are like cucumbers soaked in alcohol.

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,870
Wow, dried pollack soup! You're the best, Grandmother.

15
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,200
You should be sober on some holidays.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,270
You drink all night whenever it's a holiday.

17
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,270
Your parents are working hard in your hometowns, trying to educate you.

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,250
Grandmother! Give me food, too!

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,490
What are you doing skipping meals?

20
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,690
Are you hungover, too?

21
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,730
I didn't eat so I could eat your food.

22
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,810
- Where's Lee Chan, by the way? 
 - Gosh, I don't know.

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,080
He's been lazying around stuck in that room playing the guitar since yesterday.

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,540
Hey, Lee Chan! Don't make me set the table twice. Come out and scarf this down, you bastard.

25
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:43,610


26
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,780
What are you doing? Recording a message for your pager?

27
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,300
Did you look into what I asked about? What did he say?

28
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,390
Is he really the genius guitarist of his generation?

29
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,400
Yes. Hyeon Yool wasn't lying.

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,580
Apparently, everyone who's played the guitar used to mimic him.

31
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,280
- Let's go. 
 - Where?

32
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,470
To meet him.

33
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,330
What for?

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,500
To let him hear our original song.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,380
W-What original song all of a sudden?

36
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,760
Because we need one to enter the Nationwide Youth Band Competition.

37
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,600
Hey, are you crazy?

38
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,150
Don't you remember we almost got suspended for fighting with

39
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,640
the Jindo Dog Gang on the rehearsal day?

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,580
- How could I've forgotten? 
 - And you want to do what now?

41
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,130
Nationwide what? Band what?

42
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,820
Your grandma still has bruises on her knees for kneeling down in front of the dean that day.

43
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,990
That's why we should clear our names.

44
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,650
If we give up on the band now,

45
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,720
I'll just be a punk who created a band to impress a girl and ended up getting into a fight.

46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,160
Lee Chan, just give up now. Please?

47
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,980
Our band got disbanded. Don't you remember?

48
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,220
Fake First Love Memory-Makers will start the rehearsal now.

49
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,900
    
 One, two, one, two...

50
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,950
Hey, kick him! Kick him!

51
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,860
 Hyeon Yool got hit by the stage equipment that day and hospitalized for 12 weeks. 

52
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,530
It was shitty that we met.

53
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,630
Let's never see each other again.

54
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,480
 Dong Jin spat on the ground and quit. 

55
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,860
 Shi Gook got dragged to a prayer retreat and always has bruises on his back. 

56
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,680
 And Se Beom was forced to study abroad. 

57
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,730
There isn't a single member left anymore.

58
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,110
That's why we should meet him and ask for help.

59
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,530
We'll get his advice on music, get recommendations for members,

60
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,690
and start a band again.

61
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,740
Wow, you're so unbelievable. What do I do with you?

62
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,950
Gosh, my father sent "8282." I need to go. 
  (Code for "Hurry" and sounds like the Korean word) 

63
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,970
Hey. Hey!

64
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,050
I'm sorry. I need to behave myself because of that incident.

65
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,390
Go on your own. I'm sorry.

66
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,650
That jerk.

67
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,450
What a disloyal bastard.

68
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,710
   

69
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,630
   

70
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,390
   

71
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,700
Hello, I'm Ha Lee Chan, an 11th grader at Baegwang High.

72
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,840
You remember me, right? I'm Hyeon Yool's friend.

73
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,060
You treated us to barbecue once.

74
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,740
Of course, I remember. But I'm sorry.

75
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,680
I was just leaving because something suddenly came up.

76
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,330
Pardon?

77
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,140
You promised me first.

78
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,670
Anyway, I'm sorry. I'll take a rain check.

79
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,570
I just need 30 minutes.

80
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,600
It's a very short song because it's unfinished.

81
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,110
Next time. I'll make sure to listen to it with you next time.

82
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,110
Just 20 minutes. 10 minutes. I mean, five minutes.

83
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,960
Three minutes and 30 seconds. Please, I beg you.

84
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,540
Everyone has their own situation.

85
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,630
You can't just insist on it like this.

86
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,800
I understand.

87
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,220
Take care, then.

88
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,910
 Small coincidences sometimes create a miracle 

89
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,550
 and sometimes an unbelievable tragedy. 

90
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:10,010
 If he listened to his song for just five minutes that day... 

91
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,610
- Shit. 
 - I'm sorry, Hyung.

92
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,600
Hey, handsome puppy.

93
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,270
Look over there. Have a look.

94
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,300
There are a lot of cars here.

95
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,850
It's dangerous to play with stuff like this.

96
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,710
Where's your mom? Where's she?

97
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,950
Over there.

98
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,460
Sir, could I have this for free?

99
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,940
I said you can't.

100
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,420
Gosh, you'll be fine.

101
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,040
- I said I won't have enough left. 
  - If only... 

102
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,190
- Do you want to see something cool? 
 - Yes.

103
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,380
 If he didn't run into that kid that day... 

104
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,120
You can come out now.

105
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,510
 If only he didn't have a secret visitor that day... 

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,670
- Do you want this? 
 - Yes. I'll take 200 worth.

107
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,260
Okay. Father! The 3 cm checkered one. Spandex blend.

108
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,810
 If only a friend accompanied him that day... 

109
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,500
I'll teach you how to catch big fish today.

110
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,750
- Huh? Hey. Are you driving? 
 - Go!

111
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,580
 If only it wasn't a holiday that day... 

112
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,570
Wow, wow.

113
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,780
Do you want to see the swing this time?

114
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,280
 If only... 

115
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,810
 one of these minor coincidences... 

116
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,600
- Thank you. 
 - Hello.

117
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,130
Oh, yes. Hold on.

118
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,260
Take this, please.

119
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,640
- No, but I appreciate it. 
 - I feel too bad.

120
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,950
I'm actually allergic to melon.

121
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,200
 ...had missed him... 

122
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,360
Hold on!

123
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:10,060
 If only it were like that, would he be living a completely different life now? 

124
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,480
Is this a novel?

125
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,910
   

126
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,830
Is this a novel?

127
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,900
 Why ask? Do you think it's interesting? 

128
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,230
Well... the incident is too weak.

129
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,000
But why suddenly write a novel?

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,610
By chance, are you quitting taekwondo?

131
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,790
 No. I want to show it to my younger brother. 

132
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,950
Your younger brother? You want to show it to him?

133
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,870
 If only I wasn't caught by you, he would've been my first reader. 

134
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,860
When will you show it to him?

135
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,080
I don't understand what you're saying.

136
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,490
 Once I finish it. 

137
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,380
Oh. So, what happens to the protagonist?

138
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,720
 He became my dad. 

139
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,120
 It's not a novel. It's a true story. 

140
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,440
I heard it from Eun Ho once.

141
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,890
The date he gets into the accident is—

142
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,910
Hey. The teenage boy and girl over there.

143
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,000
Are you on a date and skipping school?

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,530
Lee Chan, coming back from school?

145
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,540
Hello. Yes, I am.

146
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,840
It wasn't a day before the festival.

147
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,590
The accident...

148
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,970
hasn't happened yet.

149
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,000
- I'll get going now. 
 - Take care.

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,650
Bye.

151
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,670
What are you guys doing...

152
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,270
Hey, I'm talking to you!

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,830
They can't stop doing that, can they?

154
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,120
Are you okay?

155
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,110
When is it, then...

156
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,180
When does the accident happen?

157
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,920
   

158
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,630
It's tomorrow.

159
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,330
How impressive. How very impressive.

160
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,930
You brighten up no matter what you wear.

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,580
What are you two doing?

162
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,110
Hey, you came.

163
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,770
I went shopping with Cheong Ah.

164
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,640
Why did you buy so much? You don't know how long she'll be staying here.

165
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,360
You need a lot of stuff to wear, eat, and sleep.

166
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,280
She needs to feel comfortable even if she's staying for a day.

167
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,970
You'll go to the district office to add her to the family registry at this rate.

168
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,840
It's fun. It's so fun.

169
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,120
Seeing a pretty girl after only seeing boys

170
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,780
is fun, like playing princess.

171
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,880
Have you ever tried playing with a prince?

172
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,770
You've been living with a handsome prince for 18 years.

173
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:45,620
Hey. I'll wash this later and make you a blanket.

174
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,890
Sleep comfortably with it. Okay?

175
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,760
So frustrating. It'd be amazing if we could talk.

176
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,840
- Grandma! 
 - Gosh!

177
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,780
My heart almost popped out of my throat, you bastard.

178
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,520
Wait there.

179
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,770
Gosh...

180
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,850
♫  The lights are turning on  ♫

181
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:28,500
♫  Someone's day is ending as usual as the afternoon is passing by  ♫

182
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,470
   

183
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,220
♫  I'm going somewhere  ♫

184
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:41,000
♫  I'm breathing out in the dark air at night  ♫

185
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,800
   

186
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,780
♫  My heart and the moon collide  ♫

187
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,750
I made this. I did.

188
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:53,340
♫  I wonder if there was a night like that in the days past  ♫

189
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,380
    
 ♫  You loved me without saying anything  ♫

190
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,580
♫  Would you have comforted me down the road?  ♫

191
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:10,180
♫  I can't love myself  ♫

192
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,160
♫  I cannot love myself anymore  ♫

193
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,800
♫  The space is expanding  ♫

194
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,640
♫  In the gap that's getting bigger  ♫

195
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:30,600
♫  Today, as always, you and I are living like that above each sky  ♫

196
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,500
♫  I try to picture you in it  ♫

197
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,140
 It was a novel. 

198
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,530
It's a story Brother created.

199
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,840
It's not a novel. He said it was a true story.

200
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,010
He likes to joke around.

201
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,290
You think he joked about his parents' tragedy?

202
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,680
He's always been kind of quirky.

203
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,730
Ha Eun Gyeol.

204
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,530
There's no way I don't know something he knows.

205
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,320
Dad couldn't have told him only.

206
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,110
He didn't hear from him.

207
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,240
He just found out by chance.

208
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,410
 What kind of excuse is that? 

209
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,530
    
 The lift fell?

210
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,820
It's not just a countryside farmers market. It's a multi-billion won concert.

211
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,400
I told you to be thorough with the safety inspection.

212
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,990
Hey—

213
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,050
Ha Lee Chan?

214
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,980
 I told you to be always careful not to get injured. I told you. 

215
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,900
 I can't compete if I'm afraid of getting injured. 

216
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,120
 The moment you give up... 

217
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,060
 it's game over. 

218
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,480
Lee Chan.

219
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,180
Ha Lee Chan.

220
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,350
You bastard. Were you alive?

221
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:38,110
N-N-No. Let's go to a cafe or something...

222
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,500
Mr. Oh! Mr. Oh. The doctor wants to see you.

223
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,580
 Wait here. I'll see the doctor for a second. 

224
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,210
The surgery needs to start now.

225
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,930
- Where is he now? 
 - Over there.

226
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,690
H-H-Hold on.

227
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,280
Lee Chan. Lee Chan. Ha Lee Chan!

228
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,420
 I'm Ha Eun Ho, Ha Lee Chan's son. 

229
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,930
 Who are you, Mister? 

230
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,530
Hi.

231
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,940
Nice to meet you.

232
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,230
I'm your dad's friend from high school.

233
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,690
 I'm sorry for suddenly contacting you. 

234
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,920
It's okay.

235
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,170
I've been waiting to hear from you.

236
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,010
You said you're curious about something. Right?

237
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,210
Ask me anything.

238
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:00,700
 Was Dad able to hear when he was in high school, by chance? 

239
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,390
Who was that friend?

240
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,740
I don't know.

241
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,170
You don't know the name?

242
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,270
No. It wasn't important back then.

243
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:21,610
I just heard he regretted and blamed himself for not accompanying Lee Chan that day.

244
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,200
Ma Joo.

245
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,110
Ma Joo?

246
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:35,070
The band manager, Ma Joo, is the only one Dad would discuss things regarding the band.

247
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,050
He must've been the friend who couldn't go with him that day.

248
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,250
But it's strange.

249
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,270
If he regretted and blamed himself for it,

250
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,790
why did he stop talking to my dad?

251
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,620
Lee Chan is the one who stopped talking to him.

252
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,500
Eun Ho said he asked his dad later. And...

253
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,540
   

254
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,210
 Whenever I see my friends from back then, 

255
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,340
 it breaks my heart a bit. 

256
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,510
 They make me miss those days. 

257
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:30,890
 It's kind of difficult to see their sad faces looking at me, too. 

258
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,110
I think I could understand...

259
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,410
what it's like to miss someone but not have the courage to see them.

260
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,060
You're afraid you'd damage the other's wound that

261
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,920
you can't bring yourself to face them.

262
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,830
Mr. Jonathan.

263
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,540
What?

264
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,160
History has changed a lot since I joined the band instead of Yoon Dong Jin,

265
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,930
but Lee Chan's connections wouldn't have changed a lot.

266
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,100
So?

267
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,370
An adult who's knowledgeable about rock music that Dad would ask for advice in music.

268
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:29,430
A guitarist who runs a store and is close with the band.

269
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:33,790
My dad must've made a plan to see Mr. Jonathan.

270
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,790
   

271
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,070
If Dad is planning to see Mr. Jonathan tomorrow,

272
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,280
I can't figure out exactly where the accident takes place,

273
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,500
but I can guess the general area.

274
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,060
Near White Nights Music Shop.

275
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,410
Yes.

276
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,610
Stay with Lee Chan no matter what tomorrow.

277
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,730
I'll stay at the accident site and eliminate all the possibilities.

278
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,670
What are you talking about? Why would you go there?

279
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,300
I suppose it's like an extra safety measure.

280
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,920
Or the second line of defense?

281
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,490
If you lose Lee Chan, I can still stop him at the scene.

282
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,540
But what if you end up getting hurt?

283
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,970
Don't worry.

284
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,680
I'll run away if it gets dangerous.

285
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,200
- But still. 
 - Ha Eun Gyeol.

286
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,640
There aren't two moons in the sky yet. And we're still here.

287
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,240
So we can definitely stop it.

288
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,630
Try believing in your helper.

289
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,940
Go inside.

290
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,370
Okay. Get home safely.

291
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,320
Have a pleasant dream tonight.

292
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,040
On Eun Yoo.

293
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,270
Huh? That's my name.

294
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,200
It's nice to hear that name here, and I feel nostalgic, too...

295
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,040
Thank you.

296
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,250
Are you sending me to a war?

297
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,410
You must be one of the reasons why I came here.

298
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,950
Yes. I think so, too.

299
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,670
Let's make sure to go back together.

300
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:17,330
I'll return the favor a thousand times in 2023.

301
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,900
A thousand times is not quite enough,

302
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,190
but I'll look forward to it.

303
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,550
 There aren't two moons in the sky yet. And we're still here. 

304
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:42,050
 So we can definitely stop it. 

305
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,460
Mr. Ha Eun Gyeol?

306
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,910
We're from the Mapo Police Station.

307
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,960
You'll have to come with us for a second.

308
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,290
We received a report on Ms. Yoon Cheong Ah's kidnapping.

309
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,350
 Would you be able to handle it? 

310
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,190
 Can you be responsible? 

311
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:11,350
 If you go out that gate now, you'll regret it later. 

312
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:17,570
Let's go. It's not like I don't have anything to say.

313
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,150
   

314
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,600
Mapo Police Station is that way. Where are we going...

315
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,210
Who are you guys?

316
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,780
You're not police officers, are you?

317
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,520
I thought you were smart. But you're still a kid.

318
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,180
   

319
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,130
Fax me a copy if he writes a memorandum.

320
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:55,500
Bring Cheong Ah back once you see the boat leaving with him.

321
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,160
Well, I'm not sure...

322
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,140
We're stowing him away since he has no valid identity.

323
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,230
No one would know he went missing since he has no family.

324
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,970
Do we have to worry about the aftermath?

325
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,010
Nice to see me again, huh?

326
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,600
I'm not happy to see a hunting dog who's crazy for money.

327
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,900
Do you know how to dictate?

328
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,000
Write down what I say and sign it. Then you're free.

329
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,110
It's simple.

330
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,320
It says you got electrocuted and became a resident tutor on purpose to approach them.

331
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,810
You admit that you kidnapped Yoon Cheong Ah and demanded ransom.

332
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:02,430
You got the ransom, and you'll never approach the Jinsung family again.

333
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,040
You think I will?

334
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,370
If you sign willingly, you'll become rich.

335
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,630
But your life will be over if you act out.

336
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:13,170
We prepared the highest quality boat for you.

337
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,490
Don't even try. They have a lot of tattoos.

338
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,840
They're good with weapons, too.

339
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,200
You guys are good with shovels, too. Right? Like burying something in the ground.

340
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,250
Why are you so scared? I already told you what to do.

341
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,500
Let's finish this quickly.

342
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:45,360
   

343
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:56,060
   

344
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,390
 This is not what you promised. 

345
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,920
 Where are we going right now? 

346
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,960
 You said you'd let me go if I sign. 

347
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,040
 Stop the car. Stop the car! 

348
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,670
Let me get off. Let me go!

349
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,410
Bring it over right now.

350
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,920
You're home, Chairman.

351
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,110
You came back a day sooner than expected.

352
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,380
I told you to bring it. Didn't you hear me?

353
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,010
Did the employees do something wrong?

354
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,940
Chairman. Chairman?

355
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:54,090
Why are you doing this, Chairman?

356
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,000
This is just a room we use as a storage.

357
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,210
Open it. Do it yourself.

358
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,840
Do I have to repeat myself?

359
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,090
I told you. It's just a storage room.

360
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:34,710
Sang Ah wanted to use it to store the clothes she got tired of.

361
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,890
She was unbelievably stubborn since she was a kid.

362
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:22,740
Whenever she got annoyed during lessons, she bit, scratched, and destroyed stuff.

363
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,890
I couldn't do anything if she came in here and locked the door.

364
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:32,000
I've thought about destroying it and getting rid of it,

365
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,590
but I thought she could use a shelter to herself at home—

366
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,090
Does an English word make the hellish situation more palatable?

367
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,460
I left this room for Cheong Ah.

368
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,540
If you chase a mouse without providing a hole to escape through,

369
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,470
it ends up biting the cat.

370
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,830
Do you think my daughter is a mouse?

371
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,830
What have you all been doing?

372
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,850
You ignored it, kept it a secret, and helped her.

373
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,580
What did you receive for destroying a child's soul?

374
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,350
W-We just followed her orders—

375
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,060
Pack your things. You're all fired.

376
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,300
Pardon?

377
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,820
Ms. Im, you're fired, too.

378
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,320
Take your children with you and get out of my house.

379
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,090
Chairman. Chairman!

380
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,720
I can't leave.

381
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:45,360
I can't leave this house or the school without a just reason.

382
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,500
A just reason?

383
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,600
I don't know what rumor made you imagine this, but I—

384
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,880
Was it that Eun Gyeol kid, by chance?

385
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,490
Just finish what you were saying. I'm curious what your conclusion is.

386
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:10,010
Do you know what he did while you were gone?

387
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:14,210
He held Cheong Ah as a hostage and demanded money.

388
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,980
I couldn't even call the police because of your reputation and company image.

389
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:24,130
I told Attorney Jang to take care of it, but that kid took the money and ran.

390
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,310
How could you believe someone like that and—

391
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,340
Your face says, "You should be stowed away on the boat by now.

392
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,180
Why are you here?"

393
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,520
 Stop the car! Stop the car, I said! 

394
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,950
 Let me get off. Let me go! 

395
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,450
 There's something I need to do! 

396
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,050
 Hey! 

397
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,610
 - Stop the car! 
 - Grab him! 

398
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,610
 Stop the car, I said! 

399
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,560
 Hey, it's the police. 

400
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,790
 Stop! Stop right there! 

401
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,120
 Eun Gyeol. 

402
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,530
 Secretary Shin. 

403
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,980
 I'm sorry, I'm late. 

404
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,090
 I followed you from the boarding house. I needed evidence. 

405
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,080
I received the fax you sent.

406
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,620
I'm glad you received it in time.

407
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,540
You need a just reason?

408
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,870
You accepted bribes using your authority.

409
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:18,210
Admission fraud. Embezzlement and tax evasion.

410
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,430
Building a slush fund using a paper company.

411
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:25,420
Imprisoning, abusing, and kidnapping of a minor.

412
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,820
Do you need more?

413
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,440
Chairman, that's—

414
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,200
Secretary Shin will send a copy of the family registry when it's updated.

415
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,140
- Chairman! Chairman! 
 - I told you.

416
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,900
I said I'll teach you what justice means.

417
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,240
And don't even dream about...

418
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,830
a comfortable life.

419
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,870
Goodness. I heard you study art. You're so talented.

420
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,270
The boys will love this.

421
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,540
 - Wow! 
 - Thanks for the meal! 

422
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,300
Whoa! It's omurice.

423
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,660
Wow.

424
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,150
 Thanks for the meal! 

425
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:24,790
Oh, I made a plan to drink with someone. I forgot.

426
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:28,220
Cheong Ah, please save this for me.

427
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,550
I need to keep my stomach empty to enjoy the drinking snacks later.

428
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,010
Are you seeing Jae Min...

429
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,540
You should've told me. Wait for me. Hey! Hey!

430
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,330
Where did everyone go in the middle of the meal?

431
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,060
Hello?

432
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,750
 It's me. 

433
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,600
What's up?

434
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,620
You ignored me earlier. Why are you calling me now—

435
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,110
 Chairman Yoon returned. 

436
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,740
Can you bring Cheong Ah here?

437
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:41,000
♫  Tell me about loneliness  ♫

438
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:49,000
♫  This must be a feeling like a wind blowing  ♫

439
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:57,000
♫  I'll tell you about sadness  ♫

440
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,340
I told you, right?

441
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,570
You're not obligated to forgive.

442
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,170
You can come back anytime.

443
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,920
We're always on your side.

444
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,660
You know, right?

445
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,980
Okay, then.

446
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,130
Go inside. I'll get going.

447
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,140
♫  I'm actually afraid  ♫

448
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:36,580
♫  If only I had you to hold my hand warmly  ♫

449
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:45,560
♫  I would've leaned on you without a word and face the night approaching  ♫

450
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:51,620
♫  And get through it with your courage  ♫

451
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,350
Do you mind...

452
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,590
talking to me for a moment?

453
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,190
- Why? 
 - Don't worry.

454
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,960
I won't misbehave.

455
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,150
I'll get you tea next time. I fired all the maids.

456
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,090
My grandma doesn't know any sign language.

457
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,750
But she talks a lot with Cheong Ah.

458
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,220
That made me realize...

459
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:40,650
that you can communicate anything with a sincere heart.

460
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,300
If you want to communicate more,

461
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:53,120
you just need to learn how to communicate more.

462
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,120
   

463
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:04,940
"A father is like a shield that protects us from all the wind and waves

464
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,560
before we face a strong wave called society."

465
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,200
I didn't come up with it. Hemingway did.

466
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,120
I didn't get to have a father like that,

467
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,820
but I hope Cheong Ah does.

468
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,110
You can have that. I'm done with it.

469
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,550
Well, then...

470
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,790
It's Stendhal, not Hemingway.

471
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,820
And it's about a mother, not a father.

472
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,350
But I understand what you meant.

473
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,120
And thank you so much for this.

474
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,670
Why are you following me?

475
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,960
I wanted to sleep with you tonight.

476
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,450
You've been quiet lately. Why do this again?

477
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,200
I think...

478
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:16,020
I finished my duty with Cheong Ah.

479
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,290
You should go back soon.

480
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,690
How much longer will you abandon your life and wander around?

481
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,600
Go tell your father that you like being in a band.

482
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:39,020
Say you don't want to study abroad and are no longer his trophy.

483
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,720
 No. I'm not going. 

484
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,480
 I don't want to be your trophy anymore. 

485
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,910
 Why didn't you say that before? 

486
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,440
 Because I knew you'd be like this. 

487
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,060
 Because it's so clear. 

488
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,140
 You should have told me still! 

489
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:59,470
 If you considered me a parent, you should have convinced me somehow. 

490
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,490
 That's what family is! 

491
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:05,600
 How could I have convinced you? You can't even hear! 

492
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,900
I'm sure he'd understand if you told him.

493
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,630
He doesn't know because you never told him.

494
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,610
If everyone goes back,

495
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,450
Grandma will feel so sad about it.

496
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,060
   

497
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,190
Grandma, will you really be like this?

498
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:41,950
How could you prefer a stranger over your grandson?

499
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:45,500
Just go take a shower if you'd only say nonsense.

500
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,080
It's not nonsense.

501
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,550
You like him more than me

502
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:52,030
and you and Cheong Ah grew attached to each other in just a day.

503
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:56,960
Hey, you bastard. No matter how precious they are, they don't compare to my grandson.

504
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,860
Bring me a truckful of them. I won't trade them with you.

505
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,510
Gosh, I'm sorry, sir.

506
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,330
- Don't mention it. 
 - Which part of me do you like, exactly?

507
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,570
Goodness, hey. Go take a shower. I'll go to sleep.

508
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,520
Come on. Tell me.

509
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,110
What about me do you find so lovable?

510
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,910
Gosh.

511
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,390
At such a young age,

512
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:30,780
you went through all the hardship, but you grew up so well.

513
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:36,000
You're neither bitter nor whiny about it.

514
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:40,380
I love how healthy you are physically and mentally.

515
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,750
What more can you ask for in a person?

516
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:58,280
Gosh, I should sleep with Ms. Go tonight like in the old days.

517
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,050
I'll join you, then.

518
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,360
I mean, let me join you.

519
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,540
How dare you get involved? She's my grandma.

520
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,280
What are you guys, babies?

521
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,550
She's my grandma, too. Okay?

522
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,500
- Grandma, he keeps... 
 - What are you doing?

523
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,390
She's my grandma. Don't touch her.

524
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,900
Let's just go to sleep.

525
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,960
You scared me.

526
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,540
Why are you still up?

527
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,230
How do you know this song?

528
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,750
What do you mean? It's because I wrote it.

529
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,810
 What's this? 

530
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:59,420
 Listen to the song on it, and then make up a guitar riff. 

531
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,930
 If I listen to it and think it's good, 

532
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,970
 I'll give you that guitar you've been eyeing. 

533
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,670
 Really? You'll really give me that guitar— 

534
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:13,370
 I said if I listen to it and think it's good. 

535
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:14,900
 It's not a complete song. 

536
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,660
 It just has a lead guitar, the main melody. 

537
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,560
 You fill it out. 

538
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,360
 But who wrote this song? 

539
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,980
 Was it you, by any chance? 

540
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,390
 No. There's no way. 

541
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,170
 You wouldn't know even if I told you. 

542
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:36,180
 I mean, no one would know. 

543
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,090
 Because he was an unknown artist. 

544
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:44,870
 No way. Was Dad the unknown artist? 

545
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,100
 But how did he hear this song— 

546
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,330
Sorry to interrupt you while zoning out,

547
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,470
but could you shut the door immediately?

548
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,980
Grandma is a very light sleeper.

549
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,970
Is this really your original song?

550
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,830
Why? Are you surprised by how genius it is?

551
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,550
Really?

552
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,730
Are you really sure this is the song you wrote?

553
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,040
I'm starting to feel offended.

554
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,970
Do you look down on me?

555
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,110
Am I not supposed to write an original song?

556
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:22,070
I mean, it's not that...

557
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,450
I thought we chose "Shining" for the contest.

558
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,180
Why are you writing a song in addition?

559
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:34,760
I'll quit being in the band after the contest.

560
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,650
What? Why?

561
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,480
I want Grandma to wear my graduation cap.

562
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:44,450
I think I should fulfill her wish.

563
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,680
What else can I do?

564
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,530
I should focus and study for a while to fulfill her dream.

565
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:56,210
So, I wrote a song dedicated to my splendid youth.

566
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,930
Will you quit music?

567
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,210
No way.

568
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:09,430
I wrote it now since I might lose the youthful spirit.

569
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,810
My next goal is...

570
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,610
the College Music Festival.

571
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,270
I did create the body, but I can't come up with the head and tail.

572
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,740
 Please let him achieve his dream. 

573
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,210
Let's write it together.

574
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,560
Let's finish this song together.

575
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,340
- Really? 
 - Yes.

576
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,870
I'd love that.

577
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:42,220
Instead, you need to promise me two things.

578
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,980
Gosh, you bastard.

579
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,990
Let's hear them first.

580
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:52,500
One. You'll never let anyone hear this song before the College Music Festival.

581
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,530
Okay. What's the other one?

582
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:59,280
Make sure not to go anywhere and stay at home all day tomorrow.

583
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,330
Are you doing this again?

584
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,870
I know. You won't understand, but...

585
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:08,010
- I have a situation I can't explain— 
 - Okay.

586
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,060
- You said "Okay"? 
 - Yes.

587
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:13,810
Why? Why are you agreeing to it without even asking why?

588
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:15,290
You're making me nervous.

589
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:17,480
Thinking about it,

590
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,790
all the favors you asked me were for my sake.

591
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:27,710
 Please don't destroy his dream. 

592
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,610
Okay.

593
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,220
Try it.

594
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:34,320
 Please let him be happy... 

595
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,660
You don't mind me recording it. Right? I don't want to forget it.

596
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:49,160
 Please let his youth continue to shine. 

597
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,490
 If someone's listening to me, please... 

598
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:11,620
   

599
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,320
 Please listen to my desperate prayer. 

600
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:56,410
Guys, let me play with you!

601
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,200
   
  Hi.  

602
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:02,590
 Today was the 40th Memorial Day on the 50th anniversary of the National Liberation. 

603
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:06,550
Wow, dried pollack soup! You're the best, Grandmother.

604
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:10,740
You drink all night whenever it's a holiday.

605
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:14,320
Your parents are working hard in your hometowns, trying to educate you.

606
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,600
Grandmother! Give me food, too!

607
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,630
What are you doing skipping meals?

608
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,560
Are you hungover, too?

609
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,840
I didn't eat so I could eat your food.

610
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,480
- Where's Lee Chan, by the way? 
 - Gosh, I don't know.

611
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:35,380
He's been lazying around stuck in that room playing the guitar since yesterday.

612
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,750
 Hey, Lee Chan! Don't make me set the table twice. Come out and scarf this down, you bastard. 

613
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,360
Geez.

614
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,850
Thank you.

615
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:52,650
Grandma! I was recording something important, but your voice ended up in it.

616
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,950
What are you doing here, Ma Joo?

617
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,920
Eun Gyeol called me.

618
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,520
He wanted all of us to practice here together.

619
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,550
- Grandma! I want food! 
 - Me, too!

620
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,620
- I want food! 
 - You bastard.

621
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,730
Hello.

622
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:09,490
Thanks for the meal.

623
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:11,560
- Goodness. 
 - Thank you.

624
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,970
You should've told me in advance if you were coming.

625
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,620
Eat the side dishes for now.

626
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,600
 - Okay. Thanks for the meal.  
 - Chopsticks.

627
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,700
Are you acting generous by emptying our food supply?

628
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,120
Hyung, how do you care for your hair?

629
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,410
I try not to wash it.

630
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:31,140
It got so long. How do you grow it that long?

631
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,690
Just have lots of dirty thoughts.

632
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,200
Hyung, I heard your girlfriend dumped you.

633
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,900
Just have lots of dirty thoughts.

634
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,430
- Seriously. 
 - Hyung, I'm eating.

635
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:48,160
 I just heard that he regretted and blamed himself for not accompanying Lee Chan that day. 

636
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,560
What? Do you have something to tell me?

637
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:57,910
Stay with Lee Chan all day today, no matter what.

638
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,370
I mean, stay with him even after you get old.

639
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:02,820
Make sure to stay in touch.

640
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,830
Wow, you want me to see him when I get old, too?

641
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,810
Where are you running off to after handing me a bomb?

642
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,400
Why are you calling me a bomb?

643
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,790
Am I wrong?

644
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:14,750
Don't worry. I won't run away.

645
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,530
I'll stay with him all the way through, too.

646
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:26,040
 Melons for sale. Melons. 

647
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,040
 I don't know exactly when, 

648
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,360
 but I can narrow it down. 

649
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,400
 Go ahead and taste it. 

650
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,430
We'll start the countdown when the late lunch at the boarding house starts.

651
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:41,420
Okay. I'll be at the scene in the morning, just in case.

652
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,900
Send me a voicemail as soon as the lunch starts.

653
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,310
Okay.

654
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,610
It's the same with the accident site. We can narrow it down.

655
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:53,250
Lee Chan normally takes this route to go to White Nights.

656
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,090
This is the only narrow street with street vendors, too.

657
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,090
The accident...

658
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:03,190
most likely happened here.

659
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,880
I got melons as big as cannonballs.

660
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,130
- Hello. Welcome. 
 - They look so good. I'll have this one.

661
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,260
- Would you like that one? 
 - Yes.

662
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,680
Could I have one for free, too?

663
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,070
It's dangerous because there are cars here.

664
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,370
Where's your mom? Let me take you to her.

665
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:23,090
What are you doing? I don't want to!

666
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:26,900
Hey, it's dangerous here because of the cars!

667
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,830
Gosh, it got on me.

668
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,510
I'm sorry. How did that fall?

669
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:36,970
Shit, it splashed on me!

670
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:41,920
I suggested having a meeting. Why did you have to drink that?

671
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,880
No, I'll answer it. I'll answer it.

672
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:54,340
Hello?

673
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,430
Are you drunk? Were you trying to kill someone?

674
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,490
It's me.

675
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:00,640
 Are you okay? Did you get hurt at all? 

676
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,080
Congratulations, Ha Eun Gyeol.

677
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,180
It's all over. I saw it with my own eyes.

678
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,520
Lee Chan is safe now.

679
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,570
Thank you, Eun Yoo.

680
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:19,280
I told you to believe in your helper.

681
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,530
Do you want to come here now?

682
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,000
Everyone is here.

683
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,470
I miss you.

684
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:28,090
Okay, I'll come.

685
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,790
Let me check one more thing.

686
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:31,850
You still have to check something?

687
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:35,720
No, I'm just curious about something.

688
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,130
   

689
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,580
 Who visited my grandfather that day? 

690
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,690
   

691
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,270
   

692
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,150
   

693
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:09,160
 Was it Mom who visited him? 

694
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,660
Taxi! Taxi!

695
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:39,210
Please follow that taxi ahead quickly.

696
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:41,430
Hurry. We can't lose them.

697
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,730
I can't guarantee anything.

698
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:47,120
 I was once lost, too. 

699
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,610
   
 You mean you pretended to be lost. 

700
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:52,020
 I'm serious. I was. 

701
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,940
 I ran away from home once in my life. 

702
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,980
 Ran away? You did? 

703
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,830
 Yes. Maybe it was shortly after I left to study in the US. 

704
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,640
 I ran away to Korea by myself behind my parents' back. 

705
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,130
 Whoa. What's the first thing you did after running away? 

706
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:10,160
 I met my biological father. 

707
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:16,700
 I had a lot of questions 

708
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,300
 and I wanted to hear about a lot of things, 

709
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,530
 but I couldn't say a word. 

710
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,660
 He was like that, too. I just... 

711
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,370
 had a tea and left. 

712
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,490
 And it was at a funeral when I saw him again. 

713
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,250
Hold on, Mister. Why did you stop?

714
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:53,330
Gosh, don't you wish life was like movies?

715
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,440
You said you'd come. Why didn't you call?

716
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,370
Do you know how worried I was?

717
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:20,810
I thought something happened.

718
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,630
What's wrong?

719
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,130
Did something happen?

720
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,930
I checked everything

721
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:33,890
but this one thing. So I felt anxious.

722
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:35,950
What didn't you get to check?

723
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:39,040
The person who visited White Nights that day.

724
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:42,720
So, did you check?

725
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:48,860
Who was it? Is it someone I know, too?

726
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,130
My mom.

727
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,990
Choi Se Kyeong.

728
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,930
Hey! Hey!

729
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,590
Get up now!

730
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,660
Aren't we having a meeting about covers?

731
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,870
We can wait until Eun Gyeol gets back.

732
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:14,710
You think you'd work when Se Kyeong gets here?

733
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:16,720
Get up right now!

734
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,680
- I don't want to. 
 - Let's do it later.

735
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,910
Lee Chan, where's the demo recording...

736
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,890
Is this it?

737
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:51,730
- No! 
 - Seriously.

738
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,500
- I can never reveal this song. 
 - What the?

739
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,480
Are you entering a contest just the two of you?

740
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,010
- You think I'm like you? 
 - Did you plagiarize, then?

741
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:02,400
You want to die?

742
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,140
It's an original song created by Ha Lee Chan and Ha Eun Gyeol.

743
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,550
Why can't you reveal it, then?

744
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:11,690
I can't tell you. Don't try to find out. You'd get hurt.

745
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:13,790
Hey, this is great.

746
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:17,220
I was nervous about competing against Ilyoung High with just one song.

747
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,920
I have a good feeling about this. "To You, Who Shines."

748
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,280
Yes, I like it.

749
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,560
It'd be different from a childish rock song. It's promising.

750
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,160
Did you clean your ears with an electrical post?

751
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,310
Didn't you hear me? I said I can't reveal this song.

752
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:34,260
I promised Eun Gyeol that I wouldn't!

753
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,740
If that's the case...

754
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,100
Catch him! Catch him.

755
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,330
- Hey! 
 - Take it from him.

756
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,160
Take it. Take it right now.

757
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,140
I'll ask Mr. Jonathan which song is better.

758
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,550
Hey, shit!

759
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:46,930
Hold him for just ten minutes.

760
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,680
Hey, let go!

761
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,700
Let go!

762
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,900
I don't understand.

763
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,640
Why did she suddenly come back from the US?

764
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,490
More importantly, why would she go to White Nights?

765
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:04,520
Because he's my grandfather.

766
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,930
What?

767
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:10,560
Mr. Jonathan of White Nights is my grandfather.

768
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,510
What are you talking about?

769
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:15,330
Your grandfather is a physics professor—

770
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:19,570
He's the one who adopted my mom.

771
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,880
 If you don't mind me asking, 

772
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,180
 what's your relationship with him? 

773
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,940
 I'm his daughter. 

774
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,210
What's wrong?

775
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,450
You and I...

776
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,650
have met before.

777
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:42,420
What? We have?

778
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,780
When?

779
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:49,630
The day your mom gave me the guitar he left for me.

780
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,920
 She's good. Right? 

781
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:03,190
 My daughter. She's a cello major. 

782
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,680
 Just like you, she's 18. 

783
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,460
And...

784
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:10,430
at your grandfather's funeral.

785
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:12,200
   

786
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,110
   

787
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,970
That kid was you?

788
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,480
Yes.

789
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:42,690
But why did you come to my grandpa's funeral?

790
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:44,700
Because he was my teacher.

791
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,620
What?

792
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:50,270
He saved me from getting bullied,

793
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,980
introduced me to music,

794
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:57,930
and taught me the word "Coda."

795
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,800
I need to go see him right now.

796
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:17,690
Oh Ma Joo!

797
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:20,550
- Shit. 
 - Hold on, hold on.

798
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,580
Give it to me while I'm asking nicely.

799
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,480
You really can't do this.

800
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,640
I promised not to let anyone hear it.

801
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,640
It's already too late. Plenty of people listened to it already.

802
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,160
Gosh.

803
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:37,700
Ha Eun Gyeol will kill me if he knew I left the house!

804
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,580
Since when did you listen to what he says?

805
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,420
Shit.

806
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:51,580
It's your dad, right? Go and be a good son.

807
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

808
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,300
I'm serious.

809
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:00,040
I'm not doing this just for myself. So we should just try asking him.

810
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,460
To see which song has a better chance of winning.

811
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,840
You're the frontman, punk!

812
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,740
I'll go, then.

813
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:11,960
   

814
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,830
Geez.

815
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,870
   

816
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:46,850
♫  ...if I saw you in Heaven  ♫

817
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:50,670
 Towel off. You'll catch a cold staying wet like that. 

818
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:57,440
 It's okay. Things happen when you're a boy. 

819
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,030
 How did I not know? 

820
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:12,930
♫  And carry on, 'Cause I know I don't belong  ♫

821
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:16,120
 How did I not recognize him? 

822
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,390
   

823
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:05,060
Special thanks to Ha Eun Gyeol.

824
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:08,270
I was able to finish this song, thanks to you.

825
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,750
But thinking about it...

826
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:13,930
you didn't just finish the song with me.

827
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:16,530
Whenever there's something I want,

828
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:20,240
something I'm missing, when I'm in despair,

829
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:27,390
or when I shined the most, you've always been there with me.

830
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:31,950
You lied that you're my son, didn't you?

831
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,910
But...

832
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,000
I felt like you were my father for some reason.

833
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,260
I've never experienced love from my father,

834
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,420
but I felt something similar, thanks to you.

835
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:59,270
Hey, son. Thank you.

836
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:01,650
In return,

837
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:05,580
I'll be born as your father in my next life.

838
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:15,580
 Hey, Yi Chan! Don't make me set the table twice. Come out and scarf this down, you bastard. 

839
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,400
Geez.

840
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,150
 If someone's listening, please... 

841
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:34,850
 Please listen to my desperate prayer. 

842
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,950
 Can you hear me? 

843
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:44,680
 Can you hear my voice? 

844
01:03:53,280 --> 01:04:03,510


845
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:08,900
I'm sorry, Dad.

846
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:16,200
   

847
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:23,530
♫  We are in different times  ♫

848
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:31,100
♫  We met while wandering around  ♫

849
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:38,280
♫  Among so many people  ♫

850
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:45,680
♫  I was able to recognize you  ♫

851
01:04:45,700 --> 01:05:00,690
♫  If only we could've been together dreaming the same dream  ♫

852
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:14,300
♫  I go all the way around a distance at the end of this road to sing about love  ♫

853
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,490
♫  These shining moments  ♫

854
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:21,260
   

855
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:24,740
 Wrap up the journey and come to the place where you first arrived. 

856
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:26,490
 You think I could go back in this situation? 

857
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:27,730
 Where are you going right now? 

858
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:29,760
 To find the bastard who did that to Lee Chan. 

859
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,970
 Please open your eyes now. 

860
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:36,800
 Your efforts must've caused a positive change. 

861
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,680
 Let's go back to our world now. 

862
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,130
 It's not your fault. 

863
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:42,970
 An accident is just an accident. 

864
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:44,380
 Don't look back and leave. 

865
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:49,550
 If you remain there, your life in 2023 will disappear. 

866
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:51,510
 Would you still be okay with that?
