2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,140
   

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,940
   

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,790
   

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,950
   

6
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,370
   

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,100
   

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,870
   

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,240
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have liked you. It was my mistake. 
    

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,760
I have a dream and a goal.

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,650
That's my dream, but it's my whole family's, too.

12
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:58,520
To me, being in a relationship right now is a waste of emotions and time.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,030
Waste of... what?

14
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,330
That's what my brother wanted me to tell you.

15
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,630
 You explain it yourself. 

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,370
 I can't believe what he's saying. 

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,800
 I'll send you a DM later— 

18
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,990
Sorry. Let's not talk until we go to college—

19
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,700
- Hey! 
 - That's what my brother wanted me to tell you.

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:35,060
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 🍉 Viva la Watermelon 🍉 Team @Viki.com 

21
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,860
Selfish bastard.

22
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,540
   

23
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,230
I took care of four.

24
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,980
We have one last person left. Right?

25
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,040
Give me her phone number now.

26
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,310
 No. Not her, ever. 

27
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,160
What do you mean, no?

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,160
You promised me you'd break up with all of them.

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,060
Gosh, give it to me.

30
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,810
She's the one who plays the cello. Right?

31
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,730
Give it to me. Give it...

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,400
 No. She's special to me. 

33
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,660
Don't you know what an important period this is for you?

34
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,560
You might not make it to college even if you only focus on training.

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,810
Think about your future seriously, please.

36
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,880
 It's not for my future, but yours. 

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,170
What?

38
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,870
 I need to achieve my dream for you to no longer be burdened. 

39
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,670
Brother!

40
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,920
 Eun Gyeol, you should live your life now. 

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,190
 I'll live my life on my own somehow. 

42
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,500
 You should enjoy the present sometimes, too. 

43
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,450
 You should be in love like me, too. Like me. 

44
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,900
 Don't waste your precious youth 

45
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,950
 because of me and the family. 

46
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,660
 Try to shine while you still can. 

47
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,240
 Do something that makes your heart beat. 

48
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,520
 The earth won't perish just because you do that. 

49
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,920
 You've grown up nicely. 

50
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,290
 Want to come in for a second? 

51
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,730
 I have something to give you. 

52
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,850
Wow, not giving into self-indulgence.

53
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,170
You control yourself very well.

54
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,030
 Are you crazy? Are you crazy? 

55
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,680
 She's a nice lady who gave me Grandpa's guitar. What am I doing? 

56
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,790
Gosh. It's okay, it's okay.

57
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,260
Losing sleep for a month out of embarrassment will let you forget all this.

58
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,640
An embarrassing history is still history.

59
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,040
Goodness, it's okay. It's okay.

60
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,510
An unrequited love is just as worthwhile as being in love for the first time.

61
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,040
Just feel honored that it was me.

62
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,550
 Remember, Brother? 

63
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,740
 You told me that day... 

64
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,850
 that life doesn't shine when all the conditions are met. 

65
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,290
 It shines in little moments. 

66
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,700
 That you experience happiness when all those moments are gathered. 

67
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,430
But be honest with me.

68
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,490
 If I shine from time to time... 

69
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,580
You've never been in a relationship. Right?

70
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,210
 ...and do what the heart tells me to do... 

71
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,850
You never have. Right? Right?

72
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,250
 ...it wouldn't destroy the earth, would it? 

73
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,520
Na-na na-na na-na. You never have.

74
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,230
You never have.

75
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:18,210
♫  These shining moments  ♫

76
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:26,150
♫  I can give them all to you  ♫

77
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:33,170
♫  Our small dreams  ♫

78
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,260
Excuse me.

79
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,100
Is that...

80
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,100
a drawing of me?

81
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,880
Why?

82
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,870
By chance...

83
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,850
do you...

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,840
like me?

85
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,590
- Well... 
 - Well...

86
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,880
- You go first. 
 - You go first.

87
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,280
- Or should I go first? 
 - Or should I go first?

88
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,270
- What happened earlier— 
 - Let's say it never happened.

89
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,680
Yes, I understand.

90
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,910
Today's temperature, humidity, atmosphere,

91
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:26,210
and the whole energy of the universe whispered to you to be a lustful monster.

92
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,370
Lustful, what?

93
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,540
It's okay. I really understand.

94
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,970
Let's say this never happened

95
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,040
and let's keep a distance between us.

96
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,930
Don't get any closer than five meters. Okay?

97
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,310
Why do I have to do that?

98
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,820
Don't you know?

99
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,730
You cheated. You tried to steal Lee Chan's ball.

100
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,760
Like I said, I'll be fair to both of you until the festival—

101
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,160
You're not totally wrong,

102
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,030
but being rejected like this

103
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,940
makes me feel kind of offended.

104
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,340
Of course, I won't...

105
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,660
I won't say I'm innocent.

106
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,780
You must be a raging brute right now at 18.

107
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,270
I was too defenseless. I admit it.

108
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,590
Instead, I'll lessen the distance by two meters.

109
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,440
Don't come any closer than three meters. Okay?

110
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,900
- About earlier, I— 
 - Okay, okay, okay.

111
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,700
Don't get closer than two meters. I can't lessen any more. Well, then...

112
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,000
♫  The lights are turning on  ♫

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,480
♫  Someone's day is ending as usual as the afternoon is passing by  ♫

114
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,660
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy!

115
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,960
What about earlier? What was I going to say?

116
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,840
Sorry about earlier? It was a mistake?

117
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,270
That was a part of the mission? If not that...

118
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,970
♫  I'm breathing out in the dark air at night  ♫

119
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:08,130
♫  My heart and the moon collide  ♫

120
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,220
Or...

121
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,110
♫  I wonder if there was a night like that in the days past  ♫

122
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,690
...what else was it?

123
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,450
What happened earlier...

124
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,710
♫  I cannot love myself anymore  ♫

125
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,980
What?

126
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,290
What is it? Where are we going?

127
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,260
 What does the sign language I just did mean? 

128
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,680
   

129
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,980
 "Don't go. Stay with me."  That's what it means. 

130
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,220
 Why? Did someone say that to you? 

131
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,900
 How about this, then? 

132
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:13,190
"Thank you for saving me.

133
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,030
And...

134
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,460
I'm sorry.

135
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,560
I didn't know that you saved me..."

136
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,650
It was Lee Chan, wasn't it?

137
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,020
It was Lee Chan, wasn't it? It was Lee Chan. Right?

138
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,910
 He gave her the green light. 

139
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,080
 I want to learn sign language. 

140
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,630
 I want to learn and make friends. 

141
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,960
 You'll teach me. Right? 

142
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,240
   

143
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,770
Yes.

144
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,560
I will teach you.

145
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,290
I'll teach you more diligently.

146
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,720
How were the past few days for you? Is being the resident tutor manageable?

147
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,200
Yes, it's manageable.

148
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,290
You didn't forget our promise. Right?

149
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,500
I'll repeat.

150
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,820
If you can't bring results in a month, there will be consequences.

151
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,930
Don't worry.

152
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,610
I'll make sure to keep my word.

153
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,600
I'll look forward to it.

154
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,500
- You can leave now. 
 - Okay.

155
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,490
Do you still have something to say?

156
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,290
As a present from your business trip,

157
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,870
how about you get your daughter a fax machine?

158
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,290
I saved you from troubles, and now you're making demands?

159
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,660
If you get her a fax machine,

160
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,330
it'd help her communicate with the world.

161
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,140
You might get the result you want sooner, too.

162
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,470
I guess you haven't learned the word "arrogation" at school yet.

163
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,060
I just meant you have everything to gain. I'm sure you'd like that.

164
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,680
Well, then.

165
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,260
 Why do I have to satisfy your demand? 

166
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,170
 I'm a salesman. I don't make bad deals. 

167
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,510
 If I give one, I may not get 10, but I get at least two back. 

168
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,010
 What would you offer me in return if I did you a favor? 

169
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,580
 What will you give to me? 

170
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,780
 Her smiling face... 

171
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,270
 What? 

172
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,940
 I'll let you see your daughter smile. 

173
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,560
 Not a fake one, 

174
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,590
 but a real one that comes from true happiness. 

175
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,170
 I'm leaving this here because I can't get closer than two meters. 

176
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,330
 I washed it while I was putting gas in it. 

177
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,750
 I fixed a few things here and there. 

178
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,280
Giving himself credit, huh?

179
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,480
 Today's temperature, humidity, atmosphere, 

180
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,970
 and all the energy of the universe want you to have a good day. 

181
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,870
Should we practice a bit?

182
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,170
I want to be friends with you.

183
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,460
I want to become close friends with you.

184
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,190
Good job.

185
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,600
It's nice to see you coming to school together.

186
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,460
Could I see you for a moment before class?

187
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,690
Eun Gyeol.

188
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,320
Yes.

189
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,570
Did you think I was joking?

190
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,860
Pardon?

191
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,740
I clearly told you sign language is banned in our house.

192
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,030
I want to hear an understandable reason for that.

193
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,750
At home, we educate children our own way.

194
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,280
I'm confident it's the best way to raise Cheong Ah like a normal person.

195
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,230
Is that really the only reason?

196
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,280
What other reasons could there be?

197
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,950
You want to isolate her from the world

198
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:34,540
and prevent her from communicating with the chairman so you could gain something.

199
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,460
For instance, Jinsung Instruments.

200
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,750
You must've gotten yourself a pretty strong string to pull.

201
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,970
But Eun Gyeol...

202
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,020
how many days a year do you think the chairman stays at home?

203
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,150
Is that why you've been abusing Cheong Ah...

204
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,720
behind the closed doors when the chairman isn't around?

205
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,520
My goodness.

206
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,450
You're not only mistaken, you're slandering.

207
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,580
If I abused Cheong Ah,

208
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,710
why don't you think the chairman heard about it?

209
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,710
There are eyes and mouths everywhere around us.

210
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,420
Because my employees have faith in my philosophy in education—

211
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,390
Because you shut their mouths with a golden key.

212
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,520
I'm perceptive enough to see that.

213
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,860
If you're thinking of making the same offer to me,

214
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,970
I'll refuse.

215
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,440
- If you don't have anything else to say— 
 - The disciplinary committee

216
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,740
decided to punish you more harshly.

217
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,350
You'll be cleaning the school for a month during class.

218
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,710
I'm already writing a letter of apology after school...

219
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,550
Are you punishing me as revenge?

220
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,230
To stop me from being Cheong Ah's teaching assistant?

221
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,830
Have you heard the story about the fox and the tiger?

222
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,840
 The fox who took advantage of the tiger's authority. In the end... 

223
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,570
 what do you think happened to it? 

224
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,900
 It survived. 

225
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,330
 It wasn't foolish, either. 

226
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,730
 Looks like you made a month-long contract with the Chairman. 

227
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,630
 You'd better leave before then. 

228
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,440
 I'm sorry, but you're not my employer. It's Chairman— 

229
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,420
 Get out. 

230
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,100
 Get out of my house and my school. 

231
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,700
 No matter who you are and what you're plotting, go back to where you came from. 

232
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,710
 Take this to heart. 

233
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,680
 If you ignore my warning, 

234
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,600
 you'll see what devastating end the cheeky fox will face. 

235
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,810
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

236
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,880
I need to finish my mission to go back.

237
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,300
And I need to know how to go back to decide if I will or not.

238
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,180
Seriously...

239
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,470
What's this?

240
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,230
- Hello? 
  - Buongiorno. 

241
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,510
Are you joking right now?

242
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,780
Gosh, how scary. I thought you were a tiger.

243
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,620
Well, what made you so angry?

244
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,500
How could I not be angry right now?

245
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,530
You call me whenever you please, and you just hang up on me.

246
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,520
And I can't reach you when I need you.

247
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,500
Okay, okay. Calm down. Let's talk it over calmly.

248
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,040
Talk it over, my foot.

249
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,530
 You'll say cryptic things, anyway. 

250
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,940
You never answered my questions or did me a favor.

251
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,210
My goodness. You must've needed my help.

252
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,490
What if I did? What if I did?

253
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,800
Did you ever help me?

254
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,050
I'm not such a bad person. Okay?

255
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,150
Tell me when Dad gets into the accident, then.

256
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,420
You're still obsessing over your parents.

257
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,660
When, where, how, and why did the accident happen?

258
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,700
Don't you want to just enjoy your youth now?

259
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,750
Don't ever call me again.

260
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,460
 Whatever happens, I'll manage things on my own. 

261
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,560
 What a shame. I have already... 

262
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,270
sent a helper who suits you perfectly.

263
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,520
 But since you want to take care of things on your own, good luck, then. 

264
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,950
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

265
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,410
 Hold on. 

266
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,760
A helper? Who is it?

267
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,940
Quietly.

268
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,630
Get louder. Get louder.

269
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,010
 They have good chemistry for some reason. 

270
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,250
 They kind of resemble each other, too. 

271
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,240
 They say you resemble each other when you're in love. 

272
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,520
Se Kyeong.

273
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,280
Choi Se Kyeong?

274
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,550
Choi Se Kyeong.

275
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,620
Yes?

276
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,060
What are you thinking about? I called you many times.

277
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,200
I'm sorry. I'm still jetlagged.

278
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,100
Come out. Treat our ears to your playing like you used to.

279
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,700
Wait, sir. I'm supposed to observe the class for now.

280
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,220
- So I didn't bring my cello, either. 
 - What are you doing?

281
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,350
Somebody lend theirs to her.

282
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,910
Here.

283
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,460
   

284
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,450
 I know it's hard, but you have to be mature and overcome this. 

285
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,240
 Don't let people say that you became No.1 because your friend committed suicide. 

286
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,560
S-Sir, I...

287
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,010
I-I'm sorry.

288
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,830
I suddenly need to go to the restroom.

289
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

290
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,490
 You can't have a mental breakdown. 

291
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:44,650
 Instead, make sure to remember this feeling. 

292
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,960
 So you can think back to it when you convey sadness in music. 

293
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,980
What happened?

294
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,210
I can't hear.

295
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,310
I can't hear anything.

296
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,180
I can't hear anything!

297
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,140
 What a shame. 

298
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,210
 I have already sent a helper who suits you perfectly. 

299
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,490
Helper.

300
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,220
   
 (It sounds like "hurry, hurry" in Korean) 

301
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,410
 Dad? 

302
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,460
 What's going on? 

303
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,310
 But there's one condition. 

304
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,060
 To get assistance from the helper, 

305
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:22,480
 you have to assist the helper first. 

306
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:57,910
♪  Your silence is drying my lips  ♪

307
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:07,400
♪  My cold glance...  ♪

308
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,780
What do I do?

309
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,550
What do I say?

310
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,510
She'd get hurt if I rejected her. Right?

311
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,980
But I should still be honest. Right?

312
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,210
I'm sorry, but I like someone...

313
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,800
You want me to have it?

314
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,000
Hold on. Cheong Ah!

315
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,690
 I know you like Se Kyeong. 

316
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,980
 I don't care. Because... 

317
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,660
   

318
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,030
 ...you own your heart... 

319
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,240
 ...and I own my heart. 

320
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,310
 But we can still be friends. 

321
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,940
 If you don't like me because I'm disabled... 

322
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,480
No.

323
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,770
 ...you're a son of a bitch, and I'll just spit on the ground and turn around. 

324
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,140
 So you can say no. 

325
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,830

332
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,560
When did you improve so much?

333
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,010
How much did you practice?

334
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,090
Let me see the calluses.

335
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,640
Geez! What took you so long?

336
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,000
I told you to come quickly.

337
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,500
Right. You said it was an emergency. What's going on now?

338
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,010
Did you get injured? Did you get into a fight again?

339
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,610
We need to share the results of the tests and make a decision.

340
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,500
You scared me because you said it was an emergency.

341
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,010
My heart almost sank. Watch your words!

342
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,370
It's an emergency. The festival is just around the corner.

343
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,720
It's an emergency. The festival is just around the corner.

344
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,300
Whatever.

345
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,300
So what's the result?

346
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,170
She obviously passed. Right?

347
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:38,070
You must've observed how talented Se Kyeong is up close.

348
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,220
I did...

349
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,540
see her up close.

350
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,390
She was pretty.

351
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,670
What?

352
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,030
You bastard...

353
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,700
No, no. Her photos were.

354
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,250
Her photos were pretty, I said.

355
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,330
What did you think, then?

356
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,950
You must've seen Cheong Ah's art.

357
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,760
It was pretty good.

358
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:30,710
I think she respects the frontman.

359
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,970
So, is it a yes?

360
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,450
Well, whatever. How about you? Is it a yes?

361
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,160
If you accept Cheong Ah as our crew member, it's a yes. Definitely a yes.

362
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,920
It's strictly business. Okay? Strictly business.

363
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,690
It's a deal. Don't change your mind. Okay?

364
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,920
Okay, look over here.

365
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,320
One, two, three. Click, click, click.

366
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,350
Shit.

367
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,440
It's like a summit between Korea and the US.

368
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,920
Wow, I think we'll have a peaceful unification.

369
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,040
Gosh, there's no time to waste right now.

370
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,740
You're right. Let's go. We can't be late.

371
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,130
Where?

372
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,850
Okay. Someone wants to see us, apparently.

373
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,930
Who?

374
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,090
They say the landlord is above God.

375
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:22,570
It's our generous helper who provided us with the practice room.

376
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,140
 Helper? 

377
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,470
   

378
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,930
You finally came.

379
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,780
 Huh? This is... 

380
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,510
Hey, why aren't you coming?

381
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,980
Yeah. I'm coming.

382
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,950
Hurry up.

383
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,660
Sir, we're here.

384
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,270
- Hey, welcome. 
 - Hello.

385
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,840
- Yes. 
 - Hello.

386
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,080
Yes, yes.

387
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,050
- Huh? 
 - What?

388
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,980
It's you. You wanted to buy a guitar for your father.

389
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,160
Wow, were you actually the owner of this building?

390
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,890
Why didn't you come then?

391
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,070
I set aside a good one for you.

392
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:03,600
I see. Well, I had a bit of a complex situation.

393
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,440
What is it? You couldn't make up with your father?

394
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,480
He doesn't want to be in a band with you anymore?

395
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,740
How did you know that?

396
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,440
Did you have a father?

397
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,870
Yes. I do, but...

398
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,890
he's kind of immature.

399
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,860
My gosh, listen to you.

400
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,280
You rebelled against him and ran away from home.

401
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,070
Behave yourself and go back home, punk.

402
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,920
Even if you want to rebel, eat at home.

403
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,860
Even if you fight, sleep warmly

404
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,590
and stay at home, you bastard.

405
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,690
Don't worry. I'll go back once I'm done with my job.

406
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,240
I'm trying my best.

407
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,760
Yes. Work hard and be good to your parents.

408
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,440
Sir, why did you call us, by the way?

409
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,460
I'll get you more if you want. Help yourselves.

410
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,930
 Thank you! 

411
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:00,130
Hyeon Yool, do you still fight the Jindo dog?

412
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,650
I could never.

413
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,730
You get arrested if you harm national treasure these days.

414
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,090
How do you know Hyeon Yool, sir?

415
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:13,080
Did I meet you when you were in the Hongdae indie music scene?

416
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,600
The leader of our band was his student.

417
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,160
Student? What did he teach him?

418
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,700
Guitar.

419
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,130
I should've introduced him first. Mr. Choi is...

420
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,950
a legendary guitarist who destroyed everyone in the rock music scene.

421
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,510
 Wow! 

422
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,780
Legendary, my foot.

423
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,160
It's all in the past. All in the past.

424
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,340
Oh, Mr. Choi. He's pretty good.

425
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,000
I was shocked when I first heard him playing.

426
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,850
Because he sounded like Mr. Choi.

427
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,190
Really? Could you play for me sometime?

428
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,990
No, Hyeon Yool exaggerated.

429
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:56,270
Would I have the chance to hear you play sometime?

430
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,400
I only sand guitars now.

431
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,440
I can't play because my fingers got stiff.

432
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,660
 Is he really the helper Master mentioned? 

433
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:08,400
 If he is, how would he help me? 

434
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,900
 Practice room? Advice as a musician? 

435
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,870
 That's not what I was hoping for. 

436
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:19,370
Anyway, he should be here soon.

437
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,600
Is someone else coming?

438
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,000
I wanted to introduce you to someone.

439
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,620
He could be like a helper who'd always support you.

440
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,420
 Helper? 

441
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,390
 Who's that helper? 

442
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,990
You must've heard of him.

443
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:55,430
A rare guitar genius from Chuncheon.

444
00:34:55,430 --> 00:35:00,390
Yoon. Dong. Jin.

445
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,320
Welcome, Dong Jin.

446
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,710
Wow, long time no see, Hyungnim.

447
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,340
- Hyungnim. Hyungnim. Hello. 
 - Hello.

448
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,500
Have a seat first. Have a seat.

449
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,230
You can sit here. Sit here.

450
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,370
Get us some beer.

451
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,210
- Have you eaten? 
 - Of course, I have. It's getting late.

452
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,760
- I'll just have a beer. 
 - Okay.

453
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,900
Your jaws are about to drop.

454
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,940
Sit down. It's hard to look up since I have a nerd neck.

455
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,440
Let's sit. Let's sit. He has a nerd neck.

456
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,750
How cute.

457
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,760
So you're in a school band?

458
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,790
 Yes. 

459
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,970
Who's the frontman?

460
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,960
- Him. 
 - Him.

461
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,380
Go.

462
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,550
Go, go, go, go.

463
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,550
Hey, hey, hey.

464
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,110
What? Why is Yoon Dong Jin here?

465
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,040
 What? Could Yoon Dong Jin be my helper? 

466
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,950
What? The legend showed up in front of us, but we ran away?

467
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,430
This is all your fault.

468
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,190
If only you didn't lie that day, we wouldn't have been called scammers.

469
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,250
If only you didn't lie that day, we wouldn't have been called scammers.

470
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:28,090
Hold on. Us hiding won't do anything.

471
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,650
Wow, amazing.

472
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,690
Did you hear that, Hyungnim?

473
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,060
He said he would've bathed first if he knew.

474
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,500
He's so happy.

475
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,630
- Hyungnim, can I hold your hand? 
 - Sure.

476
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,690
You were like a mythical creature, like

477
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,120
a dragon or a unicorn to me.

478
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,770
Thank you so much for coming all the way here.

479
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,970
I want to be your magic pearl.

480
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,200
Bite me whenever you're bored.

481
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,150
I want to be your horn. Lay your hand on me just once.

482
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,360
Okay, okay, okay.

483
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,440
Well, practice hard and...

484
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,100
call me anytime you need advice on music.

485
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,920
Hyungnim, since we're on topic,

486
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,260
would you be able to perform at our school festival?

487
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,420
Just once.

488
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,830
Hey, no, no...

489
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:28,820
I really dislike the combination of high schoolers, bands, and festivals.

490
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,400
- Why? 
 - Recently...

491
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,970
he was scammed by a high school band.

492
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,000
Which sons of bitches did that to you?

493
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
What do they look like? I'll find them and destroy their faces.

494
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,150
- Student Kang Hyeon Yool. 
 - Yes? It's me.

495
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,020
You got a call. Answer it.

496
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,290
Who's that?

497
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:50,320
Hyungnim, excuse me for a second.

498
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,530
Kang Hyeon Yool?

499
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,090
Listen to me carefully.

500
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,790
Yoon Dong Jin can never know who we really are. Never.

501
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,410
Are you out of your mind, punk?

502
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:09,100
Hey, we should be charming him right now. What BS—

503
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,790
So which school do you go to?

504
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,950
- Baegwang High School. 
 - Baegwang High School.

505
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,890
Oh. Baegwang High School?

506
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,810
Your band name is...

507
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,700
Yes, we're Cheotsa...
  (Cheotsarang Gieok Jojakdan = Fake First Love Memory-Makers) 

508
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,320
We're Cheotsap Band. Cheotsap Band.

509
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,900
Cheotsap?

510
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,100
Sap, as in a shovel?

511
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,760
- No, it's— 
 - Yes, you're right.

512
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,470
It means we should scoop the first shovel well.

513
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,260
By the way, we're so sorry.

514
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,880
Something urgent came up for us.

515
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,400
We need to go now.

516
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,810
I'm sorry.

517
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,020
Get out.

518
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,150
The band has the word "fake" in it. I should've known.

519
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,470
I could've become the dragon's magic pearl.

520
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:16,110
I could've become the unicorn's horn.

521
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,610
 We're done for now. 

522
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,550
Now that it's come to this, let's change the band name.

523
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,400
 Seriously... 

524
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,470
They say crisis brings an opportunity.

525
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:30,600
Let's have a new start in a new space with a new name.

526
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,680
Good god, you little!

527
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,010
It's too late.

528
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:37,700
I already registered us under Fake First Love Memory-Makers for the festival.

529
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,200
I believe in your negotiation skills.

530
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,150
How about the band T-shirts we got made?

531
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,120
We can remake them.

532
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,550
And the posters and pamphlets with our name on them?

533
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,780
We can remake them, too.

534
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,050
We have no time right now!

535
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:51,020
When will we design them and get them made?

536
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,240
And Bal San is taking exams right now. We can't ask him to design them.

537
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,890
We have a capable designer named Yoon Cheong Ah.

538
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,390
And we have a capable photographer named Choi Se Kyeong, too.

539
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,580
How about money? Will you steal it?

540
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,350
I got paid in advance for tutoring.

541
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,250
See? If you push a wall, it becomes a bridge.

542
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,480
There's always a hidden treasure where you fall.

543
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,170
My grandma always tells me that.

544
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,700
Gosh, you get your energy back so quickly.

545
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,450
So, what would be our band name?

546
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:32,490
Each of us should come up with one until our next practice.

547
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,750
Instead, we'll think carefully

548
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,000
and decide by majority?

549
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,320
Whatever.

550
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,500
Okay, deal!

551
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,110
Who will talk to the designer and the photographer, then?

552
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,440
Eun Gyeol can talk to Cheong Ah since they live together.

553
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,120
- And for Choi Se Kyeong... 
  - Rock, paper, scissors! 

554
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,250
 Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! 

555
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,040
Yes!

556
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,670
   
 (For panic disorders) 

557
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,100
What are you doing here at this hour?

558
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,310
I'm here to deliver a message. Don't say I'm cheating.

559
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,480
- Deliver it, then. 
 - Firstly, you're our band photographer. Congrats.

560
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,490
Secondly, we'll change our band name. Keep that in mind.

561
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,740
Thirdly, we'll have a branding meeting in the practice room this Saturday.

562
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,510
Don't forget and don't be late. The end. Bye.

563
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,640
Are you sick?

564
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,150
You...

565
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,160
look pale.

566
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,800
I'm not pale.

567
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,640
I'm just pure.

568
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,230
You have princess syndrome. Bye.

569
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,000
Hey...

570
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,100
Do you have a moment?

571
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:41,090
That bastard. Does he practice rock, paper, scissors all the time?

572
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:44,730
So annoying. He's good at everything. Shit.

573
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,230
   

574
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,430
   

575
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:57,540
 But we can still be friends. 

576
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,400
   

577
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,130
- Hello. 
 - You came.

578
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,730
- Yes. 
- I haven't gotten the new Slam Dunk yet.

579
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,430
Well, not that. Do you have any sign language textbooks?

580
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,290
S-Sign language textbook?

581
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:21,090
Yes. There must be a few in the bookshelf in the back.

582
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:23,110
I'll go check.

583
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,460
Is it a trend these days?

584
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,730
Where are we going?

585
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,390
Where are we going?

586
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,610
   

587
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:01,220
Hey, I know life is hard. But you can't drink or smoke.

588
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,910
What are you saying? I'm getting money exchanged.

589
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,730
- Getting what exchanged? 
 - Follow me.

590
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,300
Hey.

591
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,580
Come on, it's not fake.

592
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,330
I'll only deal with you in the future if you give me a good rate.

593
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:22,510
I have a ton of dollar bills at home.

594
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,300
- I'm giving you a good rate because you're pretty. 
 - Thank you.

595
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,970
Cello Goddess, my foot.

596
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:40,200
You're a pro. A pro.

597
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,250
Why did you bring me here, anyway?

598
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,860
You're my insurance.

599
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,370
Don't you mean a shield?

600
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:48,410
If a young girl goes to a place like this with money alone,

601
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,560
in the worst case, you end up one way or another.

602
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,550
You either get scammed, or something bad happens to you.

603
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:58,040
But it was my mistake to bring someone like you who can't even swear as a bodyguard.

604
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,640
You know how to flatter someone.

605
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,080
I came all the way here for you.

606
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:07,070
"Hey, I know life is hard. But you can't drink or smoke."

607
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,410
What are you, a geezer?

608
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,920
And when that lady was giving me a bad rate, you were like...

609
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,440
"Yes. Yes."

610
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,540
Are you stupid?

611
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,620
- I'll learn how to swear. 
 - Forget it.

612
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,340
I found a dealer. I can come alone from now on.

613
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,660
You'd come here again?

614
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,240
I told you. I have a lot of dollars at home.

615
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,050
Where did you get so many dollars?

616
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:27,590
I sold my cello. Because I'd rather die than play it.

617
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:28,610
You did, too?

618
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,180
"You did, too?"

619
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,350
What did you sell?

620
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,230
I sold my guitar. Where did you sell yours?

621
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,490
An instrument shop.

622
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:37,920
 By chance, is she my helper? 

623
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,460
Where was the shop? Was it in front of Hongdae—

624
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,640
Where was the shop? Was it in front of Hongdae—

625
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,950
No. I sold it in the US.

626
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:45,700
At a classic instrument shop.

627
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,130
You can go now. Thank you for today.

628
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,270
Although you weren't very useful.

629
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:53,950
Where are you going? Aren't you going home?

630
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:56,400
Where are you going now?

631
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,500
When I sold the cello, the shop owner said I should go on a trip first if I'm going to die.

632
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,670
I didn't think it was a bad suggestion.

633
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,090
There was a place I've always wanted to go alone.

634
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:08,660
Are you happy? Bye.

635
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,700
   

636
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,480
 How about this painting for the band T-shirt? 

637
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,310
My gosh. You have already thought about it.

638
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:49,950
You want this on a T-shirt?

639
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:57,410
 It's a painting by Frida Kahlo. 

640
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:59,960
 She's my favorite artist. 

641
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,480
I see.

642
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,810
Well...

643
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,830
Why do you like her?

644
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:11,090
 Because she's strong. 

645
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:12,600
Huh?

646
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,930
 She found beauty in pain 

647
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,220
 and she was strong until the end. 

648
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,780
 Her life tormented her endlessly, 

649
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,100
 but she said, "Screw it" with this one painting. 

650
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,960
With a painting of watermelons? How?

651
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,020
 Look for it. 

652
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,520
 It's hiding inside the painting. 

653
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,400
Inside the painting?

654
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:52,900
♫  It kept me up at night and tormented me all alone in an empty room  ♫

655
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,380
♫  Waiting for the morning  ♫

656
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,190
What could it be?

657
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,740
"Viva la vida."

658
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,020
What does that mean?

659
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:19,020
 Long live life. 

660
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,560
♫  You're my love  ♫

661
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:33,700
♫  You came into my life where I was left behind  ♫

662
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:37,110
The opposite direction?

663
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,150
Like this? I'm sorry.

664
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:49,580
 One day, after a long time had passed, Dad told me 

665
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:54,840
 that he could endure life because of that phrase Mom taught him. 

666
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,820
 Whenever he's happy or in pain, 

667
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,290
 he remembered that phrase like a song. 

668
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,620
You wanted to come to a double feature?

669
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,080
Is this where you wanted to come alone?

670
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,540
Well, I just...

671
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,740
There wasn't a place like this where I used to live.

672
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,660
I was curious.

673
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,880
Don't think about doing that.

674
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,910
Doing what?

675
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:39,120
Dying, I mean.

676
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,020
Did you really come to Korea to die?

677
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,260
But you won't die.

678
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,930
You'll have a disobedient daughter like you and live well.

679
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:06,340
You'll age very beautifully, elegantly, and stylishly.

680
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,250
And...

681
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,510
you change a boy's destiny.

682
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:13,380
How do you know that?

683
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,300
I saw it in the future.

684
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,390
Everyone just lives.

685
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:25,300
By justifying,

686
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,240
finding meaning,

687
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,130
and hanging in there mentally.

688
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:35,040
You don't have to try too hard to be impressive.

689
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,720
Surviving itself is already impressive.

690
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:43,270
And you never know.

691
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,350
Aren't you curious?

692
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:49,830
You don't know what fortune awaits on the other side of the lottery ticket.

693
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,640
You don't know what story will unfold.

694
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:56,490
So...

695
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,000
you should live until the festival.

696
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,840
Why until the festival?

697
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,760
Because...

698
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,270
I'll be really cool that day.

699
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,880
Wow, you're so ridiculous.

700
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,540
You're so shameless.

701
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,760
 Because he was grateful when he was happy. 

702
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,650
 And to curse when he was in pain. 

703
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,340
 Sometimes, it was like a prayer of thanks. 

704
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,780
 I got a fax machine!!! 
   

705
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,540
 Sometimes, it was like a magic spell to get rid of a curse. 

706
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,660
 Viva la vida. 

707
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,380
 Let's talk often going forward. 

708
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,580
 With a smile, he told me he used to say this to the world. 

709
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:32,880
 Viva la vida. 

710
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,490
 Long live life. 

711
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:39,030
 Subak? 
 (Watermelon in Korean) 

712
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,320
That fruit with green skin and red flesh?

713
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,970
- Yes. 
 - No way. You're kidding. Right?

714
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,740
No. I'm serious.

715
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,220
Are you crazy?

716
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,560
So you want to name our band "Subak"?

717
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,130
Okay, listen.

718
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:56,850
There was an artist lady named Frida Kahlo. She had a unibrow and lived in Mexico.

719
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,050
The last painting she did was of watermelons.

720
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,220
And it says a very cool phrase on it.

721
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,750
What is it?

722
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,070
Viva la vida.

723
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:07,040
- Long live life! 
 - Long live life.

724
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,810
Huh? How did you know?

725
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,170
I approve.

726
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:12,740
I approve, no matter what.

727
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:15,020
- I approve. 100%. 
 - Approve? You bastard.

728
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,900
Hey, there's "viva" and "la vida," too.

729
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,850
How slow do you have to be?

730
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:21,930
Why are you into the watermelon part?

731
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:24,180
Might as well go with Cheotsap Band.

732
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,120
Subak is not bad.

733
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,110
Look.

734
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:31,520
"Oppa, why is your band name Subak?"

735
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:37,110
"The thing is, there was a painter named Frida Kahlo. Blah-blah."

736
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:40,820
"It means 'Long live life.' Blahblah."

737
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,860
- That's so cool. 
 - That's what I'm saying.

738
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,290
Right?

739
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,370
So should we go with it?

740
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:47,690
 Go! 

741
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,260
Yes!

742
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,330
What do you guys want?

743
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,090
Let's call it in English instead.

744
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,280
This is my last bit of pride.

745
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,360
Subak is...

746
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,060
just too embarrassing.

747
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,440
Watermelon?

748
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,000
Oh. I like that.

749
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,230
Are you in, too?

750
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:07,920
Put a lot of sugar on it.

751
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,120
So we get a lot of girls.

752
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,470
Watermelon Sugar?

753
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:16,020
I like it. Deal?

754
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,420
 Go! 

755
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:21,230
Geez. Hey, is that the best you can do?

756
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,820
Go!

757
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:28,720

Let's work hard together going forward.

792
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:53,090
 To be honest, I'm not very good at sign language. 

793
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:56,270
 I'm studying hard at the moment.

Oh, I didn't know.

795

00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:47,690
Nothing.

807
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,240
Only one. 
    

808
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,650
We disbanded pretty soon.

809
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:55,200
One of our members got into big trouble.

810
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,100
Thanks to him, the festival performance was canceled, and the band just disappeared.

811
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,580
The only thing that lasted was my relationship with Oh Ma Joo.

812
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:07,590
It must've been a serious accident if the band got disbanded.

813
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:10,680
It was serious.

814
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:15,430
One of the members got seriously injured because of that.

815
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:23,400
♫  These shining moments  ♫

816
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:31,330
♫  I can give them all to you  ♫

817
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:38,370
♫  Our little dreams  ♫

818
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:47,350
♫  I'll protect you so you don't let go  ♫

819
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:52,440
   

820
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,070
 Dad's accident is happening tomorrow on the rehearsal day. 

821
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:57,350
 Gather around for a second. We got the rehearsal schedule. 

822
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:58,860
 Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. 

823
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,890
 That bastard. Who the heck is he? 

824
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:02,630
 Okay. I'll help. 

825
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,760
 What's going to happen tomorrow? 

826
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,180
 Who's causing the accident? Please! 

827
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,100
 You controlled me hiding behind Se Kyeong? 

828
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,810
 Why are you going this far? 

829
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:13,800
 No matter how much I beg you, you won't listen. 

830
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,680
 I know your future and figured out how to change your life. 

831
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,200
 I'll start telling you the result of betraying me.
