00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,280
   

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,110
   

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,970
   

4
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,840
   

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,780
   

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,300
   

7
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,070
   

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,150
   

9
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,360
One. Two.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,640
One. Two. Three. Four.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,270
   
   

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:59,080


13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:08,930
♫  Watching the red sunset reminds me of your sad face  ♫

14
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,640
♫  I look down. The tears are coming down  ♫

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,200
♫  Although I can't say anything  ♫

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,710
♫  I love you  ♫

17
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,250
♫  You mean the world to me  ♫

18
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,060
♫  I scream at the top of my lungs  ♫

19
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,980
♫  But the sunset is firing up without an answer  ♫

20
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,560
♫  I love you, Ha Eun Gyeol!  ♫

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,260
♫  You mean the world to me, Ha Eun Gyeol!  ♫

22
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,890
♫  I scream at the top of my lungs  ♫

23
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,840
♫  But the sunset is firing up without an answer  ♫

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,050
   

25
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,650
Welcome, Ha Eun Gyeol.

26
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,120
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,270
How did you know I was here?

28
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,410
Se Kyeong told me.

29
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,130
Ha Eun Gyeol.

30
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,300
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,760
I'll work hard from now on.

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,850
For the band, my studies, and all the promises I made with you.

33
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,260
It might feel like pouring water into a broken vessel,

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,040
but I'll try my best...

35
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,100
so it doesn't leak and gets filled up.

36
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,510
So come back.

37
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,380
You're the only guitarist for Fake First Love Memory-Makers.

38
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,140
- Okay, let's do it. 
 - Really?

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,540
You mean it, right? You can't back out. Okay?

40
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,630
Instead...

41
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,120
Instead? Instead what?

42
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,040
Tell me anything. I'll do anything for you.

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,520
I don't want you to see Choi Se Kyeong.

44
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,080
What?

45
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,380
Otherwise, we can't work together.

46
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,210
Because...

47
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,120
Because?

48
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,840
Because I like Choi Se Kyeong.

49
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,220
Make a choice. Is it me or Choi Se Kyeong?

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,600
   

51
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,750
Answer me right now.

52
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,590
No.

53
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,320
N-No?

54
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,420
That's right.

55
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,380
I don't want to, you bastard.

56
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,490
What will you do about it?

57
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,060
What did you just say?

58
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,250
Make a choice about what?

59
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,980
Don't see who?

60
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,630
You like who?

61
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,190
Hey, let go. Let go!

62
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,960
I provided clothes, food, and lodging since you had nowhere to go.

63
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,700
And you're betraying me like this?

64
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,940
Hey, how could you do this to me?

65
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,460
How could you do this?

66
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,070
Did you feed me? Your grandma did!

67
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,670
- What did you say, punk? 
 - I did it all for you.

68
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,640
I did it all for you, I said!

69
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,060
Okay, okay. It's okay, Bal San.

70
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay, okay.

71
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,630
It's really okay.

72
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,270
Hey!

73
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,630
You screw me over and do this to me?

74
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,760
- You shit all over! Is this a joke? 
 - Hey, hey, let go!

75
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,930
Let go of me!

76
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,070
Lee Chan, are you okay?

77
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,090
Are you badly hurt?

78
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,960
 What? Hey, your nose is bleeding. Your nose is bleeding. 

79
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,390
Lee Chan! Are you okay?

80
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,040
Your nose is bleeding. My gosh.

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,960
- Does it hurt a lot? 
 - Shit.

82
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,570
You think I'm okay, you bastard?

83
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,940
♫  I trusted my friend as much as I trusted you  ♫

84
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,510
♫  So I introduced you to him without any worries  ♫

85
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,990
♫  Since we met then, we started hanging out  ♫

86
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,440
♫  I thought we were just having a good time together  ♫

87
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,960
♫  I don't know where things started going awry  ♫

88
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,380
♫  When I was starting to have bad feelings  ♫

89
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,920
♫  You started showing more interest in my friend  ♫

90
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,100
Please stop, I said!

91
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,630
It's Choi Se Kyeong!

92
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,920
♫  Since the day we had a big fight  ♫

93
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:39,470
♫  You and my friend stopped talking to me and seem to be avoiding me  ♫

94
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:46,800
♫  That's when I realized that everything was wrong  ♫

95
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,490
Hey, get in, get in, get in.

96
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,860
- Hey, where are you going? 
 - Hey, hurry up!

97
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,350
We should put an end to this!

98
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,930
Hurry up! Hurry!

99
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,440
Hurry.

100
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,740
Gosh, look who's here.

101
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,070
It's the criminal I know.

102
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,760
Shit, my looks can't be camouflaged like this.

103
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,480
Hey, stop right there!

104
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,490
Hey.

105
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,390
Hop in!

106
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,640
Come here. Hey.

107
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,710
Hold on.

108
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,110
Hey, stop right there!

109
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,280
   

110
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,050
These punks.

111
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,610
Hey.

112
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,430
Where...

113
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,500
Are you okay?

114
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
What's with you?

115
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,010
What are you doing right now?

116
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,440
I thought you were in a bind and couldn't get caught at school.

117
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,220
- I was just trying to help— 
 - Not that.

118
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,020
Not that?

119
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,480
I'm sorry about earlier.

120
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,500
I shouldn't have confessed my love publicly like that.

121
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,980
I apologize for that.

122
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,280
That's considered a kind of assault. You know that?

123
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,520
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,760
Okay. And?

125
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,680
- Is there something else? 
 - Oh?

126
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,520
The fact that I said I like you?

127
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,950
Yes, that. You don't like me at all.

128
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,480
Are you kidding me? You like Lee Chan.

129
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,980
- How many times did I say I don't? 
 - Shut up.

130
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,920
You put your guard up so you don't get outed.

131
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,690
You used me, so you don't have to come out.

132
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,470
I'm your camouflage. Your airbag.

133
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,770
You lied, using me as a bulletproof vest.

134
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,420
 She has a way with her words. 

135
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,940
 Ahjumma was ahead of her time. 

136
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,960
Now, do you know what you did?

137
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,200
 Mission start. 

138
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,890
I wasn't lying. I meant it. I really like you a lot.

139
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,510
If you're okay with it, I hope you like me, too. A lot.

140
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,870
 What's this? It feels like I'm talking to an AI. 

141
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,250
 What's this? It feels like she's doing an endoscopy with her eyes. 

142
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,960
 Did I get caught? 

143
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,290
I'll give you three seconds.

144
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,580
Describe why you like me and when you started to like me in three seconds.

145
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,520
A descriptive answer worth 10 points.

146
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,550
You'd better give an answer as wise as Solomon's if you don't want to die.

147
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,020
- One. 
  - I'm in trouble. 

148
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,440
 What should I say? 

149
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,010
- Two. 
  - She looks bloodthirsty. 

150
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,120
 I might die if I say the wrong thing. 

151
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,930
- Three. 
 - The moment I saw you, it was like fate...

152
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,140
I thought you were so pretty.

153
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,670
 I'm screwed. That couldn't have worked. 

154
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,880
- Mission clear. 
  - What? That worked? 

155
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,490
You, punk.

156
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,930
You're really into me, aren't you?

157
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,970
 What? Why is it so easy? 

158
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,980
 Is she really supposed to be the goddess? 

159
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,840
My goodness.

160
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,890
All right. There you were.

161
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,620
You little bastards. Seriously...

162
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,330
How am I supposed to accept this situation?

163
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,170
On the first day you transferred,

164
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,280
you got a student from another school involved in a fight over a girl.

165
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,160
And you were supposed to be studying abroad.

166
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,670
But why are you standing here with the problematic male student?

167
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,490
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

168
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,000
Do you two know each other?

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,890
- No. 
 - Yes.

170
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,060
- Yes. 
 - No.

171
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,690
 (Get it straight!) 

172
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,220
Are you having fun?

173
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,360
Do you think this is a joke?

174
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,630
The bell rang. Go to your classrooms for now.

175
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:14,640
You'll be punished according to the disciplinary committee's decision. I warned you.

176
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,420
Okay.

177
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,800
Se Kyeong, you should stay.

178
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,050
I'm sorry. I'm late.

179
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,770
Cheong Ah.

180
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,000
What's going on?

181
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,460
- What's going on? 
 - Was it a love triangle?

182
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,630
So, you started hearing ringing noises in your ears.

183
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,950
The doctor in the US said it was due to the long flight,

184
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,250
but you came back on your own to take thorough tests?

185
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,020
Yes. You know how my mom can be.

186
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,760
She worries about every little thing about you, whether it rains or wind blows.

187
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,500
Yes, that's it.

188
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,710
No one can fight her stubbornness. No one.

189
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,770
But why did someone like her send you back alone?

190
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,410
Well, because I have an uncle.

191
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,980
I came back to take tests at his hospital.

192
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,900
Is that so?

193
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,630
I'm glad you're in someone's care.

194
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,200
Yes.

195
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,020
Drink some.

196
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,970
 Geez, is she a profiler or something? 

197
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,840
 She's making me so nervous. 

198
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,580
Are you delaying your study abroad, then?

199
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,120
No. I just need to pass the language course

200
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,500
and go back when the master class starts.

201
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,590
Don't be disappointed.

202
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,920
It's not because I doubt you.

203
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,720
I'm just trying to do my job well.

204
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,600
Wait! Are you going to call her?

205
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,380
She can't answer the phone because she's currently traveling in Canada.

206
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,880
Go drink your tea.

207
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,080
 I'm in trouble. What if Mom answers? 

208
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,000
 Our family is travelling in Canada right now. 

209
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,170
 - Yes! My memory is praiseworthy. 
 - Please leave a message. 

210
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,250
I'll talk to her when she returns from the trip.

211
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,590
I'll arrange it, so you can attend school here until you leave.

212
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,730
Pardon? Why do I have to go to school again...

213
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,000
- That won't be necessary— 
 - Are you...

214
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,980
really Choi Se Kyeong?

215
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,490
Pardon?

216
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,260
What do you mean...

217
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,790
Unless you're an ordinary kid who's fine with wasting her youth away,

218
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:00,500
I thought the Choi Se Kyeong I knew would be on the same page as me.

219
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,460
Didn't you come to school because of that, too?

220
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,880
Bingo! You're really the best.

221
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,380
I'm on the same page as you.

222
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,900
Geez, why do I have to go to school even in the year 1995?

223
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,870
Cheong Ah, don't be mad. Please?

224
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,890
Why don't you just hit me?

225
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,040
Hit me as much as you're angry.

226
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,110
Feel free to hit me until you feel better.

227
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,540
Please forgive me just once. Please.

228
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,930
Please. Just this once.

229
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,370
Who is he, exactly?

230
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,030
Did he really confess his love for me in front of the whole school?

231
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,620
Feel better.

232
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,140
Please. Cheong Ah, just this once.

233
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,260
Get back in position.

234
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,910
How dare you barge in there?

235
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,480
Did you go there to insult our school?

236
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,690
If your life sucks, just live quietly.

237
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:28,180
Why do you have to go around everywhere like you're loaches, punks!

238
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,950
You're the problem. You are.

239
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:36,240
What? You don't care because you gave up on going to college?

240
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,680
Are you fearless since you have no parents to care for you?

241
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,970
Wow, look at you.

242
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,100
Get back down immediately.

243
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,420
You little. I need to teach you—

244
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,380
Sir, seriously...

245
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,860
Doesn't your right arm hurt?

246
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,820
I've been worrying about it all this time.

247
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,180
I'll change my position like this.

248
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,760
Use your left arm.

249
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,410
I love you!

250
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,060
I guess I hit you from one angle too much. Thank you, bastard!

251
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,150
Is it my part yet?

252
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,600
Whoa! You're emitting dark energy.

253
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,420
What is it? Because you feel betrayed?

254
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,390
Or is it because you got dumped?

255
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,070
I've never been betrayed by Se Kyeong.

256
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,040
Therefore, she didn't dump me, either.

257
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,220
I didn't say it was because of Choi Se Kyeong.

258
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,950
You must've been betrayed and dumped by Ha Eun Gyeol.

259
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,250
Do you want to die?

260
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,900
But wasn't it kind of weird? Ha Eun Gyeol, I mean.

261
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,910
Shut your mouth.

262
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,660
He was insulting you with his mouth,

263
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,630
but his eyes said he was on your side.

264
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,120
 I did it all for you. 

265
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,140
 I did it all for you, I said! 

266
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,190
Anyway, make up your mind between Choi Se Kyeong and Ha Eun Gyeol.

267
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:14,630
By the way, if Ha Eun Gyeol leaves, I'll leave, too.

268
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,280
What?

269
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,970
♪  Now I know what it feels like to be alone  ♪

270
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,110
♪  I was mistaken  ♪

271
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,030
♪  Can you feel it?  ♪

272
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:33,480
♪  The beginning of love is the end of loneliness  ♪

273
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,200
♪  Now I know  ♪

274
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,980
Cheong Ah. Yoon Cheong Ah!

275
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,280
Why do you keep acting like this?

276
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,820
Why are you like this?

277
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,220
Tell me what I did wrong—

278
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,480
Cheong Ah.

279
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,040
Cheong Ah. Yoon Cheong Ah.

280
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,530
You have serious separation anxiety.

281
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,500
Bark! Bark! Are you a dog? Do you like all humans?

282
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
You don't care if it's a man or a woman?

283
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,580
I think you're mistaken. Cheong Ah and I aren't like that—

284
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,730
Of course not.

285
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,510
Follow me. We need to go somewhere.

286
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,850
I'm sorry, but I have a bit of a situation today.

287
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,690
Is that so? I should go see Lee Chan, then.

288
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,410
Lee Chan?

289
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,060
Hey.

290
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,780
Why are you so obsessed with feeding this to me?

291
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,770
You said you like me.

292
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,450
What does that have to do with this capsaicin-rich thing?

293
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,180
Did I ask you to get me a star? Did I insist on getting buried with you?

294
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,240
You can't even eat some pig trotters with me?

295
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,460
What? Don't you want it?

296
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,030
You can't eat it because it's too spicy?

297
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,400
How would you like me to eat it?

298
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,420
What?

299
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,250
You said your life depends on this, and it's important.

300
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,540
I can tell you aren't just joking.

301
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,450
I can't ignore someone's desperate situation because it looks trivial to me.

302
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,160
I know what it's like to be in a situation you can't talk about.

303
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,720
How would you like me to eat it?

304
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,430
Do you want me to eat it well or not be able to eat it?

305
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,860
I'll try my best to do what you want.

306
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,400
Eat it well.

307
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,430
That's not what I meant. Not be able...

308
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,790
No, I mean... Eat well... No...

309
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,790
Dang it. I don't know. Do whatever you want.

310
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,530
Okay. I'll do whatever I want.

311
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,360
Hold it!

312
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,800
Don't...

313
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,550
Don't eat it just yet. Okay?

314
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,290
Ma'am, we'll have this to go. To go.

315
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,760
Excuse me.

316
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,900
What? What is it? What?

317
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,530
When can I hear your answer, by the way?

318
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,930
Answer?

319
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,920
What answer?

320
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,870
The answer to my confession.

321
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,750
I'd like to know what you think of me.

322
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,990
There used to be a handsome and cute puppy in my neighborhood.

323
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,990
It was a mix between Shiba Inu and Siberian Husky. 
    

324
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,950
And? 
    

325
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,230
He looked like you.

326
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,410
What do you mean by that?

327
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,240
Do you mean I'm cute or handsome—

328
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,830
Shiba-sky. 
  (Sounds like a swear word in Korean) 

329
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:46,360
- Shiba? 
 - You're no more or less than Shiba-sky.

330
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,150
So just wait.

331
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,430
Until I decide if I'll give you a treat or not.

332
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,420
This is too difficult.

333
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,850
I have no idea what she's saying.

334
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,930
Shiba-sky? Did she swear at me?

335
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,220
What's with you, On Eun Yoo?

336
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,540
Why did you hesitate instead of just checking that...

337
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,010
But wait. Isn't spice tolerance relative?

338
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,740
Who sets the standard? How tolerant are you supposed to be?

339
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,420
Shouldn't I include Hyeon Yool, who ate the spicy chicken feet like nothing, then?

340
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,890
Gosh, seriously. Why did Mom give me such a sucky hint?

341
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,240
Gosh.

342
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,740
 I was sure it was him then. 

343
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,990
- When? 
  - During the spring festival. 

344
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,270
 He serenaded me on stage that day. 

345
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,240
 I heard you guys ask whether you were struck by someone or he grew on you these days. 

346
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,600
 I think he grew on me. 

347
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,630
 Slowly, like getting wet in light rain. 

348
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,220
 And it struck me that day. 

349
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,850
 I thought, "I like this person. 

350
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,710
 Or maybe I've been liking him this whole time. 

351
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,050
 There must be no way out anymore." 

352
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,410
 It was kind of like getting struck by lightning. 

353
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,450
Yes. I wasn't being swayed by Ha Eun Gyeol.

354
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,510
A more clear clue was in my memory.

355
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,380
That's it. Between Ha Lee Chan and Ha Eun Gyeol,

356
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,340
whoever serenades Mom is her first love

357
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,640
and I just need to be open-minded and observe them until then.

358
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,680
I'll be secretive and fair.

359
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,400
Let's start the lesson.

360
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,630
What are you doing? What are you doing?

361
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,820
I just said, "Let's start the lesson." Why are you angry?

362
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,500
Why are both Mom and Dad doing this to me?

363
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,930
What did I do, anyway?

364
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,580
   

365
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,730
   

366
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,230
   

367
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,170
 By chance... 

368
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,750
   

369
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,420
 No way! 

370
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,360
   

371
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,520
   

372
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,540
 Heart symbol? 

373
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,860
By chance...

374
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,440
do you like Ha Lee Chan, Mom?

375
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,580
Hold on, hold on. Let me ask you one thing. Just one thing!

376
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,020
 Mom, I'll ask you just one thing. 

377
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,760
Just this one thing!

378
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,940
Mom had a crush on Dad.

379
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,460
I would've made a different plan if I knew.

380
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,940
I shouldn't have provoked Dad.

381
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,100
It's all ruined.

382
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:21,620
   

383
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,360
You came.

384
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,110
Don't be intimidated and have a seat.

385
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,520
I'm not interested in killing you yet.

386
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:02,470
Why are you opening that? You said it was just a prop to intimidate him.

387
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,450
Geez, it's open.

388
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,490
Are you a choir?

389
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,410
What are you standing there for?

390
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,080
- Sir. 
 - What?

391
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,440
I'll have a large jjajangmyeon.

392
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,540
One large jjajangmyeon? I'm angry.

393
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,500
How annoying.

394
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,440
I've been thinking all night.

395
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,790
All the strange behavior you've been displaying

396
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:14,230
suddenly made sense when you said you like Se Kyeong.

397
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,280
I'm sorry about that.

398
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,340
I'll try to put myself in your socks and—

399
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,590
You mean shoes. Geez...

400
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,760
Shut up.

401
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,000
- I'll stitch up your mouth! 
 - Hey, hey, hey! Sit down.

402
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:35,250
Yes. Socks or shoes, I'll just...

403
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,950
Anyway, I'll make you an offer you can't refuse.

404
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,990
An offer? What offer?

405
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,300
I won't tell you not to see Se Kyeong.

406
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,760
So, you'd better not BS me saying not to see her, either.

407
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,390
Let's call a truce

408
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,390
and just focus on the band until the festival. Deal?

409
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,930
 This is an opportunity. How do I seize it? 

410
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,730
You don't want to? You don't think you can?

411
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,040
- Forget about it, then. 
 - What if we don't see her at all?

412
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,930
Neither of us will see Choi Se Kyeong until the festival. That's fair.

413
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:14,050
Instead, we'll compete with each other on stage.

414
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,430
What do you say?

415
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,220
You don't know how much I improved while you were gone, do you?

416
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,720
Am I the only one out of the loop?

417
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,490
Well, the ball is in Choi Se Kyeong's court already.

418
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,700
She agreed to make a decision after seeing the performance, anyway.

419
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,150
- Lee Chan has nothing to lose. 
 - You heard that. Right?

420
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,980
I'd be sad not seeing her for now,

421
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,630
but you'd be losing a lot. Would you be okay?

422
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,350
Wow, what kind of calculator gives you that kind of answer?

423
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,860
So?

424
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,350
- Deal? 
 - Of course.

425
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,240
Deal!

426
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,590
 He took the bait. 

427
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:03,090
   

428
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,530
As you know, we don't have a lot of time until the festival.

429
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,500
But after the rain, the soil gets more... Whatever. We can do it.

430
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,020
- Let's go. 
 - Let's say "Fighting" together, then.

431
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,220
Why are there only two hands?

432
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,250
Seriously. Hey!

433
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,720
Forget it, then.

434
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,100
I heard you're the resident tutor for the Jinsung family.

435
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,380
Why are you surprised?

436
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,300
Don't you know rumors travel fast?

437
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,950
I've heard about it, too.

438
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,290
So the thing is...

439
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,170
the chairman of Jinsung Instruments is sponsoring me by chance—

440
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,570
Whatever.

441
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:51,300
It's better to get paid more from a rich family and teach a well-behaved student.

442
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,250
Go now. Bye.

443
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,530
Is your grandmother doing well?

444
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,580
Goodness, goodness. Welcome, Teacher.

445
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,920
Goodness, I missed you.

446
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,690
Welcome, sir.

447
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,380
Have you been doing well?

448
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,780
I have, thanks to you.

449
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,800
Come on. You should've told me he was coming.

450
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,150
I didn't make enough food. Not enough at all.

451
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,220
He lived with us until recently. You don't have to prove your cooking skills.

452
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:27,580
You didn't even give me a chance to do that. Gosh...

453
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,740
Go inside. Go inside. Hurry in.

454
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,510
My, my, my. Take me inside, too!

455
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:35,540
 It tastes pretty good. 

456
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,850
Goodness.

457
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,260
Gosh, I'm sorry there isn't much food.

458
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,230
That family treats you well, right?

459
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,150
I heard they're very wealthy.

460
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:54,070
No, your food is the tastiest to me.

461
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,250
Gosh, I know you're lying,

462
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,660
but I appreciate it.

463
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,040
Have some. Have some.

464
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,470
Hey, go get some scorched rice water.

465
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,310
Why are we having that before eating?

466
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,700
Just bring it if I said so. Stop arguing.

467
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,040
Have some, have some.

468
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,590
Gosh, seriously.

469
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,670
Don't say silly things for no reason.

470
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,930
And the galbijjim. Leave some for me.

471
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,100
 Did I upset you 

472
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,190
 about something while you were here? 

473
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,220
No, Ma'am! Why do you ask me that? Nothing like that at all.

474
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,710
You treated me so well while I was here.

475
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:43,080
Would you be able...

476
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,590
to tutor Lee Chan again, then?

477
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,990
Gosh, sit comfortably.

478
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,890
You probably don't know,

479
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:59,700
but he's grown up a lot ever since he met you.

480
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:06,000
He quit his part-time job that I used to beg him to quit, which he scoffed at.

481
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,900
He sneaks into the storage room at night

482
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,850
to study math and English, too.

483
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,290
He was trying to impress you, you know.

484
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:23,490
But since you left, he seems to have lost focus.

485
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:28,480
He said he would study for an exam at Ma Joo's house a few days ago

486
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,530
and he didn't even come home.

487
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,750
But gosh, study, my foot.

488
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,920
He came back with a bunch of bruises on his face.

489
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,810
 Did you have to ditch Lee Chan? You bastard. 

490
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,560
 While handing out flyers looking for you, 

491
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,580
 he got punched in the face, cracked his head, and was hospitalized. 

492
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,040
I couldn't even ask him if he had a fight or something.

493
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,340
I didn't want him to end up like his dad.

494
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,360
What about his father?

495
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,460
His father got into gambling

496
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,250
and he swung his fists at me,

497
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,030
demanding money all the time.

498
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,770
 So, please, 

499
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,010
 teach Lee Chan again, Teacher. 

500
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,130
I can't pay you as much as that family, but I won't disappoint you.

501
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,770
Ma'am, I don't live there because they pay me a lot.

502
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,180
Why do you, then...

503
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,910
There's something I have to do there.

504
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,580
But it's good for Lee Chan as well.

505
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:47,490
Instead, I promise I'll come back when I'm done there.

506
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,930
Go inside. I can go alone.

507
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,350
Let's just go quietly.

508
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,650
Grandma will yell at me, otherwise.

509
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,980
Huh? Someone fixed this.

510
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,760
Wait for me.

511
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,690
You didn't actually fight someone, right?

512
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,340
They didn't deserve fighting. I didn't.

513
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,260
Se Kyeong said you fought because of me. Is that true?

514
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,950
It wasn't because of you. I just had bad luck.

515
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,300
How about you getting hospitalized?

516
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,860
Were you hiding at Ma Joo's so Grandmother wouldn't worry?

517
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,440
I heard the hospital food is good. So, I stayed briefly.

518
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,290
Were you really hospitalized, then?

519
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,000
How much did you get hurt, anyway?

520
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,810
Gosh, why are you overreacting so much?

521
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,190
I'm fine, as you can see.

522
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,700
How about your ears? Did you hurt your ears? Can you hear well?

523
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,900
I hear so well. It's too noisy, in fact.

524
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,600
Geez. Why did you disappear if you were so worried?

525
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,940
Anyway.

526
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,080
Thank Yoon Cheong Ah for me when you get home.

527
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,240
You know her?

528
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,390
Not well. I think she's Se Kyeong's friend.

529
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,260
Anyway, thank her for me.

530
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,840
She saved my life.

531
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,790
Cheong Ah saved your life? How?

532
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,600
Ask her yourself.

533
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,360
I don't remember.

534
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,060
I went to her house to thank her and ask her about it, but they wouldn't let me in.

535
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:20,220
How did you know she saved your life, then?

536
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,610
Se Kyeong told me.

537
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,870
It's Ma Joo. See you then.

538
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:28,570
You can come with me and thank Cheong Ah yourself—

539
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,520
Later. He said, "Hurry."

540
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,800
We're rearranging the tracklist. Bye.

541
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,620
You're dead if you're late to practice.

542
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,900
You're dead if you see Se Kyeong behind my back, too.

543
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,820
Whether we made a deal or not, we're finished, then. You know. Right?

544
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,780
 Dad got injured because of me. 

545
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:57,210
 As a result, Mom ended up saving his life. 

546
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:00,530
 How did you and Mom first meet? 

547
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:09,260
 At a sign language class at the Association of the Deaf when I was 20. 

548
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,150
 I went to learn sign language 

549
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,910
 and fell in love with her at first sight. 

550
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,350
 Dad didn't know Mom when he was 18. 

551
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,970
 But now he knows her. 

552
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,860
 Mom, who had a crush on him at age 18, 

553
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,490
 has a connection to him now. 

554
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,540
 It's me. 

555
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,630
 I'm the one who connected Mom and Dad when they were 18. 

556
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,810
 And... 

557
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,040
 What if we don't see her at all? 

558
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,730
 Neither of us will see Choi Se Kyeong until the festival. That's fair. 

559
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,520
 Deal! 

560
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,310
 The opportunity came just in time. 

561
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,800
 The obstacle, Choi Se Kyeong, is gone. I can't waste this opportunity. 

562
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,550
 I should set Mom and Dad up before the festival, 

563
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,240
 find out when Dad gets into the accident, 

564
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,350
 and prevent it from happening, no matter what. 

565
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,520
♫  An especially bright, happy day  ♫

566
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,820
♫  My heart is beating, you might hear it  ♫

567
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,190
♫  I don't want anyone but me to know  ♫

568
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,430
♫  You don't know how I feel  ♫

569
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:38,020
♫  I feel weird when I look at you  ♫

570
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:42,190
♫  Did I find the universe I lost?  ♫

571
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:48,260
♫  I'm so curious, the story of you and me  ♫

572
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,730
♫  Today will be different from yesterday  ♫

573
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,180
♫  I'm excited for tomorrow, too  ♫

574
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:01,120
 I'm Choi Se Kyeong, the Cello Goddess of Seowon Arts High School. 

575
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:12,080
♫  Tell me, sometimes, do you feel the way I do?  ♫

576
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:18,420
♫  Tell me it's not just the story I came up with  ♫

577
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,720
♫  I think a sparkling love has finally come to me  ♫

578
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,870
Hold on a moment.

579
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:32,750
♫  You can tell me now that you feel the same way  ♫

580
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,230
♫  The same way, the same way  ♫

581
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,730
Se Kyeong!

582
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,410
Choi Se Kyeong!

583
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,210
Hey.

584
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,250
How could you? I'm so sad!

585
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,360
How could you not even call me when you're back in Korea?

586
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,290
I'm sorry, but who are you—

587
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,920
Who am I?

588
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,160
You really don't know who I am?

589
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,510
 Damn it. I might get caught on my first day. 

590
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,400
 Hey, it's me. Yoon Sang Ah from Seowon Arts High School. 

591
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,490
 Yoon Sang Ah, the daughter of the owner of Jinsung Instruments. 

592
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,420
 I heard you came back to Korea. 

593
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,010
 It was really true. 

594
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,480
 My goodness. Is she your daughter? 

595
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,800
 Hi. 

596
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,010
 She looks exactly like when you were in high school. 

597
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,610
 Shit, that clueless and chatty lady? 

598
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,810
You're making me tear up.

599
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,720
Hey, I was just joking.

600
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,900
How could I not know Yoon Sang Ah, the daughter of Jinsung Instruments?

601
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,950
Have you been well, Sang Ah?

602
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,920
Whatever, girl!

603
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,710
You didn't miss me at all, did you?

604
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,670
You wouldn't write me back, either.

605
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,020
And you didn't even page me when you came back.

606
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,770
You're so coldhearted.

607
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,500
Are we really best friends?

608
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,810
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Time. Time.

609
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,650
You're my best friend? Not Yoon Cheong Ah?

610
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,530
Hey!

611
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,740
 I'll go to the teachers' office real quick. 

612
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,410
 I think I'll get punished for what happened recently. 

613
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,460
 Nothing will happen. Don't worry so much. 

614
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,900
 Don't report everything to me. It's annoying. 

615
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,470
 I know why you're angry. 

616
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,010
 I'll help you. 

617
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,930
 So please stop being angry at me. 

618
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,430
 I'm always on your side. 

619
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,710
What did you want to check with Cheong Ah, anyway?

620
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,640
I'm your best friend, I said.

621
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,610
 What? Why is Choi Se Kyeong at school at this hour? 

622
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,070
Does she also know you're back in school?

623
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:20,290
 What? She's back in school? 

624
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,810
 What do I do? 

625
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,240
 Should I say hi since she saw me? 

626
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,300
 You're dead if you see Se Kyeong behind my back, too. 

627
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,960
 Whether we made a deal or not, we're finished, then. You know, right? 

628
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,690
 I'm sorry, Ahjumma. 

629
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,340
 Forgive me. 

630
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,550
That Shiba-sky.

631
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,480
Hey, stop right there!

632
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,070
You Shiba-sky.

633
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,770
Move! Move!

634
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,070
Hey, Ha Lee Chan.

635
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,940
You won't fall that way.

636
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,310
Hey, there's bad news.

637
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,410
I just checked the voicemail from Yong Joon Gi.

638
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,760
Choi Se Kyeong is back at school starting today.

639
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,430
- So what? 
 - What?

640
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,010
- What? 
 - Yes.

641
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,940
That means she'd see Ha Eun Gyeol at school every day.

642
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,280
Yes! They're apparently chasing each other already.

643
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,100
Ha Eun Gyeol, son of a bitch.

644
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,700
- He knew everything from the beginning. 
 - Hey, where are you going?

645
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,450
I have no other solution.

646
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,900
I just need to become cool.

647
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,840
This means practice is the only way to survive.

648
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,020
Come at me!

649
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,980
What?

650
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,540
What's this?

651
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,300
What are you doing in our room right now?

652
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,590
What are you saying? Didn't the teacher tell you?

653
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:04,410
We're using this room starting today.

654
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,090
 Hello. 

655
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,990
Hold on! Hold on!

656
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,900
Hold on!

657
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,110
Sir, you didn't tell me that last time.

658
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,170
I told you.

659
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,330
It was the disciplinary committee's decision. What can I do?

660
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,540
But you can't take our room away.

661
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,480
You're telling us to disband.

662
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,880
Bingo. I'd be thankful if you do that.

663
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,740
Don't go. No, don't go.

664
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,000
Give us the room back.

665
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,970
You little— Let go of me.

666
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,820
- You'll rip my pants, you bastard! 
 - No, no, no.

667
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,210
The festival is just around the corner. This is unfair.

668
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,500
Just walk over me instead.

669
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,020
Say one more word.

670
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,930
I might not let you perform at the festival.

671
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,780
No!

672
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,580
Please! No!

673
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,310
Gosh, Sir!

674
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,710
Looks like we're not meant to be in a band.

675
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,460
Who the hell is humming?

676
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,260
Gosh.

677
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,000
What can we do?

678
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,100
My motel closed down.

679
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,370
I should find another place to stay.

680
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,580
Are you serious right now?

681
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,590
I can't unfurl my eyebrows listening to you.

682
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:31,070
You should follow me if you guys are interested.

683
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,950
There's always a hidden treasure where you fall.

684
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,220
Let's go find treasure together.

685
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:45,180
 Write a letter of apology and do on-campus volunteer for a week starting today. 

686
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,380
 This is instead of getting suspended. So, be thankful. 

687
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,720
Hey, stop right there!

688
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,700
- Bye. 
 - Hey!

689
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,830
What are you two doing—

690
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,380
   

691
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,310
That little. Hey!

692
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,150
Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol!

693
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,050
Were they slave hunters in their previous lives?

694
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:23,930
They chase each other whenever they make eye contact.

695
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,290
How romantic.

696
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,730
You'd better not get caught.

697
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:33,230
Hey!

698
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,250
- Hey, give me. 
 - You can't do that!

699
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,970
Are you sure it's romantic?

700
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,160
He might get killed if he's caught.

701
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,530
What? What's that now?

702
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,580
Get caught when I'm asking nicely.

703
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,090
I'll kill you if you run again.

704
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,480
Hey!

705
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,110
You claimed me by publically confessing love to me.

706
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:21,200
But now you abandon me by humiliating me?

707
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,180
Am I a virus? Why avoid me? Why run away?

708
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,310
I promised Lee Chan.

709
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:29,450
That neither of us would see you to be fair.

710
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,260
That's why you're avoiding me?

711
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,100
- Until when? 
 - Until the festival.

712
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,650
- When are you allowed to see me? 
 - After the festival.

713
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,280
You bet your lives on the festival, didn't you?

714
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,750
Anyway, keep that in mind and try to cooperate.

715
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,900
Cooperate, my foot.

716
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,580
Am I your toy? How dare you play with me?

717
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,110
- It's not that— 
 - Whatever.

718
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,790
Anyway, it means the ball is in my court. Right?

719
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:56,220
And I can decide how to play with that ball.

720
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,800
How will you play with it?

721
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,310
It's none of your business.

722
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:02,000
Go now. You're free. Hoo!

723
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,680
I have a bad feeling.

724
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,510
I have a bad feeling for some reason.

725
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:20,050
 It's me. Ma Joo. 

726
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,720
You can't tell anyone what I say to you now.

727
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,030
We lost the club room.

728
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,950
 We'll practice in a new room from now on. 

729
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,350
No one else can know the location except for the band members.

730
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:30,680
 To keep it a secret, 

731
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,910
non-members are not allowed. Keep that in mind.

732
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,730
 I said I'll help you. Right? 

733
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:55,210
 You need to come with me somewhere. 

734
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,260
   

735
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,680
 I know I'm cheating, 

736
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,660
 but I have to do this to set up Mom and Dad. 

737
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,810
Seriously, I thought you were Lee Moon Se.

738
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:25,170
Gosh, you're exaggerating.

739
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:28,080
I tried depicting the fiery sunset in a red gradient.

740
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,740
Did you catch that at all?

741
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,250
Totally.

742
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:36,070
I saw the sunset in front of my eyes. I thought there was blood everywhere.

743
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:38,400
Gosh, you're the best.

744
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,480
I'm sorry, Se Kyeong.

745
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,040
I wasted my talent because of someone.

746
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,150
But I'll make sure to serenade you at the festival.

747
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,920
 Serenade me? 

748
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,120
Serenade... Seriously.

749
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:53,840
What's going on right now?

750
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,370
- You came. 
 - Hey.

751
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,880
I thought the location was a secret, and non-members weren't allowed.

752
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,020
You shouldn't be saying that right now.

753
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,450
- Come out. 
 - Gosh, so scary.

754
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,990
If you're guilty, just apologize.

755
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:07,800
Yet you're getting mad at me?

756
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,740
- Come out. 
 - Let go!

757
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,990
I'll go of my own volition...

758
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,670
Go! Go!

759
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,600
Here they go again.

760
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,500
I feel like I'm on a swing bridge every day since I met them.

761
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:28,800
Hi.

762
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,220
 Sign language? 

763
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,820
Hey, are you really going to do this?

764
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,590
You promised not to see her before the festival.

765
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,900
You're a cheater.

766
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,170
You knew Se Kyeong was coming back to school when you said that.

767
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,520
I told you many times that I didn't know.

768
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,310
I jumped through hoops, trying to keep our promise.

769
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:58,640
If you think jumping through hoops is unfair, just join the circus.

770
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,560
Don't try to lie to me shamelessly.

771
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,550
Wow, I'm about to go nuts here.

772
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:06,250
Let's just forget about the promise, then.

773
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,970
Can the frontman break the rule?

774
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:10,780
You said it was a secret. You said no non-members are allowed.

775
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,770
You brought a non-member, too.

776
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:14,240
I didn't bring her for no reason.

777
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,980
I scouted her as an expert on H.M.S.

778
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,520
Bullshit. What's H.M.S.?

779
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,180
Hair. Makeup. Styling.

780
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,480
You think I brought Se Kyeong for no reason?

781
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,400
I scouted her officially, too.

782
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:26,140
She'll be in charge of our posters, pamphlets, and music videos as a photographer.

783
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,060
She'll be in charge of our posters, pamphlets, and music videos as a photographer.

784
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,450
P.P.M.

785
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,600
You just wanted her for yourself. You don't even know if she can do that.

786
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,780
You're the one who wanted her for yourself.

787
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,810
You wanted to impress your student.

788
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:39,550
You haven't seen Cheong Ah's art, have you?

789
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:43,090
Cheong Ah can do stage, costume, and poster design.

790
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:45,640
She's a multitalented artist who can do anything.

791
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,500
You haven't seen the photos Se Kyeong took at the theme park, have you?

792
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:53,040
She has all it takes. She's an artist full of talents. Okay?

793
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,800
- Who the hell? 
 - Damn...

794
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,270
Have you eaten?

795
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,270
Se Kyeong, do you know sign language, too?

796
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,750
Well, a little bit.

797
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,810
I'm not that good.

798
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:07,100
When did you learn?

799
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:11,120
I learned from a deaf friend a while ago. I'm really not good at it. I'm not.

800
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,150
No, you're good.

801
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,350
What did you say earlier?

802
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,330
Earlier? Right!

803
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:21,060
"Don't go. Stay with me."

804
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,000
You're good.

805
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,170
You're embarrassing me.

806
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:32,290
- You can leave. 
 - I don't want to be with you. Go.

807
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,360
Talk to me for a second, Choi Se Kyeong.

808
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,920
What are you doing right now?

809
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,360
You wanted to prove her talent.

810
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,500
You said she's our photographer.

811
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,290
I recommended Cheong Ah as our designer.

812
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,870
We're cross-checking the ones we recommended.

813
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:50,100
I hope you let us test your talents.

814
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,170
Yes, yes. I'll let you.

815
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:54,560
Let's go. Can I take photos, then?

816
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,250
Se Kyeong. Hey!

817
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:59,420
You think you can do anything, huh?

818
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,160
I guess we're not practicing today.

819
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,070
Hey. Page me when you're done testing her talent.

820
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:08,610
Let's go play a video game.

821
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:11,350
Do we need exorcism or something?

822
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:16,000
Hey, page me.

823
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,350
Geez...

824
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:30,610
Wait for me.

825
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:33,820
How do you know if I'd follow you or not?

826
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,540
That's yours, right?

827
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,140
Why? Do I need to prove that I can drive it, too?

828
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,010
No, I'll drive it. Give me the key.

829
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,070
- Where are we going? 
 - We'll get a disposable camera and be outdoors.

830
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,110
I found a location for the poster photo shoot.

831
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:48,860
You'll take photos, and I'll judge them. Deal?

832
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:52,330
You'll take photos, and I'll judge them. Deal?

833
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:57,350
I'll sacrifice for Lee Chan, who bet his life on the band.

834
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,940
Here.

835
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,800
Hi.

836
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,170
Thank you...

837
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:28,820
for...

838
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,170
saving me...

839
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:32,670
last time.

840
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:34,390
 Sign language again? 

841
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:37,000
And I'm sorry.

842
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,500
I didn't know...

843
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:43,520
you saved me.

844
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,130
And also...

845
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,590
I didn't get to practice this.

846
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,020
Should we see your drawings now?

847
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,120
Hey, how far are we going?

848
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,230
We're almost there!

849
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:08,150
We could've just taken some nearby. Why are we going so far?

850
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,240
 Why else? 

851
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,060
 I'm letting Mom and Dad spend more time alone together. 

852
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:17,430
What? Why are you stopping?

853
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,020
I ran out of gas.

854
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,470
What? Seriously!

855
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,680
You're so annoying!

856
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,440
Wow!

857
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,700
Whoa...

858
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,150
Wow.

859
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:43,840
Amazing. Whoa, whoa!

860
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,190
Gosh. Seriously.

861
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:10,800
Let's leave the scooter here and go to the main street.

862
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,800
- We could still take the last bus. 
 - Since it's not yours, huh?

863
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,860
We can't ask someone to move the scooter for us, too.

864
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,550
I'll make sure to bring it back by tomorrow.

865
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,970
You're... Seriously, you're...

866
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:29,570
- Excuse me! Excuse me! 
 - Stop! Stop!

867
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,640
- Mister! Please! 
 - Please!

868
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,200
Mister, please! Stop!

869
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,630
- No! 
 - Stop!

870
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,730
Why are you taking it this far?

871
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,450
What do you mean?

872
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,440
You don't even like me.

873
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,330
What are you talking about? I like you.

874
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:07,020
Wow, that sounded so fake.

875
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,670
I shouldn't even bother.

876
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,670
How about you?

877
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:15,500
Is this how you wanted to play with the ball?

878
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,000
Passing it to Lee Chan once and passing it to me once?

879
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,110
You guys play with me. Why should I be fair?

880
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,220
I'll be fair to both of you, too.

881
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:29,290
I'll play with the ball and be fair until the festival.

882
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,820
Well, could you...

883
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,520
pass that...

884
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,810
ball to just me?

885
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,240
I'm confident I can catch it well.

886
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:57,390
Even if I get hit by the ball you threw,

887
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:59,840
I can endure the pain

888
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,890
and I'm confident I won't miss it even if it hurts.

889
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:05,460
I'm confident I won't let anyone take it

890
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,670
and even if they do, I can take it back.

891
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:15,340
Could you only pass it to me?

892
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,910
What's your answer?

893
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:25,500
I'll think about it if you sing for me.

894
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,400
Why would I sing here all of a sudden?

895
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,190
Forget it, then. Lee Chan would've sung for me.

896
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:35,270
He said he'd serenade me at the festival, too.

 I suddenly realized. 

905
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,920
 In spring of 1995, 

906
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:56,020
 not just Mom and Dad, but I was also... 

907
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,460
 18 years old. 

908
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:07,440


909
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:15,280
♫  These shining moments  ♫

910
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:23,230
♫  I can give them all to you  ♫

911
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:30,200
♫  Our small dreams  ♫

912
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:41,200
♫  I'll protect you until then, so you don't let go  ♫

913
00:58:56,070 --> 00:59:00,700
   

914
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,770
 Can we become friends? 

915
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:07,510
 Do you like me? 

916
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,440
 Tell me when Dad gets into the accident, then. 

917
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,260
 I have already sent a helper who suits you perfectly. 

918
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,720
 A helper? Who's that helper? 

919
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,250
 Could Yoon Dong Jin be my helper? 

920
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,680
 Looks like you made a month-long contract with Chairman. 

921
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,390
 You'd better leave before then. 

922
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:25,140
 I need to know how to return so I can go or not! 

923
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,640
 Excuse me. Do you have a moment? 

924
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,500
 Sorry. I shouldn't have liked you. I made a mistake.
