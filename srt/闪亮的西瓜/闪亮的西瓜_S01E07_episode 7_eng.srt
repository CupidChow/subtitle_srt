Please move. A patient coming through.

17
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,480

♫  I recognized you  ♫

19

24
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,960
   

25
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,530
Hello?

26
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,130
Bonsoir, are you enjoying the trip?

27
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,810
What? Was it you?

28
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,200
You scared the hell out of me!

29
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,360
You should've called beforehand if you were going to call.

30
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,370
- Well, I— 
   - Whatever. 

31
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,060
I'm doing just fine. So don't ever call me. Okay?

32
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,330
 Living someone else's life for them 

33
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,850
must be fun for you.

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,730
 Hello? H-H-Hello? 

35
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,720
C-Can you... Can you hear me?

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,660
Anybody there?

37
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,960
What? Did she hang up?

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,140
 What's wrong with this? 

39
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,140
 Yes. I'm living someone else's life right now. 

40
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,480
 My name is On Eun Yoo. 

41
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,050
 You must've suspected already. 

42
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,510
 I'm Choi Se Kyeong's daughter from the 21st century. 

43
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,100
   

44
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,440
 That's me. 

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,030
 And that's my mom. 

46
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,110
 I know. I resemble her a lot. 

47
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,970
 They say I resemble her more and more as I grow. 

48
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,480
 You could basically say that I'm her clone. 

49
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,380
 Anyway...  
    

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,280
Excellent! The girl is a genius.

51
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,000
 That's how I became my mom's jewel. 

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,080
 Was I happy? 

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,960
 How could I have been? 

54
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,940
   

55
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,820
Bravo!

56
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,000
 As you know, a jewel always has to shine. 

57
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,550
 The moment it stops shining, its value diminishes. 

58
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,170
 I was loved briefly whenever she needed to show me off or make her look good. 

59
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,690
 But most of the time, I was trapped inside the jewelry box. 

60
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,580
 If Dad didn't take me out of her jewelry box once in a while, 

61
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,550
 I might've been dead already. 

62
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,250
 But... 

63
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,130
Eun Yoo is my daughter. So I'll raise her. 
    

64
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,900
Did you give birth to her by yourself?

65
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,040
If you want to raise her, quit drinking first.

66
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,690
I filled out mine, so...

67
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,390
 I prayed to someone saying, 

68
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,500
 "Please make them stop fighting because of me. 

69
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,300
 Please don't let me regret being born." 

70
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,200
   

71
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,540
   

72
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,030
Whose house is this?

73
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,530
It's my dad's house.

74
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,840
Grandpa is in the US.

75
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,820
I'm not talking about him.

76
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,250
I'm talking about your real grandpa.

77
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,210
Is the one in the US fake?

78
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,170
No.

79
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,390
I have two dads.

80
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,010
Aren't you jealous?

81
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,770
No. I just need one dad.

82
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,730
You know,

83
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:11,380
I've wanted to have a complete family since I was a kid.

84
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,200
One that doesn't require explaining

85
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,910
and doesn't make me fear if they'll leave or make me worry

86
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,480
if I'll get abandoned. That kind of a family.

87
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,260
You're the last family I have left.

88
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,120
Isn't Dad a family like that?

89
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,360
You'll stay by my side. Right?

90
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,630
You won't either abandon or leave me. Right?

91
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,950
 I regretted... 

92
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,140
 promising Mom that day. 

93
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,770
   

94
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,790
 Like how the season changes, 

95
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,320
 Mom and Dad's relationship repeatedly got hot and cold. 

96
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,400
 As if it's an annual event, they kept separating and moving back in together. 

97
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,950
 Eventually, the year I turned 18, they got divorced. 

98
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,670
   

99
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,030
This is where we're going to live now. Just the two of us.

100
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,480
You just focus on music.

101
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,800
You know what I mean. Right?

102
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,800
Did she gain weight a bit?

103
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,870
It seems so.

104
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,880
She can lose weight when she goes to college.

105
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,860
It's normal to gain weight until they're high school seniors.

106
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,680
Ma'am, please make the waist looser.

107
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,180
It'd be uncomfortable when I play.

108
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,340
No, just leave it like that.

109
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,580
She'll lose weight quickly.

110
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,630
Choi Se Kyeong?

111
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,810
Hey, it's me.

112
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,440
Yoon Sang Ah from Seowon Arts High School.

113
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,540
Yoon Sang Ah, the daughter of the owner of Jinsung Instruments.

114
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,600
I heard you came back to Korea.

115
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,170
It was really true.

116
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,010
My goodness.

117
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,450
Is she your daughter?

118
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,860
Hi.

119
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,080
She looks exactly like when you were in high school.

120
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,730
It's nice to see you.

121
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,450
But I'm sorry. I need to get going.

122
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,220
I heard the news.

123
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,450
I heard you got divorced.

124
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,140
I was a bit shocked.

125
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,680
 Damn it. The time bomb started ticking. 

126
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,010
I never would've thought you and Ji Hwan would get divorced.

127
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,800
 - Three.  
 - I guess...

128
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,150
it was even more shocking when you got married.

129
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,450
I thought you'd continue to be a cellist.

130
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,530
 - Two.  
 - You were unmatched when you were in high school.

131
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,440
You weren't just talented but also pretty,

132
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,790
and popular, too.

133
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,120
The male students from the boys' high school religiously worshipped you.

134
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,930
They called you the cello goddess.

135
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,480
 One. 

136
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,540
It's true.

137
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,900
A male student even started a band for me.

138
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,380
He wanted to do a performance at the festival just for me.

139
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,110
Oh, right. Talking about a band reminds me.

140
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,290
Did I tell you that my first love was in a band?

141
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,840
My first love was totally different than your dad.

142
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,410
He was as bright as sunshine, cheerful, and manly.

143
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,670
He sometimes acted nonchalant, but he was friendly.

144
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,240
He was sometimes sensitive and sentimental, but he was positive.

145
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,810
You should've married your first love, then.

146
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,440
I wouldn't have been born, either, then.

147
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,460
What?

148
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,180
Should I try singing the second verse?

149
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,040
"If only I didn't marry your dad and

150
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,430
you weren't born, I would've

151
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,920
been traveling all over the world as a successful cellist.

152
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,160
I wouldn't have become a typical woman obsessed with her husband and child."

153
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,360
Eun Yoo, I was just—

154
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,040
You were just drunk?

155
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,050
Will you promise you'll never drink again?

156
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,610
Do you expect me to believe your promise again?

157
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,840
You think I was born because I wanted to?

158
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,760
I didn't choose you to be born, either.

159
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,600
What do you think you're doing?

160
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,230
I'll go to Dad.

161
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,160
I'm afraid I'd end up like you after living with you.

162
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,300
That's why I'm telling you to focus on music.

163
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,010
- So you don't end up like me— 
 - Stop making excuses!

164
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,010
Stop using me.

165
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,790
Why do I have to redeem you from your failure?

166
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,790
I can't talk to you like this.

167
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,570
Were we ever able to talk?

168
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,180
You always only talked about yourself.

169
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,810
You disregarded me as if I was a barking dog.

170
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,210
Is that why you acted like you couldn't hear me?

171
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,500
Is that why you let go of yourself like that?

172
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,070
Just to rebel against me?

173
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,420
This is why I don't like you.

174
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,840
You say cruel things like it's nothing.

175
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,250
You look sociopathic sometimes.

176
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,030
Dad left you because he got sick of you acting this way. Did you know?

177
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,070
What a mean girl you are.

178
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,750
You're just like your dad.

179
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,040
Yes. I've always gotten along better with him.

180
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,680
 That was the last time I saw Mom. 

181
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,270
 And a very long journey started. 

182
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,310
Hello?

183
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,500
Who are you?

184
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,340
I'm sorry, but isn't this Dr. On's house?

185
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,420
Yes, but who—

186
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,570
Oh, you're Dr. On's daughter.

187
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,900
Honey.

188
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,910
 - Honey?  
 - Honey, come quick. Your daughter's here.

189
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,410
He's on the second floor, so he can't hear us.

190
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,490
Come in, sweetie.

191
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,300
Honey.

192
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,190
   

193
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,260
   

194
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,820
   

195
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,120
   

196
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,400
Hey, Yo Ma. Where are you going? 
  (Sarcastically referring to the famous American cellist Yo-Yo Ma) 

197
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,330
They should've married someone else if they were going to do this.

198
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,840
They shouldn't have created me.

199
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,170
You didn't even ask me.

200
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,890
You created me just because you wanted to.

201
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,990
It's not like you'd live my life for me. Look at me now.

202
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,250
   

203
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,950
   

204
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,410
   

205
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,460
- Welcome, Ma'am. 
 - Gosh, you scared me!

206
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,790
I'm the master of this shop.

207
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,270
It must've been hard to find this place.

208
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,110
What brings you here?

209
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,850
Well, you just turned the sign on in the front.

210
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,040
Right, I did that.

211
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,320
Would you like some hot tea?

212
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,140
No, I don't need tea.

213
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,750
Do you buy used cellos, too?

214
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,950
I want to sell it.

215
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,080
Are you really going to sell it?

216
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,260
I can tell you took good care of it.

217
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,660
I don't need it anymore.

218
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,290
I'll die soon.

219
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,930
My gosh. You're so young. Why would you say that?

220
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:33,530
Because it's so heavy to carry that on my back.

221
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,820
It doesn't look heavy enough to make you want to die.

222
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,840
You might not see it,

223
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,950
but my mom is sitting on top of it.

224
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,700
My gosh.

225
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,010
Dad sometimes put her down for me,

226
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,040
but he doesn't care anymore.

227
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,370
That's why I think I could die now.

228
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,620
Your parents would feel very sad.

229
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,500
They say children do all their filial duties by the age of three.

230
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,790
None of us have regrets.

231
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,340
I'll have tons of fun with the money from selling the cello and die.

232
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,840
Okay, then.

233
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,510
I'll give you a special deal just for you.

234
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,060
Wow.

235
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,310
Are you sure this is a special deal? There are only one-dollar bills in there.

236
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,450
This is more useful than you think.

237
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,870
Did you know?

238
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:32,420
The one-dollar bill's design has never changed.

239
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,430
Take this with you.

240
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,930
Just in case you want your cello back.

241
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,170
I'm sure that won't happen.

242
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,200
You never know. Just take it.

243
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,910
Okay.

244
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,760
How about you go on a trip before you die?

245
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,660
It will be a bit unusual.

246
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,270
Sounds good.

247
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,020
I'll go on a trip and think about how I'll die.

248
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,620
Thanks for the tea, then.

249
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,570
Be careful on your way out.

250
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,840
Okay.

251
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,360
I hope you have a pleasant trip.

252
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,670
   

253
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,110
What?

254
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm at the airport.

255
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,260
   

256
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,300
And I'm in Korea?

257
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,530
   

258
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,060
Huh?

259
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,250
1995?

260
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,890
 How about you go on a trip before you die? 

261
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,860
 It will be a bit unusual. 

262
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,640
 Was he talking about time traveling? 

263
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,760
Geez.

264
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,090
Se Kyeong. Aren't you Se Kyeong?

265
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,450
It's you, right? It's Min Ji. Kim Min Ji.

266
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,120
We were classmates at Rara Elementary School in the sixth grade.

267
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,050
- Oh, yes. Min Ji. 
 - Yes, it's me.

268
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:36,560
I heard you left to study abroad a few days ago. I guess you didn't.

269
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,220
- Study abroad? 
 - Yeah.

270
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,060
 Hold on. This is when Mom just left to study abroad? 

271
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,390
 If so... 

272
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,070
 Does it mean this house would be empty for now? 

273
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:04,350
 So did you give up on dying now? 

274
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,300
No, there's no way.

275
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,460
D-Didn't you say you were doing well just now?

276
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,690
I'm doing well.

277
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,420
Because I found the most comfortable and fun way to commit suicide.

278
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,830
Wow, could I ask you what that may be?

279
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,110
It won't be either scary or painful.

280
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,090
I won't inconvenience anyone.

281
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,580
And it would make me disappear so naturally.

282
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,780
You're teasing me. Tell me a little more.

283
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,690
I'm thinking of making my mom's first love come true.

284
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,090
 Then my mom won't marry my dad 

285
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,030
 and I won't be born, either. 

286
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,970
If so, I won't have to commit suicide.

287
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,140
Wow, my goodness. Oh, my god.

288
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,660
What a creative way.

289
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,030
I'm sure she'd become happier than she is now.

290
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,160
Because she'd end up with her first love like she always wanted.

291
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,280
There can't be a more reasonable and elegant way to commit suicide.

292
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,240
Wow, she's smart.

293
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,230
I suppose you're right.

294
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,520
How will you find your mom's first love, by the way?

295
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,830
- I already found him. 
  - Amazing. 

296
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,310
Wow, you're so quick.

297
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,680
By the way, are you sure it's him?

298
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,670
Well, you mean he's not the one?

299
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,430
I don't know.

300
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,240
I wonder if it's him.

301
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,340
 Why don't I... 

302
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,040
call you when it's time again?

303
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,980
 Viva la vida. 

304
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,900
H-H-Hold. Mister!

305
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,960
Gosh, hello?

306
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,110
Hello?

307
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:44,500
Does it mean Mom's first love might not be Ha Lee Chan?

308
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,980
Gosh, who is it, then?

309
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,410
He was electrocuted and was in a semi-coma while being transported.

310
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,360
His blood pressure keeps dropping, and his pulse is below 30 per minute.

311
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,860
He's in bradycardia.

312
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,370
- Please inject epinephrine immediately. 
 - Okay.

313
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,030
- Get the intubation kit ready, too. 
 - Okay.

314
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,950
- It's a cardiac arrest. 
 - CPR!

315
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,220
- Bring the ICD. Hurry. Hurry! 
 - Yes.

316
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,180
Charge to 200 joule.

317
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,390
Charged to 200.

318
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,000
Okay, step aside, everyone.

319
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,690
Ready, go.

320
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,960
 Mom. Dad. 

321
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,460
 I want to go home. 

322
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,910
 Please come pick me up. 

323
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,340
 Please. 

324
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,990
Are you awake now?

325
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,360
You're at the hospital...

326
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,120
Hold on. Hold on.

327
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,340
 You're at the hospital. 

328
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,070
 You passed out. 

329
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,800
 Do you remember? 

330
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,430
 What? What's wrong with you? 

331
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,150
 Are you okay? 

332
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,350
You remember.

333
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,120
That's a relief.

334
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,280
Hold on.

335
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,500
 I'm sorry I got angry last time. 

336
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,490
 I'm sorry I said mean things. 

337
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,760
 I didn't know you couldn't hear. 

338
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,300
- I'm sorry. 
  - Don't get the wrong idea, Yoon Cheong Ah. 

339
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,030
 He's not being kind. He's pitying me. 

340
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:08,350
 Would he have been this kind if I wasn't deaf? 

341
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,320
Gosh, no.

342
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,450
They said not to move

343
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,350
and stay in bed.

344
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,220
They said you have to rest.

345
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,500
Guardian.

346
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,140
- Could you come over for a second? 
 - Yes.

347
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,220
Hold on. Wait for a moment.

348
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,750
   

349
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,840
   

350
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,790
   

351
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,750
   

352
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,030
Here.

353
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,620
There's a prescription for the patient at the administration office.

354
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,840
Make sure to get the medicine at the pharmacy downstairs before leaving.

355
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,070
Okay. Thank you.

356
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,160
Have a nice day.

357
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,140
 The ticket I gave you that day. 

358
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,000
 Se Kyeong gave that to me. 

359
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,950
 I didn't know there was a letter she wrote in there. 

360
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,740
 I'm asking you why you wrote a fake letter to screw me over? 

361
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,620
 I won't be seeing you again, 

362
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,820
 but I wanted to clear that up. 

363
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,440
 Thank you for bringing me to the hospital. 

364
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,570
   

365
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,880
Give me a chance to apologize.

366
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,900
 Don't do it. 

367
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,710
I'm sorry I got the wrong idea.

368
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,640
I'm so sorry.

369
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,260
 Stop apologizing like that. 

370
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,270
Aren't you hungry?

371
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,180
Should we eat together?

372
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,000
You need to eat to take your medicine.

373
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,490
 Don't be so nice to me. 

374
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,110
 You don't know 

375
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,670
 that too much kindness could hurt. 

376
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,870
Can you not forgive me?

377
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,590
Can you not bring yourself to do it?

378
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:24,160
Can't you think about it while eating?

379
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,070
Aren't you hungry?

380
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,170
 I'm not hungry. 

381
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,940
You are hungry!

382
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:49,180
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's because I'm hungry.

383
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,420
I-It's because I'm hungry.

384
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,120
I paid the hospital bill.

385
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,710
So you can buy me lunch.

386
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,840
 Did you come to see me that day? 

387
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,760
 Did you need my help, by chance? 

388
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,370
 Help? 

389
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,450
 Send me an SOS if you need help. 

390
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,300
 I'll come with those PE major guys, then. 

391
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,360
Good thing if you didn't.

392
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,600
Yes.

393
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,000
 This is my fax number. 

394
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,390
 Contact me if something happens from now on. 

395
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:28,170
If it's an emergency,

396
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:33,020
send "8282" or "505" to my pager. 
 (8282: Hurry, 505: SOS)

397
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,710
I'll check immediately, then. Okay?

398
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,970
 My heart is racing again. 

399
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,660
Oh, you want to say goodbye here?

400
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,470
But would you be okay?

401
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:16,850
Can you go home by yourself?

402
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:24,940
Right. She's sick, but I can't go to her place.

403
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,930
Okay, then.

404
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,090
Eat plenty and...

405
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,700
make sure to take the medicine...

406
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,030
after meals, too.

407
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,860
Recover quickly

408
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,380
and grow super duper strong.

409
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,940
You smiled for the first time.

410
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,700
Goodbye, then.

411
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,100
 You're supposed to like Yoon Cheong Ah. 

412
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,330
Hold on! Hold on!

413
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,270
Do you know Ha Eun Gyeol by chance?

414
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,400
Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on.

415
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,690
I see.

416
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,540
Oh, right.

417
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,020
Since we had a meal together,

418
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,420
we're friends from now on.

419
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,500
Yoon Cheong Ah.

420
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,970
Tornado!

421
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,650
 He called my name. 

422
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,500
♫  The lights are turning on  ♫

423
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:59,700
♫  Someone's day is ending as usual as the afternoon is passing by  ♫

424
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:07,840
♫  In the shaking train, I'm going somewhere  ♫

425
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,550
♫  In the dark...  ♫

426
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:13,730
 He called my name. 

427
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:19,910
♫  My heart and the moon collide  ♫

428
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:26,190
♫  I wonder if there was a night like that in the days past  ♫

429
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:31,110
♫  You loved me without saying anything  ♫

430
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:37,270
♫  Would you have comforted me down the road?  ♫

431
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:42,950
♫  I can't love myself  ♫

432
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,820
♫  I cannot love myself anymore  ♫

433
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,490
♫  The space is expanding  ♫

434
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,320
♫  In the gap that's getting bigger  ♫

435
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,300
Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol!

436
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:00,320
You know that Yoon Cheong Ah you mentioned?

437
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,880
Why am I supposed to like her...

438
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,570
How dare he not come home?

439
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,880
The patient... The patient in the VIP ward disappeared.

440
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,330
   

441
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,280
If it's not Ha Lee Chan, who could it be?

442
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,670
I need a clue.

443
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,430
A conclusive clue.

444
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,700
 He was as bright as sunshine, cheerful, and manly. 

445
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,840
 He looked tough, but he always liked me. 

446
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,690
 He sometimes acted nonchalant, but he was friendly. 

447
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:04,470
 He was sometimes sensitive and sentimental, but he was positive. 

448
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:08,860
Gosh, was her first love an AI or something?

449
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,060
 And he was really good at eating spicy food, too. 

450
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,980
 I couldn't eat anything spicy. 

451
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,740
 He once ate something like it wasn't spicy at all. 

452
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,690
 So I tried taking a bite. 

453
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,400
 I thought my throat and veins were burning. 

454
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,810
 It was no joke. 

455
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,640
 I was almost sent to the ER that day. 

456
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,100
 Gosh, seriously. 

457
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,970
Eureka. It'd be as conclusive as the litmus test.

458
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,030
That's how I'm going to find out.

459
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,950
 Hey, bro. It's Se Kyeong. 

460
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,850
 I got the photos from the theme park. I'd like to give them to you. 

461
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,730
 Do you want to meet sometime? 

462
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,160
Jesus!

463
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,590
Holy s***.

464
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,860
She'd get hurt.

465
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,390
I'm not so easy.

466
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,140
   

467
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,160
Okay.

468
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,210
   

469
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,620
Hi, Se Kyeong.

470
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,040
 - It's a zombie.  
 - It seemed like you were into rock bands.

471
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,700
What do you think?

472
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,890
- Do you like it? 
  - How could I? 

473
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,800
Whoa. Gosh. Wow.

474
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,470
Have a seat, then.

475
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,010
Okay.

476
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,620
Rock never dies.

477
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,770
Do you like metal, too?

478
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,590
 Metal, my foot. Can't you do something about your mental state? 

479
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,580
What do you like? How about spicy jjamppong?

480
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,200
Is it because of your hair?

481
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,300
Do you want this?

482
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,110
Okay. Thank you.

483
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,930
   

484
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,530
    
 I gave you happiness, love,

485
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:14,120
and extra tteokbokki sauce,

486
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,600
you became my regular customer.

487
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,720
Hello, I'm DJ Joon.

488
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,860
   

489
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,140
Hi, Se Kyeong.

490
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,250
 Geez, what's this now? 

491
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,500
I didn't think you'd want to see me privately.

492
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,580
 I didn't think you'd be wearing a price tag, either. 

493
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,430
Thanks for coming. Have a seat.

494
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,170
Okay.

495
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,290
I'll read you a letter from a listener.

496
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,890
   

497
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:59,260
There's a girl who moved into my heart without my permission.

498
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,120
We met at a competition seven years ago

499
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,720
and we won the grand prize together as if it was meant to be.

500
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,140
But we couldn't end up together.

501
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,660
I was immature then.

502
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,690
I left to study abroad because of the piano.

503
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:15,330
I've been watching her from afar like a fool.

504
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,880
But I'm on my way to meet her now.

505
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,610
Please play Lee Sang Woo's "100m Until I See Her."

506
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,860
Puke. What a lame letter.

507
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,810
This letter is from Table No. 7.

508
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,200
Where is it?

509
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,840
♫  The yellow cafe right over there  ♫

510
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,830
♫  It's my third time meeting her  ♫

511
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,820
You...

512
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,480
don't remember me, do you?

513
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,980
Oh...

514
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,580
Do you like spicy tteokbokki?

515
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,660
Oh, no...

516
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,280
Do you want to use this as blotting paper?

517
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,910
Gosh. T-Thank you.

518
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,420
- Thank you. 
 - No, keep it. Keep it.

519
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,000
Can I? Thank you.

520
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,080
   

521
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,700
 It's not so bad in comparison. 

522
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,830
Don't be moved so quickly. I found this on the street on the way.

523
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,500
 How embarrassing. 

524
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,340
 Geez, this is too cringe for me. 

525
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:52,500
I thought they called you "Goddess of Cello" because of your looks.

526
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,860
- But you aren't so bad up here, either. 
  - What's he saying? 

527
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,270
You wanted to give me the photos in person?

528
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,220
I'm impressed. You have good taste in men.

529
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,050
I think I've been looking at you through colored lenses.

530
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:09,670
 You're looking at me through colored lenses now, too. 

531
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,450
Hyeon Yool, I heard the chicken feet are really good here.

532
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,230
Why don't you try them?

533
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,570
Okay. I'll eat them because you're begging me to.

534
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,160
But you should know this.

535
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,220
Winning me over won't be so easy.

536
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,600
Oh, okay. Go ahead.

537
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,330
 He seems kind of promising. 

538
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,110
What? Is it spicy?

539
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,680
You can't eat it, can you?

540
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,880
Let me warn you.

541
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,230
Give up if you're expecting something more.

542
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,960
I like older women.

543
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,700
And I'm not interested in stealing my friend's woman.

544
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,580
If I could,

545
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,410
I love him enough to join the military in his place.

546
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,020
Wow. You mean Lee Chan?

547
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,120
No, I meant the older ladies.

548
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,650
    
 Geez.

549
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:11,460
Are there only these two left now?

550
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,070
One of them like men.

551
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:18,390
That means it's 99% Ha Lee Chan.

552
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,800
If it's not him, either,

553
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,600
it means I chose the wrong group of men.

554
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,780
Gosh, that would be terrible.

555
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,400
Prove yourself, Ha Lee Chan.

556
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,150
- Here's the soft tofu stew. 
 - Thank you.

557
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,680
- Thank you. Lady first. 
 - Thank you.

558
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,780
Thank you so much.

559
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,610
Ma'am, I'll have extra pepper flakes and chili pepper.

560
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,990
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

561
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,400
 I knew it was you. 

562
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,170
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

563
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,790
- Have a good day. 
 - Put it all in.

564
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,590
- You're adding all of that? 
 - Yes.

565
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,150
This much? Done.

566
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,800
 My goodness, how come he doesn't even sweat? 

567
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,870
Aren't you going to eat, Se Kyeong?

568
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,970
Huh? Yes. I should eat, too.

569
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,770
Go ahead.

570
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,810
 Hold on. 

571
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,360
 Should I still check, just in case? 

572
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,710
By the way, why didn't your partner come?

573
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,940
My partner?

574
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,740
Your resident tutor.

575
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,800
Isn't he going to tell you what to do today?

576
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,170
He ran away from home.

577
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,000
What? He ran away?

578
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,920
That Confucian boy did? Why?

579
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,170
I don't know.

580
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,890
I can't tell which cloud holds rain.

581
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:47,740
He poured everything like a storm and left.

582
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,320
He doesn't even have a place to go.

583
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,370
You must be worried, aren't you?

584
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,970
Worried?

585
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,280
Who? Me?

586
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,770
I'm worried about him?

587
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:04,710
Why would I be? I feel liberated, as if food stuck in my teeth came out.

588
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,900
Try scratching your head.

589
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,460
- Why should I? 
 - Just go ahead and scratch it.

590
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,140
Wow, he's almost here since you're scratching the front.

591
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,900
Why? What does this mean?

592
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,410
It's a built-in navigator.

593
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,080
You know how far away someone is by scratching your head.

594
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,170
If you scratch the back of your head, it means they're far away.

595
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:26,780
And if you scratch the front, it means they're almost here.

596
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,780
Don't worry. He'll come back soon.

597
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,700
Thank you for comforting me.

598
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,600
- Let's eat before the food gets cold. 
 - Okay.

599
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,220
- Gosh, it's so spicy. 
 - Is it spicy? Is it?

600
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,820
- Gosh, it's so spicy. So spicy! 
 - Drink this. It'll help.

601
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,980
Drink it. Drink it. Drink it.

602
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,380
Hey, you already drank this.

603
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,720
Spit it out. Spit it out. Spit it out.

604
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,900
- Here's the napkin. Here. 
 - What do you mean, spit it out?

605
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,170
It bothers me that I never tested him.

606
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,090
Here it is.

607
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,500
There's this one, too.

608
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:49,780
He loves him more than I thought.

609
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:53,060
It's definitely not you, then.

610
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,070
 Do you like me, by chance? 

611
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,690
 Wait. 

612
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,810
 Just be honest. 

613
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:08,790
 Is it me or Lee Chan? 

614
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,950
You.

615
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,630
You're kind of dangerous.

616
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,060
You make my heart flutter somehow.

617
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,020
Gosh, he's really taunting me.

618
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,290
Do I take this off or not?

619
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,920
Should I take it off or not?

620
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,000
   

621
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,770
I'm home—

622
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,010
- Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol! 
 - Eun Gyeol!

623
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,650
Hey.

624
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,810
Gosh, where's Eun Gyeol? I thought you were coming with him.

625
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,370
I don't know.

626
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:14,990
Feel free to look for him if you want.

627
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,960
Can't you reach him? Don't you know where he is?

628
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,470
Is he even coming back today?

629
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,430
Gosh, we need to do the fitting today.

630
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:23,100
Fitting?

631
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,420
- What fitting? 
 - Didn't he tell you?

632
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,110
He was supposed to model for me since I was the judge for the battle.

633
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:30,320
The judge for the battle?

634
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,920
 Yes. He told me to find a judge if I wanted to battle him. 

635
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,440
 So why are you asking me to do that? 

636
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,950
 I heard you're the one who got Lee Chan into music. 

637
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,570
 Well, I suppose. 

638
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:47,080
 You're the one who made Yoon Dong Jin a guitarist, too. 

639
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,150
 Yes... well... 

640
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,370
 it's true, but... 

641
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:52,900
 I'm a bit busy. 

642
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,800
 As you can see, I have a presentation soon. 

643
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,280
 So, I have to finish designing it, and I have to write a report for a GE class, too. 

644
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,910
 I can do it for you. 

645
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,520
 What? 

646
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,390
 Whether it's a report, a research, 

647
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:07,520
 or an assistant duty, just tell me. 

648
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,020
 Hey, it might look easy, 

649
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,870
 but you can't do it unless it's your major. 

650
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,660
 I need to make this battle happen, Hyung. 

651
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:20,440
 I promised to let Lee Chan have a band before the festival. 

652
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,370
 So... 

653
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:25,600
 I'm really begging you. 

654
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,740
So he wrote a report for you because you were the judge for the battle?

655
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,660
By the way, listen to this.

656
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,440
I got an A+ for that report.

657
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,570
He's a very strict professor, too.

658
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,280
So...

659
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,240
    
 you'll have him wear this?

660
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,060
- Yes. 
 - Is it a joke?

661
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,230
No. I wanted him to wear it for the presentation.

662
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,850
- I think it's like a penalty. 
 - I think I'll beat you up.

663
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:53,410
Gosh, why do you want to punish him with shitty clothes like this?

664
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,140
Hey, we made a deal. It was a deal!

665
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,600
Deal, my foot.

666
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,970
The battle is over.

667
00:46:57,970 --> 00:46:59,370
Then the deal is over, too.

668
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,550
Why do you keep exploiting him?

669
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:03,790
Hey, I'm not exploiting him.

670
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:07,080
I paid him a fair wage for the job.

671
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,050
It's a part-time job. A part-time job.

672
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,720
A part-time job? Fair wage?

673
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,700
Didn't you know?

674
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,650
Eun Gyeol has a part-time job at the boarding house.

675
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:17,120
What?

676
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,000
Since when?

677
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:27,410
 I heard you wrote an A+ report for Bal San. 

678
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,780
 Could I ask you to write mine, too? 

679
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,150
 Well, I did it because there was a situation. 

680
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,080
 It's a really short essay. 

681
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,810
 It's eight to 10 pages. 

682
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:39,020
 Writing an essay is a part of the class, too. You should do it yourself. 

683
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,260
 You know how to make a deal. 

684
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:44,620
 Okay. 1,000 won per page. 

685
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:48,720
 Let's make it clean and do 10,000. 

686
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,370
 Deal. 

687
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,320
   

688
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:04,730
 Thank you. 

689
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,530
 - Jeong Yang Wook. 
 - Here. 

690
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:11,630
 - Kim Soo Young. 
 - Here. 

691
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,490
 - Hong Chang Soo. 
 - Here. 

692
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,350
Did he dig money that much?

693
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:44,780
Money isn't the ground. He didn't dig it.

694
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,010
It sounded like he had a situation.

695
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,220
What situation?

696
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,410
 I want to buy Lee Chan a guitar. 

697
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:51,930
 Huh? 

698
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,340
 I already gave him one. 

699
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,680
 It didn't sound good because the wood absorbed moisture. 

700
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,230
 Hey, that should be good enough for him. 

701
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,130
 Come on, Hyung. A band has to look cool. 

702
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:05,770
 We have no money, but we're still cool. 

703
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,410
 What did he do to deserve you? 

704
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:11,500
 He struck gold by finding you. 

705
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,540
 You tutor him, create a band for him, and you're buying him a guitar. 

706
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,050
 What's so great about him? Why do you do this? 

707
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,840
 I'd like to know his secrets. 

708
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,680
 He said he wanted to shine. 

709
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,720
 What? 

710
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,500
 He said this might be the last bit of his youth. 

711
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,780
 He said he'd make money when he graduates. 

712
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,290
 He wants to try everything before he graduates. That's why... 

713
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,730
 I want to make him shine... 

714
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,790
 on stage for now. 

715
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:48,220
I almost cried because I was touched.

716
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,280
Hey, be nice to him.

717
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,640
He's a good kid.

718
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,630
He's multitalented

719
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,740
and he's amazingly kind, too.

720
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,380
Let me know when he gets home, even if it's late.

721
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,780
   

722
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:28,070
   

723
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,660
 I want to make him shine... 

724
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,450
 on stage for now. 

725
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:05,130
 And in life later on. 

726
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,650
   

727
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:16,540
Get ohgomu and deabuk here.
  (Traditional Korean drums) 

728
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,950
I want Se Kyeong to know what majestic means.

729
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,540
What are you, a peddler? Don't you need a snake and a flute?

730
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,880
Percussions are the only instruments that prove the human heart isn't just a vestigial organ.

731
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,230
That's enough.

732
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:29,600
Put two pianos here and here.

733
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,090
I'll bump up the synth. Make sure the sound quality is good.

734
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,250
Cindy? Who the hell is she to put her on stage?

735
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,090
Synthesizer, you idiot.

736
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,610
It's an instrument, not a person.

737
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:40,460
It's a really expensive instrument.

738
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,090
Gosh, he's so clueless...

739
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:43,930
Hyeon Yool, don't you have to prepare stuff?

740
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,860
No, I'm fine.

741
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:48,330
I don't have to impress Se Kyeong.

742
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:51,130
Because my talent is everything.

743
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:54,490
Hyeon Yool, you're the only hope for humanity.

744
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:57,720
Well, I ask for just one small thing.

745
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:02,830
- Okay, okay. 
 - A light that only shines on me and a solo part.

746
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:05,250
It'll be about eight minutes long.

747
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,550
 So you do want to impress her. 

748
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:08,580
Whoa, whoa...

749
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,520
What are you guys doing?

750
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,910
You came.

751
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,970
Why are you alone? Where's Eun Gyeol?

752
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:19,130
Ha Eun Gyeol went recluse.

753
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,100
I can't reach him. He disappeared.

754
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,370
- What? 
 - What?

755
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,030
Ha Eun Gyeol went recluse?

756
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,320
And you still can't reach him?

757
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,400
So, we can't practice today, then?

758
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,970
That's not the issue. He's saying we don't know when he'll be back.

759
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:33,900
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

760
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,900
If we wait for him while practicing—

761
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,600
For how long? Until our hair turns gray?

762
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,070
What if he doesn't come? What if he doesn't?

763
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:44,930
Damn it. You're saying we should give up on performing.

764
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,650
But Se Kyeong might come.

765
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,280
I wanted to impress Se Kyeong.

766
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,580
Let's replace him.

767
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,590
- Replace who? 
 - The guitarist.

768
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:10,700
- What? 
 - I'll bring the guitarist from our church praise team.

769
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,300
He can catch up quickly if he starts practicing today.

770
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,130
Yes, let's do that. That's a very realistic solution.

771
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,990
- Hey! 
 - You scared me.

772
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,160
Are you guys serious right now?

773
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,290
Hey. What kind of people are you?

774
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:28,130
A member who promised to be with us disappeared.

775
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:32,030
Not only do you not care, but you suggest replacing him?

776
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:34,390
Is this band a joke to you?

777
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:36,920
Is it just for seducing a woman—

778
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,810
 Is this band a joke to you? 

779
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:41,530
 Is it just for seducing a woman? 

780
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:45,350
You think you have the right to tell us that?

781
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,470
You're the one who kicked Ha Eun Gyeol out.

782
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:51,470
You treated him like dirt to impress Choi Se Kyeong, too.

783
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,190
Hey, yo, Frontman.

784
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:57,840
So what do you want us to do, then?

785
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,220
Huh?

786
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,610
What's your solution, then?

787
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:03,070
Do you even have one?

788
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:06,150
Have you ever made a plan before?

789
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:10,440
If you're the frontman, direct the boat and paddle, you bastard.

790
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,430
All of us are about to drown because of you.

791
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,600
We do need to make a decision.

792
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,000
What do you want to do?

793
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,300
- Do you want a new member or— 
 - Shut up.

794
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,610
Ha Eun Gyeol is our only main guitarist.

795
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:26,860
I'll find him no matter what.

796
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:30,470
I'll find him and bring him here, no matter what!

797
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,800
You disloyal bastards.

798
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,600
   

799
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,120
   

800
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,720
   

801
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:27,080
Hold on. He's the reason why I started pretending to be Mom.

802
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,740
 Choi Se Kyeong? 

803
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:32,420
 You're Choi Se Kyeong, aren't you? 

804
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,010
 No, I'm not. 

805
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:40,090
 You're Choi Se Kyeong. Don't you know who I am? 

806
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:44,050
If he didn't call me by that name that day,

807
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,890
I wouldn't have fallen in love with him...

808
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,380
No, no, no. It's not that.

809
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:52,900
Anyway, I wouldn't have even considered looking for Mom's first love. On top of that...

810
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,280
 You left to study abroad without a word. You weren't supposed to come back. 

811
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,940
 But you did. You're here. 

812
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,680
 What's going on right now? 

813
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,240
He seemed to know a lot about Mom somehow.

814
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,780
It feels like they might've had something special going on somehow.

815
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,140
There's only one solution.

816
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,790
I should find Ha Eun Gyeol and find out myself.

817
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:17,110
 You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

818
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:19,340
Hi, Lee Chan. What are you up to?

819
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,500
Should we meet at the cafe around seven?

820
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:25,750
I'll be waiting. Page me as soon as you hear this.

821
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,250
Okay.

822
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,570
Please have a look at this. Thank you.

823
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:33,170
I'm looking for a person. He's handsome. Right?

824
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,830
A very handsome kid is wandering the streets...

825
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,050
I'm looking for a person.

826
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:39,400
Thank you in advance. I'm looking for a person.

827
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,040
Contact me anytime...

828
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,330
Please take this. Yes.

829
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,920
That son of a bitch.

830
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,460
Shit.

831
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,840
Yes, who paged the number 0130?

832
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,830
 I'm calling you about the flyer. 

833
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,820
 You're looking for Ha Eun Gyeol. Right? 

834
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,310
Yes, I am.

835
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:16,920
Do you know where he is right now?

836
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,540
 He won't forgive me if he knew I told you. 

837
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:22,650
 By the way, you're rewarding me. Right? 

838
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,970
Yes, I will.

839
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:27,420
Where should I meet you?

840
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,170
   

841
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,230
 This is my fax number. 

842
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:38,150
 Contact me if something happens from now on. 

843
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,520
   

844
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,690
   

845
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,720
   

846
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,140
   
   

847
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:18,950
Hey! Watch where you're going!

848
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,810
Hi, you.

849
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,590
Good to see you.

850
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,550
Where's Ha Eun Gyeol?

851
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:51,910
Where is he right now?

852
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:54,840
You think I know? Me?

853
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:00,380
Are you naive or stupid?

854
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,950
You're doing this for money, aren't you?

855
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:05,350
Ding-dong-dang-dong.

856
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:08,010
We told each other the truth. We know enough.

857
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:09,540
So let's get it moving. Okay?

858
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,450
If you give me the money you have,

859
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,550
we'll just let you go.

860
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,290
I don't have any.

861
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:17,060
Even if I did, I wouldn't give it to you.

862
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,730
This is what's wrong with high schoolers in this country.

863
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:23,140
If you're nice to them, they really think you're nice.

864
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,500
Look at those eyes.

865
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:31,970
What are you guys doing?

866
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:34,150
There's no time.

867
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,850
My goodness, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

868
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:03,670
Hold on. You can't just leave like that!

869
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,970
Geez.

870
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:23,570
 Lee Chan. Ha Lee Chan. Are you okay? 

871
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:25,760
 Open your eyes. Open them. 

872
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:51,150
♫  We are in different times, we met while wandering around  ♫

873
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:58,320
♫  Among so many people  ♫

874
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:05,900
♫  You looked so different  ♫

875
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:20,730
♫  We dream the same dream, we could have been together  ♫

876
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:28,250
♫  Go all the way around a distance at the end of this road  ♫

877
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:33,040
 Let's do it together. Starting a band. 

878
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,290
 I'll make the best band for you. 

879
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:39,570
 I'll make your youth shine like you wanted so badly. 

880
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,690
 Please. Listen to me just this once. 

881
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:43,640
 You just need to be safe this year. 

882
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,230
 I'll... 

883
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:47,740
 I'll make sure to protect you. 

884
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,790
 Just for a year. 

885
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:52,130
 Not for the rest of your life, but just a year. 

886
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:55,850
 I'm asking you to be where I can see you just for a year. Can't you even do that? 

887
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:07,880
♫  I'll protect you until then  ♫

888
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,550
 Good job. 

889
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,260
 Got it. I'll help you, then. 

890
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,830
 I'll be in a band with you, teach you how to play the guitar, and everything. 

891
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,670
 This is our Day 1. Okay? 

892
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:38,160
You said you'd protect me.

893
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,010
You said you'd help me go to college.

894
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,250
You said to be in the band together.

895
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,500
Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol, where the hell are you!

896
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:59,750
♫  All the memories that will be forgotten  ♫

897
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:07,100
♫  I will gift it to you  ♫

898
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:12,090
   

899
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:16,020
♫  Tell me, say it back, oh say it ditto  ♫

900
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:20,690
♫  The morning is too far away, so say it ditto  ♫

901
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:25,160
♫  It's completely covered, just like the memories we had together  ♫

902
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:30,800
♫  My heart that looks at you is already summer and fall  ♫

903
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:35,020
♫  I waited all this time  ♫

904
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,100
♫  Do you want somebody like I want somebody?  ♫

905
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:44,840
Excuse me.

906
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,170
- Yes? 
 - What year is it right now?

907
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:50,270
It's 2023. Why do you ask?

908
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:52,650
2023?

909
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:55,000
Not 1995?

910
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,180
What are you saying?

911
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:01,620
Wait! Wasn't there an instrument store called La Vida Music around here?

912
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,140
There wasn't.

913
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,390
Am I...

914
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:17,600
back, then?

915
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:24,750


916
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:35,710
♫  I'm alone on top of the clock's hand that stopped  ♫

917
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:45,000
♫  All the days I've run, all that time  ♫

918
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:52,180
♫  The bright future that everyone dreamed of  ♫

919
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:59,510
♫  Is in front of me right now  ♫

920
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:06,170
♫  Another day passed without even a moment to breathe  ♫

921
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:11,620
♫  Even if I look more tired than usual, I'll be fine  ♫

922
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:14,900
♫  My tomorrow will shine even brighter  ♫

923
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:19,760
   

924
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,490
 Lee Chan didn't come home last night. 

925
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:25,210
 I've been having nightmares. That's why. 

926
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:26,700
 Where's Mom? Where is she? 

927
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:32,180
 If you go back now, 2023 will be much different than when you left it. 

928
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:34,090
 Do you still want to go back? 

929
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:35,260
 Yoon Cheong Ah? 

930
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,910
 Mom. Mom! 

931
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:38,420
 Sign language is not allowed in this house. 

932
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,330
 What are you doing right now? 

933
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:42,840
 I want to give the world back to your daughter. 

934
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,040
 I want to set it up for her. 

935
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,920
 Lee Chan, it's me. I can't seem to reach you. 

936
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,740
 I found Ha Eun Gyeol.
