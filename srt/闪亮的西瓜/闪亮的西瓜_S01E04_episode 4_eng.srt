1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:11,250


2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,690
   

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,820
   

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,570
   

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,670
   

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,400
   

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,110
   

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,860
   

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,970
 The bright lights come on 

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,550
 and people call my name. 

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,600
Se Kyeong, should we pretend to be surprised? 
    

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, great job.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,630
- Let's smile prettily this time. 
 - Look at her expression. She's like a doll.

14
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,220
Goodness, so pretty.

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,570
Her smile is so pretty.

16
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,460
- Let's take a break briefly. 
 - Okay.

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,960
We'll take a 10-minute break.

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,960
We'll take a 10-minute break.

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,840
 I thought life was supposed to shine like that. 

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,070
Good job.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,680
They say you're so pretty.

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,240
The ice cream on your face.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,440
Ma'am, Se Kyeong is so pretty.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,720
She's like a doll.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,610
Thank you. We're in your care.

26
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,050
Good job, Se Kyeong. Let's take a short break.

27
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,370
Okay.

28
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,640
- By the way, Director. 
 - Yes.

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,790
Doesn't she look like some actress?

30
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,800
Who?

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,570
There was an actress who became famous briefly and disappeared.

32
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,730
Was it Shin Ha Young?

33
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,770
Shin Ha Young?

34
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,310
 Until I heard that name. 

35
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,970
   

36
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,820
Who wants to try this?

37
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,890
- Me! 
 - Get ready.

38
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,300
- Se Kyeong. 
  - Happy birthday. 

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,390
Let's keep this mood going and start the treasure hunt.

40
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,610
Raise your hand if you can have a fun treasure hunt.

41
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,710
- I can. 
 - I can.

42
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,600
Let's start by clapping hands and shouting.

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,640
Let's get the treasure hunt started now.

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,470
Where should we go? Where could it be?

45
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,390
Wow, where is it?

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,680
Goodness, goodness!

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,210
My gosh. She's a kid, and she has a flair for entertaining.

48
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,820
They say she has the entertainer gene.

49
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,140
I guess the rumors are true.

50
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,420
That can't be.

51
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,580
I heard they went through a lot to get the daughter through infertility treatment in the US.

52
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,200
She can never replace our Han Na.

53
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,710
Her blood is... I mean...

54
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,010
she is totally different.

55
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,420
Take your medicine instead of drinking.

56
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,970
Drinking doesn't help at all.

57
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,380
Same with the medicine.

58
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,630
Will Han Na come back to life if I take this?

59
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,910
So, are you suggesting terminating the adoption or something?

60
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,820
Why can't we?

61
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,150
We couldn't even protect our biological daughter.

62
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,010
 The lights suddenly turned off. 

63
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,260
 That's when I started seeing myself clearly. 

64
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,180
 I was... 

65
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,490
 a living doll that a nice husband gifted his wife 

66
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,110
 who was depressed after losing their young daughter. 

67
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,030
I'll be right back.

68
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,660
Mom.

69
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,460
Mom, I want to learn how to play the cello.

70
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,210
 I wanted to shine again. 

71
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,910
   

72
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,500
 Bravo! 

73
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,660
 Bravo, bravo! 

74
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,780
 Bravo! 

75
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,760
 The lights came back on. 

76
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,720
 My life started shining again. 

77
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,370
Geez, why won't he come out?

78
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,600
 Pretty, right? 

79
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,640
 That's me. 

80
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,380
 I was in 11th grade in high school, maybe. 

81
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,050
 It was probably a little before I left to study in the US. 

82
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,240
Ahjumma?

83
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,090
 At least that's what I thought. 

84
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,600
Ahjumma?

85
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,940
Gosh, it's really Ahjumma.

86
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,770
 Until I met this jerk. 

87
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,470
I never would've thought I'd meet you here. Really.

88
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,460
Wow, you really played the cello.

89
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,780
It suits you so well.

90
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,930
You know how to respect adults.

91
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,380
You're a proper young man.

92
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,700
I can talk casually to you. Right?

93
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,840
Of course, you're way older than me—

94
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,510
I'm sorry. You really resemble a lady I know.

95
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,080
How refreshing.

96
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,690
I usually resemble their late mothers or ex-girlfriends.

97
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,500
Oh, don't think we had a connection.

98
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,260
Wait, excuse me.

99
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,220
I'm sorry if I offended you.

100
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,520
But she's very beautiful and intelligent.

101
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,590
Should I be grateful or comforted?

102
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,240
Well, I mean, she's older but still beautiful.

103
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,130
Are you in forbidden love or something?

104
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,020
No, not at all.

105
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,970
She's like a savior to me.

106
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,780
She helped me join a band when I was lost and confused.

107
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,010
Are you in a band, too?

108
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,180
- How imaginative you all are. 
 - Pardon?

109
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,900
Why do men think women are into rock bands?

110
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,160
 I have a show today. 

111
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,630
 Please come if you're free. 

112
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,540
 So you were in a band. 

113
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,410
 My first love was in a band, too. 

114
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,400
 Really? 

115
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,950
 Why do men think women are into rock bands? 

116
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,800
It's really you, isn't it?

117
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,790
Why didn't you come to the show then?

118
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,910
You said you'd come with your daughter.

119
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,930
I have a daughter, too?

120
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,400
Yes, your daughter plays the cello, too—

121
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,210
Hey!

122
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,940
I'll move my hand now.

123
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,070
Please don't scream.

124
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,780
One...

125
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,700
two, three.

126
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,360
Thank you.

127
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,040
Thank you.

128
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,770
Thank you. Thank you.

129
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,820
What a tenacious bastard.

130
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,020
That was a good fight.

131
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,590
Yes, you're right.

132
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,700
I confessed my love to Choi Se Kyeong from the music department.

133
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,870
Gosh, it's kind of embarrassing.

134
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,840
I was immature...

135
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,090
for wanting to start a band because I was in love.

136
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,770
Well.

137
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,390
I should've introduced myself.

138
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,280
My name is Ha Lee Chan.

139
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,620
Watch out. You can get used to having me around.

140
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,420
Well, could you say something? You're embarrassing me.

141
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,820
Could you smile, at least? I feel too awkward.

142
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,370
Who am I talking to?

143
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,980
By the way, why are you staring at my lips?

144
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,390
Is there something on my lips?

145
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,430
There is. My handsomeness.

146
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,520
You're so quiet.

147
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,780
Anyway, thanks for today...

148
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,790
Blood.

149
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,670
Blood!

150
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,080
You're bleeding right here. You're bleeding.

151
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,660
Wow, you're so tough.

152
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,040
H-Hold on.

153
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,020
Where did he go to? Shit...

154
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,350
Hey, hey, hey, hey! This is really bad!

155
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,730
The PE teacher is in front of the storage room.

156
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,020
He's looking for the key right now.

157
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,280
What do we do?

158
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,840
Hurry. What do we do?

159
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,920
Gosh, that little. He's like a rat.

160
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,810
 Where did he learn terrible things like this? 

161
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,490
Open the door right now.

162
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,670
No one's in here.

163
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,180
 How dare you mock an adult like this? 

164
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,000
 How dare you? Damn it! 

165
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,730
- Calm down. 
  - Calm down? 

166
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,960
 - Geez.  
 - Hey.

167
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,390
What's with you?

168
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,000
Why are you just sitting there?

169
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,710
Should I be doing this alone?

170
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,430
Things would get complicated for you, too, if we got caught together.

171
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,790
And how you look right now probably won't help me.

172
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,650
Hey, please help me just this once. I beg you.

173
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,370
 Sir, let's try to talk it out. 

174
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,660
You're mistaken about something.

175
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,380
 - Open the door right now!  
 - Please calm down.

176
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,080
It hurts.

177
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,980
Why is she taking so long to get the key?

178
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,120
Sir, it's not like that.

179
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,000
What's this now?

180
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,930
We didn't lock the door on purpose.

181
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,630
- Sir. 
 - We really didn't.

182
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,580
- My gosh. 
 - You came.

183
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,000
Did you get the key made or something?

184
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,840
- You little. 
 - I'm sorry.

185
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,070
   

186
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:22,120
♫  Will I see the light when the morning comes after this long night?  ♫

187
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:36,100
♫  When will the cold wind coming through the windowsill stop?  ♫

188
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,810
♫  You're my love  ♫

189
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:49,560
♫  You came to my world where I was left behind  ♫

190
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,910
♫  You'll ignite a small light in me  ♫

191
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:03,540
♫  You're precious to me  ♫

192
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,410
Why won't the car come?

193
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,710
Can I ask you one thing for the last time?

194
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,840
Sorry. Ahjumma is busy right now.

195
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,540
L-Let me ask you just one thing.

196
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,320
Is Grandpa...

197
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,970
I mean, is your father doing well?

198
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,090
Why? Aren't you curious about how many spoons we have at home?

199
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,160
I don't care about the spoons. I'm asking about your father.

200
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,630
I'm actually his student.

201
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,580
You're my father's student?

202
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,500
Yes, he's like a mentor and a savior to me in my life.

203
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,950
He was so good to me.

204
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,610
I'd love to visit him sometime. How can I meet him?

205
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,080
I'm sorry, but you don't seem old enough to be a college student.

206
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,110
What did you learn from my dad and where?

207
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,680
How to play the guitar.

208
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,340
He was the best guitarist I know.

209
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,660
You...

210
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,980
Who are you, exactly?

211
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,940
Seriously, my grandma is the best.

212
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,810
She always said if you push a wall, it becomes a bridge.

213
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,810
Who would've thought there was a hole there?

214
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,390
Were you trapped in there, not hiding?

215
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:49,560
No wonder. That's why the metal door was locked with a mop.

216
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,400
I know it's not my business, but tell someone and get help.

217
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,300
No one would know unless you say something.

218
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,690
No, no.

219
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,710
You can't fight on your own.

220
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,300
If you don't have anyone, I'll help you

221
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,290
since we met like this.

222
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,820
There are guys who are PE majors at the boarding house.

223
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,320
Thanks to them, I work out, too.

224
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,230
No need to thank me. Save it for later.

225
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,800
Oh, right. What are the odds we met like this? What's your name?

226
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,110
I told you. I work out, too.

227
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,060
Send me an SOS if you need help.

228
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,190
I'll come with those PE major guys, then.

229
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,670
I'm out now, then.

230
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,510
   

231
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,150
Tell me.

232
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,370
Don't lie and tell me the truth.

233
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,770
Well, I'm not lying.

234
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,710
I told you just now.

235
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,780
He had an instrument shop in the neighborhood I lived in as a kid and—

236
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,140
You're lying.

237
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,580
My dad is a physics professor, and he never had a business.

238
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,530
There's no way.

239
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,320
He definitely said you're his daughter.

240
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,880
Did he say that?

241
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,380
That I'm his daughter?

242
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,270
- Well... 
 -  If you don't mind me asking… 

243
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,840
 may I ask how you know Grandpa? 

244
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,930
 I'm his daughter. 

245
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,220
 I said that? 

246
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,550
I said that myself?

247
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,430
You're out of your mind.

248
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,020
I know it's hard to believe.

249
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,950
I can't tell you right now because I'm in a tricky position—

250
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,360
Tell me now. What tricky situation are you in?

251
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,190
Well...

252
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,590
It's like a science fiction...

253
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,540
My gosh, how do I explain this?

254
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,180
Did he send you?

255
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,960
Did he tell you to check my reaction?

256
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,480
Did he tell you to throw a rock if the surface seemed calm?

257
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,630
- Well— 
 - Did he tell you to insult me if I'm happy?

258
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,220
Did he tell you to trip me if I'm doing well?

259
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,020
Why are you doing this to me, exactly?

260
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,920
Se Kyeong.

261
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,420
What's wrong, Se Kyeong? What's going on?

262
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,640
Se Kyeong?

263
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,700
    
 Did you want to start a band because of her, then?

264
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,980
Do you know each other?

265
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,860
- Yes. 
 - No.

266
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,600
I'm warning you, you two.

267
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,570
Don't ever show up in front of me again.

268
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,150
Se Kyeong. Se Kyeong, hold on.

269
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,160
- Se Kyeong! 
 - Hold on.

270
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,330
Ahjumma was Dad's first love

271
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,200
and Grandpa wasn't Ahjumma's father?

272
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,130
What's going on?

273
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,610
You.

274
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,100
How dare you make Se Kyeong cry?

275
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,700
Who do you think you are?

276
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,400
 Wait! 

277
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,790
 Stop sending me flowers. 

278
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,040
 You should've abandoned your lingering feelings when you abandoned me. 

279
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,800
 Don't ever come to see me again. 

280
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,590
Are you okay?

281
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,900
I'm home.

282
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,750
Hey, you're home, dear.

283
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,270
You must be very tired.

284
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,490
Weren't you on the phone, by the way?

285
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,900
Perfect timing. I just hung up.

286
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,690
Or was it a bad timing?

287
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,600
I was talking to Dad.

288
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,350
I should've come a little earlier.

289
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,980
Wash up and come down. Let's have some tea.

290
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,430
I need to tell you something.

291
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,860
The US? All of a sudden?

292
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,590
Yes, I guess the university wants Dad to stay there permanently.

293
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,190
They said they'd get him a lab, too.

294
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,780
He suggested we all live together.

295
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,050
How about my school, then?

296
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,740
I thought I was aiming to go to Juilliard next year.

297
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,500
Yes, but I thought it'd be good to go earlier and prepare there.

298
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,850
You'll take a language course and take a master's class, too.

299
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,790
That's what I think. What do you think?

300
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,820
Sounds good.

301
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,180
You don't have to think about it?

302
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,400
It just sounds good. I don't want to stay in Korea, anyway.

303
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,750
Why not? Why don't you want to be in Korea?

304
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,310
Is something going on?

305
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,790
No, not at all.

306
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:13,230
I'm happy if you're happy.

307
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,370
Thank you.

308
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,750
You'll always be on my side.

309
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,510
Se Kyeong, go outside. Someone's here to see you.

310
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,920
Oh, me?

311
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,550
Yes.

312
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,240
Hold on. Hold on, Se Kyeong. Hold on.

313
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,580
I'm here to tell you something.

314
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,120
Don't you know what "warning" means?

315
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,430
I do. I'm sorry.

316
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,750
But it's so hard to see you.

317
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,460
Leave before I tell someone.

318
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,780
I'll do it no matter what you say.

319
00:22:54,430 --> 00:23:00,820
I'll make sure to start a band and perform for you.

320
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,630
Yes, I know it started as a playful bet,

321
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,240
but I promised you.

322
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,920
I make sure to keep the promises I made.

323
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,410
So you should keep your promise, too.

324
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,820
Just wait and see how far I go.

325
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,920
You can't even do that?

326
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,490
I think someone's already watching you.

327
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,270
When did he follow me?

328
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,890
Anyway, I came to tell you that.

329
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,540
I'm sorry I've been bugging you.

330
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,320
I'll try not to show up...

331
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,450
in front of you again until I keep my promise.

332
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,440
   

333
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,240
By the way,

334
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,480
do you like Choi Se Kyeong that much?

335
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,090
Just give up.

336
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,300
She'll marry someone else, anyway.

337
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,930
She'll have a pretty daughter and live happily in a nice house.

338
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,210
So, forget about her before you get hurt.

339
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,500
I told you. You're meant to be with someone else—

340
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,530
Are you cursing me right now?

341
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,470
Or are you into getting grabbed by the collar?

342
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,960
I was just telling the truth.

343
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,640
What truth?

344
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,870
Why are you doing this to me, anyway?

345
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,270
You pretended to be Yoon Dong Jin

346
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,490
and you interfere and say bad things about every little thing!

347
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,070
Who the heck are you, exactly?

348
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,990
 I'm... 

349
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,060
 your son. 

350
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,820
W-What?

351
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,070
What is it?

352
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,370
Why are your eyes all gentle?

353
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:54,130
I'm from a world you can't even imagine.

354
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,110
What? Are you a boy from the future or something?

355
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,380
How did you know?

356
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,990
You're really crazy.

357
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,280
I can't believe I expected you to make any sense.

358
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,190
Where are you going? I'm not finished yet.

359
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,970
I'm going to the future. Okay?

360
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,060
Don't follow me.

361
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,180
Don't follow me.

362
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,510
Shit. Hey!

363
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,560
I said I'm not finished.

364
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,240
That bastard.

365
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,300
    
  It really exists. 

366
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,600
 It's Snail Boarding House. I only heard about it from Dad. 

367
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,550
Jackpot.

368
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,970
I need to tell you something. Come here.

369
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,130
What? What are you doing?

370
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,120
 Great-grandma? 

371
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,900
What? What is it? What is it?

372
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,590
Get out. Get out of my house right now.

373
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,870
Grandma, just talk to me instead.

374
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,710
Humans have been using languages for ages.

375
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,450
Why are you doing this today?

376
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,520
Why am I doing this today?

377
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,840
   

378
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,230
 53rd place? 

379
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,400
 He's in 53rd place out of 57 in his class, not out of the school or the country? 

380
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,020
 Dad was a terrible student. 

381
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,880
Fold this up and play Pogs with it or something.

382
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,900
I don't care if you become a beggar or not anymore.

383
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,580
Do you want your grandson to become a beggar?

384
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,810
I'll kill you if you come back alive again.

385
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:34,220
- Ma'am, please— 
 - You'd better leave, too.

386
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,020
They say you shouldn't take in humans and take care of them.

387
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,490
My life has been a waste. A waste.

388
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,350
You said you'd bring a tutor.

389
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:49,100
I thought you'd finally start studying for once.

390
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,510
Grandma.

391
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,820
What are you still doing here?

392
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,140
Take him with you and leave.

393
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,270
 But I have nowhere else to go. 

394
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,210
I'm sorry.

395
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,280
How could you talk to my tutor like that?

396
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,610
I told you. He goes to Chuncheon University of Education.

397
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,390
Tutor, my foot.

398
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,320
He's more like a fly on dead meat.

399
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,260
I-I am a tutor.

400
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:17,230
I'll try to teach him well.

401
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,090
I'll try my hardest to learn from you.

402
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,960
Okay.

403
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,070
   

404
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,150
Grandma, is it really necessary?

405
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,250
Seong Dae.

406
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:59,730
Okay, you have 25 minutes to finish the quiz with 10 questions.

407
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,370
Okay. Ready.

408
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,590
Start.

409
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,670
- I'm done. 
 - Already?

410
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,560
You have 10 more minutes left.

411
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,260
Goodness, Teacher!

412
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,900
My goodness, thank you.

413
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,230
Goodness, sir.

414
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,940
Lee Chan is lacking in a lot of ways.

415
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,370
But I hope you teach him well.

416
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,920
I beg you.

417
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,670
I'll try to turn him into a human.

418
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,110
Am I not a human, then?

419
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,430
Tonight,

420
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,960
we'll have a pork belly party.

421
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,790
 Pork belly! Pork belly! Pork belly! 

422
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,100
 Cheers, cheers, cheers. 

423
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,600
 Here we go! Cheers! 

424
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,160
Hey, give me a wrap.

425
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,620
Yes, put two pieces on the grill.

426
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,120
Why are you looking at me like that?

427
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,550
He was right about how smart-looking you are.

428
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,070
Seasoned green onions and a piece of kimchi, too.

429
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,590
Did Bal San go somewhere?

430
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,040
He wouldn't miss out on stuff like this.

431
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,450
He went to Yangpyeong for a one night/two day school trip yesterday.

432
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,510
Speak of the devil.

433
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:48,140
What? What's this rich and fatty smell like meat?

434
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,640
It's pork belly!

435
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,580
Hey, you ate enough. Get out of here.

436
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,370
Geez, Hyung.

437
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,660
I'll get you plenty of meat. Eat all you want.

438
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,880
- Soju. 
 - Don't drink too much.

439
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,330
 - Okay. Cheers. 
 - Cheers, cheers. 

440
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,950
- Okay. 
  - Cheers! 

441
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,940
We have a new member here.

442
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,380
Hyung, say hello. He's my tutor.

443
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,240
Chuncheon University. Mathematics Education Department. Sophomore.

444
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,780
Yoon Dong Jin. Yoon Dong Jin. He's Yoon Dong Jin.

445
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,450
Chuncheon University of Education.

446
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,300
Yoon Dong Jin?

447
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,440
Why are you so shocked?

448
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,010
Won't you say hello? You said he's the guitar genius you taught.

449
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,320
Bullshit.

450
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,650
You're Dong Jin, aren't you?

451
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,230
How did you get so handsome since the last time I saw you?

452
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,960
I'm Bal San.

453
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,030
Don't you remember?

454
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,590
Dong Jin, please stay like this for a moment.

455
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:55,470
I'll tell you the details later.

456
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,100
I'm sorry,

457
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,070
but they already know I'm not Yoon Dong Jin.

458
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,600
What?

459
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,660
I knew you didn't look like him.

460
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,990
Hyung, come here. Look at me.

461
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,870
Let's try to be honest.

462
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,650
You don't know Yoon Dong Jin, do you?

463
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,330
Okay, okay. Here.

464
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:23,720
It'd be sad not to play music on a day like this.

465
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,570
Okay. Grandma, since Lee Chan found his tutor,

466
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,210
you should sing a song for us.

467
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,250
Hey, I'm too old. I shouldn't be singing.

468
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:50,880
♪  The silent man in a yellow shirt (In a yellow shirt!)  ♪

469
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,950
♪  For some reason (for some reason), I like him (I like him)  ♪

470
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:03,310

♪  He might not be good-looking (might not be good-looking)  ♪

472
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,390
 Dad is singing... 

473
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,540
 with Great-grandma who passed away when I was a kid. 

474
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:26,120
Goodness, goodness, goodness. I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you.

475
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,610
I'm so proud of you. My baby.

476
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,040
I'm so proud of you.

477
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,890
 When I was an infant, 

478
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:39,590
 she apparently checked to see if I reacted to sound several times a day. 

479
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,260
Goodness, you're smiling.

480
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,230
Yes, yes. I know, I know.

481
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,380
How much is this mackerel?

482
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,110
It's 5,000 won if you get all three.

483
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,230
It's too expensive.

484
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,230
But they're double the size.

485
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,850
How much is the mackerel? It's expensive.

486
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:58,010
My gosh, he's already talking.

487
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,660
How old are you?

488
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:11,710
 And when I was able to communicate a bit after I started talking... 

489
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,480
I'm sorry for your loss.

490
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,880
Thank you for coming.

491
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,300
 ...she apparently was able to finally close her eyes in peace. 

492
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,530
 Back in the day, when Dad was 18, 

493
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:41,040
 he laughed a lot, talked a lot, 

494
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,120
 and he was so loud that it was annoying. 

495
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,770
 But how did my dad end up becoming mute? 

496
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,360
 And Grandma must've been so heartbroken... 

497
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,630
 to see him becoming that way. 

498
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:01,070
 What exactly happened to Dad, anyway? 

499
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,340
What? Hey, are you crying?

500
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,730
What do you mean? I'm not.

501
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,150
No, no.

502
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,500
That's soju, not water.

503
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,760
- Goodness gracious... 
 - Wow!

504
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,010
Gosh.

505
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,060
A shot is enough to kill this man.

506
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,050
He passed out after a glass of soju.

507
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,850
He drank a beer glass full of soju. That's different.

508
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,820
I told you not to drink so much.

509
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,120
Grandma, goodnight.

510
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,780
Gosh, seriously.

511
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,560
Why are you making him sleep in my room?

512
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,900
The storage room is empty.

513
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,640
How could I let your tutor sleep in the storage room?

514
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,400
I'll put up wallpaper in there later.

515
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,070
Let him sleep in your room until then.

516
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:56,210
Grandma, don't you know I'm a light sleeper?

517
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,440
 Wow, it's so warm. 

518
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:34,560
 Dad, what's that? It's gross. 

519
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,190
 How did you get that scar? 

520
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,160
 This? 

521
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,600
 I got injured a long time ago. 

522
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,500
 It must've hurt a lot. 

523
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,160
 When did that happen? 

524
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,750
 When was it? 

525
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,920
What did you say?

526
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,540
I can't see.

527
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,450
I can't see.

528
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,440
I can't see, Dad.

529
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,530
I can't see, Dad.

530
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,030
Why do you keep...

531
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,360
keep calling me?

532
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,210
I got a call from your mother this morning.

533
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,150
I heard you're studying abroad sooner than planned.

534
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,000
Yes. The situation changed a bit.

535
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,890
That's a good thing.

536
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,220
The younger you are studying abroad, the better.

537
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,120
You'll get used to things faster, too.

538
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,350
But I'm sure you'll do well, anyway.

539
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,520
Thank you.

540
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,930
But I want you to keep it a secret for now.

541
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,660
Art students are already sensitive and delicate.

542
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:17,100
I can't let them waste time being jealous at an important time like this.

543
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,120
It's to create a better atmosphere for studying.

544
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,520
I'll do as you say.

545
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,860
Gosh, you're so considerate, Se Kyeong.

546
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,350
By the way, Se Kyeong.

547
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:33,390
Being considerate isn't always a good thing.

548
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:38,480
Feeling superior can damage others' self-esteem.

549
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,870
Pardon?

550
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,810
I heard you're nice to Cheong Ah.

551
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,900
I'm thankful for it,

552
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,250
but pitying her only makes her weak.

553
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,530
She needs to grow strong.

554
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:55,550
That's also why I enrolled her in a regular school instead of a school for the disabled.

555
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,320
Chairwoman, I don't pity her—

556
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,690
Okay.

557
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:02,570
That's what we'll do as far as your studying abroad goes.

558
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:07,680
Could you tell your mother that I'd like to have dinner with her before she leaves?

559
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,070
Yes.

560
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,710
Okay.

561
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,930
Were you waiting for me?

562
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,910
 Why did you see the chairwoman? 

563
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,630
 Was it about Ha Lee Chan of Baegwang High breaking into our school? 

564
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,000
 Are you curious? 

565
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,580
 Nothing's free in this world. 

566
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,840
 I'm leaving to study abroad next week. 

567
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,290
 That's why I went to the chairwoman's office. 

568
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,320
 But it's a secret for now. 

569
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,060
 It's the chairwoman's order. 

570
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,800
 Only you know about this. 

571
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,620
It's a secret.

572
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,630
Did you see this?

573
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,460
   

574
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,720
It's at 8:00 tonight.

575
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,650
It's at Myeongse University's outdoor theater.

576
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,690
Make sure to come. Okay?

577
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,360
Promise.

578
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,710
Mom...

579
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,930
get me some water.

580
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,100
Mom.

581
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,380
My head hurts.

582
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:03,320
 One. Remember, this symbiotic relationship is only temporary. 

583
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,720
 Two. These are my favorite clothes. Make sure not to damage them. 

584
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,100
- Yes, this is Snail— 
  - I'm glad you answered. 

585
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,560
I forgot my gym clothes.

586
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,830
Bring them to school for me.

587
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,540
In five minutes. Hurry.

588
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,800
H-Hello? Hello...

589
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,190
- Hello? 
  - Bring two watermelon popsicles on the way. 

590
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,580
Excuse me, where's the classroom for 11th grade, Class 3?

591
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:10,060
Go in there, turn at the end of the hallway, and go to the third floor.

592
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,360
I see, thank you.

593
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,430
   

594
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:28,850
   

595
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,230
   

596
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:03,860
Wow, this is the same acoustic guitar he played when I was a kid.

597
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:13,310
I wouldn't have sold it if only I knew.

598
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,520
   

599
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:37,560
Will this really get us new members?

600
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,890
We'll get disbanded if we don't get all members by next week.

601
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,780
We need to do everything we can.

602
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,560
Let's go.

603
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,250
   

604
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,980
Why don't we implore the Baegwang band again?

605
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,300
I heard Kang Hyeon Yul used the club room as his bedroom and a secret meeting place.

606
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,310
It won't be good for him, either, if we get disbanded.

607
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,730
You think I haven't tried?

608
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,880
He wasn't willing to listen at all.

609
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,080
I'm thirsty.

610
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,850
Is he harvesting watermelon? Where are the popsicles?

611
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:05,510
Gosh, I can't believe you.

612
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:07,230
You're making your tutor run errands.

613
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,840
So what? He'd better do it if he wants to be a freeloader.

614
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,230
So? Did you try talking to him?

615
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,610
If he's not Yoon Dong Jin, who is he exactly?

616
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:19,100
I don't know. He only talks nonsense whenever I ask him a question.

617
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,330
I think he's probably a runaway teen.

618
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:24,230
He said he plays the guitar, right?

619
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,450
Why don't we listen to him playing?

620
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,100
You never know. He might actually be talented.

621
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,860
Gosh, there's no way.

622
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:33,710
99.99999% of what he says is a lie.

623
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:36,670
He's a psycho and says he's from the future. What could I expect?

624
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,300
Are the kids from the broadcasting club out of their minds?

625
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,090
Why are they playing music again?

626
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,310
I don't think this is coming from the speakers.

627
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,460
- It's the band practice room. 
 - It's the band practice room.

628
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:56,280
Who was it?

629
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,360
Hey, Kang Hyeon Yul, did you see who was playing the guitar here?

630
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,350
Yes, I did.

631
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:08,100
Who was it? Where did he go?

632
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,050
- Do you want a bite? 
 - Geez...

633
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:11,870
J-Just answer the question.

634
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,450
What grade and class is he in?

635
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,410
He doesn't go to our school.

636
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:18,430
Go to the bus stop if you're so curious.

637
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:22,230
He just left. You could catch him if you run out now.

638
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,610
Won't you ask me what he looks like?

639
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,580
- What does he look like? 
 - What does he look like?

640
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,620
- Good-looking. 
  - Screw you. 

641
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,480
Stop, stop, stop.

642
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,350
Search inside the building, just in case.

643
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,340
I'll go toward the bus stop.

644
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:49,340
Catch anyone handsome who doesn't go to our school.

645
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,570
- Okay. 
 - Go.

646
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,510
My gosh.

647
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:04,380
I went to 11th grade, Class 3, but they were already out of their gym class.

648
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,040
Why did you make me bring your gym clothes?

649
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:11,790
That's why I told you to come out in five minutes.

650
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,490
I'm in a hurry right now. I need to go.

651
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,240
You still have a class left. Where are you going?

652
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,820
Let go. Let go for a second.

653
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,760
I need to go recruit a member.

654
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,740
I'll miss him if I don't go now.

655
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,080
I-I can't save the band otherwise.

656
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:28,030
I wrote a good example sentence with a compound relative pronoun on the blackboard.

657
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:31,230
I'll read it and translate it.

658
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:36,410
"Whoever would be great among you must be a servant."

659
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,600
- Whoever would be— 
 - Leave, I said.

660
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,730
Ha Lee Chan! Focus!

661
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:41,920
Yes, Teacher.

662
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,580
My class is legendary.

663
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,490
Wow.

664
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:19,370
♫  Tell me about loneliness  ♫

665
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:25,970
♫  This must be a feeling like a wind blowing  ♫

666
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:34,850
♫  I'll tell you about sadness  ♫

667
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:39,990
♫  That must be a feeling like a sleeve that's getting wet in the rain  ♫

668
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,820
 The left hand... 

669
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,890
 only supports. 

670
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:50,780
♫  In front of the days I let go  ♫

671
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:58,470
♫  I'm stopping right now  ♫

672
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:03,290
♫  Which way should I go?  ♫

673
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:07,110
   

674
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:14,700
♫  If only I had you to hold my hand warmly  ♫

675
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:22,940
♫  I would've leaned on you without a word and face the night approaching  ♫

676
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,830
 You didn't say you'd leave. 

677
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,860
 What am I supposed to do? 

678
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,840
 I miss you, Se Kyeong. 

679
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,190
   

680
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,050
I took the class.

681
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,470
We were dismissed.

682
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:51,730
What's the problem?

683
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:53,750
You'll be in 12th grade next year. What part-time job?

684
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,820
You really won't go to college?

685
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,960
No, I won't.

686
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,870
Happy?

687
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:02,750
   

688
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,330
I'm here, sir.

689
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:06,260
- Hey, you came. 
 - Yes.

690
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,550
Who is he? Is he your add-on?

691
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:09,840
Don't worry about him.

692
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,400
I'll use him and get rid of him soon.

693
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,690
He's too good-looking for that.

694
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,180
Oh, right.

695
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,660
A female student left this earlier. She asked me to give it to you.

696
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,650
- A female student? 
 - Yes.

697
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,210
   

698
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,330
 I was actually surprised that you were into rock bands. 

699
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,740
 I'm embarrassed that I thought you didn't know music. 

700
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,860
 Would you like to go to a rock concert with me? 

701
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,260
 Se Kyeong. 

702
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:52,020
Sir, I can't work today.

703
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,840
He'll work instead. He will. Bye.

704
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,280
Hey, where are you going this time?

705
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,440
Going somewhere?

706
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,580
Yes, I should go.

707
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,600
 Oppa, can you take our orders? 

708
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,810
I don't work here...

709
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:09,520
Sir, I don't have time for this.

710
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,130
I can't give you ice cream. I'm a customer, too.

711
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,970
You're so handsome.

712
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,610
Thank you, but I can't...

713
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,830
   

714
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,120
Thank you.

715
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,050
   

716
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:09,770
♫  The girl I'm not interested in keeps calling me  ♫

717
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:16,660
♫  The one I'm calling keeps avoiding me  ♫

718
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,860
♫  With so many interesting people out in the streets  ♫

719
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:31,500
♫  Why do I meet only girls like this on my blind dates?  ♫

720
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,380
♫  Over here, here, here!  ♫

721
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,840
♫  Just like other friends, I also...  ♫

722
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,350
My gosh!

723
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,870
Ji Hwan is so cool, isn't he?

724
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:50,090
♫  I also want to date a girl I really like  ♫

725
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:57,220
♫  Just like my other friends  ♫

726
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:07,770
♫  I also want to date a girl I really like  ♫

727
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,430
Wow, it's so far away.

728
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:15,550
The uphill is making me puke.

729
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:17,940
I'm dying.

730
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,420
What? Is it already over?

731
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,950
Damn it! Hey!

732
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,200
Run!

733
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,540
One, two, three.

734
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:40,110
Se Kyeong!

735
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,650
What?

736
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,200
Isn't that Ha Lee Chan?

737
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,410
Ha Lee Chan?

738
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:49,190
I told you last time. There's a psycho who's pursuing Se Kyeong.

739
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:51,340
That's him.

740
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:57,510
I'm sorry. I came too late.

741
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:58,870
The ticket...

742
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:02,090
I saw the ticket too late.

743
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,270
Is the show already over?

744
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,820
How did you know I was here?

745
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:09,430
You gave me a ticket.

746
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:15,010
To be honest, I didn't think I'd get to see you before the festival.

747
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:16,430
Thank you for inviting me, Se Kyeong.

748
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:18,870
Who invited you...

749
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,430
Let me make it clear.

750
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,300
I didn't invite you.

751
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,860
Are you writing a novel or something?

752
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,140
What are you talking about?

753
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,130
I definitely have the ticket and letter you wrote—

754
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:34,140
Enough is enough! Please!

755
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:46,160
You promised that you'd never show up in front of me again.

756
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,800
You said you always keep the promises you made.

757
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,390
Do you have amnesia?

758
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:54,750
It's not that. Well, I don't know where things went wrong, but—

759
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,190
Do you even want to be in a band?

760
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:00,550
You just want to get girls' attention.

761
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,140
You don't even have a band, anyway.

762
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,970
Who said he doesn't have a band?

763
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,370
We meet again.

764
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,500
But you don't look too happy about it.

765
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,110
Who's he—

766
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:20,820
I'm Ha Eul Gyeol, the guitarist of Fake First Love Memory-Makers.

767
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:25,230
You two are completely dismissing my warning.

768
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:26,880
Come on now.

769
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,440
Nice to meet you. I'm Ohn Ji Hwan.

770
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,290
I didn't know Se Kyeong had rocker friends.

771
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,830
Would you like to jam with us since you missed the show?

772
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,660
Oppa, you don't have to do that.

773
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,700
I don't see why not.

774
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:43,360
Could I borrow your guitar for a second?

775
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,600
Do you want to pick a song?

776
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,650
Get started. We'll follow your lead.

777
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:51,640
Let's do "Man in a Yellow Shirt" in a rock 'n' roll version.

778
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:55,500
Hey, what are you going to do?

779
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,680
What's a jam? I only know strawberry jams.

780
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,810
Just do what you normally do. Like what you did last night.

781
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,530
Have fun. That's what rock is all about.

 I can't believe it. 

797
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:29,140
 Dad and I are singing together. 

798
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:32,170
 Dad is listening to me playing. 

799
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:40,600
   

800
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:53,060


801
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,930
You play the guitar pretty well.

802
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:00,710
I told you I'm pretty good.

803
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,490
Well, um...

804
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:08,230
You said you'd join instead of Yoon Dong Jin—

805
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,200
Fake First Love Memory-Makers...

806
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,950
Yes, yes. That's it.

807
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:13,200
Are you still interested in joining—

808
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,920
- Do you really have to do it? 
 - What?

809
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,450
Hey, how many times did I tell you?

810
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:19,600
I will. I have to.

811
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,220
Because of Choi Se Kyeong?

812
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,320
Even after being humiliated like that?

813
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,260
Yes.

814
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:28,320
It's also for my last bit of youth.

815
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:31,790
As soon as I finish high school,

816
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:34,200
I'll start making money instead of going to college.

817
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,100
Once I save up money from working hard,

818
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:43,520
I'll set up a Korean restaurant for my grandma that my dad lost.

819
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,630
That means my high school years are

820
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:48,960
the last years of my school days.

821
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,880
And that means I have to shine with all the sparkle.

822
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,750
I'll try everything I can try.

823
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,570
Whether it's love or being in a band,

824
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:58,640
I'll do anything that can make me shine.

825
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:05,650
Hey, hold on.

826
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:08,130
Watch out!

827
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:19,010
 Dad, how did you get that scar? 

828
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,600
 When I was a kid, 

829
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,220
 I got into a big accident. 

830
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:26,450
 When I was in 11th grade in high school. 

831
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,760
My gosh, my gosh. Hey!

832
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,510
Hey, what did you do?

833
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:39,230
Are you crazy? Are you a pervert?

834
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:42,490
He doesn't have a scar.

835
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,320
What scar?

836
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,090
 The accident Dad mentioned hasn't happened yet. 

837
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:22,450
♫  I'm alone on top of the clock's hand  ♫

838
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:29,070
♫  All the days I've run, all that time  ♫

839
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:33,860
   

840
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:36,270
 I'll change Dad's future no matter what. 

841
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:38,960
 That's the reason why I time-traveled to the year 1995. 

842
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,230
 Thanks to you, Se Kyeong thinks I'm a total loser. 

843
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,240
 Are you happy now? 

844
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,580
 What's the point? Choi Se Kyeong left to study abroad. 

845
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:48,760
 Would anyone truly be sad that I left? 

846
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,440
 The great Kang Hyeon Yool is having a battle with some bastard. 

847
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,390
 Let's not just work hard. Let's do well. 

848
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:58,220
 I have to find Mom quickly and make them meet in advance. 

849
01:02:58,220 --> 01:02:59,790
 What did you just say? 

850
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:03,010
 Who's going where?
