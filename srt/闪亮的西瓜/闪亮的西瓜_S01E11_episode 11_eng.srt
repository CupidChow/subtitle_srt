11
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,500
All right.

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,720
    
 Hey, kick him.

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,580
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

14
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,910
We would've just let you go if you kindly gave us the money.

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,850
This is the issue with Korean high schoolers.

16
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,370
It is a serious issue.

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,300
What's the issue?

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,690
These bastards think we're actually nice if we're nice to them.

19
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,610
What uncreative bastards.

20
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,280
Update your lines if you can't reform.

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,060
It's been years. Aren't you sick of them?

22
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,680
Hey.

23
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,050
What are you doing here? Gosh.

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,440
Go. Don't get picked on again.

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,560
Thank you. Thank you.

26
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,890
What are you doing, Kang Hyeon Yool?

27
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,330
Being a bully is a tough job, too. Right?

28
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,930
You have to find out their pager numbers, lie to make them come out,

29
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,200
and you have to mug them while saying lame lines.

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,470
Thanks to you, a job might be created in the future.

31
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,760
The name of the job would be...

32
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,600
How's voice phishing?

33
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,830
You son of a bitch.

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,200
Hey, hey, hey.

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,030
What are you doing? Kick him!

36
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,640
- No, no, no. 
 - Bastard!

37
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,990
Get over there.

38
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,100
Did you mess with our frontman?

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,570
Who the hell is that!

40
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,180
The one who was putting this up.

41
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,510
You cracked open his head and made him bleed.

42
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,100
Why do you care?

43
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,280
Why wouldn't I care?

44
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,750
We can't perform at the festival if our frontman gets injured and

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,830
I'd lose all of my future female fans.

46
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,150
Wow, you're quite an entertainer now.

47
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,400
I'm warning you.

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,050
Don't mess with our kids again.

49
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:59,720
Hey, Do Jin will be on parole soon.

50
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,720
Be careful at night.

51
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,320
You might get stabbed in the back.

52
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,350
Go tell Do Jin.

53
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,370
That we live in different worlds now.

54
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,600
Tell him we should live clean where we belong.

55
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,930
Hey, who's that bastard?

56
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,810
 Jeong Do Jin's right-hand man. 

57
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,850
 He was No. 2 of the Jindo Dog Gang 

58
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,070
 and he stabbed Do Jin in the back and left on the day of some incident. 

59
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:42,760
 But now he's tearing up the bass with once-bloodied hands. 
   

60
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,490
Listen up.

61
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,600
There are three reasons why people betray.

62
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,770
Either they found a better option,

63
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,270
they had no choice because their lives were threatened,

64
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,370
or...

65
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,920
 they grew to like something enough to risk their lives. 

66
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,610
 Didn't Hyeon Yool come with you? 

67
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,970
 Gosh, he's so disloyal. 

68
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,430
 What are you doing? Didn't you hear what they called you? 

69
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,510
What happened to his face?

70
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,810
I had a fight with a Jindo dog while putting up flyers.

71
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,060
 In any case, there's one thing that's for certain. 

72
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,470
It was a good fight.

73
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,870
In the end,

74
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,880
that ends up being their weakness.

75
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,260
   

76
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,050
- Thank you, Father. 
 - Yes, see you later.

77
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,130
Let's rest a bit.

78
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,020
Guys!

79
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,150
We got T-shirts for Watermelon!

80
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,090
Hey, it's so pretty. It's so pretty!

81
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,200
- Hey, look, look. 
 - Why are you pulling your pants down?

82
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,200
So pretty, so pretty. Hey...

83
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,160
Are you putting them on or taking them off?

84
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,100
If you were taking them off, stop. If you were putting them on, finish it.

85
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,760
There's no time.

86
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,340
Okay, okay. Let's get dolled up and start the poster photoshoot.

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,150
Come here, come here.

98
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,350
One, two, three.

99
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,360
 Sugar! 

100
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,370
Left foot. Right foot.

101
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,730
Hey, come quick.

102
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,320
The right foot! The right foot!

103
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,790
The right foot.

104
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:46,610
♫  Erase the times that have already passed  ♫

105
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,080
 Just one moment. Let's draw some lines on the watermelons. 

106
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,970
♫  Don't look back, you won't have any regrets  ♫

107
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,450
♫  No need to hesitate  ♫

108
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:03,710
♫  This chance won't come again, so let's begin  ♫

109
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,320
♫  The days that shone so bright  ♫

110
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,620
♫  All our full dreams (shining, shining) just like now  ♫

111
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,190
♫  Don't stop here like this, right now  ♫

112
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,710
♫  Run without looking back  ♫

113
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:24,120
♫  So you can dream again, higher, higher, fly higher  ♫

114
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,320
♫  I hope this moment lasts forever  ♫

115
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,000
Here we go.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,540
One, two, three. Jump.

117
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,120
 Hey! 

118
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,460
   

119
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,320
   

120
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,550
   

121
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,920
♫  I hope this moment lasts forever  ♫

122
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,220
   

123
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,340
Aren't they Fake First Love Memory-Makers?

124
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,040
Huh? You're right. They're the fakers.

125
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,990
I thought they got disbanded since we took their room.

126
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,590
Who's that?

127
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,570
Who said we disbanded?

128
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,190
We resurrected as Watermelon Sugar.

129
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,900
Is Choi Se Kyeong coming to the festival, then?

130
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,940
We made bets. What are the odds you'd succeed?

131
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,250
Hey, hey, tell me right now.

132
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,010
- I bet 10,000 won. 
 - I bet 20,000 won.

133
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,240
Go all-in.

134
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,380
You'll hit the jackpot soon.

135
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,320
Really?

136
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,840
- That's mine. 
  - Really? 

137
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,300
Will you really go to Baegwang High's festival?

138
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,070
I'm not sure. What should I do?

139
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,890
Who will you choose? Ha Lee Chan? Ha Eun Gyeol?

140
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,980
I don't know. Who should I choose?

141
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,940
Don't be like that and tell us.

142
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,640
Who will you choose? Huh?

143
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,520
Can't you just choose Ha Lee Chan?

144
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,140
Let's keep Ha Eun Gyeol as a public option.

145
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,410
Public option?

146
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,770
Yes. Each household needs Eun Gyeol.

147
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,090
You shouldn't keep him to yourself.

148
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,100
Try to be humanitarian. Please.

149
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,080
What are you doing here?

150
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,130
"Eun Gyeol, you must be tired from cleaning the pool every day.

151
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,330
Eat this and cheer up."

152
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,590
You might cheer up too much and turn this into a water park.

153
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,980
Shouldn't you be in class right now?

154
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,860
Yes. I'm playing hooky.

155
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,330
You're pretty athletic.

156
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,080
You saw me.

157
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,340
I've been going to the gym since I was a kid, thanks to my brother.

158
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,790
When I was learning taekwondo, I was offered to join the national team, too.

159
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,190
What? Is there something on my face?

160
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,780
Looks like you smile too easily.

161
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,760
I do?

162
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,250
Puppies wag their tails whenever they see people.

163
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,140
And Ha Eun Gyeol smiles whenever he sees a woman.

164
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,390
It must be hard to smile at everyone.

165
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:33,850
Should I just cut your mouth open for you?

166
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,870
I think you just threatened me.

167
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,060
No, right? I'm mistaken. Right?

168
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,340
Be good.

169
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,580
The festival is two days away.

170
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,600
Let's maintain suspense for the people who made bets.

171
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,280
Suspense?

172
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,170
What suspense?

173
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:54,300
Hey, you want to be chosen. There's no suspense if you don't show any effort.

174
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,970
Geez. This isn't fun, moving, or impactful. Geez!

175
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,970
What? What's wrong? Are you okay?

176
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,350
What's wrong? What's going on?

177
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,970
- Water. Give me water. 
 - Okay.

178
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,140
What's wrong? Are you okay? Is something stuck in your throat?

179
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,060
Wow. Wow. I almost died.

180
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,100
I'm not good at eating spicy food.

181
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,390
 He can't eat spicy food? 

182
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,890
- Do you think this is spicy? 
 - You don't think it is?

183
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,850
This isn't spicy. A newborn could eat it.

184
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,870
How could a newborn eat this?

185
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,900
You coward. Dummy. You're an idiot who can't even handle spice!

186
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,490
Wait...

187
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,670
Could someone tell me what I did wrong?

188
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,270
Gosh, I'm crazy. Why am I disappointed?

189
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,800
Am I IU? Is Ha Eun Gyeol "My Mister"? 
  (Referring to a Korean drama) 

190
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,760
Get it together. He's an old man who's the same age as Mom.

191
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,790
I'm looking for Mom's first love. Not mine.

192
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,030
What am I doing right now...

193
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,830
Couldn't you just eat it, Ha Eun Gyeol?

194
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,760
   

195
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,680
Hey, hey, hey! Hey.

196
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,190
Gather around for a moment.

197
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,440
The Festival Committee just decided on the order of rehearsal.

198
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,390
Really? When do we go? When?

199
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,960
Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. at the gym.

200
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,830
 Okay! Nice! Nice! 

201
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,390
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

202
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,960
Remember. This is our only rehearsal. You can never be late.

203
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,980
Of course, you can't skip it, either. Okay?

204
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,780
 - Okay, okay! 
 - And what else? 

205
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,110
We'll check lighting, sound, movement, order, and everything. Just so you know.

206
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,150
 Okay, okay! We can do it. We can do it. Okay. 

207
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,450
My dad will move the instruments and bags with his truck tomorrow.

208
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,690
Check until the last minute to make sure you didn't forget the outfit and the supplies.

209
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,430
 - Okay, okay.  
 - And most importantly,

210
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,380
remember we updated the set list, okay—

211
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,480
Gosh, stop nagging us. Seriously.

212
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,830
This is taking too long. Just do one verse.

213
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,880
Really? I'll eat the meat alone, then.

214
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,360
- Meat? 
 - Meat?

215
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,350
Our No. 1 fan is treating us, but I'll go by myself.

216
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,570
 Hey! 

217
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,660
Who's our No. 1 fan?

218
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,880
To hope for Watermelon Sugar's successful debut,

219
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,530
should we lubricate our throats a bit?

220
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,530
Let's lubricate our throats now. Meat. Meat. Meat.

221
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,140
Hey, I like the oil dipping sauce.

222
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,320
- Hey. 
 - What do you think?

223
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,860
- Hey, it's so good. 
 - I know. Right?

224
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,770
This is a special present for the band manager who works hard behind the scenes.

225
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,260
It's not pork. It's beef.

226
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,180
 - Wow.  
 - Thank you.

227
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,800
I agree. We wouldn't have gotten this far without Ma Joo.

228
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,880
- I won't steal it. 
 - I'll steal it, then.

229
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,100
Aren't you sad that you can't be on stage?

230
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,420
Not so much.

231
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,600
Maybe it's because I'm a merchant's son.

232
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,440
I find it more fun to plan things with people, promote, negotiate, and stuff like that.

233
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,890
Wow, you have the mindset of a producer.

234
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,600
Producer? What's that?

235
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,200
Someone who plans, promotes, and manages finances for records.

236
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,880
Oh, is there a job like that?

237
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,090
Of course, there is.

238
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,700
A&amp;R is big overseas these days. That'd suit you, too.

239
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,640
A-A&amp;R? What's that?

240
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,110
You discover artists with potential,

241
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,010
find their repertoire, and plan things for them.

242
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,360
John Kalodner is a famous example.

243
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,800
John... John Kalodner...

244
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,790
- What knife? 
 - That's perfect for you. 
  (Kalodner sounds like "hold a knife" in Korean) 

245
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,120
Really? Does that suit me?

246
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,830
What do you think? Do you think I'd be good?

247
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,470
You?

248
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,750
You'd be very good at it.

249
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,970
Very much, Ma Joo.

250
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,520
How about MJ for the company name? Your initials.

251
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,310
- MJ? 
 - MJ. Ma Joo. Ma Joo.

252
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,380
Whoa, not bad. It sounds cool.

253
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,900
Make sure to start it. I'll send you an impressive garland.

254
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,400
Come on. Could you help me sign a contract with Yoon Dong Jin instead?

255
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,240
My goodness. Have you already finished a business plan?

256
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,820
You're pretty ambitious for wanting Yoon Dong Jin.

257
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,080
- I'll be right back. 
  - You know Yoon Dong Jin. Right? 

258
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,380
 Of course, he's the godfather of Korean rock. 

259
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,620
 Oh Ma Joo is the person who raised Yoon Dong Jin to be the best artist that he is. 

260
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,320
 He was his manager from the very beginning. 

261
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,670
 So that's when you met President Oh Ma Joo. 

262
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,790
 Yes, I'm sick and tired of him. It's been 29 years. 

263
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,700
 Are any of the other members still doing music? 

264
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,920
 Nothing. Only one. 

265
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,800
 We disbanded pretty soon. 

266
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,460
 One of our members got into big trouble. 

267
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,150
 Thanks to him, the festival performance was canceled, and the band just disappeared. 

268
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,770
 The only thing that lasted was my relationship with Oh Ma Joo. 

269
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:28,820
 It must've been a serious accident if the band got disbanded. 

270
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,790
 It was serious. 

271
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,970
 One of the members got seriously injured because of that. 

272
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,650
- Cheers to scouting him. 
 - Hey, hey.

273
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,840
 MJ. 

274
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,110
What's wrong?

275
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,600
 Do you remember when that accident happened? 

276
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,930
 Of course, I remember very clearly. 

277
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,550
 May 1995. The day before the festival. 

278
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,310
 It happened while rehearsing. 

279
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,100
 I had forgotten. 

280
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,610
 Yoon Dong Jin was originally a member of Fake First Love Memory-Makers. 

281
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,610
 - And... 
 - What a shame. 

282
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:09,520
 I have already sent a helper who suits you perfectly. 

283
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,550
 If Yoon Dong Jin was the helper Master was referring to... 

284
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:19,020
 If Yoon Dong Jin's interview was a hint to the date of the accident... 

285
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:25,320
 If the member who got seriously injured during rehearsal was my dad... 

286
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,780
I said what's wrong! You're scaring me!

287
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,150
Have something to say to me?

288
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,790
 Dad gets into the accident on the rehearsal day. Tomorrow. 

289
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,010
Hey! Where are you going in the middle of a meal?

290
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,770
Answer, please!

291
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,890
You can hear me. Right? You're listening right now. Right?

292
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,510
Is Yoon Dong Jin the helper you were referring to?

293
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:07,510
Is my dad the member who gets injured during the rehearsal tomorrow?

294
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,840
Answer me, please!

295
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,730
What's happening tomorrow?

296
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,880
Who gets injured

297
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,850
and who causes the accident? Please!

298
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,200
Gosh, I'm full.

299
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,720
I feel like I'm pregnant with a pig.

300
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,100
Let me know when you give birth. I'll hold your hand.

301
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,540
Wow. We finally get to rehearse after all the troubles we went through.

302
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,300
Wow, why am I so nervous about it?

303
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,010
- Just croak if you're scared. 
 - Who said I'm scared?

304
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,740
I'm reaching the boiling point of my passion.

305
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,460
Should we practice again since we had meat?

306
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,940
Should we go to the practice room now?

307
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:50,610
Nope. Mr. Genius, who's better on stage, is leaving.

308
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,710
Me, too. Bye.

309
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,130
Hey.

310
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,860
You're more of a troublemaker than a genius, aren't you?

311
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,550
Sorry. I need to take care of my skin today and tomorrow.

312
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,840
I need to sleep so my skin can rejuvenate.

313
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,200
Are you competing to be Miss Korea?

314
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,300
I need to look good on stage to be chosen by Se Kyeong.

315
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,170
Hey.

316
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,880
 Do Jin will be on parole soon. 

317
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,020
 Be careful at night. 

318
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,710
 You might get stabbed in the back. 

319
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,340
Who are you?

320
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,760
I-I'm sorry.

321
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,920
I wanted to thank you for last time,

322
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,350
but I didn't have the courage.

323
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,490
What are you, fish?

324
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,900
Why do you get tricked so easily?

325
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,100
Thank you so much for last time, Senior.

326
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,020
I'll come to the festival to cheer you on. Fighting.

327
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,160
Fighting. Okay.

328
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,200
Go now.

329
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,750
- Okay. 
 - Hurry.

330
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,010
- Okay. 
 - Go, go.

331
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,400
Don't worry, Kang Hyeon Yol.

332
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,510
It's not time yet.

333
00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:00,540
It's more fun to step on the flower field when it's in bloom.

334
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,580
You scared me.

335
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,940
What's with you?

336
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,230
Did you see a pig farmer because you were so moved by the pork?

337
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,970
Lee Chan...

338
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,970
I have a favor to ask you.

339
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,420
I hope you do this for me.

340
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,150
Stop sounding serious and tell me.

341
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,280
What? You want Grandma's food?

342
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,920
Let's not rehearse tomorrow.

343
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,880
Hey, someone who understands you is over there. Talk to him instead.

344
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,180
We've practiced a lot lately.

345
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,750
We won't have any issues at the festival even if we don't rehearse tomorrow.

346
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,120
So...

347
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,210
Why do you always do this?

348
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,860
I'm not saying we shouldn't perform.

349
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,500
It's just the rehearsal tomorrow—

350
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,510
So why do you want to skip the only rehearsal we get?

351
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,540
There must be a reason why you're doing this.

352
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,750
This isn't something I can explain with words.

353
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,860
So, could you just have faith in me and listen to me?

354
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,500
Why? Were you sent from space for a mission?

355
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,610
They can conquer the universe if our band fails?

356
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,730
- Lee Chan. 
 - What comes after the rehearsal?

357
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,690
That we shouldn't do the festival?

358
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,780
Will you say we should die after that?

359
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,300
And I have to trust you and listen to you every time?

360
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,860
- Lee Chan. 
 - Don't you have any sense of professionalism?

361
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,670
Gosh, please!

362
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,430
It's just a high school band we started to seduce girls. We aren't pros!

363
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,250
Hey!

364
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,730
Okay.

365
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,290
Let's.

366
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,200
Let's do it.

367
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,190
But...

368
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,550
you can't be there. Okay?

369
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:53,050
We'll figure out the rehearsal on our own tomorrow. Okay?

370
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,310
Forget it.

371
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,070
I can't listen when you aren't making sense.

372
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,440
Lee Chan, please. Please?

373
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,810
Did you know you've always been disloyal to our band?

374
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:07,950
You pretend to be pure, innocent, and sincere a lot,

375
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,850
but I can tell there was something impure going on.

376
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,790
I was curious, but I never asked you.

377
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,480
I just let you even though I felt nervous.

378
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,730
I didn't want the rest of the band to get hurt by stirring things up!

379
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,320
I just! I just let it be pure.

380
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,400
But you have to...

381
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,690
ruin things...

382
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,760
until the very last minute?

383
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,950
Lee Chan, please. Please?

384
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,800
Fine. Don't do it.

385
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,060
You shouldn't do it.

386
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,480
But I will. No matter what.

387
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,080
I'll do it no matter what happens!

388
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,450
Lee Chan. Lee Chan!

389
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,210
Open the door for a second!

390
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,950
 What do I do? How do I stop him? 

391
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,530
 How will I make him? 

392
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,840
 Should I lock him up? Tie him up? 

393
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,450
 Make him faint? Kidnap him? Or... 

394
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,520
He's in his mid-40s if he's the same age as Mom.

395
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,770
He must've changed drastically with the passage of time.

396
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,520
He must have a gut and hair loss by default.

397
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,330
And he might wear toe socks because of athlete's foot.

398
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,710
His pores must be as large as a stadium

399
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,100
and oil must flow out of them, too.

400
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,900
The reality hit.

401
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,710
I feel so put off now.

402
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,220
Who's this?

403
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,020
 It's me, Ha Eun Gyeol. 

404
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,360
 Could we talk for a second if you don't mind? 

405
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,670
My gosh...

406
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,890
I was sleeping. What's this about?

407
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,640
I'm sorry to bother you at night.

408
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,050
I came to ask you a favor.

409
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,150
- I really need you to do this for me. 
 - I see...

410
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,180
But you came empty-handed.

411
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,480
Have manners and come with an armful of stuff.

412
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Please help me!

413
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,330
It's something only you can do.

414
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,910
I beg you.

415
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,080
Newspaper.

416
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,570
 Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! 

417
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,420
 Encore! Encore! 

418
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,980
 Encore! Encore! Encore! 

419
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,680
 Encore! Encore! 

420
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,090
 Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! 

421
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:46,290
 Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore... 

422
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,890
 Se Kyeong! 

423
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,300
 Se Kyeong! 

424
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,550
 Se Kyeong, you came. 

425
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,810
 Choose one! 

426
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:14,580
 Choose one! Choose one! Choose one! 

427
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,260
 I came to keep the promise I made to you. 

428
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,950
 Se Kyeong, I'll respect whatever decision you make. 

429
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,400
 Se Kyeong, it's me. Right? You'll choose me. Right? 

430
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,390
 I choose... 

431
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,020
 Say, Lee Chan. 

432
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,720
 Tell me, Se Kyeong. 

433
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,140
 Answer the phone. 

434
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,670
 What? 

435
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,290
 Answer the phone, I said. 

436
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:47,060
 Lee Chan, answer the phone! 

437
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,510
Geez...

438
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,600
 Lee Chan! Please! 

439
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,740
 Gosh, Lee Chan! Lee Chan! 

440
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,550
 Lee Chan, please! 

441
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,640
Hello?

442
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,750
I'm sorry. I woke you up. This is Se Kyeong.

443
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,540
Se Kyeong. What made you call so early?

444
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,940
The thing is...

445
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,860
I'm in a bit of a tricky situation.

446
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,530
What? What? What? What's wrong? What's going on?

447
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,110
Are you sick? Did you get hurt?

448
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,570
No, it's not that.

449
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:27,080
You know the individual photo cards we're handing out with the pamphlet at the festival?

450
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,490
Yes.

451
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,630
What about them?

452
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,320
Everyone looks good,

453
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,140
but yours is a bit... How should I say...

454
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,080
Let me be honest.

455
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,700
I'm so upset that your charm doesn't come across at all.

456
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,040
Gosh, you scared me.

457
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,640
I'm okay, Se Kyeong.

458
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
I look the best in person.

459
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,610
I know, but I wanted to keep one if it turned out well.

460
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,460
My gosh.

461
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,210
Keep one?

462
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,500
- My photo? 
 - Yes. I was going to laminate it, too.

463
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,480
 So I'm thinking of retaking yours. 

464
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,930
That'd be too difficult. Right?

465
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:08,910
No, not at all! I can do it! Yes! No matter what!

466
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,990
Really? What a relief. I worried you might say no.

467
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,470
By the way, I only have time today. Is it okay to skip school?

468
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,100
Yes, of course.

469
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,870
The school will be there even if I skip for a day.

470
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,160
Well, oh...

471
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,940
Right, by the way, today—

472
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,260
I know. You have a rehearsal at 3:00. Right?

473
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,050
I'm sure you'll be able to make it.

474
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,560
Really?

475
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,150
Where should I meet you?

476
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,170
Where can I meet you?

477
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,640
 There's an island called Boreum. It's not far from Incheon. 

478
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,790
Here.

479
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,320
Let me carry it for you.

480
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,170
You should've told me you had all this.

481
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,390
I'll carry this for you, too.

482
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,490
Gosh, thank you.

483
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,910
Where are you going?

484
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,090
   

485
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,820
I'm from Seoul.

486
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,240
Yes, from Seoul.

487
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,860
Gosh, thank you.

488
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,340
 I found an amazing place that could capture 

489
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:56,330
 your boyish, mischievous, and tough side of you, too. 

490
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,240
 I'll set up the camera and wait for you. Don't be late. 

491
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,120
Se Kyeong! I'm here!

492
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,550
Wait for just a moment!

493
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,520
 Wait for just a moment! 

494
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,380
 Se Kyeong! I'm here! 

495
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,260
 Wait for just a moment! 

496
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,950
 Se Kyeong! 

497
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:26,150
Gosh, this is why you can't live with guilt.

498
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,650
 Why do I have to trick Lee Chan like that? 

499
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,500
Someone's life is at stake. It's important.

500
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,480
It's too vague. I'm not convinced. Give me another reason.

501
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,650
I have a secret I can't talk about.

502
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,020
You already told me when we went to the theme park.

503
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,490
That won't work. Another one.

504
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,800
Don't be like that. Can't you please help me? Please.

505
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,830
Another reason.

506
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,200
Okay. I'll help you.

507
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,800
I don't need words to understand the message.

508
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,540
I can feel your desperation, urgency, and goodwill without bad intentions.

509
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,900
Really? Will you really help me?

510
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,030
You said someone's life is at stake, and it's important.

511
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,310
I could tell you weren't completely joking.

512
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,840
"I can't ignore someone's desperate situation because it looks trivial to me.

513
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,800
I know what it's like to be in a situation you can't talk about."

514
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,000
That's what you said at the jokbal place. I'm doing it for the same reason.

515
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,420
Thank you. Thank you so much. I'll make sure to return this favor—

516
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,830
But...

517
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,790
what will you do for me?

518
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,100
- What? 
 - Give and take.

519
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,830
Isn't that basic in making a deal?

520
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,420
Yes.

521
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,960
Tell me anything you want. I'll do whatever I can.

522
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,690
Both of them are huge.

523
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:11,210
Would you be able to handle them?

524
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,750
You have two?

525
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,610
Yes, of course. I'll do my best.

526
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,710
Firstly, the secret you can't talk about.

527
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:26,520
Promise me that you'll tell me everything when it's time.

528
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,350
That's...

529
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,860
Okay.

530
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,550
I will.

531
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,380
What's the second one?

532
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,410
This one is really huge.

533
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,950
- That huge? 
 - Yes.

534
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,360
It's humongous.

535
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,040
Watch a movie with me after you're done with everything tomorrow. Deal?

536
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,520
Coke and popcorn, too, then. Deal?

537
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,990
- Deal. 
 - Deal.

538
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,090
Excellent.

539
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:11,760
See? You got a lot better after practicing.

540
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,900
If you skip a day, all the efforts you've been making go to waste. You know. Right?

541
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,180
 Yes. 

542
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:21,210
On that note, Choi Se Kyeong. Could you play for us as you promised...

543
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,600
Where did she go?

544
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,510
She was here, but she left.

545
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,120
   

546
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,540
Are you playing hooky, too?

547
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,980
Why are you alone? Where are the others?

548
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,840
   

549
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,830
What? Do you have something to tell me?

550
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,720
 Who will you choose at the festival? 

551
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,590
Why? Did you bet money, too?

552
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,970
Really? Who did you bet on?

553
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,420
 It's a secret. 

554
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,220
Wow, you're aggressive. You must've bet a lot.

555
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,680
 Who did I like more before I left to study abroad? 

556
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:05,180
Well, I was curious what other people thought.

557
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,030
Oh, I'm sorry.

558
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:12,090
I was curious what other people thought.

559
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,930
What did you think?

560
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,720
Who do you think I would've chosen before I left to study abroad?

561
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,080
Ha Lee Chan? Ha Eun Gyeol?

562
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:38,280
 Ha Eun Gyeol. 

563
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,560
Ha Eun Gyeol.

564
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,790
I see.

565
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,380
Wow.

566
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,590
What?

567
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,240
Are you reshooting, too?

568
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,380
Geez. Where's Se Kyeong?

569
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,210
Choi Se Kyeong isn't coming.

570
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,490
How do you know...

571
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,460
- By chance— 
 - Yes.

572
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,260
I asked Se Kyeong to make you come here.

573
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,330
So you controlled me by hiding behind her back?

574
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,480
Why are you taking things so far, exactly?

575
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,250
Because I had to stop the rehearsal from happening, no matter what.

576
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,560
- What? 
 - You didn't listen, no matter how much I begged.

577
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,270
I can't even reason or have the ability to persuade you.

578
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,420
Crazy bastard. I'm leaving.

579
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,830
You have to wait until six to get out of here.

580
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,290
That's when the ship comes.

581
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,050
Why do you think I made you come to an island?

582
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,850
Shit. You think I'd give up like this?

583
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,370
I'll leave no matter what.

584
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:09,570
I'll either take a fishing boat or swim to...

585
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,910
Hey, what are you doing right now?

586
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,940
Don't go.

587
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,450
Give up. Please.

588
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,090
What kind of man kneels so easily?

589
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,970
Get up. Get up right now.

590
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,840
There's a tragedy I want to prevent.

591
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,550
But I didn't know how to.

592
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,570
But I see a hope in front of me.

593
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,210
I need to seize it.

594
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,730
I need to seize it and hang onto it somehow.

595
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,020
Do you have two heads?

596
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,280
Why is everything so difficult and complicated all the time?

597
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,340
Just give up if you can't persuade me, you bastard.

598
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,790
I came from the future.

599
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,110
Would you believe me?

600
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,790
I'm your son from the future.

601
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,940
And you're my dad.

602
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,240
Can you believe that?

603
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,290
- Are you writing a novel? 
 - I know your future

604
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,090
and I found a way to change your life.

605
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,060
Can you believe that?

606
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,410
You will get into an accident at the rehearsal today.

607
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,830
Because of that, your life changes

608
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,460
and I have to prevent it from happening no matter what.

609
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,570
This isn't funny. Stop.

610
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,370
If I prevent the accident, not only your life but also mine will change.

611
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,670
I told you to stop! It's not funny!

612
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,330
I...

613
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,970
I was lonely.

614
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,570
My family lived in the same world,

615
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:48,830
but it felt like I was stuck alone in a different world. I was always lonely.

616
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,070
But...

617
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,770
I got a chance to live in the same world as you.

618
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,350
I want to seize it.

619
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:02,530
What are you talking about, anyway?

620
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:05,880
I want to make music with you

621
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,290
and I want you to hear the music I make.

622
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,000
I wanted to stop feeling bad for feeling safe alone...

623
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:19,470
and stop feeling guilty about how I shouldn't be the only happy one.

624
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:24,550
♫  It comes so close, it could cover my eyes  ♫

625
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:29,100
I'm sorry, but I don't really like novels.

626
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,430
I don't have time. I'll get going.

627
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,340
Please don't go!

628
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,620
Take your time and come on the 6:00 boat.

629
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,330
If you leave, I'll jump off here!

630
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,230
Do whatever you want. I won't stop you.

631
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:44,120
I mean it! I'll really jump off here if you leave!

632
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:50,130
♫  My desperate song  ♫

633
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:52,250
Do whatever you want.

634
00:42:52,250 --> 00:43:01,070
♫  Even if no one reaches their hand out to me  ♫

635
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:07,780
 You can't even hear. How did you know I drowned? 

636
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,720
 I might not hear you, but I can see you. 

637
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,230
 How? 

638
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:27,780
♫  Even in the moments I hated you and the moments I pushed you away  ♫

639
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:40,080
♫  I've always been calling for you  ♫

640
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,020
 The Little Mermaid gave her voice to the witch, 

641
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,110
 but she gained two legs instead. 

642
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,460
 I lost my voice, 

643
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,800
 but I begged God over and over again... 

644
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:04,090
 and I got one, two, three. The third eye. 

645
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:09,240
 It's a mighty eye that can watch and protect you guys anywhere. 

646
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:17,290
 This scar is the evidence of that. 

647
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,780
Should we lower it a little bit? A little bit?

648
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,800
I think that's good.

649
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,210
Hey, come down right now!

650
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,290
You bastard. I asked you to wait a little longer.

651
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,370
He's coming soon.

652
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,030
Do you know how much time we wasted because of you guys?

653
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:48,700
Everyone come down unless you'll start now.

654
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,880
The vocalist isn't here. How will we start without him, asshole!

655
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,050
How about you just let us go last?

656
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:55,560
No, I won't. I never will!

657
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,030
Get them out of here. Remove the guitar and everything.

658
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,180
Hey, it's Ma Joo!

659
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,290
Hey, hey! What happened to Lee Chan and Eun Gyeol?

660
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,720
I did just reach them, but—

661
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,490
Are they coming or not? Just tell us that.

662
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:35,160
You'll catch a cold if exposed to the ocean wind like that.

663
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,260
Here.

664
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,780
Drink it. I got you a hot one.

665
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,020
You really came.

666
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,990
I thought you swam back.

667
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,570
I said I'll stop by the store.

668
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:52,240
I thought you left to look for a fishing boat.

669
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,470
I called Ma Joo and told him I couldn't make it to the rehearsal.

670
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:06,030
How's that? Are you happy now?

671
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,610
Hey, what's wrong?

672
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,830
Are you in pain?

673
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,500
Hey, what are you doing? Stop acting gross.

674
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,620
 I came from the future. 

675
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,560
 Would you believe me? 

676
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,610
Crazy bastard.

677
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,840
 I'm your son from the future. 

678
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,120
 And you're my dad. 

679
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,260
 Can you believe that? 

680
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,800
Crazy bastard.

681
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,630
I heard you the whole time.

682
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,430
How far will you follow me?

683
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:48,840
Aren't you going home?

684
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,630
I'll stay the night tonight.

685
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,040
Enough is enough.

686
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,800
Be happy that I canceled the rehearsal as you wanted.

687
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,190
I'll give you a special lesson since we couldn't rehearse today.

688
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:04,720
I'll teach you a killer guitar technique and how to look cool on stage, too.

689
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,000
Whoa, will you cry like you did earlier if Se Kyeong chooses me?

690
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,960
When did I...

691
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,430
do this?

692
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:16,680
When did I do that?

693
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,730
And natural coolness is different from acquired coolness.

694
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,370
It doesn't even compare. Don't you know?

695
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:23,860
Acquired coolness is better.

696
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:26,110
Gosh, seriously.

697
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:31,950
 Watch a movie with me after you're done with everything tomorrow. Deal? 

698
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,280
Hey, I'll be right back.

699
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,840
Just go. Don't bother coming back.

700
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,840
Don't go anywhere and go straight home.

701
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,870
And just stay in the room. Okay?

702
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,080
And stay up until I come back. Okay?

703
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,950
I was wrong. He isn't just kooky. He's a psycho.

704
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,040
I'm home—

705
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,370
Why are you alone?

706
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,940
Did you bury Eun Gyeol on the island?

707
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,320
What? Don't say something so scary.

708
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,820
Didn't you go there for a duel?

709
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:11,020
That's not our genre.

710
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,100
What's your genre, then?

711
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,030
Romance? Drama? Horror?

712
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:18,540
What did you two film there?

713
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,270
A human adventure action hero genre, I suppose?

714
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,590
You guys are acting weird, by the way.

715
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:29,550
Shouldn't you have thrown stuff when I showed up there

716
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,700
and said all sorts of swear words at me?

717
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,400
- Are you enjoying my grandma's cooking? 
 - Yeah.

718
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,240
We're planning to do that after we get energy from this.

719
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,000
I'm finished now. What will you do, you bastard?

720
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,330
You call yourself a human?

721
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:42,530
Hey, hey, hey!

722
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:45,510
- What kind of frontman skips the rehearsal? 
 - Hey, hey!

723
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:48,850
Why did you have to lure the guitarist and make him cry now?

724
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,570
I said that's not our genre!

725
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,430
- Come here, you bastard. Come here! 
 - I didn't—

726
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:54,580
Hey... You...

727
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:59,160
I made you hot food. Why are you wasting energy like this?

728
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,500
 Thank you for the meal! 

729
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,660
Grandma, they're... You know...

730
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,360
Hey, deliver this to Soo Bin.

731
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,840
What is it now?

732
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,820
We had winter kimchi left, so I washed it and made dumplings with it.

733
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,870
You know how much Soo Bin loves dumplings.

734
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,730
Take this over before they get cold.

735
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:19,250
Can't you tell how serious things are right now?

736
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,380
Why are you bringing up dumplings in this situation?

737
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,940
What kind of situation is this, then?

738
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,850
A situation in which all of you pretend to be musicians instead of studying?

739
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:30,960
Forget it. I'll ask Bal San when he gets back.

740
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,590
You're never helpful in any way. Goodness gracious.

741
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,730
By the way, who's Soo Bin?

742
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,690
- I-Is it a girl? 
 - No.

743
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,740
My grandma's friend from her hometown.

744
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:49,590
She's been caring for him since he moved to Seoul.

745
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:52,320
He's a security guard at our school now.

746
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:00,720
 Grandma! 

747
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,450
♫  The lights are turning on  ♫

748
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:23,260
♫  Someone's day is ending as usual as the afternoon is passing by  ♫

749
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,110
You came running. You must be excited.

750
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:28,690
You're wearing makeup. Your heart must've fluttered.

751
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:32,470
Things must've gone well since you're joking around.

752
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,030
I owe you.

753
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,500
Thank you.

754
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,830
I'll never forget about this.

755
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:43,470
Did you dry fish on the island?

756
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,170
Do I smell? I'll go change real quick.

757
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,750
No, no. It's okay.

758
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,610
Let's just go. I'll get you some.

759
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,830
Get me what? Clothes?

760
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,540
Yes.

761
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,800
You're like an heiress.

762
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,290
I have extra money from exchanging dollars. I can't do origami with it.

763
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,630
Gosh, how could you?

764
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,190
You sounded like an heiress

765
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,890
and I felt like a poor female lead. My heart was racing.

766
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:08,190
Gosh, you have poor taste in TV shows.

767
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:11,770
We'll barely make it in time for the movie. Let's hurry.

768
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:13,330
Huh?

769
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,890
We're supposed to keep a two-meter distance.

770
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,140
There's no time. Let's ignore that for now.

771
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,090
There's no time. I'm faster.

772
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,380
   

773
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,720
Ta-da.

774
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:20,170
   

775
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:22,090
Wow...

776
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,860
Thank you, Grandmother.
    

777
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:39,790
Your dumplings allowed us to have a private rehearsal.

778
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:47,180
 Yes! 

779
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,120
Kang Hoon.

780
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,200
I need to be careful since I'm on parole right now.

781
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,980
I can't come out in the open for now.

782
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,220
That's why I'd like you to help me.

783
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,470
If you disappoint me like this,

784
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:07,310
would I be angry or not?

785
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,460
Huh?

786
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,470
You bastard.

787
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:22,020
I-I-I really did what you told me to.

788
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,450
 You did, huh? But you warned them. Right? 

789
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:30,860
No, I really removed all the screws in the stage equipment, as you told me.

790
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,580
Did you tell them to cancel it?

791
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:37,550
No, I said. They really canceled the rehearsal on their own.

792
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:43,920
Didn't I tell you?

793
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,850
That I have a sensitive back?

794
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:54,390
I'll never forgive anyone for stabbing me in the back.

795
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,150
Do Jin!

796
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:04,700
Those bastards are rehearsing right now.

797
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,800
I saw them sneaking into school at night, so I followed them.

798
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,280
I think they got a key by bribing the security guard.

799
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,110
What do you want to do? Should we attack them? Should we, Do Jin?

800
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:17,930
I'm grateful that they fell into the trap on their own.

801
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,770
I know.

802
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,280
You have a poor taste for an heiress.

803
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,650
What? It reminds me of Squid Game. I like it.

804
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:39,150
 Squid Game? It hasn't been made in 1995. 

805
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:41,460
Right. Do you want to stop by the restroom?

806
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,420
I'll go before the movie starts. I'll go now.

807
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:49,200
 Is it a '95 style joke? 

808
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,510
   

809
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,270
 First message. 

810
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:02,350
 Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol. We'll rehearse at the gym right now. 

811
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:06,060
 Come to the gym as soon as you check this message. 

812
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,540
Hey, the movie's about to start! Where are you going?

813
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,970
Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol!

814
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,630
♪  I love you  ♪

815
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:21,010
♪  You mean the world to me  ♪

816
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,870
♪  I scream at the top of my lungs  ♪

817
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:31,570
♪  But the sunset is firing up without an answer  ♪

818
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:43,140
 No way. 

819
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,320
 Yoon Dong Jin wasn't the helper? 

820
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:49,660
 Or is it like, "Whatever has to happen, happens?" 

821
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,930
 It doesn't matter. 

822
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:54,000
 I'll stop this. I'll stop it, no matter what. 

823
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:08,500
Long time no see, Kang Hyeon Yool.

824
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,900
Hyeon Yool, your brothers are here!

825
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,900
What's happening?

826
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:22,460
Hey, hey, hey. Kang Hyeon Yool, do you know them by chance?

827
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:37,590
Right, I have a present.

828
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,390
My Hoon.

829
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:44,140
Ding-dong.

830
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:50,700
I heard he messed with your stage earlier today. Right?

831
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,830
Why did you do something I didn't even tell you to?

832
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:04,260
How does it feel to be stabbed in the back?

833
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,250
- Do Jin. 
 - I'll tell you what happens...

834
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:10,570
when you stab someone in the back now.

835
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,300
Just hit me if you're going to. Let the other kids go.

836
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,580
They have nothing to do with it.

837
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:24,700
♪  The hibiscus flowers have blossomed  ♪

838
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:29,930
♪  They blossomed so freaking flashingly  ♪

839
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,420
I just want to step on the ground, but the petals keep falling.

840
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,820
What can I do? I have no choice...

841
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,920
but to step on all of them. Don't you think?

842
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,190
Stomp on them.

843
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:54,170
- We've met before, right? 
 - I don't want to see you!

844
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:58,170
Get them now!

845
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,560
Get them!

846
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,320
- Are you okay? 
 - Of course.

847
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:35,190
Shit!

848
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,710
Young man.

849
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,590
Young man!

850
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,850
H-Hey, young man.

851
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,690
Hey, young man. Are you okay?

852
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:53,020
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine, I'm fine.

853
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,310
Move it!

854
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,690
 You get into an accident if you go to the rehearsal. 

855
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:55,550
 Because of that accident, your life changes. 

856
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:57,110
 Is this what he meant? 

857
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:59,260
 I know your future 

858
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:02,380
 and I found a way to change your life. 

859
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:05,320
 That was... 

860
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,410
 really true? 

861
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,970
I need to be careful.

862
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,290
But they always force me to.

863
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:15,660
Hey!

864
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:25,100
Don't touch Lee Chan, you sons of bitches!

865
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:38,130
I said don't touch Lee Chan, you son of a bitch!

866
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,910
There's police outside!

867
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,610
Let's run!

868
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,700
Lee Chan.

869
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,160
Please wake up. Please?

870
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,080
Open your eyes, please?

871
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,090
Can you hear me?

872
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:04,150
Answer me! Can you hear me?

873
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,920
You're so loud. Be quiet.

874
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,190
Can you hear my voice?

875
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,820
Yes.

876
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,680
I can hear everything.

877
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:30,560
 I prevented it. 

878
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,650
   

879
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:45,170

 There's something you don't know about. 

884
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,610
 I hate being abandoned more than anything. 

885
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:15,360
 I won't go easy on you today. 

886
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,060
 You think only you have it? I have one, too. 

887
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,300
 About the secret that I said I'd tell when it's time. I'll tell you everything now.

01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,590
 Please choose me.

 It's love. You'll get very good lyrics later. 

890
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,630
 No, the festival ended. 

891
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:29,060
 Don't come to see me anymore. 

892
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:30,770
 Can't you just leave me alone? 

893
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:32,640
 We won't have to see each other again. 

894
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,630
 You and I live in different worlds, anyway. 

895
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:37,790
 It's been fun, Lee Chan.
