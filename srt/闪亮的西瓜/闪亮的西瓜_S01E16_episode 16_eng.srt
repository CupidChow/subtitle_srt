1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,300
   

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,250
   

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,070
   

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,680
   

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,540
   

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,180
   

7
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,090
   

8
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,370
   

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,730
   

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,090
 How did I not recognize him? 

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:01,030


12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,390
 Mom. 

13
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,510
 Since I put us… 

14
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,610
 on the Jinsung's family registry by doing all sorts of dirty things, 

15
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,910
 you should've kept us on it. 

16
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,480
 Never mind his hidden son. Even if his dead son came back, 

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,160
 you should've protected us somehow. 

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,070
 How come you never won the chairman's heart? 

19
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,110
 Even a random stranger out of nowhere won his heart immediately. 

20
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,230
 I can finally die for you, then. 

21
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:37,260
 I'll go ahead and do that if you want. 

22
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,990
 Hey! Hey! Why did that bastard suddenly return to Korea? 

23
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,520
 Didn't you hear the rumor? 

24
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,240
 Chairman Yoon's hidden son showed up. 

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,690
 I heard he's really smart and handsome. 

26
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,740
 He's a dethroned crown prince now. 

27
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,240
Yes. If someone has to die, it better be him.

28
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,120
   

29
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,840
Dad.

30
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,970
   

31
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,570
 Thinking about it, 

32
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,100
 all the favors you asked me were for my sake. 

33
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,580
 I'm sorry. 

34
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,870
 I'm sorry, Lee Chan. 

35
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,060
 I just had to... 

36
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,840
 I just had to be by your side today. 

37
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,340
 I should've protected you. 

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,140
 It's all my fault. 

39
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,710
 It's all my fault. I'm sorry, Lee Chan. 

40
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,690
Was there an accident or something?

41
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,760
I hope it's not serious.

42
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,290
Hey, where are you going so late this time?

43
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,860
Are you going out to drink again?

44
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,950
Hey, Eun Gyeol!

45
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,670
How's Lee Chan? What happened to him?

46
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,240
Mr. Ha's guardian? Mr. Ha's guardian.

47
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,440
It's me. I'm his cousin.

48
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,900
We need to start emergency surgery. We need your signature. Follow me.

49
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,260
Oh, okay.

50
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:35,200
Hey, I'll go. Go wash yourself in the bathroom.

51
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,800
♫  You're going further away  ♫

52
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,240
♫  I feel like I can touch you  ♫

53
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,180
 Huh? Could I... 

54
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,980
 Could I have passed? 

55
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,150
   

56
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,510
What? What? What?

57
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,850
- What? What? 
 - Did you get in?

58
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,500
Grandma. Grandma, I got in!

59
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:31,540
♫  It got so close to me that it's blocking my view  ♫

60
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:40,490
♫  It's comforting me, who's inside my tired heart  ♫

61
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,770
- Unbeatable... 
  - Economics Dept! 

62
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,060
 Unbeatable Economics Dept! Unbeatable Economics Dept! Unbeatable Economics Dept! 

63
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,610
♫  My song that I had desperately wanted to sing  ♫

64
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,430
♫  No one offered a hand to me  ♫

65
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,490
 See, Ha Eun Gyeol? 

66
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,460
 I kept my promise. Okay? 

67
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,120
 The grand prize goes to... 

68
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,220
 No. 18, the band Watermelon Sugar. 

69
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,340
♫  Even the times I hated you  ♫

70
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,200
 Bastards, what did I tell you? 

71
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,380
 I. G. O. T. M. Y. G. U. 

72
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,920
 "It's game over the moment you give up," I said. 

73
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,100
♫  I call for you  ♫

74
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,570
- Applause! 
 - So cool!

75
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,350
You look pretty.

76
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,230
 Grandma, did you achieve your dream now? 

77
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,410
Okay, okay. Look over here.

78
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,860
Grandma, look.

79
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,110
Gather around.

80
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,130
Five seconds. Five seconds. Five seconds. Hurry, hurry.

81
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,570
One, two, three.

82
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,830
♫  My dream that I had desperately wished for  ♫

83
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,450
 Thank you for raising me, Grandma. 

84
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,400
There aren't many cars because it's a Friday night. How did this happen?

85
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,110
The kid who was behind pushed the one who was running ahead...

86
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,290
Gosh, what a son of a bitch.

87
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:37,300
How could he just hit someone and run away?

88
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,860
I'm sure. I saw it with my own eyes.

89
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,280
That was the only car that left the scene at the time.

90
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,450
The license plate number was Seoul 2 Na 4836.

91
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,090
I don't know the model, but it was a red sports car.

92
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,890
You have to catch him. It was a hit-and-run... I mean, he attempted murder.

93
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,520
Calm down. Which way did he go?

94
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,320
He went toward the main road that way.

95
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,170
Lee Chan is the one who got into the accident?

96
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,060
He was...

97
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,800
on his way to have me listen to this?

98
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,850
Probably...

99
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,970
I assume so.

100
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,600
We tried so hard to stop it, but...

101
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,610
But that tape ended up in your hands after all.

102
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,960
Please burn it with your own hands.

103
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,570
I think this cursed cycle will end that way somehow.

104
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,510
I'm...

105
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,010
sorry I let you go without saying anything earlier.

106
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,660
Did you...

107
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,750
come back to see me, by chance?

108
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,660
 Mom, if you go back to that time, 

109
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,840
 what do you want to ask the most? 
   

110
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,070
 Why did you abandon me? Something like that, probably. 

111
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,590
 Why couldn't you ask him? 

112
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,900
 I think I was afraid to face the truth. 

113
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,100
 He was probably afraid, too. 

114
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,040
 Because he would've had no answer for me. 

115
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:57,270
If you're back to tell me something—

116
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,700
Why did you abandon me?

117
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,630
When I asked you about the actress Shin Ha Young, you said

118
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,680
it was love, not just a fling.

119
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,870
You said you found out that she died and that I was born after I was adopted.

120
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,340
You said you never abandoned me.

121
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,670
- Se Kyeong— 
 - I'll try...

122
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:26,180
to believe that and understand that, but...

123
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,680
if that was true, shouldn't you have tried to find your daughter later?

124
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,330
It's too irresponsible to say you didn't abandon me because you didn't know.

125
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,420
Because you looked happy.

126
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,500
You were growing up happily with well-off and excellent step-parents.

127
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,670
I didn't want to destroy your happiness.

128
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,390
Your daughter was never happy.

129
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,060
She was always anxious and often miserable living someone else's life.

130
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,950
She had to be better than Han Na, the step-parents' biological daughter.

131
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:11,500
She thought she'd be loved that way. She never lived her life as Choi Se Kyeong.

132
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,020
So I want you to answer...

133
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,980
if someone who looks exactly like me asks the same question,

134
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,480
answer as many times as it takes.

135
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,610
Say, "I never abandoned you.

136
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,950
You're not Han Na and...

137
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,400
you're my daughter, Choi Se Kyeong, who was born out of love."

138
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,050
If you don't say it, there's no way to know.

139
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,720
 This is it. 

140
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,650
 You people are responsible for the rest. 

141
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,130
 I'll no longer get involved. 

142
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,190
 I'm afraid something else will change again. 

143
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:55,600
 I'm afraid I'd fail like I failed to protect Lee Chan. 

144
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,430
 I want to go back home now. 

145
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,530
   

146
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,710
Who the heck are you?

147
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,200
There will be two full moons tomorrow night.

148
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,830
 When there are two full moons, 

149
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,950
the door that connects the past and present or the present and future opens.

150
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,740
What does that have to do with me?

151
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,410
 Wrap up the journey and 

152
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,770
come to the place where you first arrived.

153
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,550
I'll make sure it's bright inside La Vida Music, as I promised.

154
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,380
Oh, I'll serve you lavender tea to welcome you.

155
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,640
Who are you?

156
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,490
You think I could go back in this situation?

157
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,170
Tomorrow is your only chance to go back.

158
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,530
 If you remain there, 

159
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:46,080
your life in 2023 will disappear.

160
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,830
Will that still be okay?

161
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,440
 You, who don't belong in this world, 

162
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,020
might create another butterfly effect again and

163
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,390
it's impossible to predict the outcome.

164
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,840
Would that still be okay?

165
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,940
Why are you doing this to me?

166
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,450
What did I do wrong exactly?

167
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:13,630
What sin did I commit that you sent me on this awful journey?

168
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,220
No matter what decision you make,

169
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,900
I hope it's for your own sake.

170
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,270
- Well, then. 
  - Don't hang up. 

171
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,740
Don't hang up, I said.

172
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,390
Don't hang up! I'm not done talking to you!

173
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,230
Hey, Eun Gyeol. Eun Gyeol.

174
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,250
Lee Chan's surgery just ended.

175
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,110
What happened? Did it go well?

176
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,260
It did. He will survive.

177
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,070
He'll be sent to a regular ward soon.

178
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,450
Lee Chan.

179
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,550
Dad.

180
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,580
I'm sorry, Dad.

181
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,110
If I didn't come here,

182
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,570
this wouldn't have happened.

183
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,650
Dad.

184
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,220
It's not that I didn't say anything because you couldn't hear

185
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,960
I didn't...

186
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,800
say those...

187
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,600
mean things because I hated you.

188
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,000
You know how much I love you.

189
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,340
So...

190
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,620
please open your eyes now.

191
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,490
I have something I have to tell you. Don't just sleep like this.

192
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,110
And...

193
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,210
I might need to go back now.

194
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,810
   

195
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,540
Lee Chan.

196
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,240
Lee Chan.

197
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,050
Hey, something's strange.

198
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,200
I can't hear sounds.

199
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,250
I don't hear my voice, either.

200
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,100
Gosh, Grandma.

201
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,010
You might fall. Slow down.

202
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,560
We can't keep it a secret forever. It's not something to get over in a few days.

203
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,830
Who am I?

204
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,670
I said he's fine mentally.

205
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,050
Who am I? Tell me right now.

206
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,600
You're Grandma.

207
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,140
Can you hear my voice?

208
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,310
I'll go home soon. You shouldn't have come.

209
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,500
I thought I was finally catching a break from your nagging.

210
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,570
Can you hear my voice?

211
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm sorry, Grandma.

212
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,360
You said you love how healthy I am physically and mentally. What do I do?

213
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,580
Instead,

214
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,250
I'll try to have a more lovable heart.

215
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,570
I'll work on the muscles around there more.

216
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,760
Goodness, my baby. Goodness, my baby.

217
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:53,250
I thought happy endings existed. How could such an unexpected thing happen?

218
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,810
No one in the world was as kind as my grandson.

219
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:03,120
What sin did he commit? How could this be? Goodness...

220
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,690
Why are you crying, Grandma? I didn't die.

221
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:15,660
I couldn't even feed and dress you properly while trying to feed others.

222
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:22,070
You've never been loved by your parents, and I nagged you all the time.

223
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:29,370
I couldn't even hug you warmly. Why...

224
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,800
Grandma.

225
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,240
Goodness, what do we do?

226
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,330
- Grandma. 
 - My goodness...

227
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:49,140
Let's ask them to test you from head to toe.

228
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:54,240
I'll give you my ears if they say they can't fix you.

229
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,270
I'll cut out my heart for you if you need a heart.

230
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:02,130
I'll give you both of my eyes if you need them.

231
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,650
What am I supposed to do with you?

232
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:11,380
Goodness, what do I do with my baby? My baby...

233
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,140
I'll fix you. Don't worry.

234
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,530
I'll give you my heart and my eyes, too.

235
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,700
Eun Gyeol.

236
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,620
What's going on? Where are you going right now?

237
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,690
To find the bastard who did that to Lee Chan.

238
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,550
I'll find him if the police can't find him.

239
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,920
I'll find him and kill him.

240
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,610
The culprit was caught. Calm down.

241
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,190
He got caught this morning.

242
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,070
I just checked at the police station.

243
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,260
But I think...

244
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,690
it'd be better if Lee Chan or his grandmother didn't know.

245
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,020
What are you talking about?

246
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,070
Why shouldn't they?

247
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,930
Is it someone we know by chance?

248
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,740
Yes.

249
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,120
Cheong Ah's stepbrother, Yoon Joo Yeop.

250
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,570
 Do you want to join me for my business trip overseas? 

251
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,690
 It'd be fun because there are many art museums there. 

252
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,690
You like art. Right?

253
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,000
Is that wrong?

254
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,770
   

255
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,720
Let's look at art...

256
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,940
and make time to do sightseeing...

257
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,430
 I'd love you to see it. 

258
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,600
 See what? 

259
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,060
 Cheong Ah's smile. 

260
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,380
 It's really pretty. 

261
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,120
 I'll come with you. 

262
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:10,200
I said I didn't do it on purpose.

263
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,020
He suddenly ran toward the car, and I was so shocked that I accelerated

264
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:21,210
mistakenly instead of braking. How many times did I tell you?

265
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,090
How strange.

266
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,350
The skidmark on the road says otherwise.

267
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,120
Are you a psychic or something?

268
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,840
Do police officers communicate with the ground, too?

269
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,490
Be careful how you approach this.

270
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,540
If it's proven intentional, it's attempted murder.

271
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,790
I said it wasn't intentional...

272
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:45,830
Whatever. I won't say a word before my lawyer gets here.

273
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,310
It was intentional.

274
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,400
You saw me and drove toward me without hesitating at all.

275
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,410
That's enough. We're at the police station, Eun Gyeol.

276
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,040
Thank you for stopping him for me.

277
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,630
You tried to kill me.

278
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,480
You tried to kill me, but you hit Lee Chan, who tried to save me!

279
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,780
Gosh, seriously. Why blame me? Do you have evidence?

280
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,050
I'll kill you.

281
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,800
I'll follow you to the edge of hell and punish you if you get out with money.

282
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,230
I'll do everything you could imagine and fear.

283
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:16,220
I won't let you go and slowly dry you out to death.

284
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,420
Don't make this worse. Let's leave. Okay?

285
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,290
I'll kill you.

286
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,870
I won't leave you alone until you die!

287
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,410
I'll kill you!

288
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:28,480
Gosh, seriously. When is the lawyer coming?

289
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,840
Let me use your phone.

290
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,560
I can do that much in a democratic society. Right?

291
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,310
There will be two moons tonight.

292
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,540
You received a call from Master, too. Right?

293
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:00,510
This is it. We can't get involved more.

294
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,400
We have to go back.

295
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,800
Not now.

296
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,860
We get trapped here forever if we don't go back tonight.

297
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,330
I can never go back until I turn everything...

298
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,290
back to normal.

299
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,760
How?

300
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,370
It already happened. How will you turn it back?

301
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,670
Travel to the past again?

302
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,710
Will you go further back if something changes again?

303
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,260
Come to your senses.

304
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,290
2023 is the year you're going back to.

305
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,370
How am I supposed to go back?

306
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,430
My dad's life was ruined because of me.

307
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,160
I couldn't change anything.

308
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,720
I should've just let things go as they were meant to.

309
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,320
I shouldn't have tried to change things.

310
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,960
Of course, you changed something.

311
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,460
You saved me.

312
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:00,680
And you saved Cheong Ah.

313
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,710
 Lee Chan, I'm going on a trip with Dad. 

314
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,570
 I'm just tagging along to his business trip, 

315
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:34,980
 but I'm kind of excited because I've never done this before. 

316
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:39,100
 Thank you. This is all thanks to you. 

317
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,630
 It's such a happy thing to have someone on my side. 

318
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:49,260
 I feel supported. It gives me courage somehow. 

319
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,380
 Something is making me stronger. 

320
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:57,520
 I want to be someone like that to you, too. 

321
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,040
 To Lee Chan, who's always on my side. 

322
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,200
 From Cheong Ah, who's always on your side. 

323
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,350
Look for a school abroad where Cheong Ah can study.

324
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,600
Got it.

325
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,870
There's a school for deaf people called Gallaudet University.

326
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,240
Find out their admission requirements, too.

327
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,870
A university, too?

328
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,700
Cheong Ah...

329
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,920
won't come back once she leaves.

330
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,820
But don't let her know.

331
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,850
I understand what you're saying.

332
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:42,300
We'll pay for Ha Lee Chan's hospital bills and tuition, including university.

333
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,770
I'll arrange that.

334
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:52,170
I won't help Yoon Joo Yeop, no matter how much Jinsung's legal team requests.

335
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,750
Ms. Lim Ji Mi. We're from the National Tax Service's investigation team.

336
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:01,280
You're banned from leaving the country due to a tax investigation.

337
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,230
 Your efforts must've caused a positive change. 

338
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:14,280
So, let's stop here and go back to our world.

339
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,200
I can't...

340
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,750
bring myself to leave.

341
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,700
Don't you care that your life in 2023 might disappear?

342
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,700
I can't run away alone, leaving my dad in despair.

343
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,830
Gosh, I finally get what Eun Ho said.

344
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:37,940
I couldn't understand because my sign language was bad then, but I get it now.

345
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:43,220
The reason why Eun Ho didn't tell you about your dad's accident.

346
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,020
 When will you show it to your brother? 

347
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,160
 Once the load on his shoulders lightens up a bit. 

348
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,140
 His shoulders seem a bit heavy now. 

349
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,130
Give up now.

350
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,110
It's not your burden to carry.

351
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,620
You forced yourself to carry it.

352
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,110
Do you think they were happy because of that?

353
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:12,100
No. They were actually worried and sad.

354
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,340
That you'd be more miserable because of them.

355
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,130
No one can live your life for you.

356
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:28,140
Let Lee Chan of 1995 take care of himself in 1995

357
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,750
and just have faith in him.

358
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:35,000
There are Lee Chan and Cheong Ah in 2023, too.

359
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,550
There's Eun Ho, too.

360
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,700
There are people waiting for you.

361
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,020
And I'll be there, too.

362
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,470
I'll go back.

363
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,270
Pack your things and meet me at my house at nine.

364
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,440
I'll be waiting.

365
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,180
 Flip a coin or something. 

366
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,590
   

367
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,190
   

368
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,210
Long time no see, Grandpa.

369
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,400
I thought I'd never see you again,

370
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,430
but here we are.

371
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,000
Wow. Bravo.

372
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,850
I thought you were just going through puberty.

373
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:04,170
But you were way more daring than I thought.

374
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,820
What are you?

375
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,290
Who are you?

376
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:14,520
Me? I'm On Eun Yoo, Choi Se Kyeong's daughter from the future.

377
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,410
I'm crazy. I've gone insane.

378
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,240
I'm out of my mind right now.

379
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,760
Oh, hold on.

380
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,590
Hold on.

381
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,990
I'll say a few more things since I came clean.

382
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:32,240
Use this courage and tell the step-parents yourself.

383
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,820
Say you're not Han Na's replacement.

384
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,670
And ask your biological father properly since you managed to find him.

385
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,540
Ask him why he abandoned you.

386
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,450
Then he'll answer as if he's been waiting.

387
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:48,530
And just like how you can't replace Han Ha,

388
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,690
I can't live your life for you, either, Mom.

389
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,460
So you should live your life, too.

390
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,460
It's okay.

391
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:03,050
Because you're plenty charming and cool the way you are.

392
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,340
Oh, you can run away now. I'm busy, too.

393
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,860
I'll tidy up in here. Don't worry so much.

394
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,210
You've been cleaning my room for me, too.

395
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,660
This is a dream. An illusion.

396
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,930
It must be my imagination.

397
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,520
I won't see you off.

398
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,830
Bye, Mom.

399
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,150
See you in 28 years.

400
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,740
Just ask me.

401
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,330
I can just tell from your face.

402
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,380
Your head is filled with heavy stuff right now.

403
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,010
I thought about flipping a coin before I came.

404
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,390
You're like a psychic.

405
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,780
A coin?

406
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,210
"If you have to make a hard decision,

407
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,720
try flipping a coin."

408
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,970
Someone told me that once.

409
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,790
I'll give you this instead of a coin.

410
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,340
Se Kyeong told me to burn it,

411
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,290
but I think you should listen to it.

412
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,560
It's a nice song. Make sure to listen to the end.

413
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,690
   

414
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,360
Have I told you before?

415
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,500
My parents are deaf.

416
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,560
And I have a brother who's a year older.

417
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,740
He's deaf, too.

418
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:56,410
They apparently call a child with a deaf family like me...

419
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,440
a Coda.

420
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,590
Coda?

421
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:07,260
 This is like a secret code for people who do music. 

422
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,940
 It's called a coda. 

423
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,530
 If you put a coda at the end of a musical phrase, 

424
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:17,060
 it means getting ready to wrap up the song with a beautiful end. 

425
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,510
That's why I came by.

426
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:26,650
I think it's time to start preparing for a beautiful ending.

427
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,410
Are you going somewhere?

428
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,460
Thank you for everything.

429
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:52,160
I wanted to say my last goodbye properly in person this time.

430
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,010
What's with you? As if you'd never see me again.

431
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,020
Take care of your health.

432
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,630
Especially your heart.

433
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:07,480
And make-up with your daughter, too.

434
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,490
And later...

435
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,710
much later,

436
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:18,460
if you find a kid who's crying alone in front of the shop,

437
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,810
give him milk instead of hot chocolate.

438
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,500
He prefers milk.

 Special thanks to Ha Eun Gyeol. 

447

 I was able to finish this song thanks to you. 

448
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:54,010
 But thinking about it, you didn't just finish the song with me. 

449
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,930
 I'll make your youth shine like you wanted so badly. 

450

 you've always been there with me. 

454
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,130
 You lied that you're my son, didn't you? 

455
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,850
 I'm your son from the future... 

456

 and you're my dad. 

457

 But I felt like you were my father for some reason. 

458
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,960
 I've never experienced love from my father, 

459
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,830
 but I felt something similar thanks to you. 

460
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,450
 Hey, son. Thank you. 

461
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,830
 In return, 

462
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,880
 I'll be born as your father in my next life. 

463
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:51,030
 Hey, Lee Chan! Don't make me set the table twice. Come out and scarf this down, you bastard.

hear then?

do my duty as a person...

You shine more than anyone.

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,880
I told you before.

488
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,630
You're loved by your wife...

489
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,390
and respected by your children.

490
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,070
You become a great father.

491
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,060
You do.

492
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,970
You turn your weakness into a unique charm.

493
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,710
You turn any suffering...

494
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:17,520
into a heroic story.

495
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,040
- So— 
 - What are you saying?

496
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,820
I can't hear anything.

497
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,070
So...

498
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:37,160
make sure to keep your promise.

499
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,960
Overcome this impressively...

500
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,620
and make sure to become my father.

501
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,050
You heard.

502
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,760
It's not your fault.

503
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,370
It was just an accident.

504
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,780
It'd be awful for a while,

505
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,810
but I won't give up thinking my life was ruined.

506
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,570
So leave.

507
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,140
Don't look back and just go.

508
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,070
Go back and...

509
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,650
when you no longer have the guilty look on your face,

510
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,140
come back to see me then.

511
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,720
 I believe you'll come. 

512
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,980
 I thought about waiting longer, 

513
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,460
 but I have a long way to go. So I'll be ahead of you. 

514
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,370
 See you 28 years later. "Metaphone." 

515
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,240
Huh? What's going on? Huh?

516
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,620
No, no, no, no, no.

517
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:36,410
Excuse me! Is there anyone out there? There's a person here!

518
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:41,290
Somebody, please help me!

519
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,570
   

520
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,830
   

521
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,980
Give me my guitar back.

522
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:47,330
Gosh. Looks like you're thinking of changing your life instead of others now.

523
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,050
Drink this while I look for it.

524
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:51,560
I harvested the lavender myself.

525
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,710
It relaxes the mind and body, and it helps you sleep.

526
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,810
You know, life...

527
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,980
can't give you everything you want,

528
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,990
but it sometimes hides small gifts here and there.

529
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:11,010
I hope you overcome the suffering from the cruel life...

530
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,140
and receive the hidden gift eventually.

531
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:22,430
Not just you but everyone you wanted to protect.

532
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:24,560
Viva la vida.

533
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,860
Long live life.

534
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:45,130
Did it get damaged while in storage?

535
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,120
What are you exactly?

536
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,660
You won't answer even if I ask that.

537
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,980
Just think of it as a prank from God.

538
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,480
Life is filled with metaphors

539
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,180
and it's up to us to interpret them.

540
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,580
There's no such thing as an answer.

541
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,480
I'm not sure what you mean,

542
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,090
but thanks for the tea.

543
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,740
 How can you be an artist and not understand metaphors? 

544
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:46,440
Flip a coin if you want to find the answer to something.

545
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,560
It was nice to see you, kid.

546
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:13,020
 What happened? 

547
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,790
This is the Jinsung family's annex.

548
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,830
Is this a dream?

549
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,720
Or is it real life?

550
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,410
What did he put in the lavender tea exactly?

551
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:28,900
 - I'm sorry. I'm not so sure.  
 - Geez Louise.

552
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,560
What year is it now?

553
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,470
It's 2023.

554
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:41,710
Am I finally back then?

555
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:44,450
But why am I at the Jinsung family's house...

556
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,790
 Of course, you changed something. 

557
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:00,330
 And you saved Cheong Ah. 

558
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,770
 Have faith in Lee Chan. 

559
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:06,950
 There are Lee Chan and Cheong Ah in 2023, too. 

560
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,590
 There's Eun Ho, too. 

561
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:12,450
 There are people waiting for you. 

562
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,690
 And I'll be there, too. 

563
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,690
   

564
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:29,620
 The number you dialed does not exist. 

565
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,120
Who are you?

566
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,060
Are you sure you're at the right house?

567
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,700
It was definitely this house.

568
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,940
Do you know where the previous owners moved to—

569
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:53,420
What do you mean? I built this house and moved in five years ago.

570
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:56,430
- There were no previous owners. 
 - If so...

571
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:10,840
 Eun Yoo's history changed. 

572
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,420
 There's no way she couldn't return from 1995. Right? 

573
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:19,830
   

574
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,900
- Hyung. 
  - Where are you right now? 

575
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,140
 Do you know how many hours I waited at the shop? 

576
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:29,140
 Whatever. I'm on my way to pick you up. Wait at home. 

577
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,920
Hello?

578
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:35,930
Shop?

579
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,010
What shop?

580
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,280
Excuse me.

581
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,780
It's you, right? Spine9's Ha Eun Gyeol.

582
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,240
Amazing! Geez.

583
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:51,680
Oppa, could you pluck a strand of hair for me?

584
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,160
My hair?

585
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,110
Well, two strands.

586
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,560
I just need two strands.

587
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,700
- Oppa! Oppa! 
 - Oppa!

588
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,570
 What? Why are they following me? 

589
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,750
 Did I become something? 

590
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,840
Gosh, thank you...

591
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,750
Guys.

592
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,550
How did you guys become so cool?

593
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:36,150
People might think you're artists represented by MJ.

594
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:39,770
You little. How dare you try to smooth things over?

595
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:43,690
Whatever. Did you get approval for touring during vacation?

596
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,470
Touring?

597
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,190
Are we taking a group tour somewhere?

598
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,400
Group tour, my foot.

599
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,270
Our world tour, you dumbass.

600
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,190
World tour?

601
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,020
Us?

602
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:58,930
We'll be the supporting band for Yoon Dong Jin. I told you to get permission from your parents.

603
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:00,700
Did you go through a war somewhere?

604
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,470
It's because he feels guilty for being late.

605
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:06,010
Anyway, Soo Ji agreed to come to the location.

606
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:07,890
As soon as you get there, get your makeup done and get dressed—

607
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,230
Are we attending some event?

608
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:11,670
What kind of event—

609
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,540
 Seriously, what's wrong with you? 

610
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,390
   
   

611
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:20,700
   

612
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:23,620
   

613
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,520
   

614
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,450
So we're artists represented by MJ

615
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:36,500
and we endorse Jinsung Instrument.

616
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,920
They're doing a launching show for Goliath.

617
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,220
And we're supposed to perform there.

618
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:45,190
But I'm the grandson of the Jinsung family?

619
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:47,000
You're awake now, right?

620
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,340
Let's hurry and go to the waiting room now, then.

621
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,910
Let's go. Let's go.

622
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,530
 What took you so long? 

623
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,440
Brother.

624
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,910
Brother, I missed you!

625
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,460
 Where's your suit? 

626
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,080
Brother.

627
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,670
 I told you to wear it because we need to say hello to Dad's friends. 

628
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:22,320
I never thought of you as a burden.

629
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:25,210
 Is that so? 

630
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:28,130
 I thought of you as a burden often. 

631
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,410
 Like right now. 

632
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,400
Where are Mom and Dad?

633
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:59,170
 Thank you. 

634
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,260
 (Have a pleasant time.) 

635
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:05,290
 I'm already having a pleasant time, thanks to you. 

636
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:11,690
 Things are improving in Korea, too. Right? 

637
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,200
   

638
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,790
   

639
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,000
   

640
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,060
   

641
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,770
Good work, Cheong Ah.

642
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:47,990
You did so great.

643
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:50,080
I'm so proud of you.

644
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,430
 Don't try to butter me up. 

645
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:56,840
 I completely disagree with your dad. 

646
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,750
 I'm letting you be in a band under the condition you go to college. 

647
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:05,290
 The moment your grades go down, the world tour will be... 

648
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,870
 Get to your positions. 

649
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:14,270
 Smile. Smile. 

650
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,210
- Look over here! 
 - Over here!

651
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:20,650
- Please look over here! 
 - Look over here.

652
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,800
 Hello. 

653
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:27,080
You came. How have you been, Cheong Ah?

654
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,890
Who are they?

655
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:34,890
 They're Dad's high school friends who were in the band together. 

656
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,380
 Was the traffic bad? 

657
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,870
 (Thankfully, no.) 

658
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,430
Ma Joo will be late because of work.

659
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:48,280
You look so pretty today.

660
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:50,240
 Just today? 

661
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,990
Just today.

662
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:59,930
 Lee Chan is the one who stopped talking to him. 

663
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:02,770
 Whenever he saw his friends, it broke his heart. 

664
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,520
 Because he missed those days. 

665
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,120
 It was difficult to see their sad faces looking at him. 

666
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,170
   

667
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,850
   

668
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,110
 (When is Dad coming?) 

669
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:46,210
 Let me introduce you to Goliath S, Jinsung Instruments' new product line. 

670
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,160
   

671
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,130
 And there's someone I'd like to welcome to stage. 

672
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:04,000
 Please welcome the man behind the Goliath, Chief Director Ha Lee Chan. 

673
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:09,480
   

674
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:33,620
   

675
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,960
   

676
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:41,120
   

677
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:46,780
 My dream was to become a rockstar, conquer the world, 

678
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,250
 and steal a beautiful woman's heart. 

679
00:59:54,080 --> 01:00:00,500
 However, I had to give up on that dream since I became deaf due to an accident. 

680
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,940
 At first, when I lost my hearing, 

681
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:10,000
 I was very afraid. 

682
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:20,730
 I was scared, 

683
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:23,000
 angry, 

684
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,830
 and I was in despair. 

685
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:31,610
 There was a time when I couldn't vocalize at all. 

686
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:54,630
♫  We met each other while wandering around at different times  ♫

687
01:00:54,630 --> 01:01:00,700
 But I gave up on giving up. 

688
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:05,440
 Because for 18 years, 

689
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,320
 I was exposed to sound. So I remembered them.  
    

690
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,350
 And I could imagine them, too. 

691
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:17,350
 And since I have lived another 18 years without sound, 

692
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:24,520
 I believed I could create the most precious and beautiful sound. 

693
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:31,980
 In the end, I stole a beautiful woman's heart and... 

694
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,230
 My gosh. 

695
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:43,880
 I believe Goliath will achieve my dream of conquering the world. 

696
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,990
   

697
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:58,690
   

698
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:14,180
Wow.

699
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:33,760
   

700
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:38,670
 That's all. 

701
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:46,620
 Seeing your faces, I think Goliath sounded good. 

702
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:49,210
Yes, it did.

703
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:51,790
Aigoo, seriously.

704
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,310
 I'll get off the stage feeling relieved, then. 

705
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:01,270
 Thank you. Thank you. 

706
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,180
   

707
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:17,640
Gosh, he's such an entertainer.

708
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:21,360
Ma Joo.

709
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:25,090
Wow. You're addressing the president by his first name now?

710
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:27,460
You think I'm your friend?

711
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,270
I'm sorry.

712
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,890
Shouldn't you run to prepare for the performance?

713
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,850
I won't go easy on you for being my friend's son.

714
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:37,120
Got it. On my way, sir.

715
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,690
Okay.

716
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:54,490
I was right, wasn't I?

717
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:56,360
I told you.

718
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:59,530
That I won't despair and think my life was ruined.

719
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:02,600
So, I told you to leave without looking back.

720
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:06,660
I said when you no longer have a guilty look on your face,

721
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:09,350
come back to see me then.

722
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:13,680
What do you think?

723
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,370
Are you ready to see me now?

724
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:21,120
♫  All those times  ♫

725
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:33,150
♫  The bright future that everyone dreamed of is in front of me right now  ♫

726
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:37,930
 Son, wasn't I really cool today? 

727
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,850
♫  Another day passed without even a moment to breathe  ♫

728
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:45,530
♫  Even though my reflection in the mirror  ♫

729
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:47,930
Thank you...

730
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:50,100
for keeping your promise.

731
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:55,260
♫  Looks more tired than usual today  ♫

732
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:59,560
It's my turn to become cool now.

733
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,620
I hope you look forward to it.

734
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:08,670

You're right. They aren't as good-looking as we were, either.

Hey, by the way, doesn't Eun Gyeol look like someone?

I feel like I remember. It's driving me crazy.

758

He definitely resembles someone.

I thought you couldn't come back.

Right. I almost didn't make it back.

777

Why did you come and run away?

I didn't run away. I was luring you.

01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:55,730
and let me make good friends. Thank you for all that.

816
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:02,950
I'll get along with Mom when I get back. Don't worry.

817
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:07,240
But I'm sure we'll continue to fight a lot.

818
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:12,190
I'll get going now, then.

819
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:15,310
I'll live a good life when I get back, too.

820
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,800
It was so nice to meet you.

821
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,660
Bye.

826
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:48,580
♫  It's a new beginning, I breathe out  ♫

827
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:55,070
♫  A moment I've been waiting for  ♫

828
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:59,880
♫  Erase the times that have already passed  ♫

829
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:06,490
♫  We're here on this shining stage together  ♫

830
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:09,370
♫  Don't look back, you won't have any regrets  ♫

831
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:11,780
♫  No need to hesitate  ♫

832
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:17,100
♫  This chance won't come again, so let's begin  ♫

833
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,680
♫  The days that shone so bright  ♫

834
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:24,260
♫  All our full dreams (shining, shining)  ♫

835
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:25,990
♫  Just like now  ♫

836
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:28,560
♫  Don't stop here like this, right now  ♫

837
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,040
♫  Run without looking back  ♫

838
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,630
♫  So you can dream again, higher, higher  ♫

839
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:37,460
♫  Fly higher  ♫

840
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:41,780
♫  I hope this moment lasts forever  ♫

841
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:48,110
♫  My heart is racing, I'm running out of breath  ♫

842
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:50,490
   

843
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:55,800
