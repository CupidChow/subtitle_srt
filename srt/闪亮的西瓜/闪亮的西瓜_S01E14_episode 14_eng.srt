1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,400
   

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,130
   

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,080
   

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,890
   

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,550
   

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,440
   

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,050
   

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,460
   

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,260
    
 Geez, please work. Please work.

10
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,440
You...

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,960
What?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,990
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 🍉 Viva la Watermelon 🍉 Team @Viki.com 

13
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,430
 What? It reminds me of Squid Game. I like it. 

14
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,660
 I sold my cello. Because I'd rather die than play it. 

15
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,680
 - Where did you sell yours? 
 - An instrument shop. 

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,340
 - Ahjumma! 
 - Ahjussi! 

17
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,050
   

18
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,770
   

19
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,240
 I have a secret I can't talk about. 

20
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,920
 I saw it in the future. 

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,670
 Where was the shop? Was it in front of Hongdae— 

22
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,650
 Shut up while I'm asking nicely, Ahjussi. 

23
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,880
 Ahjumma! 

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,460
The time traveler Master mentioned was...

25
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,260
The helper Master mentioned was...

26
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,390
- You? 
 - You?

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,100
Son.

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,330
We have to get off at the next station. What are you two doing...

29
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,320
What are you holding in your hands?

30
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,340
Well...

31
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,290
Why are you so surprised?

32
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,130
Let me see.

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,110
Let me see, I said.

34
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,410
Where are you going? Hey!

35
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,590
Hey, hey, hold on!

36
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,920
Driver! Driver! Hold on!

37
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,430
 Excuse me! Hold on! 

38
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,300
 Hey, what are you doing right now? 

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,290
 Hey! Sir, someone jumped off! 

40
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,190
 Hey! 

41
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,560
 Come here! What's with this bastard? 

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,040
 Come here! 

43
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,100
 What? 

44
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,000
No way. How could Ahjumma be... I mean...

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,020
How could you be a time traveler?

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,130
Everyone in the year '95 thinks you're Choi Se Kyeong.

47
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,960
It's because I look exactly the same.

48
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,320
I look just like my mom.

49
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,400
- Mom? 
 - Yes.

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,940
I'm Choi Se Kyeong's daughter, Oh Eun Yoo, from the year 2023.

51
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,020
How about you? What are you?

52
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,550
Me?

53
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,030
I'm Ha Lee Chan and Yoon Cheong Ah's son, Ha Eun Gyeol, from the year 2023.

54
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,690
What?

55
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,490
Are you two making a movie?

56
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,360
You'd better come back.

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,220
We'll wait here until you come.

58
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,660
Hey, the next train isn't coming for an hour.

59
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,800
Tell them to just come straight to the cabin.

60
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Forget it. Just come straight to the cabin—

61
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,910
Hey, what if they get lost? They don't know how to get there.

62
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,060
Gosh, seriously.

63
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,670
Wait right there until I figure out a solution.

64
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,620
I'll kill you if you go somewhere else!

65
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,810
So...

66
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,070
   

67
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,540
You're Lee Chan's son?

68
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,330
So...

69
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,210
you're Choi Se Kyeong's daughter?

70
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,570
It's fascinating how genes transform.

71
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,050
You don't look like him at all.

72
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,070
Genes are so powerful.

73
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,010
I thought you were a clone.

74
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,710
Hold on. Have you been flirting with my mom, then?

75
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,880
With a woman who's the same age as your parents?

76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,470
Hey, how about you? You flirted with my dad, Ha Lee Chan.

77
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,590
At least, I had a reason for it.

78
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,180
Reason? Okay, let's hear it. What was the reason?

79
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,850
Is this "name"?

80
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,260
This is "name"?

81
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,650
Are you okay?

82
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,050
No.

83
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,410
Gosh, I didn't think Ha Eun Gyeol would do this.

84
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,840
How could he put on a show like that right after you got dumped?

85
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,400
Anyway, cheer up.

86
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,870
I can't.

87
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,890
I mean, I won't.

88
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,480
How am I supposed to cheer up seeing that?

89
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,560
Brother. Brother, please pick me.

90
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,150
How could she? For me, seeing her smile is more difficult than winning the lottery... Gosh.

91
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,810
- Please pick me! 
 - My gosh. My gosh.

92
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,280
She thinks that's funny? Is saying "Brother" funny?

93
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,350
Why? Which part?

94
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,600
Which part exactly... Hey.

95
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,720
My gosh. Hey, you. Hey!

96
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,420
You tried to set Lee Chan and Cheong Ah up?

97
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,660
Why? Aren't they supposed to be together, anyway?

98
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,360
Was it necessary to set them up?

99
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,330
Because of you.

100
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,910
- What? 
 - Because you suddenly came back from the US.

101
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,120
 Se Kyeong. 

102
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,080
 Hi. Long time no see, Lee Chan. 

103
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,360
 You were cold as ice, 

104
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,610
but you suddenly started acting friendly.

105
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,360
 I went to the ice cream shop, 

106
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,390
 but I heard you're doing band practice today. So I came to cheer for you. 

107
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,610
 Ta-da. How does a theme park sound? 

108
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:56,360
If Mom and Dad don't end up together because of you, I won't...

109
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,870
be born.

110
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,560
How about you? Why were you suddenly friendly to Lee Chan?

111
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,260
You pretended to be your mom, too.

112
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,500
- Because of you. 
 - What?

113
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,980
Because you called my mom's name.

114
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,740
 - Choi Se Kyeong? 
 - No, I'm not. 

115
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,090
 You're Choi Se Kyeong. Don't you know who I am? 

116
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,800
Because you told me about Lee Chan.

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,700
 Don't you feel guilty toward Ha Lee Chan at all? 

118
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,630
 He formed a band for you, and he's practicing day and night, singing his heart out. 

119
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,540
 How could you leave without a word? 

120
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,650
Because of what you said, I thought he was Mom's first love.

121
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,380
And I had to set them up, no matter what.

122
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,020
W-Why did you try to set them up?

123
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,330
Because I didn't want to be born.

124
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:51,910
If Mom ends up with her first love instead of Dad, I won't be born.

125
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:57,070
So, it was a battle between matchmaking and breaking people up.

126
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,570
We were like a sword and a shield.

127
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,770
By the way, hold on. Didn't you say you're a Coda?

128
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,320
Yes.

129
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,950
Yes, I just got the key to the cabin from your friend. Yes.

130
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,960
Yes, we found it right away.

131
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,390
There are too many heads to mess up.

132
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:21,850
By the way, sir. Would you be able to give a ride to two runaways on the way?

133
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:27,060
A boy and a girl idiot couple got off at the previous station by accident.

134
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,550
Yes, yes. That's the station.

135
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,040
Really?

136
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,260
Yes, yes. I will.

137
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,460
Thank you. Thank you, sir!

138
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,380
 But Lee Chan knows how to speak. 

139
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,600
He doesn't just speak. He sings, too.

140
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,100
Are you really sure he's your dad?

141
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,580
I found out when I came here, too.

142
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,790
My dad wasn't born deaf. He went deaf later.

143
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,280
He lost his hearing due to an accident when he was in 11th grade.

144
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,220
11th grade...

145
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,640
- If so— 
 - Yes.

146
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,050
1995. The year we traveled to. It's now.

147
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,100
When did the accident happen, then?

148
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,690
I already stopped it from happening.

149
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,870
 Hey! 

150
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,450
 Don't touch Lee Chan, you sons of bitches! 

151
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,910
Gosh, what a relief. That's such a relief.

152
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:27,120
I think I came here to prevent his accident from happening.

153
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,960
How about me?

154
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,280
What's the reason I came here?

155
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,530
- It's because— 
 - Why the two of us?

156
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,270
Who sent us to the same time period and space? And why?

157
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,500
There must be a connection between us two.

158
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,740
- Hello? Master? 
 - Hello? Master?

159
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,770
   

160
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,970
Huh? Mr. Choi.

161
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,760
Were you the owner of the cabin who was picking us up?

162
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,520
A friend of mine owns the cabin.

163
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,620
I'm just his guest who visits a few times a year.

164
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,850
Oh, I remember.

165
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,880
You're the one who gave me the handkerchief at the festival. Right?

166
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,940
Thank you so much for that.

167
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,070
Well, sure.

168
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,110
Well, what's your relationship?

169
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,800
She's Choi Se Kyeong. She's a friend who goes to the same school as me.

170
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,970
And she's the photographer for our band.

171
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,640
I see.

172
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,380
By the way, do you know me?

173
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,380
I think you called my name then, too.

174
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,060
I remembered hearing your name somewhere...

175
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,610
Well, let's get going. They're waiting.

176
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,030
- Get in. Get in. 
 - Okay.

177
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,940
Why do you keep looking at me?

178
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,590
Huh?

179
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,190
And you keep avoiding eye contact, too.

180
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,720
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,610
But she doesn't look 28 years older than you.

182
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,510
Mr. Choi.

183
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,920
Hey, what's he talking about?

184
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,850
Did you tell him that we're time-traveling?

185
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,030
I was talking about her maturity.

186
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:33,250
I think I said she acts 28 years older than me.

187
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,090
What the heck are you saying...

188
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:46,300
That's it. I'll be at the cafe. Let me know if you need anything.

189
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,240
Okay. Thank you for the ride.

190
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,470
Age is just a number, and love has no borders—

191
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,080
Forget it. Yes, I'm a pervert.

192
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,680
We'll talk about this after the camping trip.

193
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,690
Let's act like we belong in this world for now.

194
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,010
If we get caught, the family tree and history will get messed up,

195
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,910
and it causes confusion.

196
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,020
Hey. You can't say that when you flirted with a woman 28 years older.

197
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,570
Hey. Come on!

198
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,200
Fine. Just worry about yourself.

199
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,760
Don't you know I'm a genius at disguising?

200
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,090
I'm Choi Se Kyeong right now, man!

201
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,680
You're Oh Eun Yoo. Choi Se Kyeong isn't like that.

202
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,670
 What? What's going on? 

203
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,900
 Lee Chan is angry. 

204
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,370
Do you see the world with the Disney filter on?

205
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,290
Are you trying to cheat without the pain of creating?

206
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,760
I came up with an idea.

207
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,630
You can't be seriously calling this an idea.

208
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,740
This is a copy.

209
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,310
This is crude.

210
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,000
And this is a horrible mix between a copy and something crude.

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,770
- What are you, hacks? 
 - Excuse me. We're here.

212
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,650
What? So what if you're here?

213
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,720
Did you win a war or win an Olympic gold medal?

214
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,370
What's the big deal about the big entrance?

215
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,150
- Follow me. 
 - Right now? In this situation?

216
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,580
- That's right. 
 - Just me?

217
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,150
Just you.

218
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,300
Se Kyeong.

219
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,700
What happened, Se Kyeong?

220
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,590
Why did you suddenly jump off the train?

221
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,350
Well, the thing is... It's definitely not his fault. I...

222
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,470
I suddenly craved garakguksu. 
  (Thick wheat noodles) 

223
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,180
- G-Garakguksu? 
 - Yes.

224
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,330
Cheong Ah, it's not me.

225
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,570
They aren't fighting because of me.

226
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,880
Have a seat first.

227
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,530
- Have a seat. 
 - Have a seat.

228
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,350
Here's your pillow.

229
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,510
Have some cucumber...

230
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,770
 I'm sorry, Eun Gyeol's mother. 

231
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,060
 I almost stole your husband. 

232
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,810
 I'll never do that again. 

233
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,810
Give it to me right now.

234
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,040
Give you what?

235
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,390
It's really nothing.

236
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,260
I don't think you're telling the truth!

237
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,060
Seriously!

238
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,970
How dare you touch me there?

239
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,120
Give it back!

240
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,600
- Where did this come from? 
 - Give it back!

241
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,210
- How do you use it? 
 - Gosh, seriously.

242
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,200
Shit.

243
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,500
It's just a voice recorder. It's a new model from overseas.

244
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,880
I just use it to record whenever I have a song idea.

245
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,690
♪  It's a new beginning, I breathe out  ♪

246
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,460
Hold on.

247
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,530
Did you...

248
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,290
write that?

249
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,180
Yes.

250
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,590
Why ask?

251
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,720
Do you think it's good?

252
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,000
For some reason...

253
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,610
it stinks.

254
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,120
What? What? What? What is it? What's happening?

255
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,600
Hey, hey, hey. Hurry, hurry.

256
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,290
Se Kyeong just came up with the original song title. It's amazing.

257
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,180
I-I vote for "Fire Up."

258
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,940
Fire! It's cool.

259
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,560
"Dynamite" is cooler. Bam!

260
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,220
I really liked "Not Today," too.

261
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,940
Seriously.

262
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,380
- Are you crazy? 
 - Shut up!

263
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,310
- How could you talk to Se Kyeong like that— 
 - Hold on!

264
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,100
Hold on.

265
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,250
I just came up with an amazing motif.

266
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,390
- Do you want to hear it? 
  - Yes, yes, yes. 

267
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,700
♪  - My blood—  ♪ 
 - No!

268
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,430
Don't you understand copyrights?

269
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,600
Follow me.

270
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,830
Let go of me first. Your hand is too salty.

271
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,710
By the way, are they really dating?

272
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,400
Don't they act too much like siblings?

273
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,710
Whatever.

274
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,390
Might as well come up with an idea individually

275
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,200
and regroup after an hour.

276
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,330
- Okay. 
 - Dismissed.

277
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,170
Okay.

278
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,440
Gosh, seriously. Why are you so angry?

279
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,600
A genius at disguising, my foot. Just have a press conference and say you're from the future.

280
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,190
Don't worry. I was just joking.

281
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,450
By the way, aren't they so pure?

282
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,180
They're so sweet and so pure. I'm having too much fun!

283
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,940
Hey!

284
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,890
I figured out why I came here.

285
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,760
Master told me this when he paid me for the cello.

286
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,370
 How about you go on a trip before you die? 

287
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,530
 It will be a bit unusual. 

288
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,520
That was it. A trip. Something fun!

289
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,620
Excuse me. I'm time-traveling now, too.

290
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,840
I'll have fun. I'll just enjoy it.

291
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,740
I'll work hard on the mission until there are two moons.

292
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,130
Don't stop me.

293
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,670
Catch me if you can.

294
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,460
You think I will?

295
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,610
You'll have to. Otherwise, I'll go in and

296
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,750
sing a Blackpink song.

297
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,730
Hey, stop! Come here.

298
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,210
Gosh, okay. Okay!

299
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,970
Seriously. Come here!

300
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,460
We're taking a break for an hour.

301
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,860
Do you want to go biking with us?

302
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,570
 Me? 

303
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,660
I thought you might be bored alone.

304
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:41,580
I tried picking one that resembled me.

305
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,130
Face...

306
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,630
name?

307
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,420
 Yes. 

308
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,050
 Since it's complicated to spell the name in sign language, 

309
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,920
 you name someone by their face, personality, or characteristics. 

310
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:26,590
 For example, "A cat with a spot under its chin." Like that. 

311
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:34,860
Do you have a face name, too, then?

312
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,950
 Yes. 

313
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,550
What is it?

314
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,090
What does this mean?

315
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,970
 Clear sound. 

316
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,460
 My mom, whom I was separated from, named me that when I was little. 

317
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,870
How pretty.

318
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,970
From now on,

319
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,780
I'll call you by your face name.

320
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,890
 I came up with a name for you, too. 

321
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,150
Me? My name?

322
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,650
What is it?

323
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,030
What does it mean?

324
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,150
 Shiny voice. 

325
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,200
 I can't hear it, but I can see it. I can feel it. 

326
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,320
 You shine the most when you perform music. You look the coolest. 

327
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,490
 So don't worry about me and work hard as the frontman. 

328
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,720
 I'm not bored. I don't feel lonely, either. 

329
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,100
 I have eyes, a heart, and things to do, too. 

330
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:22,480
♫  You looked so different  ♫

331
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:28,280
 It's time. Should we go now? 

332
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:36,120
♫  We could have been together  ♫

333
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:51,500
♫  Go all the way around a distance at the end of this road I sing a love song  ♫

334
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:58,640
♫  These shining moments  ♫

335
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:06,520
♫  I can give them all to you  ♫

336
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:14,940
♫  Our small dreams, I'll protect you until then, so you don't let go  ♫

337
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,360
 Shining? 

338
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,950
Yes.

339
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,980
What? You told me it stinks earlier.

340
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,600
Hey, I was just immature then.

341
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,020
Everyone grows.

342
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,440
Wow, that's pretty good.

343
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,000
It's good as a concept, but it's not a bad title, either.

344
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,330
You heard that. Right?

345
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,510
Our manager can predict the Billboard charts.

346
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,640
He's actually thinking about becoming a fortuneteller in Miari.

347
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,670
So why don't we start writing the song now?

348
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,700
It's not like we're making rice cakes.

349
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,380
You think rice cakes appear if you have rice?

350
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,790
How did it go earlier?

351
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,350
Was this it?

352
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,890
You remembered that?

353
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,340
I didn't remember.

354
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,280
The genius DNA in my body remembered it.

355
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,600
Geez, here we go again. Somebody get him a leash.

356
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,690
How about...

357
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,680
we add chords like this to that?

358
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,630
 Whoa. 

359
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,130
That's nice.

360
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,190
Pretty good.

361
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,420
What was it? Repeat the chords again.

362
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:36,230
Wow. This layout is pretty good.

363
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,320
I'll stop here.

364
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,780
Should we swap and have a look now?

365
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm excited.

366
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,360
Wow. Isn't Lee Chan too flashy on his own?

367
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,100
Okay. Let's go with this.

368
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,800
Wow. Eun Gyeol's mom is talented.

369
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,810
I heard the '90s aesthetic is trendy these days.

370
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,130
This would work in 2023, too.

371
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,080
How cute.

372
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,290
Huh?

373
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:18,560
 I've been curious. When did you learn sign language? 

374
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,760
I met a deaf person at the hospital when I briefly had a hearing issue. He taught me.

375
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,860
I learned quickly because he was so handsome and fun.

376
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,540
 Was he more handsome than Eun Gyeol? 

377
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,390
Gosh, hey. You can't even compare them. Of course, Eun Gyeol is more...

378
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:47,520
By the way, do you think they could finish writing a song overnight?

379
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:55,510
In the first six bars in the intro, I want the two of them to have the drum.

380
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,830
Make it fun. It has to be fun.

381
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,390
Boom, pow. Boom, boom, pow.

382
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,380
- That's it. 
 - Nice, nice.

383
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,150
And I want there to be a chorus starting at the third bar.

384
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,990
And I want the bass to kick in then, too.

385
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,270
Something like this?

386
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,420
Okay, okay.

387
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,690
By the way, this is A minor. Right?

388
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,810
Yes. A flat, B flat. Synchronize.

389
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,710
So you want A flat and B flat to be offbeat.

390
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,900
Let's try it.

391
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,930
- Something like that? 
 - Yes. Pretty good. Right?

392
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,840
What would you call this theme?

393
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,750
- The coolest on earth. 
 - The coolest on earth.

394
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,450
We have to make it fun no matter what.

395
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,250
Fun, fun. The coolest on earth!

396
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,410
One, two, three.

397
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,040
 - The coolest on earth.  
 - That's right. The coolest on earth.

398
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,400
Start with the guitar and...

399
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:59,440
I'll jump in the center. Let's do it together.

400
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,330
The two of us have to sync.

401
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,410
We'll do it together at first and...

402
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,700
Didn't you sleep?

403
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,860
Lee Chan.

404
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,270
Oh, good morning.

405
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,890
You didn't sleep a wink?

406
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,690
Do you think this could be a song?

407
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,810
Did you write the lyrics, too?

408
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:45,240
I just put together what we talked about.

409
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,150
You think we could use it?

410
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up!

411
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,050
Hey, hey. Come here, Shi Gook. We got a song.

412
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,160
We got a song.

413
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,520
When did you write all this?

414
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,650
Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol!

415
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,450
Lee Chan wrote it!

416
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:13,030
Lee Chan wrote it, I said!

417
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,770
H-He's sleeping.

418
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:52,730
♫  It's a new beginning, I breathe out  ♫

419
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,760
♫  A moment I've been waiting for  ♫

♫  So let's begin  ♫

00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,850
♫  The days that shone so bright  ♫

♫  So you can dream again, higher, higher  ♫

431
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,660
♫  Fly higher. I hope this moment lasts forever  ♫

432
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,510
♫  My heart is racing. I'm running out of breath  ♫

433
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:58,840
♫  I waited for this moment at the end of long days  ♫

434
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,670
♫  Just like our dreams that are shining in the distance  ♫

435
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:10,250
♫  Let go of everything with this tireless song  ♫

♫  Forget about your worries  ♫

438

Guys, look over here!

♫  Let's try getting started  ♫

♫  The days that shone so bright  ♫

441

Let me film you.

Hurry!

443
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,540
Guys, look over here!

444
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,810
Hey! Come here, come here!

445
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,740
Come inside the frame!

446

448
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,570
Okay. Have one piece at a time.

449
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,850
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

450
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,880
- It's Hyeon Yool. 
 - Yes, Hyeon Yool.

451
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,070
I'll have some, too.

452
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,720
Oh. Hold on, hold on.

453

♫  Even if it passes by  ♫

454

Thank you.

456
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,210
Be as cheerful as possible.

457
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,150
One, two...

458
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,270
It's so refreshing. So refreshing.

459
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:13,470
♫  All our full dreams (shining, shining) just like now  ♫

♫  So you can dream again, higher, higher, fly higher  ♫

463
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,570
 You worked so hard for the past couple of days. 

464
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,040
I don't need to say a lot.

465
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,880
I want you to just remember this one thing.

466
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,130
I. G. O. T. M. Y. G. U.

467
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,490
I. G. O. T... What's that?

468
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,310
It's game over the moment you give up.

469
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,380
Dang it. I thought it was an actual saying.

470
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:51,960
I never questioned that we'd lose to Ilyoung High.

471
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,880
So keep that in mind.

472
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,850
- Viva... 
 - La...

473
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,820
Gosh, there are too many people here.

474
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,980
Come on, come on! Viva!

475
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,290
La Vida!

476
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,520
Watermelon!

477
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,820
 Sugar! 

478
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,280
- Dismissed. 
 - Okay.

479
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,200
Let's go.

480
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,390
Let's go, Cheong Ah.

481
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,800
Huh? No.

482
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,890
- You come with me. 
 - Where?

483
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,790
Are you that bad at reading the air?

484
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,600
Should we have an afterparty, then?

485
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,660
Leave, leave, leave. You dumbass. Let's go.

486
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,450
What are you doing?

487
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,200
Huh?

488
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,090
Shall we?

489
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,240
Gosh. I'm sure you'll get born just fine.

490
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,080
Yes.

491
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,860
You might get born sooner than you're supposed to.

492
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,300
What?

493
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,040
What?

494
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,170
I suppose they're rich kids. I was contacted by their lawyer first.

495
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:04,200
They said we should settle if we're going to demand compensation later.

496
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,760
I just made them write an apology letter to be done with it.

497
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,340
Didn't you say there was one more?

498
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:15,450
Oh, his name is Ha Lee Chan, and goes to Baegwang High. You must know him, too.

499
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,410
He's the one who crashed the garden party, caused a scene,

500
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,160
showed up at school with a truck.

501
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,520
He apparently was violent first this time, too.

502
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,630
Chairman can't know about this.

503
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,710
Do you understand?

504
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,400
Go in now.

505
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:51,570
If someone bothers you again, contact me immediately.

506
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,990
Go in. I'll get going.

507
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,840
If there's only a pay phone around,

508
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,580
tap on the receiver like this.

509
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,860
Twice.

510
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,660
Three times.

511
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,440
Twice.

512
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,300
Can you do it?

513
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,640
Try it, then.

514
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,540
Good job.

515
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,260
I'll really go now.

516
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,780
Bye.

517
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,690
Cheong Ah, what are you doing in front of the gate?

518
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,580
Hello, I'm an 11th-grader at Baegwang High, Ha Lee...

519
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,820
You must recognize me, too.

520
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,990
I only have unpleasant memories about you.

521
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,080
Do we have to keep seeing each other here?

522
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,990
No. I'll say hello another day. Well, then...

523
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,810
You skipped your lesson and didn't come home without telling me.

524
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,710
You hang out with thugs and get into fights.

525
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:18,550
And you chat in sign language so the whole neighborhood can see.

526
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,750
What else do you have left?

527
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,650
How else will you humiliate your family now?

528
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,500
Did you laugh? How dare you laugh at me?

529
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,820
 Don't touch me. 

530
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,000
I said not to use sign language.

531
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,130
 I'm no longer alone. 

532
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,700
 You're the queen of this house 

533
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,960
 and your slaves, whom you pay, will do what you want. 

534
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,830
 But there's another world out there. 

535
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:51,710
 And there are friends who listen to me and help me. 

536
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,870
Talk, talk, talk.

537
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,290
I told you to talk!

538
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,080
 Touch me one more time. 

539
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,610
 And you'll see your name in the newspaper. 

540
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,550
Bring me the key.

541
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,210
Pardon? Which one—

542
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,210
Why are you asking? Bring both!

543
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,610
Okay.

544
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:35,300
 Lee Chan, help me. Come pick me up. 

545
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,680
 Dad, help me. 

546
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,250
 The teacher hits me. 

547
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,210
 She ties me up. 

548
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,670
 She traps me. 

549
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,390
 I don't want to learn cued speech. 

550
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,260
Bring her out.

551
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,560
 If someone bothers you again, contact me immediately. 

552
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,270
What are you doing? Catch her!

553
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,640
Cheong Ah.

554
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,140
 Cheong Ah... 

555
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,250
 Chairman. 

556
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,410
 I told you to bring Cheong Ah. What are you doing? 

557
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,400
 C-Chairman. 

558
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,610
 Dad! 

559
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,070
 You did it, Cheong Ah! 

560
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,790
 You finally learned how to say "Dad." 

561
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,490
 Good work, Cheong Ah. 

562
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,980
 You really did a great job. 

563
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,810
 The class hasn't ended. Take her upstairs. 

564
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,420
 Let's go, let's go. 

565
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,890
 Good girl. Let's go, let's go. 

566
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,410
 No. 

567
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,540
 How dare you block my path like this? 

568
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,930
 Pitying and being sympathetic don't help. 

569
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,810
 If she stops now, she'll stop talking again. 

570
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,710
 Be even-headed, Chairman. 

571
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:44,720
 I'll make sure Cheong Ah becomes someone who will lead the Jinsung family. 

572
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,370
 Let's go. 

573
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,660
 Let's go. 

574
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,550
Bring the rope.

575
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:11,570
What did I say I'd do if you used your hands?

576
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,680
 I said I'll tie up your hands. 

577
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,220
 What did I tell you to do if you want something? 

578
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:33,060
 Speak with your mouth, not your hands. 

579
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,220
 I said only the two of us... 

580
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,710
 have to know what happened here. 

581
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,160
I said your mom would come back that way.

582
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,870
   

583
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,090
You went through here?

584
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:26,660
Yes. It was late at night.

585
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,710
There were two moons in the sky.

586
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,720
I was at an empty lot in Hongdae, and La Vida Music suddenly appeared.

587
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,580
I sold the guitar there and left and—

588
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,810
You were here?

589
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,410
Yes.

590
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,000
You were in a back alley in New York?

591
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,980
Yes. I was in Gimpo Airport when I left the store.

592
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:47,070
We left from different places,

593
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:51,870
but we both arrived in 1995.

594
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:56,090
What? What kind of logic is that?

595
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:59,580
Two moons. La Vida Music.

596
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,050
Sold instruments. The suspicious master.

597
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,590
The year 1995.

598
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:09,190
To think of this in terms of quantum physics—

599
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,200
Wow, you're like Sherlock—

600
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,160
Hey, go over there and push the bookcase. Let's see if it moves.

601
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,870
Never mind.

602
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,090
- It's too unfair. 
 - What is?

603
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,980
Your matchmaking was a success, and you prevented your dad's accident, too.

604
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,680
But I failed at breaking up my parents and suicide, too.

605
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,320
This time travel must've been designed in your favor.

606
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,980
Favor, my foot. You got paid in dollars.

607
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,020
Because that master bastard only gave me 50,000 won bills

608
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,160
that I couldn't even buy a bungeoppang (fish-shaped pastry).

609
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,040
What is he, anyway?

610
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,880
It's either one or the other. He's crazy or has a loose screw somewhere.

611
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,080
- What's the difference? 
 - There's a subtle difference.

612
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,790
You pay for this.

613
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:52,940
Was this grand debate only about who pays for the meal?

614
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:58,050
The logic of the world and even quantum physics were brought up.

615
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,320
You succeeded in matchmaking, but I—

616
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,360
Okay. I'll pay for it.

617
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,180
I will, but...

618
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,350
I haven't completed my mission yet.

619
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,890
I have the most difficult task left.

620
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:22,450
Wow, seriously? She won't let a deaf person use sign language?

621
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,710
That's not acceptable in the 21st century at all.

622
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,420
This is the year 1995.

623
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,050
I didn't know Cheong Ah was in a situation like that.

624
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:36,680
So you made a deal with Chairman Yoon... I mean, your grandpa?

625
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,360
- Yes. 
 - You love torturing yourself, don't you?

626
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,580
Your trip is a pain since you came up with a mission on your own.

627
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,200
It's not a pain.

628
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,600
It's for my mom to become happy.

629
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:54,500
Wanting to see his daughter smiling must mean he wants to reconcile.

630
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,170
I really want Grandpa to see

631
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,470
my mom smiling.

632
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,570
She looks very pretty.

633
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,120
And how about you?

634
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,860
Did you have enough fun?

635
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,920
You think you'd clear all the missions before you go back?

636
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,250
Yes, pretty much.

637
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,670
But there's one thing...

638
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,240
Never mind.

639
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,980
What? Tell me. I told you everything.

640
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:27,460
Later. I'll tell you when things become clear.

641
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,460
That's enough for today. I'm off.

642
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,560
Welcome.

643
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,570
Do you know a band named White Nights, by chance?

644
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,710
Of course. They were the best back in my day.

645
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:50,360
Is there a magazine with an article on that band?

646
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,610
Preferably one with detailed articles and a lot of photos.

647
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,050
I'm home...

648
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:05,390
Y-You came.

649
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,690
You came.

650
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,960
Give me the clothes that need to get dry cleaned.

651
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,660
I think I'm okay.

652
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,480
Is Cheong Ah inside?

653
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,630
No.

654
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,600
She's taking a lesson at Professor Kim's today.

655
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,310
Where's Cheong Ah right now?

656
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,230
I told you. She's at Professor Kim's—

657
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,230
Should I report her missing?

658
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,600
Should I get help from the police?

659
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,830
What are you people doing in this house?

660
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,710
Do you want to be an accomplice?

661
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,120
Tell me.

662
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,790
Tell me where Cheong Ah is right now!

663
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:33,520
♫  We are in different times  ♫

664
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:40,910
♫  We met while wandering around  ♫

665
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:48,020
♫  Among so many people  ♫

666
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:55,580
♫  I recognized you  ♫

667
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:58,610
♫  We dream the same dream  ♫

668
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,520
 You found me. 

669
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,810
 The hide-and-seek is over. 

670
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,400
 After 12 years. 

671
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:18,060
♫  Go all the way around a distance at the end of this road  ♫

672
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:24,220
♫  I sing a love song  ♫

673
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,100
You have a family, too, Mom.

674
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,990
You have a true family.

675
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,260
Let's go.

676
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,200
Let's go to them right now.

677
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,230
♫  I can give them all to you  ♫

678
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:44,080
Let's get out of here immediately.

679
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:57,600
♫  I'll protect you until then, so you don't let go  ♫

680
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,820
Move.

681
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,730
Move it now.

682
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,500
We can't.

683
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,120
Move unless you want to get hurt.

684
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,930
Just leave them. Let's see how far they go.

685
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,600
Eun Gyeol.

686
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:30,540
Do you even know what you're doing right now?

687
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:36,650
Kidnapping is a criminal activity.

688
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,410
Not as much as imprisonment and abuse.

689
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:41,710
My gosh. You're using horrible words.

690
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,600
Instead of a good word like disciplining.

691
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,690
- Aren't you afraid of anything? 
 - No, I'm not.

692
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,060
I have no fear in this world.

693
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,990
There's nothing I can't do, either.

694
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:55,340
I can yell in front of the National Assembly, too.

695
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:00,530
There's a child abuser in the famous Jinsung family of musical instruments!

696
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:05,520
Come in quietly when I'm asking nicely.

697
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,480
No.

698
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,870
I won't talk to you.

699
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,300
I'll settle it with the Chairman myself.

700
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,030
Tell him when he gets back from his business trip.

701
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:23,810
Contact me personally if he wants to see his daughter.

702
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,730
Would you be able to handle it?

703
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,660
Can you be responsible?

704
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:38,770
If you go out that gate now, you'll regret it later.

705
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:46,610
That's what I want to tell you.

706
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:51,040
I'll change your history from now on.

707
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,280
A comfortable life? Forget about it.

708
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,040
I'll teach you what justice means.

709
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:07,600
I definitely warned you.

710
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,990
   

711
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:25,050
I need to tell you something, Grandmother.

712
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:33,440
I had a feeling when they didn't show up when their daughter was at the police station.

713
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,750
But how could they do that as a human? My goodness...

714
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,400
Even animals won't do that.

715
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,050
This is for the better.

716
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:46,260
I'll sell my underwear to feed, dress, and sleep here if I have to.

717
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,660
So let here be here for now.

718
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,840
Thank you.

719
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,050
Where are you going?

720
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,820
Jinsung family's house.

721
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,920
I should tell them what they've done.

722
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,500
Why would you?

723
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,100
Should I just sit back and watch?

724
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,800
They're strangers to you.

725
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,400
- It's none of your business. Sit down. 
 - Grandma!

726
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,150
The head of the family is not home.

727
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,690
He apparently had no idea.

728
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,960
Don't you care about Cheong Ah?

729
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,020
You want to destroy the entire family?

730
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:20,420
You need to give her some time to think about

731
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,020
if she should forgive her ignorant father or not.

732
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,850
Just let him, sir.

733
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:33,930
He has too much anger in his chest right now.

734
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:38,170
He needs to let it out sometimes so it doesn't turn into resentment.

735
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:43,280
He's not that clueless. Just go to him and

736
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,490
listen to what he has to say.

737
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,100
Okay.

738
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:56,050
Lee Chan.

739
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,730
Hold on.

740
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,610
Let go.

741
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:04,420
They need to know there are people on Cheong Ah's side.

742
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,940
They need to know that people are watching them.

743
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,460
Okay. Go when the Chairman comes back.

744
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,330
Who?

745
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:13,780
That money-making machine?

746
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,800
Whether his house is becoming a prison

747
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,500
or his daughter is being abused, he plays ignorant and works all the time. That guy?

748
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,590
- Lee Chan. 
 - How is he different?

749
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,270
How is he different from my father who's a gambler and roaming

750
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:31,070
around the country, abandoning his mom and child?

751
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,090
I didn't ask him to have me.

752
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:38,300
They never asked us if we wanted to be born.

753
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:41,050
They can't abandon us after having us.

754
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:43,840
They should at least hear us blaming them for creating us.

755
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,280
That's what parents should do!

756
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,970
Goodness, there are no girls in this house.

757
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:08,350
I did wash it cleanly. I don't know if you'd like it.

758
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:12,810
Gosh. You're so pretty.

759
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:20,500
How come your eyes are so clear and as dark as wild grapes?

760
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,780
Not being able to talk must be hard enough.

761
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,590
You must've been so upset and frustrated.

762
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:34,390
But you did a good job growing up as a pretty young lady.

763
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:36,610
I'm proud of you.

764
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:41,420
If someone harasses you or

765
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:44,210
tries to trap you in the attic again,

766
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:48,470
don't put up with it and run all the way here.

767
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:53,280
Or you can just start living with me.

768
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,740
Golly, gosh!

769
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,970
Yes, yes.

770
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:09,000
Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

771
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,100
Don't cry.

772
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,880
Don't cry.

773
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:21,670
 Since I had Grandma... 

774
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:24,450
 Thanks to her, I was able to endure. 

775
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,240
But does she...

776
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:35,490
have anyone by her side?

777
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:39,080
Yes, she does.

778
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,040
You, me, Grandmother,

779
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,840
and...

780
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,600
 older brother, Eun Ho. 

781
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,830
She's a good kid. And impressive, too.

782
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:58,010
She must've never been loved properly. But...

783
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,420
how is she able to be so devoted to me?

784
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:05,730
You're cool.

785
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:08,460
You definitely deserve to be loved.

786
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,780
What's with you? Do you need to borrow money?

787
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:17,070
You'll become a very good father.

788
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:19,770
What are you saying? I won't get married.

789
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:23,760
What? Why? Why won't you get married?

790
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,940
How about me? What am I supposed to do?

791
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,040
You shouldn't be joking right now.

792
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,870
I won't do it.

793
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:37,170
I might not know how to love since I've never been loved by my parents.

794
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,460
I'm afraid of it.

795
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,250
You'd never be like that.

796
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:48,930
You'll be loved by your wife and be respected by your kids.

797
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:52,100
You'll become a very impressive and great dad.

798
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,790
I can guarantee you.

799
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:56,740
What is it? How much do you need to borrow?

800
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:01,150
Let's go. Cheong Ah must be waiting. She's alone.

801
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,300
Let's keep her company.

802
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,210
Gosh, you shouldn't have chosen that one.

803
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:19,380
The one with a red ribbon. This. This.

804
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:23,470
I said you'll get Hongdan if you have one.

805
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,370
Hey, you should give up one card.

806
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,340
Come on! I can't backtrack.

807
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,330
If you keep insisting, I'll give up on the three Gos and stop.

808
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,960
You mean bastard.

809
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,100
Don't you know how many meals I made you?

810
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,430
Just give up on one card.

811
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,080
I said I won't play it the old people's way.

812
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,350
You should follow the rules.

813
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,370
Here comes a new player.

814
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:44,820
- Gosh! 
 - Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

815
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:48,730
I can finally digest the tteokguk I had last year.

816
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,960
No, no. I had no choice.

817
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,870
What are you doing? Seriously!

818
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,930
- It was a mistake. 
 - Geez!

819
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:57,240
Grandma digested tteokguk, she said!

820
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,910
 I finally found out after I came here. 

821
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:07,990
 That my mom and dad had painful youths, too. 

822
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:09,070
No, no. This isn't right.

823
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:11,450
Hey, hey. Let's do it again.

824
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:13,020
My hands are slippery.

825
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,220
Grandma, it slipped out of my hand.

826
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:18,910
Goodness gracious! What do we do? Gosh!

827
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:22,870
 Grandma finally digested tteokguk. 

828
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,540
 They overcame the pain and wounds... 

829
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,120
 and became my parents. 

830
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,060
Okay. Ready, start.

831
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,760
   

832
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,480
   

833
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,660
 What's Mr. Choi like? 

834
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:19,590
 Ha Eun Gyeo says he was a legendary guitarist who conquered the rock scene in Korea. 

835
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:21,180
 Is that true? 

836
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,260
 It can't be more true. 

837
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,460
 You've heard of White Nights, the legendary rock band. Right? 

838
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,110
 - You don't know White Nights? 
 - No. 

839
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,390
 I don't want to talk to you. 

840
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:34,250
 Why? Is White Nights that great of a band? 

841
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:36,070
 They weren't just great. 

842
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:39,170
 If only they lasted 10 more... I mean, five more years, 

843
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:42,620
 Korea's rock scene would've changed. That's what the experts say. 

844
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,510
 The frontman of that band was... 

845
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:46,950
 him. 

846
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,700
 Why is someone that great grilling meat here? 

847
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,560
 It's all because of the scandal. 

848
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,140
 Hey, that was made up by the competitors— 

849
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,090
 What scandal? 

850
00:56:55,090 --> 00:57:00,340
 There was a rumor that he fell in love with a rookie actress and had an illegitimate child. 

851
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,210
 Illegitimate child? 

852
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,480
 Of course, he lost his female fans 

853
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,230
 and the record sales went down. 

854
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:11,650
 The band collapsed, disbanded, and they retired. 

855
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:14,680
 The rumor hasn't been confirmed yet. 

856
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,750
 It was a great loss for the Korean rock music scene. 

857
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,410
Hello, welcome...

858
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,440
What brings you here?

859
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,610
I want to know about my mom.

860
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,800
The actress Shin Ha Young.

861
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,840
 Press two to record a message... 

862
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,660
Ha Eun Gyeol,

863
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,260
why didn't you come to school today?

864
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,620
Cheong Ah didn't come, either.

865
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,270
Everything's okay with you two. Right?

866
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,990
Something happened to me.

867
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,800
Something huge happened to me.

868
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,780
You know...

869
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:58,610
I think I'm homesick.

870
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:02,080
I suddenly crave Mom's cooking so much.

871
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,110
I'm hungry.

872
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,950
Let's eat together.

873
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:15,190
It's on me today.

874
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:21,260
Welcome.

875
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,260
I'm sorry, Ma'am. We'll come back next time.

876
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,490
Okay, then.

877
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,000
- Why? 
 - Let's go.

878
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,880
I can't let you have your mom's food, but I can get you Grandmother's food.

879
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,620
So you brought Cheong Ah to the boarding house?

880
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,800
Yes. Just until the Chairman comes back.

881
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,690
You'll face your grandfather yourself once he comes back?

882
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,070
I'll try my best.

883
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:59,240
By the way, didn't you say something happened? What happened?

884
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,270
Never mind. You must be worried already. I don't want to add to it.

885
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,400
What is it? Tell me.

886
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,630
I was just hungry, like I said.

887
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,190
Anyway, I envy you.

888
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,550
Your mom, dad, and great-grandmother.

889
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:15,080
The whole family is living together.

890
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,140
It's not everyone. My brother isn't here.

891
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,870
Oh? Did you have a brother?

892
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:21,610
Huh? Didn't I tell you last time?

893
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:23,930
I went to the gym a lot because of my brother, who did taekwondo.

894
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:26,660
Oh, yes. You did.

895
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,800
Am I homesick, too?

896
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,150
I suddenly miss him a lot.

897
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:38,300
My brother's so athletic and handsome that he was very popular with girls.

898
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:42,520
Gosh, I miss you, Ha Eun Ho.

899
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,370
Hold on.

900
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,740
What's your brother's name again?

901
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,940
Eun Ho. Ha Eun Ho.

902
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,830
What's wrong?

903
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:58,470
Were you Eun Ho's younger brother?

904
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:59,890
Do you know my brother?

905
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:03,390
Eun Ho is the one who taught me sign language and the word "Coda."

906
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:07,000
I befriended him when I was being treated for hearing loss.

907
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,850
 Hey! Stop it! 

908
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:13,870
 You have a girlfriend again, don't you? 

909
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,690
 Who is she this time? 

910
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:18,650
 A pretty girl. 

911
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:22,270
 She majors in cello at the arts high school. 

912
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,070
By chance...

913
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,160
are you "metaphone"?

914
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,660
Yes. I exchanged a lot of DMs with him

915
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,870
and we wrote to each other a lot, too.

916
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:35,170
I can't believe you're Eun Ho's brother.

917
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:36,820
Wow.

918
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,470
What's the deal with you and me?

919
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:42,240
How tangled up are we, exactly?

920
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,620
- Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol. 
 - Yes?

921
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,880
You said you prevented Lee Chan's accident.

922
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,130
No, you were wrong.

923
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:55,680
What are you talking about?

924
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,120
I heard it from Eun Ho once.

925
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,590
The date he gets into the accident is—

926
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:03,590
Hey. The teenage boy and girl over there.

927
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:06,750
Are you on a date and skipping school?

928
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,220
Lee Chan, coming back from school?

929
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,200
Hello. Yes, I am.

930
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,420
It wasn't a day before the festival.

931
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,280
The accident...

932
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,650
hasn't happened yet.

933
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:21,370
I'll get going now.

934
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:23,270
- Take care. 
 - Bye.

935
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:56,310

 I don't know exactly where the accident happened 

944
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:53,550
 but I'm sure he planned to see Mr. Jonathan that day. 

945
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:54,610
 Do you have something to tell me? 

946
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:56,120
 Let's go and let him hear our original song. 

947
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,880
 Let's ask him for help in person. 

948
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,280
 Please, sir. I beg you. 

949
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,650
 Chairman Yoon returned to Korea. 

950
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:02,210
 Could you bring Cheong Ah over? 

951
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:05,330
 Like I said, you can always come back. 

952
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,440
 Come with us for a second. We received a report. 

953
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,790
 You aren't police, are you? 

954
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:10,620
 Stop the car! Let me go! 

955
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,100
 Stay with Lee Chan, no matter what happens tomorrow. 

956
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,000
 Hey, son. Thank you. 

957
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,920
 I'll be born as your father in my next life.
