1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,280
   

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,090
   

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,920
   

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,730
   

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,580
   

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,800
   

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,090
   

8
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,060
   

9
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:51,110


10
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,100
What can I get you?

11
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,880
Help me?

12
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,270
Maybe they don't speak English.

13
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,170
Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan.

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,950
Welcome! How can I help you?

15
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,810
 (You're getting what you got last time, right?) 

16
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,460
 (Yes) 

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,830
 (So why are you taking so long? Do you want whipped cream?) 

18
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,220
 (Of course) 

19
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,520
 (Don't forget, get an extra espresso shot) 

20
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,620
 (Are you crazy? That's expensive. Just drink it normally.) 

21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,720
 (I thought you were going to use reward points anyway.) 

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,740
 (You cheapskate!) 

23
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,490
Hello, excuse me.

24
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,180
Excuse me. Um...

25
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,590
If you can write down what you would like...

26
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,250
I would like a large double espresso frappe with extra whipped cream and caramel syrup.

27
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,010
And a large mocha java chip frappe, please.

28
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,790
Yes.

29
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,700
You got that, right?

30
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,560
 (- Did you get the extra shot?)  
 - Double espresso with whipped cream...

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,280
Excuse me. Could I get an extra shot in the double espresso frappe?

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,890
- Extra shot. 
 - Extra shot.

33
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,270
Yes.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,490
 (Why do you want me to wear this? It's useless.) 

35
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,400
You don't get it.

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,290
You need this so cars don't honk at you.

37
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,030
They know you won't hear them,

38
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,940
so they just go around you.

39
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,440
You also look cool.

40
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,340
   

41
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,020
 My older brother is deaf. 

42
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,210
- Hello! 
 - Hey, Eun Gyeol!

43
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,820
- Are you here to eat? 
 - Yeah!

44
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,990
Have a nice day!

45
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,310
- Hi, Eun Gyeol! 
 - Hello!

46
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,090
Hey!

47
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,200
   

48
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,330
 (Grab the handles! It's dangerous!) 

49
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,580
 (Don't go so fast, you'll fall!) 

50
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,000
 (Don't do that) 

51
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,910
 My parents are deaf, too. 

52
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,430
 But I'm not. 

53
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,700
 I can hear. 

54
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,890
 I can speak. 

55
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,750
We need more chicken over here.

56
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,170
Coming right up!

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,300
Today's special!

58
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,870
Wow, Eun Gyeol!

59
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,590
Helping your parents out again today?

60
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,800
Gosh, you are such a good kid.

61
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,160
- I heard you do well in school, too. 
 - Sort of.

62
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,670
If I had a son like you, I'd gladly raise ten of them.

63
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,620
- I agree. 
 - Hold on.

64
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,590
Take it, take it.

65
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,580
No. My dad would get mad at me.

66
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,220
Just take it, kid.

67
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,380
Maybe you could bring out two makgeollis?

68
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,240
I can't do that. If you're drunk, you'll get into an accident.

69
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,290
Just one glass per person.

70
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,270
But I'll make sure they're strong pours.

71
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,700
Got it, kid!

72
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,250
Cabbage delivery!

73
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,840
- Hi! 
 - Hey, Eun Gyeol!

74
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,410
Goodness, so busy!

75
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,440
Hello!

76
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,020
What? Is something wrong with the delivery?

77
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,670
She says to take it back right now.

78
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,630
What did you say?

79
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,430
She says if you keep bringing inventory that won't sell, she'll stop working with you.

80
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,580
When did I do that?

81
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,350
These meals feed people who put in their blood and sweat.

82
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,050
She says, don't mess around with the ingredients.

83
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,380
Wow. This is crazy.

84
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,350
Who messed with it? Me?

85
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,900
She says just because we can't hear or speak doesn't mean we're stupid.

86
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,650
Don't even think about ripping us off.

87
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,750
She's let it go until now because of my dad, but she won't take it anymore.

88
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,150
She'll look at what you bring tomorrow and pay for this month's ingredients.

89
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,840
But why does it feel like you're scolding me?

90
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,890
The last thing you said. You didn't make that up, did you?

91
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:07,570
♫  Silent night, holy night  ♫

92
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:15,000
♫  All is calm, all is bright  ♫

93
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:22,530
♫  Round yon Virgin Mother and Child.  ♫

94
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:29,940
♫  Holy Infant, so tender and mild,  ♫

95
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:37,420
♫  Sleep in heavenly peace.  ♫

96
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,950
 Merry Christmas! 

97
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,860
Merry Christmas!

98
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,160
 Why did you wake up? 

99
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,420
The choir singing and the snow falling woke me up.

100
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,950
 I thought snow fell silently. 

101
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,800
I can hear it.

102
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,830
 What does it sound like? 

103
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:00,500
A sound that gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling, like the laundry you dry in the sun.

104
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,750
 Snow is cold, but the sound is warm? 

105
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,700
 Eun Gyeol, you might grow up to be a poet. 

106
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,190
 Oh, it's snowing! 

107
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,640
 Let's go outside and make a snowman. 

108
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,970
Brother!

109
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,310
Mom! Dad! Mom!

110
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,220
Mom! Dad! Brother!

111
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,460
That thing's going to fall!

112
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,710
It's dangerous! Hurry up!

113
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,550
 I told you not to go near buildings under construction. It's dangerous. 

114
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,180
 But Dad saved me. 

115
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,720
 What if Eun Gyeol had been next to you? 

116
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,230
Dad, if Brother and I are both in danger,

117
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,810
who are you going to save first?

118
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,040
Dad!

119
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,090
If Brother and I are both in danger,

120
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,160
who are you going to save first?

121
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,870
 Sounds fun. 

122
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,270
 If Eun Ho, Eun Gyeol, and I are all in danger? 

123
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,960
 Who are you going to save first? 

124
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,900
 I regretted asking that question. 

125
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,800
 Obviously... 

126
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,860
 From that day, I remembered my dad's answer at every important moment in my life 

127
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,990
 and my heart ached every time. 

128
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,590
 What floor are we on? 

129
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,580
   

130
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,210
You made it!

131
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,090
Mom, that lady is here.

132
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,440
You're early.

133
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,560
You know I'm giving you way under the market rate. Right?

134
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,780
 The lady says the house is cheap. You know that. Right? 

135
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,270
No one in the building liked the idea,

136
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,820
but I went door to door to convince them.

137
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,290
I told them, at least you won't be loud.

138
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,650
I like it quiet and peaceful, and disabled people—

139
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't have anything against them.

140
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,330
 The lady welcomes us. 

141
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,920
 She says, go on and move in your stuff. 

142
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,370
Huh?

143
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,100
Why are your parents laughing at me?

144
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,800
You didn't talk trash about me, did you?

145
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,300
No. I told them what you said.

146
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,620
So why was it so short? I talked for a long time.

147
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,790
If that's all, could I go move our stuff now?

148
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,760
Sure, well. Sure!

149
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,890
See you later.

150
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,980
   

151
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,910
What in the world? He is different than he looks.

152
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,190
Hey, Byung Ho. Where are you right now?

153
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,490
♫  An especially bright, happy day  ♫

154
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,830
♫  My heart is beating, you might hear it  ♫

155
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,330
♫  I don't want anyone but me to know  ♫

156
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,550
♫  You don't know how I feel  ♫

157
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,040
♫  I feel weird when I look at you  ♫

158
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,890
♫  Did I find the universe I lost?  ♫

159
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:34,250
♫  I'm so curious, the story of you and me  ♫

160
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:41,920
♫  Tell me. Do you feel the way I do sometimes?  ♫

161
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:51,150
♫  You can tell me that you feel the same way, too  ♫

162
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,590
 We're going to be coming home late often. 

163
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,490
 If something happens, call us right away. Okay? 

164
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,410
 After school, come to the restaurant to have lunch. 

165
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,400
You'll pack us dinner, so we'll bring it home to eat.

166
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,490
Don't ever touch the gas stove.

167
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,230
Right?

168
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,040
 After sunset, come home... 

169
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,600
I'll always stay with Brother, no matter what.

170
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,450
 I need to go right now. 

171
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,060
 Do I need to go to the bathroom with him, too? 

172
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,480
 Hello, my name is Yeom Byeong Ho. I live on the 4th floor with my mom, the landlady. 

173
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,840
 My mom told me to say hello. 

174
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,880
 - Okay. 
 - Hi! 

175
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,100
Are you Ha Eun Gyeol?

176
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,410
Can I go play with Eun Gyeol?

177
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,340
I want to show him around the neighborhood.

178
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,020
 Of course, of course. 

179
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,440
Can my brother come?

180
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,450
 My mom told me to be friends with just you since you get good grades— 

181
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,640
Today is just for fourth graders.

182
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,870
Let's hang out with your brother next time.

183
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,920
Is that okay?

184
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,190
 Of course. 

185
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,520
   

186
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,390
Why are we stopping?

187
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,210
You should know.

188
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,230
You always avoid that place.

189
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,360
   

190
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,350
I heard the old guy who runs that store eats children.

191
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,570
Do you actually believe that?

192
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,160
This guy can't follow a joke.

193
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,350
What we mean is,

194
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,000
he wears a special bracelet right here.

195
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,630
   

196
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,950
   

197
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,190
Hold on!

198
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,830
Get it! Please!

199
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,300
- No, no, no, no! 
 - Eat, eat. Hurry.

200
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,360
Hurry up, hurry up.

201
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,300
   

202
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,100
Eat, eat!

203
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,000
    
 Is there more?

204
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,390
No, no, right there!

205
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,010
Next to you! No, in front of you!

206
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,170
What are you doing?

207
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,680
 Eun Gyeol, come home right now! 

208
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,090
Why? I'm having fun.

209
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,290
Hey! What are you doing with the charger? The center is wide open.

210
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,880
Gosh! I died.

211
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,590
 Mom and I need to go to the restaurant. 

212
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,550
 Your brother is going to be alone. 

213
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,080
 Hurry home right now. 

214
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,120
Okay.

215
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,030
Sorry, guys. I need to go home.

216
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,560
What was he doing on his phone?

217
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,610
Sign language.

218
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,100
It's creepy. Don't bring him along next time.

219
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,230
Deal with it.

220
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,160
I'll put him to good use later.

221
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,550
 You guys remember tomorrow is the math chapter test. Right? 

222
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,160
 Yes! 

223
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,160
The test will cover multiplication to division.

224
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,070
Please try your best to be ready.

225
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,010
 Yes! 

226
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,050
- Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol. 
 - Yes?

227
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:17,600
Maybe you can be polite this time and get one question wrong?

228
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,700
You know I'm kidding. Right?

229
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,710
- Yeom Byeong Ho! 
 - Yes?

230
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,650
Maybe you can be polite this time and get one question. Right?

231
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,860
You know I totally mean that. Right?

232
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,310
Want to study for the test together?

233
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,910
Why would we both study? That's unproductive.

234
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,700
Only you need to study.

235
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,300
Hey, Yeom Byeong Ho!

236
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,290
The guys we crushed yesterday want revenge. What do you say?

237
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,680
We got to fight them, then.

238
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,950
Okay, let's go.

239
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,600
Put it in my room.

240
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,640
Hey, what did you mean by that earlier?

241
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Darn it.

242
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,820
I thought you were supposed to be smart.

243
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,550
It's simple, so listen up.

244
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,700
Write my name on your test tomorrow.

245
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,450
Then I'll write your name on mine.

246
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,680
Super easy. Right?

247
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,320
You want to defraud? 
  (He uses a difficult word for "cheating" here) 

248
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,290
I don't know what that means, but do your best. Okay?

249
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,210
Don't forget, your family's future depends on you.

250
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,630
My family's future?

251
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,900
How much more do I need to beat around the bush?

252
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,300
Don't piss off the landlady's son and have your poor family on the streets.

253
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,120
   

254
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,680
Five more minutes, guys. Wrap it up.

255
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,000
   

256
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,940
   

257
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,060
Are you trying to show off or something?

258
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,810
I hung out with you out of pity, and you think you're all that?

259
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,970
Don't stare at me.

260
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,280
You want to get beaten up?

261
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,040
I never said I'd cooperate.

262
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,980
"I never said I'd cooperate."

263
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,890
I'll let it go today.

264
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,680
- But next time, I'll tell your mom— 
 - You jerk!

265
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,960
Hey, let go, let go.

266
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,200
Watch me. I'll talk to my mom,

267
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,380
and kick out your dirty family from our building.

268
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,150
Get ready, you jerk!

269
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,850
   

270
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,770
   

271
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,850
♫  Would you know my name  ♫

272
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,190
   

273
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:33,400
♫  If I saw you in Heaven?  ♫

274
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,720
♫  Would it be the same  ♫

275
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,510
♫  If I saw you in Heaven?  ♫

276
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:51,400
♫  I must be strong  ♫

277
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:56,110
♫  And carry on  ♫

278
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:02,760
♫  'Cause I know I don't belong  ♫

279
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,050
♫  Here in Heaven  ♫

280
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,940
Towel off.

281
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,160
You'll catch a cold staying wet like that.

282
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,570
Or come inside and have some hot chocolate.

283
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,260
If you go home like that, your parents will be worried.

284
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,470
Hey, look. Not here.

285
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,570
Not here. Cool?

286
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,330
Thank you.

287
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,120
Why are you crying because of those little bastards?

288
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,540
Those kids are ruthless.

289
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,820
The whole neighborhood's given up on them.

290
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,340
Just ignore them.

291
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,170
That's not why I was crying.

292
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,230
I was crying because of the song.

293
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,890
The song was so sad.

294
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,310
I felt like it was talking to me.

295
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,680
You know Eric Clapton?

296
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,680
Who is that?

297
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,640
Don't hold it all in.

298
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,350
Tell your parents.

299
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,990
I can't do that.

300
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,900
You can tell your parents anything.

301
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,430
- Just explain. 
 - If I cause trouble,

302
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,900
people talk badly of my parents.

303
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,580
That they're disabled and don't know how to raise their children.

304
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,340
They're both deaf.

305
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,380
If I make a mistake,

306
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,500
they'll be blamed twice as much as others.

307
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,070
So, I need to be good.

308
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,780
You don't have any siblings?

309
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,170
My older brother is deaf, too.

310
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,870
Thank you for the drink.

311
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,900
Do you want to learn guitar?

312
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,460
What?

313
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,030
The Eric Clapton song.

314
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,090
Don't you want to play it yourself?

315
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,670
If you master that one song,

316
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,640
your life will be completely different.

317
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,420
Number one...

318
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,700
Minor...

319
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,270
Three...

320
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,560
Sorry.

321
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,410
Don't feed the beast.

322
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,910
You feed kids like that,

323
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,940
they'll poop it out with their mouths.

324
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,860
You can't reason with guys like that.

325
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,100
But an instrument is different.

326
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,260
This guitar is not like those kids.

327
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,320
If you speak to it truthfully,

328
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,890
it will answer truthfully.

329
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,050
And if you speak to it tenderly,

330
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,140
it will respond tenderly.

331
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,410
And if you're happy,

332
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,420
it will be happy, too.

333
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,650
Or... maybe you're angry.

334
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,630
It will be angry with you.

335
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,400
How can I play like you?

336
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,790
You need to learn its language.

337
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,370
- Language? 
 - Yeah.

338
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,820
You need to know how to speak to this guy.

339
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,650
See the English here?

340
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,260
These are chords. They're like names.

341
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,330
You sing these to the guitar, one by one.

342
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,280
Not with your mouth, but with your hands.

343
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,620
Then, it will respond...

344
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,130
the way you want it to.

345
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,320
 In a way, it's like sign language. 

346
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,590
 You talk with your hands, and the music talks back. 

347
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,660
Oh, my goodness, I'm so busy. What are you doing here?

348
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,660
Ma'am, I have a question.

349
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,910
I heard there's a law called tenant protection.

350
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,470
Even if you're the landlady, if it's during the lease,

351
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,680
you can't evict the tenant. Is that true?

352
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,480
Are you threatening me?

353
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,120
Who said I'm evicting your family?

354
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,850
Oh, so we are protected by law!

355
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,100
Thank you.

356
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,610
I'll tell my parents, too.

357
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,640
See you later.

358
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,010
What the heck? I don't have time for this.

359
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,320
 You have major chords and minor chords. 

360
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,510
Right, now go to two. The second one?

361
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,160
 If major chords sound bright, 

362
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,540
 minor chords feel a little sad and melancholic. 

363
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,890
Try it. That's right.

364
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,120
To be considerate is not a difficult thing.

365
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,320
Just like how all of you are quietly focusing on me,

366
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,750
you think of the other person...

367
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,570
 Major and minor chords must coexist harmoniously, 

368
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,540
 in order to complete a great song. 

369
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,550
 Life is like that, too. 

370
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,670
 There has to be hardship and the joy. 

371
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,930
 That's how you make your life twinkle. 

372
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,390
Slow strumming.

373
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,140
Slow strumming. Listen.

374
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,260
One-two, three-four...

375
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,910
Let's try it.

376
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,230
A.

377
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,510
B.

378
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:43,570
 But why do you hide this from your family? 

379
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:47,220
 I just feel bad. 

380
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,400
   

381
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,970
 That you're the only one who can hear music? 

382
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,740
 No. 

383
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,420
 That I'm the only one who can play it. 

384
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,280
   
   

385
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,660
Just say it.

386
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,750
- Say what? 
 - You're deciding whether to compliment me.

387
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,840
Hold on a second.

388
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,690
What is this?

389
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,720
Listen to the song on it.

390
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,390
Then, make up a guitar riff.

391
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,840
If I listen to it and think it's good,

392
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,290
I'll give you that guitar you've been eyeing.

393
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,840
Really?

394
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,970
You'll really give me that guitar?

395
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,510
I said if I listen to it and think it's good.

396
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,730
I said that very clearly.

397
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,280
It's not a complete song.

398
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,070
It just has a lead guitar, the main melody.

399
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,530
You fill it out.

400
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,810
   

401
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,980
What?

402
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,190
What are you doing? Just go!

403
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,260
What are you doing?

404
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,870
Hey!

405
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,620
Hey!

406
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,670
Hey.

407
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,300
Hey! Don't toss your garbage here! Take it back!

408
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,910
Hey! Hey! Ha Eun Gyeol!

409
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,510
Hey! Take it back!

410
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,130
Hey!

411
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,920
Why are you making all that noise?

412
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,730
Ten more minutes!

413
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,320
Don't you dare move!

414
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,050
Where are you going?

415
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,910
I thought it was the restaurant's day off.

416
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:05,850
 We have to go to headquarters to talk about extending the restaurant's contract. 

417
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,130
 Your brother has a cold. 

418
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,810
 He took his medicine and is sleeping. 

419
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,550
 Wake him up around seven and give him his fever medicine. 

420
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,730
 Don't go outside. Please stay with your brother. Okay? 

421
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,560
Okay.

422
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,880
See you later.

423
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,360
 But who wrote this song? 

424
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,000
 Was it you, by any chance? 

425
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,480
 No. There's no way. 

426
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,120
 You wouldn't know even if I told you. 

427
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,160
 Or no one would. 

428
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,220
 They were an unknown artist. 

429
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,790
 Hey! 

430
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,570
Ha Eun Gyeol!

431
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,190
Come outside!

432
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,970
Are you ignoring me?

433
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:13,190
If you don't come out in three, I'll kill you.

434
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,090
One!

435
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,900
Geez, you dirty bastard.

436
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,930
Don't give me your trash.

437
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,380
Put your trash in your trash can.

438
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,870
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

439
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:19,350
 Grandpa, why aren't you answering your phone? 

440
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,560
 I already did my homework. 

441
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,490
 I'm headed to the shop now. Please take a listen. 

442
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,840
 I'm super confident you'll like it. 

443
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,440
   

444
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,030
Grandpa?

445
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,380
Grandpa!

446
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,650
Grandpa!

447
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,650
   

448
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,130
   

449
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,660
   

450
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,110
Cut off the gas and electricity.

451
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,130
Get the equipment and follow me.

452
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,710
Yes, sir!

453
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,770
What were you doing? Why are you so late?

454
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,080
You're looking for your kids. Right?

455
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,090
The firefighters just went inside. Just wait.

456
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,990
They're coming out! They're coming out.

457
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,740
Here, here, here, here, here.

458
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,600
   

459
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,810
Huh?

460
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,960
They have two kids.

461
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,880
He's trying to say there's one more inside.

462
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,640
- We looked everywhere. 
 - Yes.

463
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,910
- Please tell him no one else is inside. 
 - Oh, my.

464
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,780
Hey, there is no one inside.

465
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,880
No one is inside your house.

466
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,230
Mr. Ha! Mr. Ha!

467
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,670
No, no, no, no!

468
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,950
No, no, no, no.

469
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,380
Excuse me! Excuse me!

470
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,730
Mom!

471
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,580
 Why are you here? 

472
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,400
Where's Brother?

473
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,350
 He's in an ambulance on the way to the hospital. 

474
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:06,210
Where's Dad?

475
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:09,640
 He went inside to get you. 

476
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,870
 Dad, if Brother and I are both in danger, 

477
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,570
 who are you going to save first? 

478
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,590
 Obviously, it's you, Eun Gyeol. 

479
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,320
 Me? 

480
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,830
 You're lying. 

481
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,850
 It's true. 

482
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,890
 Of course, I would try to save our whole family. 

483
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,890
 But it might be hard on my own. 

484
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,110
 So I'm going to save you first. 

485
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,100
 Because... 

486
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,170
 Because? 

487
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:42,010
 You're going to run and find someone who can help me. 

488
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:53,150
 Eun Gyeol, you are the voice that connects our family to the world. 

489
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,840
 You're an angel. 

490
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,500
 - Okay? 
 - Okay. 

491
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,030
Dad! Dad!

492
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,310
Dad!

493
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,510
Dad!

494
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,420
Dad!

495
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,620
Are you okay?

496
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,120
Hurry up! Hurry up!

497
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,980
Dad!

498
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,630
Dad...

499
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,130
But how did the fire start?

500
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:11,100
The kid was sleeping alone at home.

501
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,340
I don't know.

502
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,240
Goodness.

503
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,070
You pay back my kindness with such cruelty.

504
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,640
Are you so bored that you set someone's building on fire?

505
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:41,510
 The fire wasn't our fault. It was because of a cigarette. 

506
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:46,100
Anyway, I've been considerate of your situation. I've done enough.

507
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,790
Renters insurance or whatever. File a lawsuit or start a protest. Do whatever you want.

508
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,280
But leave my building right now.

509
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:56,300
I can't give you your deposit back.

510
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,460
You know it doesn't come close to covering the repair cost. Right?

511
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,090
 Did you check if you forgot anything? 

512
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,990
 Everything's burned. 

513
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,200
 - Did you forget anything?  
 - No.

514
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,780
Dad.

515
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,940
Hold on just one minute.

516
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,660
I want to say bye to a friend.

517
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:21,870
   

518
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,920
   

519
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:31,260
♫  We are in different times  ♫

520
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:37,510
♫  We met while wandering around  ♫

521
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:46,230
♫  Among so many people  ♫

522
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:52,400
♫  You looked so different  ♫

523
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:59,480
♫  We dream the same dream  ♫

524
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:07,390
♫  We could have been together  ♫

525
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:15,810
♫  Go all the way around a distance at the end of this road  ♫

526
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:21,970
♫  I sing a love song  ♫

527
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:29,050
♫  These twinkling moments  ♫

528
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:36,990
♫  I can give them all to you  ♫

529
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:44,050
♫  Our small dreams  ♫

530
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:55,440
♫  I'll protect you until then, so you don't let go  ♫

531
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,440
   

532
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:08,870
   

533
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,100
Get out of the car.

534
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:35,700
This is where we're going to live now. Just the two of us.

535
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,400
You just focus on music.

536
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,740
You know what I mean. Right?

537
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:56,290
Good, good, good! Finish it, finish it, finish it!

538
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:59,740
That's right!

539
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,980
Nice!

540
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,550
Okay, okay.

541
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,960
Circle up.

542
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,250
Since you blew out your cruciate ligament last match, you keep hesitating on your kicks.

543
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:30,140
It could turn into a bad habit, so be careful.

544
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:37,960
 He's saying that you hurt yourself at the last match, so be careful. 

545
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,660
 Okay, okay. 

546
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,350
Careful. Okay?

547
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,800
 - Yes, sir.  
 - All right.

548
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,750
Wow. Anyway, you might be ready to compete after helping your brother.

549
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:51,380
You're getting light-years better every day.

550
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:52,920
Do you want to try?

551
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,650
I need to help him get a medal first.

552
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:59,430
Hey, hey, you'll get hurt. Hey!

553
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,550
Hey, no.

554
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:02,350
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

555
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:08,650
Anyway, listen to the coach and focus on physical therapy.

556
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,650
Before the national competition,

557
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,330
you need to be in top shape.

558
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,300
   

559
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,830
You know admissions is tough with scores.

560
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:33,050
At the individual games,

561
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:37,930
you need to be in the top 3 if you want to be safely recruited.

562
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,920
Hey! Stop it!

563
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,450
You have a girlfriend again, don't you?

564
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:16,190
Before an important match? Good going.

565
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,490
Who is she this time?

566
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,960
 A pretty girl. 

567
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,190
 She's like me. 

568
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:26,790
Like what?

569
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,940
Being pretty?

570
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,490
Or does she play taekwondo?

571
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:35,430
 No. She's deaf like me. 

572
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,870
 She majors in cello at the arts high school. 

573
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,470
Hello! What can I get—

574
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,400
   

575
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,200
♫  It's a new beginning, I breathe out  ♫

576
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:38,640
Hold, h-hold on one moment, please.

577
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,520
He smells.

578
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,960
What can I get for you?

579
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:53,460
♫  Don't look back, you won't have any regrets  ♫

580
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,930
♫  No need to hesitate  ♫

581
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:01,120
♫  This chance won't come again, so let's begin  ♫

582
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,730
♫  The days that shone so bright  ♫

583
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:10,570
♫  All our full dreams (shining, shining) just like now, don't stop  ♫

584
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:15,290
 Please, let me hear your voice... 

585
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,710
 Come on. Come on... 

586
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:21,740
 Come on. Come on! 

587
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,620
 But how does a deaf person play the cello? 

588
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,490
 I want the watermelon sugar. 

589
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,070
 How about you guys? 

590
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,090
It's a lie?

591
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:33,160
So, she's not actually deaf?

592
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,330
Why would she lie about that?

593
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,780
 I don't know. She must have a reason. 

594
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:39,790
 Or maybe she just pretends in front of me. 

595
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:43,200
Why would she put up a show like that in front of you?

596
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,760
 Because she likes me? She wants to be like me? 

597
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,520
 She wants my attention? 

598
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,420
 Probably? 

599
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,560
You really have some unbridled confidence.

600
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,820
So, how do you talk to each other?

601
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,050
You said she doesn't even speak sign language.

602
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:00,320
 We write notes back and forth. 

603
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,140
 Her handwriting is as beautiful as her face. 

604
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,740
 We have a Jindo dog. Both of you, to the restaurant. Hurry up! 

605
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,490
Your ice cream is ready!

606
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,350
Ta-da!

607
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,180
Ta-da! Surprise!

608
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,880
Please talk to me. Don't step on my heart like that.

609
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,840
- That's not what I ordered. 
 - Yes, it is.

610
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,370
- No, it's not. 
 - Yes, it is.

611
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:40,990
Watermelon sugar, right?

612
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:45,640
I put a little tiny bit of my heart on top, very gently.

613
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,610
I'm sorry. I don't think I can carry that.

614
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,460
I'll carry it for you.

615
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,240
All the way to your seat, safely.

616
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,720
Move!

617
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,630
Move out of my way!

618
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,320
Your watermelon sugar has safely arrived!

619
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,060
Hey, Ha Lee Chan!

620
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,040
One Jindo dog. Run.

621
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,700
Hey, what are you doing, being so crass? We have patrons here.

622
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,700
- Your grandma is here, you bastard! 
 - What?

623
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:33,340
My name is Ha Lee Chan. Please come again.

624
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:36,700
   

625
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,420
Stop right there.

626
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,800
Grandma, put that down.

627
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,600
You young bastard. I told you to study.

628
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,290
All you think of is how you can scam people to make money.

629
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:58,030
What? Scam?

630
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,930
How can you talk to your grandson like that?

631
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:02,890
You stole student ID cards from the kids renting rooms

632
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:05,030
and got a job under false pretenses! That's a scam!

633
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,590
It's not false pretenses. It's a part-time job!

634
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:09,010
Who told you to get part-time job?

635
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:10,350
It's not just for me!

636
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:12,850
It's so I can take care of you! You handle it!

637
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:14,500
Let me just catch you!

638
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:18,570
I'll sew your mouth shut first!

639
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,800
- What are you doing? 
 - I'm so sorry.

640
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,230
- You messed up my tray! 
 - I'm so sorry.

641
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,420
Sorry!

642
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,440
Oh, all right.

643
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,480
Even if your marriage fails, go for it.

644
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,770
Hey, you!

645
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:10,860
   

646
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,380
What happened? One indo dog?

647
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,700
 There's the Jindo dog. 

648
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,860
   

649
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,150
How is it?

650
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,340
It's going well. Really well.

651
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,500
    
 - I hope it goes well. 
 - Tell them good luck.

652
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:33,700
We met about it today. It'll go well.

653
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,990
 Your dad brought them all after the vendors' meeting. 

654
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:40,010
For what?

655
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:44,500
 He's back after six years. He's bragging about his success. 

656
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,430
 He's been bragging about his kids for an hour. 

657
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,840
   

658
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:56,530
I'll admit it, I'm jealous.

659
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:03,770
You did a great job with your kids. Great job.

660
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,910
- You're right. 
 - Goodness.

661
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:11,640
 Five, four, three, two, one! 

662
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,880
 Ping! 

663
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:18,450
- He's asleep. 
 - Gosh, this again.

664
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,720
 Take him home. 

665
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,810
 Can you finish up? 

666
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,110
Why? Do you need something?

667
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:10,290
 Everyone at the vendors association was jealous of me. 

668
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:16,190
 They thought nothing of me six years ago. 

669
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:19,320
 No one can look down on me now. 

670
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:24,570
 I have a son who's going to be on the taekwondo national team, 

671
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,300
 and a valedictorian son who's going to be a doctor. 

672
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:33,220
 I have two amazing sons. 

673
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:37,310
I'm not a doctor yet.

674
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,570
 Thank you. 

675
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:56,730
 Eun Gyeol, I would never be treated like this without you. 

676
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:58,650
 Just focus on your studies. 

677
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:02,720
 I'll help you in any way I can. 

678
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:07,000
 There really must be a God. 

679
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:10,370
 He took away sound from me, 

680
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:13,970
 but instead, he gave me you and Eun Ho as a gift. 

681
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:37,240
 No one can look down on me now. 

682
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,000
 Thank you. 

683
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,920
 Eun Gyeol, I would never be treated like this without you. 

684
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,800
 Just focus on your studies. 

685
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:51,180
 I'll help you in any way I can. 

686
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:56,420
   

687
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:42,120
 Do you know what this symbol is? 

688
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:49,150
 This is like a secret code for people who do music. 

689
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:50,860
 It's called a coda. 

690
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,480
 If you put a coda at the end of a musical phrase, 

691
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:58,660
 it means getting ready to wrap up the song with a beautiful end. 

692
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:01,130
 It's a really good thing. 

693
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:04,290
 Want to know a secret? 

694
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:06,830
 - You're a coda, too. 
 - Me? 

695
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:13,320
 They call kids like you codas. The only one in a family who can hear and speak. 

696
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,710
 There are other kids like me? 

697
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:18,590
 Of course, there are. 

698
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:22,340
 They are people who connect the hearing world and the silent world. 

699
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,640
 With your voice and your hands. 

700
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,890
 And sometimes, with music like you. 

701
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:19,480


702
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:39,370
♫  I'm alone on top of the clock's hand  ♫

703
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:46,940
♫  All the days I've run, all that time  ♫

704
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:52,460
♫  The bright future that everyone dreamed of  ♫

705
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:57,220
   

706
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,370
 I want to do music. 

707
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:02,460
 You might not like it, but this is the real me. 

708
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,100
 You're lost right now. 

709
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,720
 This isn't the real you. 

710
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,230
 Welcome to our store. 

711
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,340
 How can I help you? 

712
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:11,010
 Oh, you're going to sell that guitar? 

713
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:12,370
 You fell in love. 

714
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:15,990
 The only way a poor, powerless man to win over a beautiful woman 

715
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:17,770
 is to be in a band! 

716
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:19,310
 What did you just say? 

717
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:21,430
 - You want to be what?  
  - Choi Se Kyeong's boyfriend. 

718
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,900
 - Your fly's open. 
 - Oh, my. 

719
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,820
 Yoon Dong Jin? 

720
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:27,430
 Dad?
