1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,310
   

2
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,150
   

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,950
   

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,700
   

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,740
   

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,850
   

7
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,100
   

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,900
   

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:50,970


10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,330
You said you'd protect me.

11
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,000
You said you'd help me go to college.

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,320
You said to be in the band together.

13
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,610
Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol, where the hell are you!

14
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,100
Am I...

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,200
back, then?

16
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,010
   

17
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Mom! Dad! Brother!

18
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,910
Dad! Brother!

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,800
 Why are you being so gross? 

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,900
Where's Mom? Where is she?

21
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,560
 She'll be late after hanging out with her friends. 

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,420
 She told us boys to figure out dinner. 

23
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,310
What are we having?

24
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,670
 Ramen. 

25
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,570
Ramen? That sounds amazing.

26
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,930
 What's wrong with him? 

27
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,120
It's so good.

28
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,660
 Dream? What kind of dream? 

29
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,130
A dream in which I met Dad in 1995.

30
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,740
 1995? 

31
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,940
 It's when I was 18, then. 

32
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,040
Yes. The same age as me.

33
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,940
I was your tutor

34
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,300
and I was in your band, too.

35
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,120
I went to the Snail Boarding House, too.

36
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,460
I even met Great-grandma, too.

37
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,660
 How about me? Didn't you meet me? 

38
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,050
It was before you were even born.

39
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,610
 What was I like in your dream? 

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,680
 I was cool. Right? 

41
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,670
Cool, my foot.

42
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,590
Do you know how much I suffered because of you?

43
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,030
You refused to study

44
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,660
and you made Grandma upset.

45
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,530
 - Se Kyeong, where were you?  
 - You said Mom was your first love,

46
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,850
but you were chasing after another girl.

47
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,830
 What? Another girl? 

48
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,870
 Is that really true? 

49
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,460
 Mom would get so upset if she found out. 

50
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,170
 No, no. Your mom was everything to me. 

51
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,040
 She was my first love. 

52
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,510
It's Mom.

53
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,090
I'll ask her myself.

54
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,680
 Don't do it. Don't. 

55
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,430
I don't want to. I'll tell her everything.

56
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,370
Mom!

57
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,070
You were all together.

58
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,940
How about dinner? Did you eat it?

59
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,650
 If you go back now, 

60
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,390
 the year 2023 will be a lot different than when you left it. 

61
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,100
 Do you still want to go back? 

62
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,730
No way.

63
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,390
Eun Gyeol, what's wrong?

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,410
Are you sick?

65
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,340
 Gosh, I guess you didn't know. 

66
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,650
 Everything started changing the moment you arrived here. 

67
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,620
- Eun Gyeol? 
 - No.

68
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,030
What's wrong, baby?

69
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,130
It's Mom.

70
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,540
No, no, no!

71
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,540
 What was that? What happened? 

72
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,030
 Where am I? 

73
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,260
   

74
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,430
 It's 1995? 

75
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,280
   

76
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,120
   

77
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,530
 Jinsung Instruments' chairman, Yoon Geon Hyeong? 

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,100
 Take this. You'll catch a cold. 

79
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,150
 That girl from then? 

80
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,590
You can't be running away. Right?

81
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,430
How strange.

82
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,360
He'd call me if he were running late.

83
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,870
 You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

84
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,190
Lee Chan, it's me. I can't seem to reach you.

85
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,510
I'm going home now. Call my house when you hear this message.

86
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,230
You almost bumped into me there earlier, right?

87
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,100
 - Se Kyeong?  
 - My goodness.

88
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,710
Are you okay? Did you get—

89
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,640
B-Blood.

90
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,760
Is it from bumping into me earlier?

91
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,610
My goodness.

92
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,390
Hold on! Hold on!

93
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,870
Where are we going?

94
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,140
Why are you taking me somewhere dark?

95
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,460
Hold on.

96
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,940
Cheong Ah? Yoon Cheong Ah.

97
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,280
Yes, Cheong Ah. Let's talk instead. Let's talk.

98
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,410
Where are we going?

99
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,610
Violence isn't the answer.

100
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,480
Lee Chan?

101
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,400
Lee Chan! What happened?

102
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,790
Help!

103
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,420
Someone passed out here! Is anyone there?

104
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,910
Is something going on?

105
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,320
Please call 911 now. Someone passed out here.

106
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay, I-I'll call.

107
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,010
Lee Chan. Ha Lee Chan.

108
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,900
Wake up, please!

109
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,020
Open your eyes. Lee Chan.

110
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,570
S-Se Kyeong,

111
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,920
s-stop shaking me.

112
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,760
My headache is killing me.

113
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,120
What? Are you awake now?

114
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,630
Do you recognize me?

115
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,960
What happened?

116
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,370
Can you get up?

117
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,730
Who are you?

118
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,070
No matter how much I looked, all I found was dust.

119
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,200
I couldn't find out anything about you.

120
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,740
Who the hell are you?

121
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,670
You have no belongings

122
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,570
and you have no ID, either.

123
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,270
 Oh, my bag. 

124
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,520
You weren't even a real contestant for the audition.

125
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,690
Well, let me explain what happened.

126
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,540
I went to the audition due to a situation, and I found the invitation for it.

127
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,600
But a staff member mistook me for a contestant.

128
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,580
- Are you a spy? 
 - Pardon?

129
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,620
You're an industrial espionage from Daemyeong Instruments. Right?

130
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,370
Or are you trying to scam me?

131
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,010
Or are you trying to blackmail me or something?

132
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,600
Looks like you aren't interested in believing me or listening to me.

133
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,700
Just imagine however you'd like. I'll get going now.

134
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,300
Where are you going? Sit.

135
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,430
Sit!

136
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,780
I spent so much money and manpower to steal you. Why would I let you go like this?

137
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,500
Do you think I brought you here because I like you?

138
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,250
Because of you, tons of reporters were at the hospital, and the company's image might suffer.

139
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

140
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,750
I'll get going because I'm in a hurry.

141
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,880
If you really want to leave,

142
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,220
sign this memorandum.

143
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,620
Memorandum?

144
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,000
What for? I'm the victim. Why—

145
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,400
Look at him. Look how he's calling himself a victim already.

146
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,950
You'll leave pretending to be innocent, and you'll make up stories

147
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,640
and come after me eventually.

148
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,030
Demanding compensation.

149
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,400
Happy now?

150
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,530
- Make sure to get it notarized. 
 - Okay.

151
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,110
Huh? You're...

152
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,210
I'm sorry.

153
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,870
   

154
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,980
 Yoon Cheong Ah. 

155
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,080
 Yoon Cheong Ah? 

156
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,550
Mom.

157
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,790
Mom!

158
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,500
Mom! It's me, Eun Gyeol!

159
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,700
Let go of me. I need to check something.

160
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,640
Let go of me, I said.

161
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,790
Hey, stop!

162
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,670
Let go! Let go of me!

163
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,780
Mom! Mom!

164
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,210
What's all the commotion?

165
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,700
Well, he kept calling Lady Cheong Ah "Mom" and insisted on checking something.

166
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,140
Crazy bastard.

167
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,390
I'm done dealing with him. Get him out of here.

168
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,230
Are you crazy?

169
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,310
The deal is off. I won't leave this place.

170
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,420
- Hey! 
 - Try kicking me out.

171
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,110
I'll barge into the office right away.

172
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,500
I'll meet with the chairman and face him directly.

173
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,630
Are you serious right now?

174
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,320
Hey.

175
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,540
Hey, get up.

176
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,840
Stop putting on a show and get up, you bastard!

177
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,850
Hey. Hey.

178
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,510
Hey!

179
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,510
Hey!

180
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,560
 They definitely called Mom "Lady Cheong Ah" earlier. 

181
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,490
 That means this is my grandparents' place, 

182
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,790
 Chairman Yoon Geong Hyeong is my grandpa, 

183
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,740
 and that annoying bastard is my uncle? 

184
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,780
How strange.

185
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,590
She definitely said she didn't have a family.

186
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,220
Why?

187
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,700
Why did she say that?

188
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,250
Get us cold drinks.

189
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,410
Yes, Ma'am.

190
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,410
Okay...

191
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,680
You came.

192
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,170
Hello, Ms. Im.

193
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,240
My mom doesn't like seeing you and Attorney Jang together, Brother.

194
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,650
Sang Ah, go to your room.

195
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,370
Okay.

196
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,370
What did you do this time?

197
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,400
M-Mom, the thing is...

198
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,660
That guy who got electrocuted the other day—

199
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,920
I told you to behave until the chairman comes back!

200
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,020
Gosh, get out of my face.

201
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,830
I'm not even surprised anymore.

202
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,420
Did you get into a fight again?

203
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,820
What's this now?

204
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,620
What's with that reaction?

205
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,840
How suspicious.

206
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,810
Did you steal this?

207
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,510
Is that why you got all bloody?

208
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,970
Is it a limited edition?

209
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,030
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

210
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,290
 Hey! 

211
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,050
 Let go of me! 

212
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,900
Just stay here.

213
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,400
But I just heard someone screaming outside—

214
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,150
Pretend you don't hear or see anything.

215
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,120
That'd be to your benefit.

216
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,110
Hey!

217
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,560
My hair.

218
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,600
My hair!

219
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,520
I'll pull out your hair, too.

220
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,760
I'll make you look like a boiled chicken.

221
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,370
Let go! Let go, I said! Let go!

222
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,910
Stop that right now!

223
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,080
What are you guys doing...

224
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:37,180
Mom, she took my keychain.

225
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,380
I asked her to give it back,

226
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,890
but she grabbed my hair like this

227
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,820
and insisted it was hers.

228
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,890
Se Kyeong got it for me from her trip to Europe.

229
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,330
Give me that.

230
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,450
Shut up.

231
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,120
Aren't you going to shut up?

232
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,170
What are you, an animal?

233
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,120
Talk like a human if you are one.

234
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,980
 - Mom? 
 - Shut up. 

235
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,240
 It's definitely her. 

236
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,570
Do I have to repeat the warning?

237
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,960
What are you people, anyway?

238
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,520
Do you skin people and make instruments with it?

239
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,470
I need to check. Move.

240
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,350
Will you behave if I tie you down?

241
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,640
Will you listen to me if I lock you in?

242
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,370
Those eyes.

243
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,800
I told you not to look at me with those eyes.

244
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,530
What are you doing right now?

245
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,730
I think you've been asked to stay in the annex, sir.

246
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,970
Didn't you tell him?

247
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,200
He didn't give us a chance to stop him.

248
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,650
Are you okay?

249
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,090
Are you hurt at all?

250
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,890
 Sign language? 

251
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,850
What are you doing right now?

252
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,690
Sign language is not allowed in this house.

253
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,610
What kind of nonsense is that?

254
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,400
If you don't let a deaf person use sign language,

255
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,260
how is she supposed to communicate?

256
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,770
 Tell me what's going on. 

257
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,710
 You can tell me everything, Mom. 

258
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,070
 Mom? 

259
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,960
You must've been shocked by the noise.

260
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,340
I was disciplining her as a mother.

261
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,000
Look the other way because it's our family business—

262
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,720
Discipline? Discipline, did you say?

263
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,810
What I saw today was clearly abuse.

264
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,640
Hey.

265
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,640
Don't you see this?

266
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,340
Can't you see my hair?

267
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,780
That thing bit her and pulled out my hair.

268
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,320
- "That thing"? 
 - Yes.

269
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,350
Asking politely doesn't seem to work for you.

270
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,390
We have no choice but to be rude, then.

271
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,390
What are you doing? Get him out of here now.

272
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,900
Let go.

273
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,740
Let go, I said!

274
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,440
Does the chairman know, too?

275
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,980
Does he know what's going on in this house?

276
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,560
Does he know how his daughter is being treated, too?

277
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,250
Shut his mouth immediately!

278
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,650
I'll tell him everything.

279
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,020
I'll tell the whole world about what I saw, heard, and experienced here.

280
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,660
Could I hear that first?

281
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,880
- Chairman. 
 - Dad.

282
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,770
Father.

283
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,140
I thought you were coming back the day after tomorrow.

284
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,040
You should've let me know if your plan changed.

285
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,700
Are you Chairman Yoon Geon Hyeong?

286
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,460
And you must be our unfortunate guest who got into an accident because of my son.

287
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,800
Let's hear it. It's regarding my family.

288
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,050
I need to know before the world finds out since I'm the head of the family.

289
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,370
   

290
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,440
What did they say? Did they say you're fine?

291
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,960
Yes.

292
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,180
They said I'd be friends with the bionic woman.

293
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,200
How about your head? Did they scan your head, too?

294
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,920
Yes. It wasn't fractured at all. It's totally fine.

295
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,790
They told me to go home tomorrow as planned.

296
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,060
Applaud, Ma Joo.

297
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,400
Are you sure you didn't lie just now?

298
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,750
Geez, why would I lie about that?

299
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,970
I heard the whirling noise in my ears like this.

300
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,770
It felt like I was communicating with aliens.

301
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,900
You don't know anything.

302
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,910
Right! Did you take care of what I asked you?

303
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,890
Yes. Bal San will get you discharged as your guardian.

304
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,490
He called the school pretending to be your cousin.

305
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,890
Nice. What a useful man he is.

306
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,990
Right. Please thank your father for me.

307
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,550
Tell him I'll be sure to pay him back for the hospital bill later.

308
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,860
Forget it.

309
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,840
You helped him a lot at the linen shop. He won't take your money.

310
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,330
Ma'am!

311
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,100
Walk slowly. Careful.

312
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,110
Where are you going? The restroom?

313
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,520
You should've told me. I would've come to you immediately.

314
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,040
Did you watch the drama yesterday?

315
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,350
Of course, I did.

316
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,680
See? I told you.

317
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,670
I said they must be half-siblings.

318
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,240
I know. What do we do?

319
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,550
It's okay, it's okay.

320
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:46,830
It'll turn out they aren't blood-related, and they'll end up together.

321
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,650
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

322
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,950
What a relief.

323
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,450
So relax and take care of your business.

324
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,280
Wow, he's so sociable.

325
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,030
No, don't worry.

326
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,360
People might think you've been here forever.

327
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,100
Hey, hey, hey. Come here. Come here.

328
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,370
Are you allowed to run in the hospital or not?

329
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,960
You're not, Captain.

330
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,640
Yes. Salute!

331
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,710
- At ease. 
 - Okay.

332
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,200
Lee Seul, what happened to your hair?

333
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,480
I'll braid your hair later.

334
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,940
Come to my room after dinner.

335
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,120
Yes, sir.

336
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,390
Yes, Princess.

337
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,420
   

338
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,650
You became a soldier, and you opened a hair salon, too. What a ruckus.

339
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,050
By the way, you didn't tell Grandma. Right?

340
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,440
I did. She called this morning, so I told her everything.

341
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,580
You want to die, don't you?

342
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,510
I was just kidding.

343
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,990
I told her we were pulling all-nighters studying at our place.

344
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,980
Well done, Cheetah.

345
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,910
Run now.

346
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,520
Going somewhere?

347
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,930
I'm glad I ran into you.

348
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,780
Bal San, you know where Ma Joo's linen shop is. Right?

349
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,190
Yes. I've been to Dongdaemun a few times to get fabric. Why do you ask?

350
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,730
Lead the way. I want to stop by there.

351
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,300
Why would you go there?

352
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,880
Lee Chan didn't come home last night, you know.

353
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,640
They said they'll study for the exam together at his house for a few days.

354
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,200
I can't just do nothing when they're caring for him.

355
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,300
I'll give them some side dishes so I can say hello to them, too.

356
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,720
Goodness, don't bother.

357
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,370
Just stay home.

358
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,570
Ma Joo eats tons of food at the boarding house.

359
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,590
And they're too busy dealing with customers and delivering stuff.

360
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,100
It'd be rude to just show up like that.

361
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,210
You're hiding something, aren't you?

362
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,610
What are you talking about?

363
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,170
You're blaming an innocent man.

364
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,160
It's because I've been having nightmares.

365
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,200
When Lee Chan's late mother shows up in my dream, he's either sick or injured.

366
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,340
Anyway, something must've happened to him.

367
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,880
Why are you just standing there?

368
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,980
I told you to lead the way. What are you, a totem pole?

369
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,870
How am I supposed to go like this?

370
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,810
I need to wash my hair and blow dry it.

371
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,690
Forget it.

372
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,130
I'll go find him myself. Geez.

373
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,220
Gosh, hold on, hold on.

374
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,440
You can't find him alone.

375
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,230
Don't you know how crazy the Dongdaemun Market is?

376
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,460
That's why you should lead the way.

377
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,880
Stop talking and go.

378
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,340
Come on, let's go.

379
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,100
Try not to shake it when you walk.

380
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,160
You're mixing up the food in the container.

381
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,510
Aigoo, you wasted all this food.

382
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,730
Goodness, you stupid bastard.

383
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,680
You did that on purpose, didn't you? Goodness, how wasteful.

384
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,260
It wasn't on purpose, Ma'am.

385
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,200
Gosh, what do we do with this? What a waste...

386
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,360
I'm sorry.

387
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,220
 - Ha Lee Chan. I did my best.  
 - Golly! How many times did I say not to shake it?

388
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,140
- Have you eaten? 
 - Have you eaten?

389
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,600
See, Ma Joo?

390
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,900
This is how lonely this world is.

391
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,070
Their frontman was hospitalized, but they won't even show up.

392
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,280
Gosh, I even told them you're going home tomorrow.

393
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,520
How could they be like this?

394
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,100
Why?

395
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,910
   

396
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,330
I handed it out in the whole Mapo District area.

397
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,200
I mentioned him in the church bulletin, too, just in case.

398
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,710
Why? You should play with a spiritual guitarist and stick with him forever.

399
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,450
You said Ha Eun Gyeol is the only guitarist for our band.

400
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,810
I know.

401
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,290
By the way, didn't Hyeon Yool come with you?

402
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,810
Gosh, he's so disloyal.

403
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,420
What are you doing?

404
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,940
Didn't you hear what they called you?

405
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,160
What happened to his face?

406
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,920
I had a fight with a Jindo dog while putting up flyers.

407
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,520
It was a good fight.

408
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,400
Wow, I'm so touched.

409
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,710
What can you do?

410
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,310
I should do what the frontman tells me to do.

411
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,400
Guys.

412
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,690
Don't do it.

413
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,970
I'm so grateful—

414
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,360
No. I told you not to do it.

415
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,330
I'll do my best to return the favor for your friendship—

416
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:52,670
- I told you not to! 
 - Stop!

417
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,120
- I'll do my best— 
 - Don't say it. No, don't hit me.

418
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,410
Please help me.

419
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,460
A patient is dying right now.

420
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,680
Who told you that I got beaten up?

421
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,300
It's okay.

422
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,520
They say a humiliating memory lasts as a fond memory forever.

423
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,990
Do I really have to say this myself?

424
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,320
About that legend...

425
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,970
of a passionate fight. 10 against 1.

426
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,690
 Could you move your dirty hand? 

427
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,460
 Otherwise, I'll snap your wrist. 

428
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,020
A toothpick?

429
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,340
Not a matchstick?

430
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,040
 You little punk. Do you want to die? 

431
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,680
 Hey, teach him a lesson. 

432
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,440
It can't be a gun, right?

433
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,920
 If you mess with someone who's precious to me, 

434
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,590
 I won't forgive you, no matter who you are. 

435
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,300
And at that moment...

436
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,920
 Lee Chan! 

437
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,820
 Lee Chan! 

438
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,190
 Lee Chan, wake up! 

439
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,280
 Open your eyes! 

440
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,060
 I'll die without you! 

441
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,320
Why would I die?

442
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,430
 S-Se Kyeong. 

443
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,420
Se Kyeong, come. Come sit here.

444
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,720
You saved my life.

445
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,900
By the way, I'm not the one who saved you then.

446
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,540
What?

447
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,400
You didn't save me?

448
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,430
- No. 
 - I knew it.

449
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,220
I knew it was all bullshit—

450
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,500
No, no.

451
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,440
But you took me to the hospital—

452
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,630
Yes, yes, I did. But...

453
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,930
someone else found you first and asked for my help.

454
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,420
You could say that she saved your life, I suppose.

455
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,880
Who was it?

456
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,880
She was a student at Seowon Arts High School.

457
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,390
Her name was...

458
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,340
Yoon Cheong Ah?

459
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,510
What? Yoon Cheong Ah?

460
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,970
Your friend Yoon Cheong Ah?

461
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,210
What? Yoon Cheong Ah is my friend?

462
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,500
Aren't you close if you exchange concert tickets and letters?

463
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,240
Yes, you're right.

464
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,090
Of course, we're close.

465
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,060
I was wondering how other people would perceive us.

466
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,770
I guess I was wondering how you two got close, too.

467
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,770
I guess we find each other easy to talk to.

468
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,190
What? Easy to talk to?

469
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,820
I thought she was hearing impaired.

470
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,550
What? She can't hear?

471
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,850
What?

472
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,880
- What? 
 - What?

473
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,320
Your visiting hour is over. Everyone else but the guardian should leave.

474
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,140
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

475
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,480
Give me my Coke.

476
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,160
 B-Blood. 

477
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,280
 Is it from bumping into me earlier? 

478
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,850
 Hold on! Hold on. 

479
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,310
 Where are we going? 

480
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,960
 Why are you taking me somewhere dark? 

481
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,310
 She didn't understand me at all that day, then. 

482
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,930
 Mom had a friend like that? How surprising. 

483
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,210
- Well, Se Kyeong. 
 - Yes?

484
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,160
We'll go eat something tasty. Want to come?

485
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,750
Sure. Sounds good. What should we have?

486
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,930
Really? You're coming?

487
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,010
Anything, as long as it's not spicy. Anything you crave?

488
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,040
I'm hungry, too. Choose whatever you want.

489
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,430
- We'll pick a place, then. 
 - Okay.

490
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,480
 What do you want? 

491
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,890
 Jjajang. Let's have jjajangmyeon. 

492
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,220
 Jjajangmyeon? But it's spicy. It has pepper flakes in it. I don't like it. 

493
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,820
   
 - Jjangmyeon. 
 - I don't want it. 

494
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,300
   
 I want jjajangmyeon. 

495
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,660
 How about stir-fried soondae? 

496
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,290
 - Jjajangmyeon is spicy? 
 - How about pizza? 

497
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,930
 I'll buy you pizza. 

498
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,840
- Really? 
 - Se Kyeong, how about pizza?

499
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,140
- What? 
 - S-Se Kyeong, how about pizza?

500
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,520
- Se Kyeong. 
 - Se Kyeong.

501
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,480
Where did she go?

502
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,810
 Dad, I'm sorry. 

503
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,970
 I'm so sorry. 

504
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,500
 I tried to set Mom up with another man. 

505
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,800
 I must've been crazy for a moment. I'm sorry. 

506
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,320
 I'm so sorry. 

507
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,330
Dr. Ohn,

508
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,120
your car is a LeMans with license plate No. 9125. Right?

509
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,890
Yes, it is. Why?

510
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:22,580
If you give me the car key, I can put your stuff in the trunk.

511
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,360
Ms. Jeong, how's your wound from the surgery?

512
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,380
Pardon? What kind of surgery did I get?

513
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,610
Doesn't it hurt where you got your wings removed?

514
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,270
My gosh, Dr. Ohn.

515
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,790
I'll move them eventually.

516
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,360
But I really appreciate your offer.

517
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,700
By the way, the hospital would feel empty starting tomorrow.

518
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,830
When you become a specialist in the US, make sure to come back to treat us.

519
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,070
Of course.

520
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,190
If you forget about me, I'll be...

521
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,450
so upset.

522
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,240
- Promise. 
 - Yes, I promise.

523
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,370
Promise.

524
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,530
I'm not sorry at all.

525
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,760
He's such a flirt.

526
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,690
He was quite a player since his youth.

527
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,700
Dang it.

528
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:09,970
I'm sorry, but you missed your chance to have a pretty daughter named Eun Yoo someday.

529
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:13,660
Why? Because Mom will marry another man.

530
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,870
I'll make sure that happens.

531
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,950
That man is...

532
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,990
no one other than Ha Lee—

533
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,050
 Are you sure it's him? 

534
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:27,790
I think that man is...

535
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,280
 Are you sure? 

536
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,150
Gosh, that stupid master.

537
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:36,420
Why is he confusing me?

538
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,320
Geez, seriously.

539
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,310
 If you go back now, 

540
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:56,020
 2023 will be much different than when you left it. 

541
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,200
 Do you still want to go back? 

542
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,850
Eun Gyeol?

543
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,320
 What's wrong, baby? 

544
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,760
 It's Mom. 

545
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,010
 It was a dream. 

546
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,590
 It was just a dream. 

547
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,380
 Something like that would never happen. 

548
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,670
 There has to be a reason why I woke up at Mom's house. 

549
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,530
 I need to call the master. 

550
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:56,730
 The number you dialed does not exist. Please check and dial again. 

551
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,360
Why won't you answer the phone?

552
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,550
Why won't you answer it?

553
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:11,510
Stop confusing me, and just tell me.

554
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,850
- So I'll go after just one guy. 
 - Is she talking to a loan shark?

555
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,430
 Is she a loan shark? 

556
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,520
Three days. I'll give you just three days.

557
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,320
You either call me back in three days or put him right in front of me.

558
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,850
You either call me back in three days or put him right in front of me.

559
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,490
Make a decision.

560
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:28,010
Or you'll experience the miracle of having your back snap backward. Got it?

561
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,780
 By chance... 

562
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,020
 By chance... 

563
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,370
 - does this mean... 
 - does this mean... 

564
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,520
 Mom's first love was Ha Eun Gyeol? 

565
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,910
 that Choi Se Kyeong could become my mom? 

566
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:42,310
 - Is this a fate? 
 - Is this a warning? 

567
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,000
Ha Eun Gyeol?

568
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,350
- Ha Eun Gyeol. Right? 
 - No.

569
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,710
What do you mean you're not? You're Ha Eun Gyeol.

570
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,690
Don't you know me? I'm Se Kyeong. Choi Se Kyeong.

571
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,710
 What's wrong, baby? 

572
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,040
 It's me, Mom. 

573
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,970
No, no, no!

574
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,660
You scared me.

575
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,550
What do you mean, "no," exactly?

576
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,200
Give up, Ahjumma.

577
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,530
I can never let you.

578
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,490
A-Ahjumma?

579
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,650
Did you call me "Ahjumma" just now?

580
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,160
 I'm sorry, but I can never allow that to happen. 

581
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:20,070
I'll make sure to destroy your relationship with Lee Chan somehow.

582
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,980
Oh? Come on.

583
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,960
Let go while I'm asking nicely, Ahjumma!

584
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,200
Shut up while I'm asking nicely, Ahjussi.

585
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,480
- Ahjumma! 
 - Ahjussi!

586
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,720
I'm not doing this because I like you. Okay?

587
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,700
You're 200 times uglier than my dad.

588
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,510
I just need to check something briefly. So be quiet and follow me.

589
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:41,560
I'll give you a special senior treatment. Okay?

590
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,060
Let go of me.

591
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,560
Let go of me, I said!

592
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,250
I'm the one who's giving you special senior treatment.

593
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,070
- Seriously... 
 - Enough is enough.

594
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,830
Where are we going right now?

595
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,690
Enjoy.

596
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,770
- What's this? 
 - What do you mean? It's jokbal.

597
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,570
Wow, it looks amazing.

598
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,600
Wow, it smells great, too.

599
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,400
I followed you since you wanted to check something. Are you telling me to eat pig feet now?

600
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,510
How's living away from home going? Have you been eating properly?

601
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,280
It's not too bad. I eat well, too.

602
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,580
You're done checking. Right?

603
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,470
Hold on.

604
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,340
Eat this first.

605
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,380
Just take a bite. Please.

606
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,830
Why do I have to eat this?

607
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,920
Someone's life is at stake.

608
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,870
I beg you.

609
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,190
- Let me ask you one thing first. 
 - Gosh, seriously.

610
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,820
You can ask after you eat.

611
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,270
Don't you know the saying, "Even Mt. Geumgang comes after a meal"?

612
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,700
Here.

613
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,170
- Say ah. Ah... 
 - My life depends on it.

614
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,350
So take just one bite and say it.

615
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,840
Your answer determines someone's, no...

616
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,490
I mean a family's lives.

617
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,810
So why do we have to talk about that over jokbal...

618
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,690
Go ahead. Go ahead.

619
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,990
You said you're not toying with Lee Chan's heart. Right?

620
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,940
You said it's natural for people to change their minds, too.

621
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,660
The jokbal is getting cold.

622
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,600
So, how do you feel about him now?

623
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,410
Do you like him?

624
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,080
 Hold on. I need to be careful right now. 

625
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,420
 I haven't even confirmed yet. If I say I liked him, 

626
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,980
 it might end up upsetting him. 

627
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,920
- No comment on that. 
 - I won't eat, either, then.

628
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,580
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

629
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,460
We agreed to play it fair.

630
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,870
You should have good manners, then.

631
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,270
Answer me. Then I'll eat.

632
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,870
Eat. Then I'll answer.

633
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,740
Let's just forget about it.

634
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,950
Gosh, are you serious right now?

635
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:12,090
Ma'am, I'll take this to go.

636
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,920
Ha Eun Gyeol! Hold on.

637
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,970
Hold on. Stop right there.

638
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,080
Okay. I'll let you go.

639
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,560
I'll let you go, so just tell me where you're staying.

640
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,380
Why should I tell you that?

641
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,340
Don't you care about the people waiting for you?

642
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,200
They should know you're okay, at least.

643
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,740
- Lee Chan tried to look for you and— 
 - I'm warning you.

644
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,100
Don't mention his name to me from now on.

645
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,910
My gosh. Is he a traitor or something?

646
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,600
Did you catch him plotting treason?

647
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,280
I have a place to stay, and I'm eating three meals a day.

648
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,650
I found a job, too.

649
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:46,010
And most importantly, I need to do something with my life on the line.

650
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,110
Happy now?

651
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,360
Why are you doing this? Are you going through puberty?

652
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,370
Are you angry that the earth won't move the way you want?

653
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:56,420
What did Lee Chan do to you that you're acting like this?

654
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,780
I think you're mistaken about something.

655
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,630
I don't hate Lee Chan. I hate you, who's by his side.

656
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,940
I hate you.

657
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,650
You shouldn't have let me say all this.

658
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,450
 I'm sorry, Ahjumma. 

659
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:21,370
 I have no choice but to do this. I hope you understand. 

660
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:25,290
 I'll make it up to you if I go back to 2023. 

661
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,240
Gosh, seriously...

662
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,700
What kind of crappy situation is this?

663
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,900
Seriously, why would Mom let him treat her like this?

664
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,980
This is bad.

665
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,910
If I get offended, it means I lost.

666
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,640
He hurt me!

667
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,650
Wow.

668
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,650
 Do you really have to go that far? 

669
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:58,870
 My grandma told me not to delay thanking someone. 

670
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:02,380
 It's the least I can do to someone who saved me. 

671
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,230
 Are you sure that's the house? 

672
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,260
 - Yes, I'm sure. 
 - Shit. 

673
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,230
 The house you got humiliated after climbing over the fence to see Se Kyeong 

674
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:13,310
 and got kicked out for ruining a party. The chairwoman of Seowon Arts High School's house. 

675
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,320
 Wow, that's a long address. 

676
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,470
 Yes. By the way, the chairman of Jinsung Instruments lives there. 

677
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,840
 That means Yoon Cheong Ah is from an elite family. 

678
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,550
 You don't have to get intimidated by that. 

679
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,900
Shit...

680
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,180
I'm not intimidated at all.

681
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,200
 Who's there? 

682
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,630
Hello, I'm Ha Lee Chan, who's in 11th grade, Class 3 at Baegwang High.

683
00:42:55,630 --> 00:43:00,320
I'm here because I need to tell Cheong Ah something.

684
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,590
Can I see her for a second?

685
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,220
 Hold on a second. 

686
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,980
Okay.

687
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,020
He thought I couldn't do this?

688
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,010
Oh, right.

689
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,900
Thank you.

690
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,880
You saved me.

691
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:23,610
I'm sorry.

692
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:26,170
I didn't know.

693
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,850
 - Excuse me.  
 - Yes? Yes?

694
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,850
 She says she doesn't know you and wants you to leave. 

695
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,730
Pardon? There's no way.

696
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,040
Could you tell her one more time—

697
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,700
 She said she doesn't know you. 

698
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,260
 Please leave now. 

699
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:42,020
Hold on! Hold on!

700
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,960
 Ring the bell one more time. I'll call the police. 

701
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,470
Shit...

702
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,760
♫  You're going further away  ♫

703
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,710
 It's a built-in navigator. 

704
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:25,760
 You know how far away someone is by scratching your head. 

705
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,640
 If you scratch the back of your head, it means they're far away. 

706
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,560
 And if you scratch the front, it means they're almost here. 

707
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,420
♫  My dream  ♫

708
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,700
Shit.

709
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:47,210
♫  It got so close to me that it's blocking my view  ♫

710
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:56,330
♫  It's comforting me, who's inside my tired heart  ♫

711
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:01,900
♫  My song that I had desperately wanted to sing  ♫

712
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:08,100
   

713
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,820
I'm sorry I made you wait.

714
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:32,030
Should we have a seat first?

715
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:57,480
 Is Cheong Ah your biological daughter? 

716
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:08,310
 The things you saw, heard, and experienced in my house. 

717
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:14,240
 I'm letting you scream it out here before telling the world about them. 

718
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,430
 I thought you'd try to expose me. But you're asking a cheeky question. 

719
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,220
 What are you trying to do? 

720
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:25,320
 If she's really your biological daughter, 

721
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,330
 why don't you let her use sign language? 

722
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,370
 I mean, 

723
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,670
 why didn't you teach her sign language? 

724
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,290
 Why? 

725
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:38,200
 It's a simple reason. 

726
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:43,860
 There's no reason to let everyone know my daughter is disabled 

727
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:47,060
 and I don't want them to know, either. 

728
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,700
 His eyes look sad. 

729
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,310
 Why? 

730
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,190
You heard from the chairman. Right?

731
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:14,590
I'll be your tutor starting today.

732
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:18,550
Aren't you curious what you'd be learning?

733
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,490
 He's being friendly to me. 

734
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,210
 Why? 

735
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,420
It's sign language.

736
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,800
You can create sounds with your hands.

737
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,600
My mom taught me when I was a baby.

738
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,800
 He's crying. 

739
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,060
 Why? 

740
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,130
But...

741
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:54,030
you can't tell anyone else.

742
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:59,370
It's a secret between you, me, and Chairman.

743
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,560
So, should we get started, then?

744
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,560
Have a seat here.

745
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:13,590
♫  I recognized you  ♫

746
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:23,850
♫  We dream the same dream, we could have been together  ♫

747
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,920
Should I introduce myself first?

748
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,880
My name is Ha Eun Gyeol.

749
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:35,210
Ha.

750
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:37,400
Eun.

751
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,880
Gyeol.

752
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:43,390
 A pure sound. 

753
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,630
 A pure child. 

754
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:57,180
♫  I can give them all to you  ♫

755
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:04,240
♫  Our small dreams  ♫

756
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:12,150
♫  I'll protect you until then  ♫

757
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:22,550
♫  Even if I don't ever get to see you  ♫

758
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:33,980
♫  I'll remember you forever  ♫

759
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,420
 What's your name? 

760
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,980
 I'm Ha Eun Gyeol. 

761
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,150
 Ha Eun Gyeol? 

762
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:03,610
 You look young. How old are you? 

763
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:07,510
 I'm 18 years old. 

764
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:10,520
 Your parents must be very worried. Let's contact them first. 

765
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,420
 My parents are... 

766
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,390
 in another world right now. 

767
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,010
 Do you mean you're an orphan? 

768
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,940
 I guess you could say that... 

769
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,070
 for now. 

770
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:28,410
 Do you have relatives or adults you could contact? 

771
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,440
 I don't have any. 

772
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,430
 Looks like you have no place to go. 

773
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:41,120
 Stay in the annex until you recover. 

774
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,070
 Although it's the weather's fault, 

775
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:46,390
 since it happened during my company's event, 

776
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:49,290
 we'll care for you until you fully recover. 

777
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:53,610
 Of course, you'll be compensated adequately as well. 

778
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:56,840
 I'd like to teach your daughter sign language. 

779
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:59,280
 You'd like to do what? 

780
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,660
 I don't need to be compensated. 

781
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,720
 Let me teach her sign language while I'm staying here— 

782
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,910
 Are you mistaking our kindness as your right to receive it? 

783
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,680
 I'm begging you for the sake of her happiness. 

784
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,270
 Excuse me, young man. 

785
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:15,340
 My parents were deaf and mute, too. 

786
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,370
 But they were positive, 

787
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,490
 healthy... 

788
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,730
 and extremely happy. 

789
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:25,540
 Because... 

790
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:30,420
 they communicate. 

791
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:36,450
 With their eyes, hearts, and hands. 

792
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:39,250
 Are you claiming learning sign language makes one happy? 

793
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,710
 It's not just a claim. 

794
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:45,970
 No matter what the reason, you're taking her world away by not letting her speak. 

795
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:49,480
 You're colonizing her soul. 

796
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,630
 How grandiose. 

797
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:56,440
 So, what's the conclusion of this touching speech? 

798
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:00,810
 I want to... 

799
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,510
 give your daughter the world back. 

800
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:06,330
 What? 

801
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:10,210
 So, she'll no longer be lonely like a remote island 

802
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,140
 and be discriminated against for being different. 

803
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:17,300
 I want to create a bridge for her. 

804
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,320
 At home and also... 

805
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,420
 at school, too. 

806
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,020
   

807
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,460
Ha Eun Gyeol.

808
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,760
The dagger you threw struck my brain and kept me up all night.

809
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,850
You want to be so uncooperative, huh?

810
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:47,330
If I can't find out myself, I'll have to spy on you instead.

811
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,600
Yoon Cheong Ah? No.

812
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,310
Yoon Cheong Ah? No.

813
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,400
If she's Mom's friend, she would know.

814
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,530
What Mom's relationship with Ha Eun Gyeol is, and who her first love is.

815
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,000
Yoon Cheong Ah. No.

816
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,320
What's with that car?

817
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,690
He looks like Ha Eun Gyeol...

818
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,900
No, it is him.

819
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,960
Huh? It's Yoon Cheong Ah.

820
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,880
Why are they getting out of the same car?

821
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,280
This is what "Killing two birds with one stone" means.

822
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,480
- I should go talk to them for now. 
 - Hey, hey.

823
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,110
That's Yoon Cheong Ah from Visual Arts. Right?

824
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,040
Hold on. Guys. Excuse me.

825
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,830
I'll walk you to your classroom.

826
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:35,200
What in the world...

827
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,800
- What's with his face? 
 - Excuse me.

828
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,390
Was there a boy like that at our school?

829
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:42,770
I know. I guess there was.

830
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:45,600
Yoon Cheong Ah! Ha Eun Gyeol!

831
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,970
It's me! It's me!

832
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:55,070
Gosh, that jerk. Seriously...

833
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:57,860
The one with a helmet! Stop right there.

834
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,290
- I-I brought them the school supplies— 
 - No.

835
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,190
What's this?

836
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:09,220
I thought you got T-shirts made for our band.

837
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,370
The designer, Foot Mountain, made it for us.

838
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,650
I tried to make it avant-garde.

839
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,450
Ma Joo's father sold them to us at the wholesale price.

840
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:17,910
Ready, go.

841
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:22,380
Come to Majoo Fabric at Dongdaemun if you need fabric.

842
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,250
There's a subsidiary company called Majoo Lace, too.

843
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:28,320
This isn't a band T-shirt. It's a missing person T-shirt.

844
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,530
 How are we supposed to wear this? 

845
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:32,920
Why not? You can't even do this for him?

846
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,060
We'll wear this and hand out flyers until we find him. Just know that.

847
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,380
Okay?

848
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,400
It looks nice to me.

849
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,140
Gosh, it's Se Kyeong.

850
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:47,110
Someone should put him back in the hospital.

851
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:49,050
Somewhere he gets locked in.

852
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:51,300
 You have one message... 

853
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,550
 Lee Chan, don't be shocked and listen to me. 

854
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:57,280
What's this? Is she confessing her love to me?

855
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,010
 I found Ha Eun Gyeol. 

856
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,600
Move, move, move!

857
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,260
 I don't know what the story is, 

858
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,540
 but he showed up at Seowon Arts High with Yoon Cheong Ah. 

859
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:17,290
♫  It's a new beginning, I breathe out  ♫

860
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:19,070
 I'll look into it further. 

861
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:23,790
 So, you should behave and stay put until you fully recover. 
   

862
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:30,440
♫  Erase the times that have already passed  ♫

863
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,950
Guys.

864
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,790
I want you to cause big trouble with me today.

865
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,940
Is he from a foreign country?

866
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:43,630
Good manners are absorbed into his body like perfume.

867
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,390
Manners, my foot.

868
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,040
He's an orphan.

869
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,570
My dad's scholarship foundation sponsors him.

870
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,210
What? Really?

871
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:54,810
Gosh. I don't know how he convinced my dad.

872
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,460
I guess he'll be living with us for now.

873
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,440
Instead, he's a resident tutor

874
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,710
and he works as Yoon Cheong Ah's learning assistant at school.

875
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:06,090
He's basically our servant.

876
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:07,530
That's right.

877
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,800
My gosh. I guess I'm into servants.

878
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,680
- I understand how the aristocratic ladies must've felt. 
 - Hey.

879
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,230
 Announcement. 

880
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:21,320
 Ha Eun Gyeol in 11th grade, come to the chairwoman's office immediately. 

881
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,370
 Let me repeat. 

882
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:26,720
 Ha Eun Gyeol in 11th grade, please come to the chairwoman's office... 

883
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,230
Someone wants to see me.

884
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:30,990
I'll be right back.

885
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:32,930
You don't mind. Right?

886
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,610
Choi Se Kyeong.

887
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:48,930
What are you doing right now?

888
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:52,800
My gosh, I guess I wasn't a ghost.

889
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,810
Do you see me?

890
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:58,520
Seriously...

891
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,510
I need to talk to you. Follow me quietly.

892
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:04,740
It's about Lee Chan.

893
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,620
Huh? What? What?

894
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,180
How far are we going? Just talk to me here.

895
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,800
I'm doing this for a reason. Okay?

896
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:37,360
Tell me right now. I need to go.

897
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,130
What's your relationship with Yoon Cheong Ah?

898
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,780
You said this was about Lee Chan.

899
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,010
Yes, you're right. So, just answer the question.

900
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:44,740
Did you switch to Cheong Ah from Lee Chan?

901
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,890
How many times did I tell you that Lee Chan and I aren't like that?

902
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:50,470
That means we're not enemies, then.

903
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:52,830
Why do you hate me so much, then?

904
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,140
Do I really need a reason?

905
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,610
You do. You really do.

906
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,470
I don't want to be hated for no reason.

907
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,410
Whenever I see you,

908
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,950
I just feel angry.

909
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,800
I'm so angry that I'm about to go crazy.

910
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,280
Are you happy now?

911
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,650
Did you have to ditch Lee Chan? You bastard.

912
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,420
While handing out flyers looking for you,

913
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,390
he got punched in the face, cracked his head, and was hospitalized.

914
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:18,100
    
 Hello!

915
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:21,580
Everyone at Seowon Arts High School!

916
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,330
We're Baegwang High School's band,

917
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:29,110
- Fake First Love Memory-Makers! 
 - What the?

918
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:32,650
For the students who are tired from studying,

919
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:36,640
and for your passion and youth

920
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,080
 - that will finally get fired up,  
 - Five, six, seven...

921
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,960
 I'll play this song. 

922
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,210
 Something's happening. 

923
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:46,340
One. Two.

924
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:49,610
One. Two. Three. Four.

925
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,490
   

926
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,460
Let's go.

927
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:11,950
♫  Watching the red sunset reminds me of your sad face  ♫

928
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:15,790
♫  I look down. The tears are coming down.  ♫

929
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:18,190
♫  Although I can't say anything  ♫

930
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:21,750
♫  I love you  ♫

931
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:25,270
♫  You mean the world to me  ♫

932
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:28,140
♫  I scream at the top of my lungs  ♫

933
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:32,990
♫  But the sunset is firing up without an answer  ♫

934
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:36,660
♫  I love you, Ha Eun Gyeol!  ♫

935
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:40,240
♫  You mean the world to me, Ha Eun Gyeol!  ♫

936
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,990
♫  I scream at the top of my lungs  ♫

937
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:47,940
♫  But the sunset is firing up without an answer  ♫

938
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:52,990
   

939
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,640
Welcome, Ha Eun Gyeol.

940
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,040
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

941
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,150
How did you know I was here?

942
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:08,320
Se Kyeong told me.

943
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,090
Ha Eun Gyeol.

944
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:15,180
I'm sorry.

945
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,740
I'll work hard from now on.

946
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:22,940
For the band, my studies, and all the promises I made with you.

947
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:26,120
It might feel like pouring water into a broken vessel,

948
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,050
but I'll try my best...

949
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:34,100
so it doesn't leak and gets filled up.

950
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,370
So come back.

951
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:40,370
You're the only guitarist for Fake First Love Memory-Makers.

952
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:56,100
- Okay, let's do it. 
 - Really?

953
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,730
You mean it, right? You can't back out. Okay?

954
01:00:58,730 --> 01:00:59,690
Instead...

955
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,070
Instead? Instead what?

956
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:04,040
Tell me anything. I'll do anything for you.

957
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,480
I don't want you to see Choi Se Kyeong.

958
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,830
What?

959
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,370
Otherwise, we can't work together.

960
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:18,160
Because...

961
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,130
Because?

962
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:23,530
Because I like Choi Se Kyeong.

963
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:27,090
♫  I love you  ♫

964
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:30,630
♫  You mean the world to me  ♫

965
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:33,490
♫  I scream at the top of my lungs  ♫

966
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:40,910
♫  But the sunset is firing up without an answer  ♫

967
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:49,490


968
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:59,200
♫  I'm alone on top of the clock's hand that stopped  ♫

969
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:08,300
♫  All the days I've run, all that time  ♫

970
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:20,940
♫  The bright future that everyone dreamed of is in front of me right now  ♫

971
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:25,690
   

972
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:28,050
 Is he the one who confessed his love for me in front of the whole school? 

973
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:29,540
 When can I hear your answer? 

974
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:31,330
 - What answer? 
 - Your answer to my confession. 

975
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,460
 I understood right away when you confessed your love for Se Kyeong. 

976
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,420
 I'm sorry about that. 

977
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,710
 Let's be fair and not see Choi Se Kyeong before the festival. 

978
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,150
 Of course. Deal! 

979
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:42,090
 Choi Se Kyeong is coming to school starting today. 

980
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:44,640
 That means she'd see Ha Eun Gyeol at school every day. 

981
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,220
 They're apparently chasing each other already. 

982
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,090
 Why are you taking it this far? 

983
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,750
 I had to do this to get Mom and Dad together. 

984
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:54,920
 Could you pass that ball only to me?
