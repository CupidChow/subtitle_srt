1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,520
   

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,010
   

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,000
   

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,820
   

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,750
   

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,380
   

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,070
   

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,140
  

9
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,680
    
 I don't think he's coming out today.

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,160
He's been gone for two weeks.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,870
No, I think he's coming today.

12
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,120
What proof do you have?

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,920
He has a pattern.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,360
When a certain date approaches, he says goodbye and disappears.

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,000
After that date passes, he returns.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,750
Today's the day.

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,300
Is he a werewolf or something?

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,620
Does he turn into a wolf during the full moon?

19
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,940
National mock exams.

20
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,600
What? He's in high school?

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,950
It's been 30 minutes already.

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,700
Let's go.

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,840
He's here!

24
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,370
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

25
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,960
 It's okay! 

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,090
Unfortunately, I think today is my last performance.

27
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,020
- No! 
 - No, it's not.

28
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,700
He always said it was his last, then came back.

29
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,770
Thank you so much for supporting me all this time.

30
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,720
I will remember you for a long time.

31
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,110
He's really milking this.

32
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,230
Crowd pleaser.

33
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,300
People who love to show off don't have actual skills.

34
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,360
I don't think there's anything more to see. Let's go.

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,180
Let's go.

36
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:13,110


37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,360
I-I found a rare gem.

38
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,050
You can pick up the presents later.

39
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,380
Thank you for everything.

40
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,060
Hey, yo, Mask Man!

41
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,470
I'm going to present you with an offer you cannot refuse.

42
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,400
The Coldplay of the Hongdae indie scene.

43
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,550
I'll give you a chance to audition for the guitarist for the band Spine9.

44
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,090
What do you think?

45
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,220
You're excited, right?

46
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,620
I know it's an offer you cannot refuse—

47
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,440
I'm sorry. I cannot accept.

48
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,170
Wait. Hold on.

49
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,020
How can you be so young and rash?

50
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,390
The Coldplay of Hongdae!

51
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,170
- I said no. 
 - Nope.

52
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,740
Give your no to charity. I take complaints in the form of cash.

53
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,230
Here.

54
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,200
   

55
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,990
The audition song is track 3.

56
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,830
Take a listen, and practice the guitar riff and the sub-vocals.

57
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,710
If you pass, we'll let you be a member of Spine9.

58
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,830
The audition is on Friday at 6:00 p.m.!

59
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,990
At the practice studio at Club Spark, the mecca of bands, all right?

60
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,610
 I suddenly remembered the most cringeworthy quote of all time. 

61
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,480
 Music is the only legal drug. 

62
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,620
   

63
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,950
 Can I quit it this time? 

64
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,440
♫  Tonight, I am not afraid  ♫

65
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:49,630
♫  Nothing can get in our way now anymore  ♫

66
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,730
♫  All right, now you know better why  ♫

67
00:05:53,730 --> 00:06:00,500
♫  My heart is beating louder in my chest, let's go  ♫

68
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,900
♫  Even if I fall once, I'll get back up twice  ♫

69
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,050
♫  So don't stop, I can fly away  ♫

70
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,410
♫  When the door opens to the higher ground  ♫

71
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,240
 Can I quit it? 

72
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,960
 Can I? 

73
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,470
That Hunter Lee, I swear, he got an offer and ditched.

74
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,700
Those guys were buttering him up,

75
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,960
his head got bloated like popcorn and ditched, blaming it on me!

76
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,830
Stop fucking around. You're always—

77
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,900
Anyway, if we're going to prepare a team and get back to prime time,

78
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,050
we need a good new member now.

79
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,450
It can't be him.

80
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,750
Why do you think he wears a mask?

81
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,990
He's not confident about his looks.

82
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,920
You really have no eye for beauty.

83
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,910
His eyes get the job done. You can feel the hotness through the mask.

84
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,100
I know he's good-looking. Bet 50,000 won?

85
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,560
Is your offer still valid?

86
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,310
I have my own terms.

87
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,720
First, I can't take off my mask because of personal reasons.

88
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,890
Second, I'll be in 12th grade next year, so I must focus on my studies during exams.

89
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,130
Third, I have a unique family situation.

90
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,940
School comes before music, and family comes before school.

91
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,660
Can I...

92
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,440
still join the band?

93
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,060
What did you just say? What do you want to be?

94
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,910
Choi Se Kyeong's boyfriend.

95
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,920
You're not serious, are you?

96
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,930
At first, I thought I was hallucinating.

97
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,420
 Or maybe I died? 

98
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,470
 Did I see an angel? 

99
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,010
I doubted myself.

100
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,930
But it wasn't, it wasn't.

101
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,120
It wasn't a hallucination.

102
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,060
She is a real goddess.

103
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,850
Hey, brother, I need her information.

104
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,090
You can help me. Right?

105
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,390
You have eyes everywhere.

106
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,260
You have more information than the FBI.

107
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,240
Yeah. There's nothing to look into. Give it up.

108
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,280
What! Why?

109
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,140
Why? Why?

110
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,140
You want the truth?

111
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,170
Choi Se Kyeong, 11th grader, cello major at Seowon Arts High School.

112
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,770
 It's Choi Se Kyeong! 

113
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,280
The boys from nearby schools wait at her school gate, hoping to see her face,

114
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,320
and managers promising to make her a star, 365 days a year.

115
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,560
 My head is filled with thoughts of you, the angel. 

116
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,040
 Don't you want to be the next Lee Young Ae, Go So Young? 

117
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,830
It's tougher to get to her than get into any top school.

118
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,280
 You won't be seeing her. 

119
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,870
She won't give you any attention.

120
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,120
She doesn't step on dirt.

121
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,040
She takes care of herself. She is talented.

122
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,020
Her schedule puts most celebrities to shame.

123
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,630
School, lessons, practice, group practice, concerts, social events.

124
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,560
There is no room.

125
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,700
Her family? Amazing.

126
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,630
You know what a "prestigious family" means. Right?

127
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,430
I know! A family with expensive taste. Right?

128
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,300
Wrong. Do you really want to live without front teeth?

129
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,910
Not the right time for a joke.

130
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,910
- Go on. 
 - Her family is wealthy.

131
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,640
Hey. Why do you think a goddess came down to earth?

132
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,300
If you take off your wings and come down to earth,

133
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,840
you can set up wing factories anywhere.

134
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,240
 My dear daughter, are you ready for your concert tonight? 

135
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,900
 I picked out a couple dresses for you. 

136
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,510
 My choice would be the pink one. 

137
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,070
And most importantly,

138
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,570
she already has a boyfriend.

139
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,570
The families have already agreed.

140
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,840
They're basically engaged.

141
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,990
But I'll marry her.

142
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,270
Hey, did you get rose-tinted glasses installed on your eyeballs?

143
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,600
Look! He's good-looking and rich on top of that.

144
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,380
And in med school. And in a band.

145
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,120
You think you can beat Dr. McDreamy over here?

146
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,270
Do you think he saw us?

147
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,920
I don't know, dude.

148
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,290
Just give it up.

149
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,710
As far as Choi Se Kyeong is concerned, she's untouchable for you.

150
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,140
It's not a wall you can easily climb over...

151
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,940
This bastard actually climbed over the wall.

152
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,510
I know you.

153
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,720
You work at the ice cream shop.

154
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,900
How did you get in here?

155
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,290
Well, I... I... was invited.

156
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,650
You were invited? By who?

157
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,300
The organizer of this party?

158
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,930
Oh! Yes. Over there.

159
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,920
The Chairman of the Board of Seowon Arts High School is the organizer,

160
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,590
and I'm the chairman's daughter.

161
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,030
Neither of us has any recollection of inviting you.

162
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,100
Who are you?

163
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,900
- Are you a thief? 
 - What?

164
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,570
Who do you take me for?

165
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,700
I invited him.

166
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,410
Se Kyeong, you did?

167
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,480
Why?

168
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Because I don't think we settled up correctly for the ice cream last time.

169
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,070
Follow me. I don't have my wallet on me.

170
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,850
Thank you for helping me out.

171
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,470
I didn't think you would remember me.

172
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,100
Should we speak comfortably? I'm also in 11th grade...

173
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,500
- Stop wasting your life and save your time. 
 - What?

174
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,310
If you stick around longer, you'll become a stalker.

175
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,270
A stalker is a complete failure in life.

176
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,670
That's my honest advice, instead of the ice cream cost.

177
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,530
I'm not a stalker.

178
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,170
You don't know me well yet.

179
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,300
It takes time to become friends...

180
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,540
Do you know how much time, effort, and money goes into wearing this dress

181
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,840
and performing perfectly in front of professors who may become my teachers?

182
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,520
Is it a quiz?

183
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,510
A day? Two days?

184
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,780
Try figuring it out.

185
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,920
Do you think I have time to waste?

186
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,580
Do you think I will in the future?

187
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,990
You're not a machine.

188
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,100
You should take time to play, rest...

189
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,190
You and I live in different worlds.

190
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,680
Didn't you see today?

191
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,490
When you're playing by the pool, I'm networking.

192
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,940
While you build sandcastles, I'm building relationships.

193
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,470
- Your life sounds stuffy. 
 - What?

194
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,180
Stuffy, like you've eaten a hundred sweet potatoes.

195
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,270
You never get your youth back.

196
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,570
So, you should let yourself enjoy...

197
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,550
- Do you like stripes? 
 - Like the soda?

198
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,510
Of course, should we go get some?

199
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,790
No, stripes. As in pattern.

200
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,010
What about it?

201
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,250
Your fly's open.

202
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,750
♫  Tonight, I'm not afraid  ♫

203
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:14,850
♫  Nothing can get in our way now anymore  ♫

204
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,120
♫  All right, now you know better why  ♫

205
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,990
♫  My heart is beating louder in my chest, let's go  ♫

206
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,730
♫  Even if I fall once  ♫

207
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,400
♫  I'll get back up twice  ♫

208
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,470
♫  So don't stop, I can fly away  ♫

209
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,060
♫  Knocking, knocking, once the door opens  ♫

210
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,630
♫  Our story across the wide oceans  ♫

211
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,420
♫  Knocking, knocking, when I hold my hand out  ♫

212
00:15:52,420 --> 00:16:00,220
♫  We're so close we could touch, follow our dream  ♫

213
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,770
   

214
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,250
- Yoon Dong Jin's band. 
 - Yes.

215
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,380
Did you confirm the changes to the international tour schedule?

216
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,810
We finished our talks with the production company for the tour in Europe.

217
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:31,480
We temporarily delayed ticket sales opening for North America.

218
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,380
You haven't selected a support act for the opening show?

219
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,850
I made a list focusing on new indie bands, as you requested.

220
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,760
But Yoon Dong Jin rejected all of them.

221
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:47,550
- Gather the A&amp;R team in 30 minutes. 
 - Yes. 
  (Artists and repertoire) 

222
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,750
Where is Yoon Dong Jin right now?

223
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:05,430
♫  When you grow too weary of the roads you walk  ♫

224
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:10,830
♫  Tell me, don't hide it  ♫

225
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:16,000
♫  You are not alone  ♫

226
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:26,780
♫  Someday we will swim like blue whales  ♫

227
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:31,480
- It was the heyday of dial-up internet. 
 - Yes.

228
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,040
You would post music reviews on message boards,

229
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,670
or look for bandmates.

230
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,200
That's how I joined a school band.

231
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,130
The name of the band was...

232
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,670
well, "Fake First Love Memory-Makers."

233
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,490
 In any case, I don't remember exactly, 

234
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,690
but we went by "Fake Love Makers" for short.

235
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,020
It wasn't a lie.

236
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,180
Because we were utterly talentless.

237
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,990
How was your first meeting with your bandmates?

238
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,310
It was terrifying, you know.

239
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,360
Back then, we would meet up by saying,

240
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,720
"Stand on this street corner in Hongdae with sheet music on your right hand."

241
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,900
So that's when you met President Oh Ma Joo.

242
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,970
Yes, I'm sick and tired of him. It's been 29 years.

243
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,780
Are any of the other members still doing music?

244
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,000
Nothing.

245
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,700
Only one.

246
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,780
We disbanded pretty soon.

247
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,850
One of our members got into big trouble.

248
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,130
President, I think I caught a big fish.

249
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,680
Would you like to see?

250
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,610
Here, look at the kid with the mask.

251
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,420
Isn't his guitar skills incredible?

252
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,070
He's a sub-vocalist, so he doesn't have that many parts.

253
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,400
But his voice is unique, and he has a great physique, as you can see.

254
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,110
I think his face should be decent, too.

255
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,790
What do you think?

256
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,600
Is this mask a concept?

257
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,430
I think it might be good marketing.

258
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,710
It makes you want to rip it off.

259
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,330
Gosh!

260
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,480
- Let us pass! 
 - Oppa! Can I get an autograph?

261
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,180
Oppa! Please show me your face!

262
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,640
Be careful.

263
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,920
Hey, go back, go back.

264
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,570
Are you okay?

265
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,650
Thank you!

266
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,240
Gosh, it's crazy.

267
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,100
I think I'm going to die. The mask gets so humid.

268
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,590
Our little good luck charm!

269
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,600
If we could show his face, we would really explode.

270
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,970
Hey! Just take it off!

271
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,450
Leave it.

272
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,850
If the masked king takes off his mask, it's over.

273
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,550
Let's just take it off now.

274
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,270
Merchandise, gifts, all we have is masks.

275
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,360
What if you got fake grills like rappers?

276
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,740
So, people bring us gold.

277
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,330
Good news, bad news.

278
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,890
What do you want first?

279
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,680
Geez, I hate that line.

280
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,370
You'd give anyone with a brain decision paralysis.

281
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,360
They say that the good comes with the bad.

282
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,840
Let's just get it over with.

283
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,570
Bad news.

284
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,180
I think it's time to say goodbye to you guys.

285
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,290
What do you mean?

286
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,100
You're dropping us?

287
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,720
You were happy we were bringing up sales!

288
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,570
So what's the good news?

289
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,890
MJ Entertainment just called.

290
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,070
Yoon Dong Jin is looking for a supporting act for his international tour.

291
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,060
So?

292
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,430
Spine9 is on his radar!

293
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,110
Next week! To see your show in person!

294
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:30,380
President Oh Ma Joo is coming here!

295
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,390
♫  Knocking, knocking, once the door opens  ♫

296
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,500
Hyung, but who is Oh Ma Joo?

297
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,510
 - Cheers! 
 - Cheers! 

298
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,900
Yeah!

299
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,450
How can someone be in a band and not know Oh Ma Joo?

300
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,010
You know Yoon Dong Jin. Right?

301
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,300
Of course, he's the godfather of Korean rock.

302
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,570
Oh Ma Joo is the person who raised Yoon Dong Jin to be the best artist that he is.

303
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,790
He was his manager from the very beginning.

304
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,000
Plus, he is the Midas of the entertainment industry.

305
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,550
Once his hands are on it, a song, an album, an artist,

306
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,160
they are a big hit.

307
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,920
Right. If Oh Ma Joo discovers us,

308
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,150
not only could we go on tour with Yoon Dong Jin,

309
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,750
we could have the best facilities, the best sound, the best experts...

310
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,180
Hey, we can make an album!

311
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,210
Do you understand now, baby?

312
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,210
The incredible thing that happened to us today?

313
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,300
Wow. Wow. Wow! A goldmine!

314
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,860
Let's cheer to that!

315
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,910
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers, cheers!

316
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,370
 There's been a car accident. 

317
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,950
 Come to Seogyo Police Station. Hurry. 

318
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,590
I'm sorry, I have to go. Personal stuff.

319
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,120
- Hey! 
 - That guy always has "personal stuff."

320
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,610
Why does he have so much personal stuff he can't talk about?

321
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,170
   

322
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,630
I was driving. Me!

323
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,930
Gosh, my heart was beating so fast.

324
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,700
I did leave the car for a second and ran off,

325
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,590
but I eventually came here on my own feet!

326
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,220
Ma'am, let's keep things straight.

327
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,890
You didn't come here on your own.

328
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,480
We looked up your license plate and called you in.

329
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,130
This is a clear hit-and-run.

330
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,170
I told you I'll pay the price.

331
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,850
Everything broken, and the medical bills.

332
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,600
I'll pay them all!

333
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,750
So what is the problem?

334
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,820
He's saying that it wasn't you.

335
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,190
I drive my own car. Who else would it be?

336
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,190
 She was not the driver. 

337
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,980
 It was clearly someone else. 

338
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,990
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

339
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,990
 I'm okay. 

340
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,550
 I just fell a little bit while trying to avoid the car. Just here. 

341
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,180
I heard there was a car accident. What are the details?

342
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,680
Is my dad the victim or the perpetrator?

343
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,280
Is there CCTV footage?

344
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,060
Her car ran into your dad's business storage.

345
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,810
The CCTV in the vicinity was broken,

346
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,740
so we haven't confirmed the driver who ran off.

347
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,650
She's saying that she was driving.

348
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,020
Your father is saying it wasn't her.

349
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,870
Can you ask him?

350
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,390
Yes.

351
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,970
Did you see the driver?

352
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,960
He says he saw clearly with his two eyes.

353
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,940
The driver that ran off was not her. It was a guy.

354
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,410
What? What is he saying?

355
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,100
Are you sure?

356
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,430
 I saw clearly with my two eyes! 

357
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,420
The driver who ran off was definitely...

358
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,760
- was her son. 
 - Hey!

359
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,160
How dare you frame my son!

360
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,150
Please be quiet!

361
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,000
It's not true. I was driving.

362
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,050
It's a dark alley with no streetlights.

363
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,920
How would he recognize the driver's face?

364
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,100
He's just trying to screw me over!

365
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,970
Thank you for everything.

366
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,210
Oh, sure. Thank you for interpreting.

367
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,320
We'll get in touch when we have more definitive proof.

368
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,440
- You said you're in 11th grade. Right? 
 - Yes.

369
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,560
For your dad's sake, focus on school and don't get distracted. Okay?

370
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,500
Eun Gyeol!

371
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,320
What is your dad saying?

372
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,220
He won't even let me go. What in the world is going on here?

373
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,260
He says you must be worried about Byeong Ho.

374
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,540
Are you mocking me?

375
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,510
I see that you haven't changed at all.

376
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,600
Why did you stop?

377
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,250
Why? What is he saying?

378
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,020
Tell me.

379
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,380
Tell me what your dad said without skipping a word!

380
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,430
I see that you haven't changed at all.

381
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,470
Six years ago,

382
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,190
when the fire started at our house,

383
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,200
 you knew the truth but turned a blind eye. 

384
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,620
 Renters insurance or whatever. File a lawsuit or start a protest. Do whatever you want. 

385
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,020
 Renters insurance or whatever. File a lawsuit or start a protest. Do whatever you want. 

386
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,530
 But leave my building right now. 

387
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,270
You put the blame on all of us.

388
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,360
The person who made Byeong Ho like this...

389
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,760
is you.

390
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,700
That's what he said.

391
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,220
What...

392
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,520
What did my son do?

393
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,300
What's wrong with my son?

394
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,810
   

395
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,140
   

396
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,810
 I'm sorry to call you up so suddenly. 

397
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:11,100
 Something came up with the interpreter, and she was running late. 

398
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,370
 I had no choice. 

399
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,800
Couldn't you just have let it go?

400
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,310
There wasn't big damage.

401
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,940
She says she'll pay for everything and the medical bills.

402
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,620
   

403
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,820
 So you want me to stay quiet? Like six years ago? 

404
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,720
 Because I can't speak? 

405
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,940
 Because I can't get my message across? 

406
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,190
 Because no one listens to those without money, power, connections, or the disabled? 

407
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,270
 So I should stay quiet like last time? 

408
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,670
 Did staying quiet make Byeong Ho happy? 

409
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,740
 Did just taking it make our family happy? 

410
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,100
 I was not happy. 

411
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,870
 I was so sorry to you guys. 

412
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,720
 I should've fought. I should've been furious, saying our kids didn't start the fire. 

413
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,170
 I shouldn't have stayed still. I regretted it this whole time. 

414
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,690
 I'm not going to do something I'll regret. 

415
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,020
 For our family, 

416
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,270
 and for Byeong Ho. 

417
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,760
   

418
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,710
   

419
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,700
"I'm going to ditch. You guys can do it on your own"?

420
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,090
Hey, Eun Gyeol didn't say it like that.

421
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,330
He said something came up, so he'll have to miss it.

422
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,190
Hey, are you a voice bot?

423
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,940
I can hear the arrogance in his words.

424
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,750
Let me ask you since we're talking.

425
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,560
What is this damn "personal stuff"?

426
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,440
I told you before.

427
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,400
School comes before music.

428
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,880
Family comes before school.

429
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,670
So you'll run into your family's arms now?

430
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,940
Yes.

431
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,930
Why? Is your dad giving out inheritance on our gig date?

432
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,670
He won't give it to you if you don't come?

433
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,400
- So, can I miss practice? 
 - This bastard!

434
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,040
Hey! Are you crazy?

435
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,920
You think you can do whatever because you're popular?

436
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,130
I told you I didn't like that kid from the start!

437
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,480
You don't actually care about music.

438
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,860
He was just playing band with us.

439
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,300
Get attention from girls, de-stress from getting good grades.

440
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,410
He was just using us.

441
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,640
Stop it.

442
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,490
Who are you to play with us?

443
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,610
Oh, are you screwing us to see if we can do it without you?

444
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,870
- Were you waiting for the right time to screw us? 
 - I said, stop it.

445
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,000
How dare you shit all over a done meal?

446
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,260
- You're nothing! 
 - Stop it, you bastard!

447
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,550
- Hey! 
 - I!

448
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,290
I almost killed my family.

449
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,400
I went off trying to do music on my own.

450
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,600
I left my brother alone, who couldn't even hear "fire!" or say "help!"

451
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,010
Just so I could be happy.

452
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,630
They didn't say anything,

453
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,190
so I thought they forgot.

454
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:14,030
So I thought I could breathe now.

455
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,330
But that wasn't true.

456
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,680
The wounds are still clearly there.

457
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,370
They haven't forgotten. They have just been silent.

458
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,700
So I'm going back to my real life before it gets too late, hyungnims.

459
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,660
If I start having more fun here, it'll be dangerous.

460
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,850
Thank you for everything.

461
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,230
Did the timing have to be now?

462
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,030
   

463
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,010
Maybe you should've cut off your umbilical cord before cutting off our lifelines.

464
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,950
You're 18. It's time.

465
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,920
I'm sorry.

466
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,050
We're going to make it.

467
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,700
Without you. But—

468
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,380
We'll wait for you. Just once.

469
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,920
   

470
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,290
 You weren't in your seat, so I waited. 

471
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,480
   

472
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,730
 Your homeroom teacher texted me. 

473
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,450
 Your grades fell a lot. 

474
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,810
You went through my room?

475
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,090
Why? You never did that before.

476
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,630
 Actually, this isn't the first time I have come to the library. 

477
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,500
 I came with snacks several times. 

478
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,260
 You weren't there a lot. 

479
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,300
 I won't ask. 

480
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,470
 Why you keep secrets from us… 

481
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,960
 Where that cut is from… 

482
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,450
 I want to know, but I won't ask. 

483
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,600
 I'll wait until you tell me. 

484
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:52,400
 But I don't want your dad to know. 

485
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,690
 I want Dad to be much happier than he is now. 

486
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,340
 To him, you are happiness. 

487
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,270
 You are his pride. 

488
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,780
 You're going to come back. Right? 

489
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:14,500
 You'll find your way and come back to who you are. Right? 

490
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,010
♫  It's getting far  ♫

491
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:32,700
♫  It used to be so close I could touch  ♫

492
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:43,340
♫  In my memories, my dream is so vivid  ♫

493
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:53,880
♫  It comes so close, it could cover my eyes  ♫

494
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:02,980
♫  In my weary heart, it comforts me  ♫

495
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:13,730
♫  My desperate song  ♫ 
    

496
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:24,180
♫  Even if no one reaches their hand out to me  ♫

497
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:29,420
♫  Even if I walk all alone on this path  ♫

498
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:37,070
♫  Your voice will embrace me without words  ♫

499
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:45,220
♫  Maybe all the times I hated you  ♫

500
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:50,610
♫  All the times I pushed you away  ♫

501
00:34:50,610 --> 00:35:02,930
♫  I still call for you  ♫

502
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,000
- Do you like my daughter, too? 
 - Pardon?

503
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,100
No, that's not it...

504
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,120
There used to be an instrument store here called Viva Music.

505
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,170
- Viva Music? 
 - Yes.

506
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,820
I used to be friends with the owner. I came over all the time.

507
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,980
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

508
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,250
I just randomly thought of it and stopped by. Okay, then.

509
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:01,660
By any chance, are you Ha Eun Gyeol?

510
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,920
How did you know my name?

511
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,850
   

512
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:33,250
You've grown up nicely.

513
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,590
Want to come in for a second?

514
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,820
I have something to give you.

515
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,990
She's good. Right?

516
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,040
My daughter. She's a cello major.

517
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,500
Just like you, she's 18.

518
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,800
And, like 18, she's rebelling.

519
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,800
Tough luck for the instrument with a bad owner.

520
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,230
If you don't mind me asking...

521
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,340
may I ask how you know Grandpa?

522
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,180
I'm his daughter.

523
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,470
I didn't know he had a daughter.

524
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,700
I'm sure. Right?

525
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,270
I went to study abroad in the 11th grade and lived in the States since.

526
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:44,200
Until I heard he passed away.

527
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,190
Open it.

528
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,260
He left this to you.

529
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,880
 If I listen to it and think it's good, 

530
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,030
 I'll give you that guitar you've been eyeing. 

531
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,470
 Really? 

532
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,740
 You'll really give me that guitar? 

533
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,940
 I said if I listen to it and think it's good. 

534
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,020
 I said that very clearly. 

535
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,790
It took me six years to get this to you.

536
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,120
I looked at it every once in a while and took care of it,

537
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,920
so you should be able to play it right away.

538
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,170
I don't know how or why you two got connected,

539
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,960
but he said something pretty cool in his will through his lawyer.

540
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,510
Ready to hear it?

541
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,280
Yes.

542
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,300
That boy...

543
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,580
 That boy knows how to speak to a guitar. 

544
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,240
 He knows how to speak to the world through his guitar. 

545
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:06,220
 He is the best guitarist I've ever met. 

546
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,590
Do you like it?

547
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,620
You said you'd need to check my assignment first.

548
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,370
I was going to give it to you anyway.

549
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,130
Had to play it cool, huh?

550
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,790
Getting the carrot ready before cracking the whip.

551
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,040
So, if you got the carrot, why do you look whipped?

552
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,730
Because I think I got a harder assignment.

553
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:09,900
Assignment?

554
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,990
I gave up a gig that I wanted to do so badly.

555
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,480
It was a really tough decision.

556
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,430
Now you're making me second guess.

557
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,440
Why make it so complicated?

558
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,020
This is about my life.

559
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,790
What's the right answer?

560
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,880
A life that makes my heart beat?

561
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,270
Or a life where I'm my dad's trophy?

562
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,110
No matter which one I choose,

563
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,820
my heart will break for the other one.

564
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,000
I can't be happy.

565
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,550
Flip a coin.

566
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,120
How can you make life decisions with a coin flip?

567
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,180
How can you be an artist and not understand metaphors?

568
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,760
Pretend that gig is your coin. Take a flip.

569
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,800
You wanted to divide up the beats and up the tempo.

570
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,720
Why are you making me put out the fire?

571
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,900
You're too fast.

572
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,300
Talk about putting out the fire when the boosting isn't even ready.

573
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:42,010
Hey, kid, put more on the drive.

574
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,150
More drive?

575
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,590
What?

576
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,990
Yeah.

577
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,150
Should we go from the verse?

578
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:48,180
♫  Tonight, I am not afraid  ♫

579
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:55,270
♫  Nothing can get in our way now anymore  ♫

580
00:42:55,270 --> 00:43:00,160
♫  All right, I'll tell you no matter what  ♫

581
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,000
 Your fly's open. 

582
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,560
 Your fly's open. 

583
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,740
 Your fly's open. 

584
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,680
So embarrassing.

585
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,660
I'm so embarrassed, I'm so embarrassed, I'm dead.

586
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,750
Oh, my god...

587
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,520
Geez, seriously!

588
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,590
Fight me! Let's go!

589
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,290

What is this song called?

602
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,490
Hey.

603
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:25,080
It's you, Lee Chan.

604
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,650
Could you put down my hair?

605
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:40,350
This song is called "The Story of You and Rain" by Boowhal.

606
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:48,380
♪  How sad you looked that day  ♪

611
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,090
It goes like this.

612
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:17,380
Lee Chan, you must be in love.

613
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,420
But I...

614
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:25,250
I have...

615
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,710
nothing.

616
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,150
Then you need to be in a band.

617
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:33,110
A band man can be worshipped.

618
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:37,310
Our brother Kurt Cobain proved it.

619
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:38,670
Who is that?

620
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,980
It's a guy.

621
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,920
The only way someone without money or power can conquer the world

622
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,250
and win a beautiful woman is...

623
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,840
to join a band!

624
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,410
A band?

625
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,200
You like rock bands?

626
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,470
Like? I think they're noise pollution.

627
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:57,990
So why are you going to a concert?

628
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,450
It's Ji Hwan's hobby band's regular gig.

629
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,230
He needs flowers.

630
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,580
Can I come?

631
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,560
I love bands.

632
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,840
You mean you love med students.

633
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,840
Don't be like that. Let me come with you, Se Kyeong.

634
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,590
If you get me a ticket, I'll get the flowers. Okay?

635
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:31,400
I'll get a humongous bouquet.

636
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,200
- Just get me the bouquet. 
 - Stop combing your hair.

637
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:54,860
Are you okay? Your uniform...

638
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,930
Hey! Watch where you're going!

639
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:03,600
Are you okay?

640
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,060
I'm okay. I'm on my way home anyway.

641
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:23,620
Hey, apologize properly.

642
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:30,450
Fine, be like that.

643
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,640
I'm all wet.

644
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,920
Thank you.

645
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,660
I'll wash it and get it back to you.

646
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,300
You're Yoon Cheong Ah from Visual Arts. Right?

647
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,210
Oh, I...

648
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,700
 Se Kyeong! 

649
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,960
Gosh, why isn't he here?

650
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,340
 Hey, who is that? 

651
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,130
 Who is that guy? 

652
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,920
Se Kyeong, you like rock bands, too?

653
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,090
You should have told me.

654
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:42,130
I also...

655
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,270
am in a band!

656
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,050
Choi Se Kyeong!

657
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,460
Want to come to my band's concert later?

658
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,970
Go where?

659
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,720
Go where today?

660
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,760
 To find the black box. 

661
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,570
 Dad found a car that was near the accident that day. 

662
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:25,840
 I'm going to ask him to show me the black box. 

663
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,870
 If you can interpret for me, it would be so helpful. 

664
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,320
I...

665
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:39,090
Today...

666
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:44,590
I have something important...

667
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,980
 No way! Eun Gyeol has something important today. 

668
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,230
 He needs to go meet the coach with me today. 

669
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,380
 To make the training schedule. 

670
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,220
 Eun Gyeol needs to study. 

671
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,440
 I'll go instead. 

672
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,720
 No, it's better for the coach if there's a hearing person. 

673
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,920
 Plus, he loves Eun Gyeol. 

674
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,480
 So you should take the interpreter, Dad. 

675
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,440
Did you know?

676
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,120
 Of course. 

677
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,900
How?

678
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,580
 I'm an influencer on social media. 

679
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:51,990
 I have more than 2,000 followers. 

680
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,010
You want to come?

681
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,530
Bring your girlfriend.

682
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:58,670
I'll get you tickets.

683
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:02,050
 It's fine. I can't hear anything anyway. 

684
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,510
Hello—

685
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,640
Hyung, are you sick?

686
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,430
I'm fine.

687
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,110
I just, just...

688
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,970
I just have a cold.

689
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,920
He lost his voice.

690
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,270
Hyung, can you do the show today?

691
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,000
Hey, kid. Run and get some medicine.

692
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,800
- We still have time. 
 - Got it.

693
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:50,370
   

694
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,410
   

695
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:59,160
If you snuck into the house, why not just steal the money and go?

696
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,480
Why touch my car and make all this mess?

697
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,950
I'm near the karaoke you used to work at in Hongdae.

698
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,060
I got it.

699
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,910
So hide there until things calm down.

700
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:17,060
I'll call you back.

701
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,270
Hyung, take some medicine.

702
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:25,430
The pharmacist said your voice might come back if you're lucky.

703
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:26,500
- Really? 
 - Yes.

704
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,690
Hold this.

705
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:36,000
Oh, my. Oh, my.

706
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,250
Stop taking them, dude.

707
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,820
Your eyes will roll over.

708
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:48,710
Just a little more.

709
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,120
I need the drugs now!

710
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,090
D-Drugs...

711
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,310
Hey, let's go.

712
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,630
Get inside.

713
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:00,890
Get inside, I said. Get inside.

714
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:19,210
Hello?

715
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:23,560
What? Y-You found w-what?

716
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,090
   

717
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:28,190
This is the video from the black box.

718
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:31,680
You can clearly see the driver's face.

719
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:41,520
Ma'am, you know where your son is right now, don't you?

720
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,190
Are you happy now that you screwed up my son's life?

721
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,300
You feel good?

722
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,260
I'm sorry.

723
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:18,290
But for Byeong Ho's sake, this is—

724
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:21,080
How dare you give me advice!

725
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,630
Don't worry about my son.

726
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,800
Worry about yours.

727
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,530
You think your son is the best in the world, don't you?

728
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:36,310
You're so proud of how you raised him. Right?

729
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:41,610
But do you know what he's doing right now and where?

730
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:44,480
He pretends to be a model student,

731
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,610
then goes clubbing, drinking,

732
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:50,020
smoking cigarettes, and doing drugs. Do you know that?

733
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,850
If Eun Gyeol looked up to you as a parent, would he do that?

734
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,660
Don't fool yourself.

735
00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:00,540
The one who looks down on you the most is your own son. Got that?

736
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,290
 What did she just say? 

737
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:10,640
 What did she say! 

738
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,590
Is it really Oh Ma Joo?

739
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:43,810
It's Oh Ma Joo.

740
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:46,130
- Here? 
 - Yes.

741
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,180
You should sing.

742
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,800
Me?

743
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,950
There's no other solution.

744
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,960
I can't let these tone-deaf idiots get in front of the mic.

745
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,810
No way! How can I...

746
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:04,260
You've been singing backup for me.

747
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,690
You can do it. No...

748
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,790
you have to.

749
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,110
♫  Tonight, I am not afraid  ♫

750
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:47,320
♫  Nothing can get in our way now anymore  ♫

751
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,480
♫  All right, I'll tell you no matter what  ♫

752
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:58,470
♫  My heart is beating louder in my chest, let's go  ♫

753
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:01,010
♫  Even if I fall once  ♫

754
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:04,830
♫  I'll get back up twice  ♫

755
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:08,770
♫  So don't stop, I can fly away  ♫

756
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:14,240
♫  Keep on knocking, knocking, once the door opens  ♫

757
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:19,920
♫  Our story across the wide oceans  ♫

758
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,590
♫  Knocking, knocking, when I hold my hand out  ♫

759
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:53,320
 You lied to me. 

760
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:57,810
I can explain everything.

761
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,690
 You deceived me. You thought nothing of me. 

762
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,820
 You made a fool out of me. 

763
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,690
It's not like that.

764
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,150
I was going to tell you.

765
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,050
But I didn't have a chance.

766
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,680
After tonight's show,

767
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,690
I was going to tell you everything.

768
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,460
 Tell me what? 

769
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,830
I...

770
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,730
want to do music.

771
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,540
I love music.

772
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,500
I love performing.

773
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,850
 You're wrong. 

774
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:38,480
 You're just lost right now. 

775
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,870
 School is stressful, so this is a distraction. 

776
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:42,600
 This is not the real you. 

777
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,910
No.

778
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:46,310
This is the real me.

779
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:48,310
You might not like it,

780
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:51,300
but what you just saw is the real me.

781
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,200
 A student going in and out of clubs, 

782
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,500
 drinking, smoking, doing drugs, and being delinquent? 

783
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,740
 That's the real you? 

784
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:00,170
Who said I drink and smoke?

785
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,750
 Let's go home. Let's talk at home. 

786
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,370
 This is not where you should be! 

787
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:13,090
No. I'm not going.

788
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,590
I don't want to be your trophy anymore.

789
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,260
I'm not an interpreter.

790
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,490
I'm not a fire alarm or an angel.

791
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:22,950
I'm just me.

792
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:32,830
 Why didn't you say that before? 

793
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,160
Because I knew you'd be like this.

794
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,750
Because it's so clear.

795
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,710
 You should have told me still! 

796
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:41,240
 If you considered me a parent, 

797
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,490
 you should have convinced me somehow. 

798
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:47,570
 That's what family is! 

799
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:49,030
How could I have convinced you?

800
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,750
You can't even hear!

801
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:22,220
 There really must be a God. 

802
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,930
 He took away sound from me, 

803
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:28,650
 but instead, he gave me you and Eun Ho as a gift. 

804
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:30,600
 Dad! Dad! 

805
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,410
 Dad! 

806
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:39,310
 Dad! 

807
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,900
   

808
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,980
   

809
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:49,580
   

810
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:34,910
Welcome to our store.

811
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:37,340
I am the master of this store.

812
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,240
It must've been tough to find us.

813
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,710
How can I help you?

814
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:45,380
It looked exactly like Viva Music, a store I used to know.

815
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,240
Oh, Viva Music!

816
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,000
We are La Vida Music.

817
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,250
If you put it together, it's Viva La Vida.

818
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:55,490
If you translate, "Live the Life!"

819
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,260
What a great connection.

820
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,440
So, what can I do for you?

821
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,710
Are you going to sell that guitar?

822
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,080
- What? 
 - In your hand.

823
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,080
Oh, yes. This. Here.

824
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,200
Let me see.

825
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,950
Wow, this is a very rare item.

826
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:20,080
Are you sure you won't regret it?

827
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,960
I'm sure.

828
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,400
How much can I get?

829
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:41,640
The rest, later.

830
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,880
If you need another guitar,

831
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:50,210
I could get you a new one from Jinsung Instruments at a great price.

832
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,850
Okay, I'll think about it.

833
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,730
If you change your mind, come back.

834
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:02,570
I mean, it won't be easy to find us, but...

835
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,280
No, that won't happen.

836
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,430
You never know.

837
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:11,770
So take it.

838
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:13,350
Sure.

839
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:19,780
Don't lose this.

840
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:22,480
Then you'll be in trouble.

841
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,340
Okay.

842
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:32,870
I'm kidding.

843
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,200
You're all set.

844
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,270
Be careful on your way out. You might get lost.

845
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,510
Sure.

846
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:44,880
- Viva La Vida! 
 - Scared me.

847
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:14,070
   

848
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:16,010
Seo Tae Ji?

849
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,850
Wait...

850
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,940
   

851
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:33,860
Sorry.

852
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:36,160
Excuse me!

853
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:44,810
   

854
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,920
What?

855
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,390
Yoon Dong Jin?

856
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:58,040
It's you.

857
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,600
Ma Joo! Oh Ma Joo!

858
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,480
 - Oh Ma Joo?  
 - Here! He's here!

859
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:06,900
Gosh! You're early!

860
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:11,300
Who are you?

861
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:18,130
I am the frontman of the band "Fake First Love Memory-Makers," Ha Lee Chan.

862
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:22,900
   
 Ha Lee Chan? 

863
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:23,920
 Ha Lee Chan? 

864
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,570
Dad?

865
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,890
 It's Dad. 

866
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:36,350
 Dad... 

867
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,320
 is speaking. 

868
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:51,680


869
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:57,580
♫  It's a new beginning, I breathe out  ♫

870
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:03,950
♫  A moment I've been waiting for  ♫

871
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:08,800
♫  Erase the times that have already passed  ♫

872
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,400
♫  We're here on this shining stage together  ♫

873
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:16,120
   

874
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,270
 How are we going to find him and practice? 

875
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:20,190
 Unless it's the amazing Yoon Dong Jin! 

876
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:21,340
 I'll bring Dong Jin! 

877
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,020
 Yoon Dong Jin? It's you! 

878
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,930
 I am Yoon Dong Jin. 

879
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:27,840
 - I can call you Bro, right? 
 - What? 

880
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,630
 You're in a band because of a girl? 

881
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:30,670
 Who are you? 

882
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:32,340
 If I find you, I'll kill you. 

883
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:35,220
 Yes, Mom. Why didn't I think of finding Mom? 

884
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:37,010
 Do you like him? 

885
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:38,760
 No, not at all. 

886
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,710
 I was hoping for a twist. What a letdown. 

887
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:42,120
 There has to be a way. 

888
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:46,020
 I'll make sure to repay this debt before I die.
