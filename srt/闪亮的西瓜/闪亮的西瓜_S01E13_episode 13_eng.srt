I'm sorry, but could you go around the block one more time?

 Huh? Should we eat somewhere first, then?

00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,930
 I'm tired.

00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,770
 I want to rest.

Well, sir. I'm so sorry, but could we go around just one more time—

Thank you.

Hey.

41
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,790
Do you want some ramen before you go? 
  (Similar to Netflix and chill) 

42
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,670
W-What?

43
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,700
Do you want to heat up the water? I'll put this away and come down.

44
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,090
The kitchen is over there.

45
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,660
Shouldn't I say hello to your parents?

46
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,120
They aren't here.

47
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,750
- Both of them? 
 - Yes.

48
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,640
I came back alone from the US.

49
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,500
Have you been living alone all this time, then?

50
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,560
Your jaw is about to drop.

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,200
Then, there's no one else but the two of us here—

52
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,020
That's what you mean.

53
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,090
- I'll put this away. 
 - I'll boil the water.

54
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,580
What's going on?

55
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,000
 What? I feel I just saw something really strange again. 

56
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,590
It's nothing!

57
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,250
Oh, okay. I'll carry this.

58
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,960
Okay. Thank you so much. It's the first room on the second floor.

59
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,680
- Okay. 
 - Thanks.

60
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,220
Gosh, that scared me.

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,110

Hey, be careful! Be careful! Be careful!

65
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,450
What did you put in the eggs that they ignited like this?

66
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,120
Why are you getting so angry?

67
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,620
You're scarier than the fire.

68
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,780
You live alone. You can't even make something simple like this?

69
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,810
What have you been eating all this time?

70
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,900
How did the eggs ignite like this?

71
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,610
Come on.

72
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,570
Be careful from now on. Are you okay?

73
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,840
I like that sound.

74
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,690
Did you know?

75
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,170
You crave veggie pancakes on a rainy day because

76
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,350
the frying sound is similar to the sound of rain.

77
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,290
Yes, I heard that, too.

78
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,550
My mom used to make veggie pancakes on rainy days, too.

79
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,210
Did your parents, too?

80
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,410
- No. 
 - Huh? Why not?

81
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,190
You're supposed to have veggie pancakes on a rainy day.

82
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,250
I was the only one who could hear the rain in my family.

83
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,850
All done.

84
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,610
Wow, it looks amazing. Thank you.

85
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,230
Hey, it's incredible. It's so crispy.

86
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,340
You didn't try to go to the US because you craved veggie pancakes. Right?

87
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,390
No way.

88
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,790
Why did you suddenly want to go to the US, then?

89
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:58,090
I realized that my mom's first love was my dad.

90
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,320
- Hey— 
 - No.

91
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,640
Don't ask. I won't answer.

92
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,540
That's it for today.

93
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,200
I'll eat all around the edge.

94
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,790
Hey, eat slowly. You'll get indigestion.

95
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,400
The edge is the best. Go ahead and tear it!

96
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,560
The edge part is mine, I said.

97
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,490
Hey, the edge is the best part.

98
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,300
Hey, let's share. I haven't eaten at all today.

99
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,850
I'm hungry. Let's share it. Seriously!

100
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,550
Let's share it, I said.

101
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,670
You'll get indigestion like that. I told you to eat slowly.

102
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,870
I want to try it, too! Give me.

103
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,580
Give me, I said!

104
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,750
Move, move!

105
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,350
Are you a Coda, by chance? 
  (Child of Deaf Adults) 

106
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,670
How did you know that?

107
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,090
The only one who can hear the rain in your family.

108
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,300
I heard they call people like you a Coda.

109
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,840
No, I'm asking how you knew that word.

110
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,250
 Did the word not exist in '95 yet? 

111
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,610
Well, the thing is, I learned from a deaf friend in the US.

112
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,710
Ask me.

113
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,460
Ask what?

114
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,800
Don't you have any questions?

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,000
Should I?

116
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,820
How strange.

117
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,350
People usually ask me a lot of questions when I say I'm a Coda.

118
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,840
At first, they're curious. And then they empathize with me.

119
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,030
After that, they sympathize, feel friendly, concerned, worried,

120
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,370
et cetera. All of those things.

121
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,340
It's because the ones who ask want to hear that you're miserable.

122
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,420
That way, it proves that they're happy.

123
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,680
I feel less affectionate about humanity.

124
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,590
That's just how people are.

125
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,940
They want to comfort someone rather than being comforted.

126
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,640
Don't worry.

127
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,250
You know how people get excited when they find interesting content,

128
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,470
but they turn it off immediately if it's not what they want.

129
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,140
It's similar to that.

130
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,290
You can leave now. Thank you so much for today.

131
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,490
Would you be okay alone? Isn't it scary?

132
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,950
Why ask? Will you keep me company all night if I say yes?

133
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,150
Huh? A-All night?

134
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,490
It's not that...

135
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,570
Gosh, look at yourself. You're already a pervert.

136
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,980
You're a pervert.

137
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,820
You said I'm a pervert.

138
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,980
Are you really?

139
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,920
Am I a pervert?

140
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,100
No. Can you really find a way for me to go back?

141
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,650
Huh?

142
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,510
Yes.

143
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,860
It'd be difficult.

144
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,610
I know.

145
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,800
It really isn't simple.

146
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,870
I know that, too.

147
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,810
- You do? 
 - Yeah.

148
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,410
You're not talking about just going back to the US.

149
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,650
You're talking about a way to approach someone in the US.

150
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,230
I'll figure it out with you.

151
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,210
If I go back, I'd never be able to come back.

152
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:38,000
That's why I'll take my time figuring it out.

153
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:44,930
I'll do my best to find a way and delay it as much as I can. That way...

154
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,100
I can be with you for a long time.

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,680
- Hello? 
 - Buonasera.

167
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,900
- Master? 
 - Did you enjoy your trip?

168
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,910
Gosh, you scared me. Hold on.

169
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,750
Why are you asking in the past tense this time?

170
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,390
You're definitely very quick.

171
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,210
Looks like it's almost time to end the trip.

172
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,620
End the trip?

173
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,320
Does that mean I'll go back to the year 2023?

174
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,450
Bingo.

175
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:59,960
Soon, on the night with two moons, the door that connects the two worlds opens.

176
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,780
That's the only day you can go back.

177
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,850
When is that?

178
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:11,130
I'll make sure it's bright inside La Vida Music so you don't get lost. Well, then...

179
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,910
Hold on. Hold on. When will there be two moons?

180
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,090
That's coming soon.

181
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,460
 Hello? Hold on! Master! 

182
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:10,600
 Soon, on the night with two moons, the door that connects the two worlds opens. 

183
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,350
 That's the only day you can go back. 

184
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,370
Newspaper.

185
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,050
The left hand only supports.

186
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,090
Goal!

187
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,720
Gosh.

188
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,780
 The festival is over. 

189
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,120
 Don't ever come to see me again. 

190
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,660
 You and I live in different worlds, anyway. 

191
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,970
Se Kyeong.

192
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,050
You're going to school early. Are you a model student now?

193
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:06,960
I'm an old man now. I wake up early for no reason these days.

194
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,310
- Did you pray that I become an old man? 
 - No.

196
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,080
For running away without telling you at the festival.

197
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,880
I see. Is that why you came here?

198
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,300
Yes. To apologize sincerely and work up my courage to confess.

199
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,680
To be honest, Lee Chan, I...

200
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,460
I know. You like Ha Eun Gyeol.

201
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,550
How did you know?

202
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,780
You think my eyes don't work?

203
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:09,270
I don't know if you'd believe me, but I wasn't planning to use or deceive you.

204
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,970
To be honest, I have a situation I can't explain—

205
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,710
Thank you.

206
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,200
- Out of the blue? 
 - Yeah.

207
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,440
Thanks to you, I've been excited and had fun like every day was a festival.

208
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,040
I had fun passionately without any regrets.

209
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,430
Although I lost the bet, I can tell an amazing story now.

210
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,720
Aren't you angry?

211
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,440
No. Since you ran away, it ended up as everyone's festival.

212
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,750
Instead of it being about a couple.

213
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,410
You were perfect until the end.

214
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,480
What a shame. I knew I should've chosen you.

215
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,920
It's too late.

216
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,490
Hey, aren't you cutting me out too fast?

217
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,750
Didn't you know? I'm a cold-hearted man.

218
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,010
Did you even like me?

219
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,820
It's open-ended— My gosh. Don't touch me quite yet.

220
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,540
I didn't touch you. I hit you.

221
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,320
Let's keep it open-ended, then.

222
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,070
   

223
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,230
What are you doing?

224
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,590
I'm looking for the right curse word for you.

225
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,770
When will you move your stuff in the practice room?

226
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,560
Everyone else has already done it.

227
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,710
What disloyal bastards.

228
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,340
What did you expect?

229
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,030
It was a temporary band we put together in a rush for the festival.

230
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,900
Ha Lee Chan. Oh Ma Joo.

231
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,000
The principal wants to see you.

232
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,770
Did you cause trouble again? Again? Again? Again?

233
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,500
Gosh, seriously.

234
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,560
What? Why are you guys coming out of there?

235
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,770
What? Why am I having a bad feeling about this?

236
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,700
Did we get caught having a fight with the Jindo Dog Gang?

237
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,720
- Is everyone here? 
 - Yes!

238
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:25,290
- Have a seat. Have a seat. Have a seat, I said. 
 - Okay.

239
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:35,940
So, according to the rumor, you completely destroyed the stage during the festival.

240
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,500
There's another one of you. Right?

241
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,150
The one who goes to Seowon Arts High School.

242
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,140
What was his name...

243
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,850
 I'm sorry! 

244
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,380
We deserve to die.

245
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,220
No, no, no. It's okay.

246
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,730
I can deal with that student separately.

247
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,260
Geez, we're in trouble!

248
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,090
You can sign this first.

249
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,760
 No! 
   

250
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,590
 We can't drop out! 
   

251
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,960
 It's an emergency. It's an utter crisis. 

252
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,140
 After school... I mean, after cleaning, come to the practice room immediately. 

253
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,500
What's wrong with you guys? Huh?

254
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,640
What's going on?

255
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,460
   

256
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,480
What's that?

257
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,050
 It's an application for the Nationwide Youth Band Competition. 

258
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,610
 Men should be ambitious and perform on a big stage. 

259
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,140
 Sign the application form. 

260
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:02,050
 Enter the competition and destroy the stage again. 

261
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,410
 Instead, 

262
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:15,870
 you must defeat Ilyoung High School, no matter what it takes. Okay? 

263
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,680
Is Ilyoung High School that impressive?

264
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,360
Our principal and Ilyoung's principal grew up together,

265
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,320
but they're sworn enemies.

266
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,590
They compete with the Seoul National University acceptance rate, but we're always behind.

267
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,870
It's also true that their band is pretty good.

268
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,350
By telling us to defeat them, he's basically telling us to win first place.

269
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,560
Let's do that, then. I don't see why we can't.

270
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,810
I thought he was Lee Chan's son.

271
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,610
It's not only about the performance.

272
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,790
 You have an original song. Right? 

273
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,720
 No way. You don't have one? 

274
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,860
 Well, the thing is, we do covers. We don't have an original song yet— 

275
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,890
 What? 

276
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,930
 What will you do, then? 

277
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:10,080
 Hey. You need an original song to enter the competition. 

278
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,870
 What will you do now? 

279
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,770
 What have you been doing? 

280
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,500
 They have plenty of original songs, apparently. But you— 

281
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,210
 We have an original song! 

282
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,360
That's what happened.

283
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,720
We can just write one. What's the big deal?

284
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,540
I thought he was really Lee Chan's son.

285
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,850
My son is right.

286
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,330
Let's write an original song.

287
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,780
Lee Chan, you must've bought a vending machine.

288
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,170
One that gives you original songs if you put a coin in it.

289
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,800
How will idiots like us write an original song in a month?

290
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,640
We pulled it off.

291
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,340
We had a month to practice for the festival, too.

292
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,400
Don't you remember?

293
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,450
Close your eyes and remember.

294
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,440
Think about all the sweat and blood we shed all this time.

295
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,780
And our fiery breaths.

296
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:12,760
 As a result, we were rewarded with a passionate, screaming audience. 

297
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,130
All the passion and love we received from the female fans.

298
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,800
Don't you want to experience that again with our own song, not a cover?

299
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,990
Well...

300
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:34,120
How about we go on an overnight songwriting camping trip next weekend, then?

301
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,390
 Songwriting camping trip? 

302
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,000
We'll decide on the concept for our song

303
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,290
and we can rally for unity to celebrate Watermelon Sugar's comeback.

304
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,200
What do you think? Are you in?

305
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,190
That sounds pretty good.

306
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,300
- Let's go! 
 - A songwriting camping trip...

307
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,160
Let's just go!

308
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,390
I'm sure we idiots could make a stone tower, at least. Right?

309
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:56,480
Okay. Manager, get us lodging and train tickets today.

310
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,990
Yes, sir.

311
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,310
Okay. Train tickets and lodging.

312
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:07,770
By the way, we should tell Se Kyeong and Cheong Ah, too. Right?

313
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,480
We need a stylist and a photographer to be on a big stage.

314
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,460
So who wants to tell them—

315
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,760
Ha Eun Gyeol can tell them.

316
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,570
That's the end of the meeting.

317
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,290
Let's eat tteokguk. It's on me.

318
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,660
Ma Joo, please grab my bag.

319
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,800
Aren't you going to fight?

320
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,770
- Why aren't you guys fighting? 
 - Why aren't you?

321
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,260
- How strange. 
 - Why aren't they fighting? How weird.

322
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,230
- We can do it. Okay? 
 - We just need you to focus.

323
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,550
- We're Watermelon... 
 - Sugar!

324
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,010
- Watermelon. 
  - Sugar! 

325
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,780
Beat...

326
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,980
I need to tell you something.

327
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,850
Well, to be honest—

328
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,490
Do I have to be ordained as a priest?

329
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,760
Why is everyone confessing to me?

330
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,770
You're too late, you bastard.

331
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,030
Se Kyeong came in the morning and told me everything.

332
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,450
What? W-What did Se Kyeong tell you?

333
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,960
She said she likes you.

334
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,950
Must be nice being handsome.

335
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,430
H-Hey...

336
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,500
Are you okay?

337
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,770
Would you be okay if you were me?

338
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,550
Do you want to just punch me?

339
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,720
I was going to, anyway.

340
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,380
Be good to Se Kyeong.

341
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,650
I'll be watching you.

342
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,970
If you make her cry, you'll be crying blood.

343
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,290
Okay. I will.

344
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,420
We'll continue to be friends, then. Right?

345
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,350
Stay out of my sight for a while, you bastard.

346
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,920
For how long?

347
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,530
Three minutes.

348
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:55,260
 The 18-year-old dad was way cooler than I thought. 

349
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,510
Why? Come with us.

350
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,940
Is it because of Lee Chan, by chance?

351
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,630
 It's not like that. I'm busy preparing for the exhibition. 

352
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:23,620
I told you. Se Kyeong didn't choose anyone at the festival.

353
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,990
This is your chance. That's why you should come...

354
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,080
 I know you've been trying hard to set me up with Lee Chan. 

355
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,130
 But I'll manage myself from now on. 

356
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,790
Don't be like that and go camping with us.

357
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,800
I'll help you.

358
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,600
 It's my life. 

359
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,750
 Not yours. 

360
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,540
 I can do it myself. Don't you trust me? 

361
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,320
 Let's study sign language now. 

362
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,180
 The 18-year-old mom is getting stronger. 

363
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,670
 Cheong Ah, let's go camping together. 

364
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,860
 You didn't even come to the festival. 

365
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,730
 Make sure to come. I'll be waiting. 

366
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,020
No! Gosh...

367
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,390
 I thought the band would get disbanded, but it revived. 

368
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,290
 Everything else is going well, but I... 

369
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,420
 Looks like it's almost time to end the trip. 

370
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,910
What are you doing here?

371
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:40,610
Well, my teacher keeps telling me to play in front of everyone.

372
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,310
 Everything else is going well, but I... 

373
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:47,040
I said I don't want to. I'd rather die.

374
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,690
 For some strange reason, I... 

375
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,130
So I'm playing hooky. You didn't see me.

376
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,440
 I want to stay here a little longer. 

377
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,730
Let's go.

378
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,190
No, I won't go back.

379
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,530
Don't you know what playing hooky means?

380
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,810
I didn't say go back to class.

381
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,730
Let's run away together.

382
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,310
 It's not time yet. 

383
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,430
 Not today. 

384
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,420
 We can be together for now. 

385
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,500
- Just be honest with me. 
 - About what?

386
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,330
You said you fell for me at first sight. That was a lie, wasn't it?

387
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,940
What?

388
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,250
I'll give you three seconds.

389
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,860
Tell me when you started liking me and why in three seconds.

390
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,320
- One. 
 - It was after you came back from the US.

391
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,900
- What? 
 - When I ran into you working in Hongdae.

392
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,490
To be honest, I was happy.

393
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,810
It wasn't love at first sight. I grew to like you while fighting with you.

394
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,020
Wow!

395
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,700
- What's wrong? 
 - That's the real me.

396
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,610
That's the real me, I said!

397
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,000
What?

398
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,750
   

399
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,300
I don't want to! I don't want to go!

400
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,280
Let go of me!

401
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,690
Will you keep acting like this?

402
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,440
Lee Chan, does our band need a designer or not?

403
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,900
You said she already said no.

404
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,680
You said she refused to go camping, too.

405
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,950
That's why we should persuade her in person.

406
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,210
She doesn't want to go. Why persuade her more?

407
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,500
And Yoon Cheong Ah...

408
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,050
doesn't listen to me.

409
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,450
What?

410
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,420
Make Ha Eun Gyeol do it! Make him do it!

411
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,680
Hey, hey, hey. He doesn't see her often these days, either.

412
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,790
And she's always at the academy because of the exhibition.

413
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:08,240
- Geez, come on! 
 - The desperate ones need to work hard.

414
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,570
Go ahead and do it if you want!

415
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:15,880
Okay. I'll do it. You can just interpret.

416
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,780
- Hey. 
 - I can't do sign language.

417
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,660
You think I can? I'm barely on a toddler level—

418
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,500
Oh, it's here.

419
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,080
I got paged. Paged.

420
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,370
I'll check the message for a second. Wait right here.

421
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,800
Don't move. Seriously.

422
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,980
You think I won't move?

423
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,930
Get out of the way!

424
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,480
I'm sorry, sir. She'll move soon. Very soon.

425
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,570
You'd only go this much faster. This much.

426
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:04,200
Thank you. Have a nice day. Thank you!

427
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,470
 Hi, little buddy. Have you been well? 

428
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:34,960
♫  Tell me about loneliness  ♫

429
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:42,350
♫  This must be a feeling like a wind blowing  ♫

430
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:50,330
♫  I'll tell you about sadness  ♫

431
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:59,500
♫  That must be a feeling like a sleeve that's getting wet in the rain  ♫

432
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,500
Guys, the teacher told us to eat. We have an interim assessment in an hour.

433
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,360
Gosh, I don't want to.

434
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,600
Let's go, guys.

435
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,780
♫  I'm stopping right now  ♫

436
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:23,680
♫  Which way should I go? I'm actually afraid  ♫

437
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:29,900
♫  If only I had you to hold my hand warmly  ♫

438
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:38,930
♫  I would've leaned on you without a word and face the night approaching  ♫

439
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,360
Drink it.

440
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,800
You must be thirsty without a drink.

441
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,610
You don't have to be so alarmed. I didn't put poison in it. Just relax and...

442
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:54,190
Hold on, hold on! Hold on, buddy.

443
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,170
Hey, hey, hey. Where are you going? Hey!

444
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,050
Talking to her won't work.

445
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,570
Pardon?

446
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,850
Wait, hold on.

447
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,980
You go to that art academy there. Right?

448
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,730
I see you often because I go to an academy nearby, too.

449
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,500
I'm an 11th grader at Dongwon High.

450
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,040
And you're an art student at Seowon Arts High— Hold on, hold on.

451
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,760
Would you like to talk at a quiet cafe if you're free?

452
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,040
I'll get you a parfait.

453
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:29,020
To be honest, you're exactly my type.

454
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,440
Hey!

455
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,960
Hey. Do you think I'm a joke? Why do you keep ignoring me?

456
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,260
Just tell me if you don't want to.

457
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,840
Why do you keep ignoring me like that?

458
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,890
- Are you serious— 
 - Hey, hey, hey. Don't.

459
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,270
She can't talk.

460
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:50,350
- What? 
 - She's deaf, I mean.

461
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,980
What? She really can't hear?

462
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,080
Hey, is it for real or not? Hey!

463
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,440
- Come here, come here, come here. 
 - Who are you?

464
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,410
- It hurts, it hurts, it hurts! 
 - Come here, come here.

465
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,460
What are you, in elementary school?

466
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,530
Do you really have to be that childish?

467
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,210
Open up your notebook and write this down.

468
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,170
"A handsome hyung taught me a true lesson today.

469
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,500
It was so moving.

470
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,210
After listening to him, I realized I was trash.

471
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,820
I should be a good person from now on."

472
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,810
Won't you write it down?

473
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,120
Don't cross the line.

474
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,210
I warned you nicely. Okay?

475
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,270
I'll kill you if you mess with her again.

476
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:56,680
Why did you have to choose someone like her and get us into this mess?

477
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,840
She walks around with headphones to confuse people. How was I to know?

478
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,000
You're right. How would you have known?

479
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:11,040
Gosh, I told them not to cross the line. But they moved the line.

480
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,600
Hey, hey, hey!

481
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:33,750

483
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,840
Please, please, please, please, please! 
  

484
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,700
Okay, I'll try one more time.

485
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,460
   

486
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,610
- Wear this one. 
 - I bet it's made for me.

487
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,720
It suits you. You look so pretty.

488
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,750
Looks good, right?

489
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,260
What's this?

490
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,790
Come here.

491
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,810
I'm the frog prince.

492
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,920
I'm a princess.

493
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,340
   

494
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,080
I'm really competitive.

495
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,670
Really?

496
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,400
But I am, too.

497
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,260
Watch this.

498
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,180
♫  I'll be fine  ♫

499
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,320
Eat it.

500
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,690
- It's tasty. 
 - It is.

501
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,500
You have to smile prettily for 15 minutes.

502
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,900
- I have to do this for 15 minutes? 
 - Yeah.

503
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,370
Are your eyebrows this thick?

504
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,740
Mine are very strong.

505
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,360
You have handsome eyebrows.

506
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,000
   

507
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,240
I picked this up while moving your suitcase but didn't get to give it back.

508
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,400
Can I ask you why you need this?

509
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,900
Does this have to do with the reason you hate cello to death?

510
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,940
Or the reason you ran away to the pool?

511
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,870
Or the reason you can't find a way to go back—

512
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,230
Mom forced happiness on me

513
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,560
and I displayed unhappiness with my entire body.

514
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,860
We were like a sword and a shield.

515
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,790
I was in front of a doctor when I woke up.

516
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,230
I had an exhibition of unhappiness like I used to.

517
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,460
And they gave that to me.

518
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,570
Since then, it has become my best friend.

519
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,710
Does that answer your question?

520
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,190
What tortured you so much?

521
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,690
Do you want me to do it again? In front of you, even?

522
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,600
Gosh, forget it.

523
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,330
If I do, they say I'm spoiled, childish,

524
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,410
and I'm just mentally fragile.

525
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,390
Do you still want me to show you?

526
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,920
Do you want to see who's unhappier?

527
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,690
 Welcome. I heard you're a pretty good cellist. 

528
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:28,690
 I came as my mom told me to because I didn't want to argue. 

529
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,900
 What kind of club is this? 

530
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,600
 Well, it's kind of a social club. 

531
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:40,180
 You know, a social club for networking where successful people can support each other. 

532
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,890
 So, we're the Barbie dolls who got invited to the network pool our moms created? 

533
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,350
 So, what would we usually do? 

534
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,620
 We'd bribe the contest judges and sneak out pieces to play for the college entrance. 

535
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,940
 What? 

536
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,550
 Moms do that part. 

537
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,820
 We just need to look pretty like dolls. 

538
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,710
 Until when? 

539
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,790
 Until we conquer the world? 

540
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:05,220
 We need to do that much to satisfy our moms' vanity and ambition. 

541
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:09,550
 Oh, didn't she tell you to become friends with me? 

542
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,570
 I'll take a photo with you. Although I'm only No. 1 in the country. 

543
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,850
 Smile like a pretty doll. 

544
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,440
 You should show gratitude to your mom. 

545
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:26,360
 One, two, three. 

546
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:44,350
 I know it's hard, but you have to be mature and overcome this. 

547
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:49,000
 Don't let people say that you became No.1 because your friend committed suicide. 

548
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,150
 You can't have a mental breakdown. 

549
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:56,300
 Instead, make sure to remember this feeling. 

550
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,440
 So you can think back to it when you convey sadness in music. 

551
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,670
 What? 

552
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,110
 I can't hear. 

553
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,800
 I can't hear sounds. 

554
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,700
 I can't hear anything, I said! 

555
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:26,060
The otolaryngologist couldn't identify the condition, so I befriended the psychiatric medicine.

556
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:31,440
Mom, who wanted to compensate for her failure through me, befriended alcohol.

557
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,480
It's a typical story like that.

558
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,380
It's a pathetic story of a mentally weak mother and a daughter.

559
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,590
Should we leave now?

560
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,270
Won't you be honest with me?

561
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:59,990
You blocked her path, started a fight, threatened her, and mocked her!

562
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,330
You were mugging her, but you got caught, so you're framing us!

563
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,130
- Seriously. 
 - Shut up!

564
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,980
Aren't you done writing yet?

565
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,710
Hey, you can't be like this.

566
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:17,190
You don't want to contact your parents and don't want to write about what happened.

567
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,290
You can't be so uncooperative.

568
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,840
Ahjussi, she doesn't understand the situation.

569
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,260
Her ears are blocked, so she can't hear. How could she testify?

570
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,990
Hey, do you want to die?

571
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,290
Do you want me to kill you?

572
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,510
You must be happy that you can hear.

573
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:38,030
What did you hear so clearly that you're spitting out trash?

574
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,140
Who are you, and why are you butting in?

575
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,830
I'm the grandmother of this kid.

576
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:50,490
He said to just warn and release them unless you'd put them in jail.

577
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,980
Who said that?

578
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,790
Kang Chang Shik.

579
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,220
Who's Kang Chang Shik—

580
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,380
You mean Chief did?

581
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,730
I used to feed him at my boarding house and became a police officer.

582
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:10,030
He was skinny enough to ride on a leaf, but I made him look normal.

583
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,180
And this is how he's returning the favor.

584
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,970
He hasn't called you to warn them and release them?

585
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,800
No, not yet.

586
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,040
I can't do that yet since the testimonies don't match.

587
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,800
The exit is behind you.

588
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,250
   

589
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,880
The lady at the shoe store saw it.

590
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,120
Huh?

591
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:37,870
I searched all the stores nearby and found a witness.

592
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:40,150
W-Well, it's not that.

593
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,500
I was just trying to talk to her—

594
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,200
Hey, hey! Be quiet. Be quiet!

595
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,730
He's done testifying.

596
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,210
Let them go now.

597
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:49,880
It's past dinnertime. They must be hungry.

598
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,480
Gosh.

599
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,500
Come and eat at my house since we got to meet like this.

600
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,530
You didn't have to find a witness.

601
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,690
You watched the show "Chief Inspector" too much.

602
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:55,600
Witness, my foot. I was lying.

603
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,860
What? Grandma, that's a false statement.

604
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,070
Why did you think you could—

605
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,000
Because of you.

606
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,430
You don't get violent for no other reason.

607
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:11,810
It's one or the other. To achieve justice or to help someone.

608
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,690
Do you like her?

609
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,370
She's pretty.

610
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:28,410
Forget it if you pity her.

611
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:33,980
Looks like she lives in a cold and lonely world on her own.

612
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,650
Don't even get started if you think you'll just hurt her.

613
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,700
I don't want you to suffer.

614
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,440
I had fun today, thanks to you. Bye.

615
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,320
You know...

616
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:18,780
There's no scale to compare who's hurting more.

617
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:22,690
There's no judge to determine that, either.

618
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,170
No one has the right to judge someone else's pain.

619
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,320
You're not obligated to be acknowledged, either.

620
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,970
If...

621
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,990
you're hurting, you're hurting.

622
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,470
And only you know how much you're hurting.

623
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,390
I won't force you to be happy.

624
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,560
I won't measure who's unhappier with you, either.

625
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:54,170
Sometimes, I just...

626
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,050
want to be your prescription.

627
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:03,130
Instead of that medicine, I want to...

628
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,280
become your best friend.

629
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:26,650
♫  If only we could've been together dreaming the same dream  ♫

630
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:38,590
♫  Go all the way around so far, at the end of this road, I sing a love song  ♫

631
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:42,700
 And if you're able to shine on your own again, 

632
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,640
 I want you to shine with all of your might. 

633
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:52,580
 I want that time to come as soon as possible. 

634
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,490
 Because... 

635
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:58,300
 I don't have a lot of time left. 

636
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,220
♫  Our small dreams  ♫

637
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:08,490
♫  I'll protect you until then, so you don't let go  ♫

638
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,530
What took you so long?

639
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,400
I told you to fly like a missile.

640
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,500
Hey, what happened? Why did you go to a police station?

641
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,510
And what's with that wound?

642
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,680
Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol.

643
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,230
What do you get paid for, exactly?

644
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,400
- What? 
 - The Jinsung family...

645
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,230
must pay you handsomely.

646
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:44,200
Are you happy as long as your pocket is full?

647
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:48,460
How about Yoon Cheong Ah? You don't care about her?

648
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,520
What are you talking about? Try to help me understand.

649
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,680
You don't care even though she didn't come to the festival.

650
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,880
You don't care even if she refused to come to the songwriting camp.

651
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,140
And you don't care if she's harassed on the street or not!

652
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,200
What kind of person are you?

653
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,560
Cheong Ah...

654
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,520
got harassed on the street?

655
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,010
Whatever.

656
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,230
I'm about to do something big. You'd better help me.

657
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:18,040
Hey, hey, hey. Something big? Are you thinking of taking revenge?

658
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,420
If you can't even do this much for her, you're not even a human.

659
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,030
Hey, Lee Chan. No, don't do it! Control yourself!

660
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:47,180
 I'm sorry, Lee Chan. Everything I said last time was a lie. 

661
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:51,070
 I was trying to get out of the way, so you and Se Kyeong get back... 

662
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,700
 Cheong Ah, this is Eun Gyeol. Could you come to the practice room now? 

663
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,590
 You need to stop Lee Chan! 

664
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,070
I'm sorry.

665
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:50,680
I asked Eun Gyeol because I thought you wouldn't come if I asked you.

666
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,370
 You wanted to be friends with me first. 

667
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,770
 You said you liked me first, too. 

668
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,410
 You can't make my heart flutter and just ditch me. 

669
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,310
 How could you not come to the festival? 

670
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,840
 How could you not join the camping trip? 

671
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,370
 How could you be so mean? 

672
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:50,620
 I was going to sing for you at the festival. 

673
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,680
 But you didn't come to the festival... 

674
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,710
 and if you can't come to the camping trip, 

675
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,090
 I'll have to do it here. 

676
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,460
Watch carefully.

677
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:26,850

00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:46,900
♫  You'll ignite a small light in me  ♫

699
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:53,100
♫  You're precious to me  ♫

700
00:54:53,100 --> 00:55:00,220
♫  La-la-la-la. I'll always be with you  ♫

701
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:13,020
♫  When morning comes, the warm sunshine will shine on me  ♫

702
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:18,060
    
 Geez, don't they know what time it is?

703
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,940
Gosh, seriously...

704
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,390
By the way, is Yoon Cheong Ah really coming?

705
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:26,050
Yes, she told Eun Gyeol yesterday.

706
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,780
Why are you so happy, by the way?

707
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:33,090
Well, the more I see her, the more I like her.

708
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:35,300
Gosh, I'm so sick of it.

709
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:39,190
- Is she really coming with Ha Eun Gyeol? 
 - I don't know. Probably.

710
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:40,620
Gosh, seriously.

711
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,900
I'm sorry we're late!

712
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,610
What's with you guys?

713
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:53,730
Are you two dating, by chance?

714
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:55,920
Yes.

715
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:04,270
What? Did you guys know?

716
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:08,040
I had a feeling when Se Kyeong left in the middle of the performance.

717
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,010
And I figured it out when Ha Eun Gyeol left without joining the after-party.

718
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:15,380
How about Lee Chan? How about our Lee Chan?

719
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,980
Is he getting drunk on the water somewhere again?

720
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,480
Start the music!

721
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:25,620
Here comes the designer!

722
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,500
What? Did you guys know?

723
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,130
Yes. I had a feeling when he was freaking out after getting the guitar pick.

724
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:41,920
I found out when he flipped out when Cheong Ah didn't come to the after-party.

725
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,600
Am I the only stupid one? How come I'm still on the ground?

726
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:49,850
You're all too relaxed. You practiced the greeting, right?

727
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:53,190
Attention.

728
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,250
At ease.

729
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,600
Attention.

730
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,460
Say hello to the designer.

731
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,020
 Hi, friend. 

732
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:06,600
 How are you? 

733
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,910
- Wow. 
  - Hi, guys. 

734
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,940
She understood.

735
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,130
Hey, it's time to board the train.

736
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,020
Okay. Move, move, move, move!

737
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,120
Okay, let's go. Make sure you have everything.

738
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,270
Come this way. This way!

739
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,500
- Shall we go, too? 
 - Okay.

740
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:36,400
   

741
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:44,940
♫  It's a new beginning, I breathe out  ♫

742
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,050
Let's check just once.

743
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,310
It tickles. What's the deal?

744
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:53,250
- You try it, you try it. 
 - Do it.

745
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,800
♫  We're here on this shining stage together  ♫

746
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,860
See?

747
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:04,580
This is what I get for choosing you.

748
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:11,190
My fans left me. How will you compensate for this?

749
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,800
I'll be good from now on.

750
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,400
Whatever. Just keep your promise.

751
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,460
Promise?

752
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,380
What promise?

753
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,650
My promise to find you a way to go back?

754
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:31,130
- Not that. 
 - Not that?

755
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:33,040
W-What else is there?

756
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,320
You promised to delay it as much as you can.

757
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:40,330
I think I missed my chance to die because of you.

758
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:45,000
I no longer feel like giving up on my life because of Mom.

759
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,990
I changed my mind after eating the star candy.

760
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:53,840
So I want to try living. And I might as well make it fun.

761
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,420
So...

762
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:58,790
I'll kill you if you rush it.

763
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:05,150
If you give up on working hard or disappear like last time, I'll kill you.

764
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,510
Where's the restroom?

765
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,510
Oh, that way.

766
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,200
 I like her. 

767
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,320
 It's not time yet. 

768
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,220
 Not today. 

769
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,750
 We can be together now... 

770
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:41,380
   

771
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,090
   

772
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,810
   

773
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,940
No way. How is this here...

774
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:28,270
   

775
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,650
Hello?

776
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:42,540
Is this Master, by chance?

777
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:46,560
I knew you'd greet me warmly.

778
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,120
Gosh, when did I fall asleep again?

779
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,430
This is a dream, right?

780
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:57,330
I'm not sure. But the dreamy trip is coming to an end.

781
01:00:57,330 --> 01:01:01,540
Does that mean I'll go back to the year 2023?

782
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,930
Soon, on the night with two moons,

783
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:06,740
- the door that connects the two worlds... 
  - Gosh, whatever. 

784
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:11,050
I'm not interested in going back yet. I'll go back when I want to. Bye.

785
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:12,820
H-H-Hold on.

786
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,280
You only get one chance to go back.

787
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,550
If you lose that chance, you might be stuck in the past forever.

788
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,190
Would you be okay with that?

789
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:25,500
I-I-I'd be stuck forever?

790
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,240
Don't worry.

791
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,910
I sent a helper just for you.

792
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:33,030
A helper? What helper?

793
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:37,310
 A travel companion and a helper who'll come back with you. 

794
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:42,360
Pardon? Does that mean there's another time traveler?

795
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,740
 Who's that? Where are they right now? 

796
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,260
How can I meet them?

797
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:51,470
They might be closer to you than you think.

798
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:54,270
Coming soon.

799
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,560
Oh, hold on. Ahjussi. Master. Hello? Hello?

800
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,800
Gosh, why isn't it working?

801
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:12,500
Geez, please work. Please work.

802
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,640
No, no, no, no, no...

803
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,490
You...

804
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:24,940
What?

805
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:48,360

The time traveler Master mentioned was...

807
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:55,440
The helper Master mentioned was...

808
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,400
- You? 
 - You?

809
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:01,030
   

810
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:08,150
♫  These shining moments  ♫

811
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:16,040
♫  I can give them all to you  ♫

812
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:28,540
♫  So we don't lose our little dreams, I will...  ♫

813
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:33,300
   

814
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,320
 How could you be a time traveler? 

815
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,130
 Have you been flirting with my mom the whole time, then? 

816
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:41,950
 I'll make sure Cheong Ah becomes someone to lead the Jinsung family. 

817
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:43,850
 I haven't achieved my mission yet. 

818
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:46,920
 - I have the most difficult task left. 
 - What is it? 

819
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,370
 You've heard of White Nights, the legendary rock band. Right? 

820
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:51,610
 He's the frontman of that band. 

821
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:54,040
 Is there a magazine with an article on that band? 

822
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,260
 Lee Chan, help me. Come pick me up. 

823
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,920
 What are you people doing in this house? 

824
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,430
 What brings you here? 

825
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:03,110
 I want to learn about my mom.
