1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,960
   

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,450
   

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,660
   

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,810
   

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,550
   

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,610
   

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,880
   

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,990
   

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,710
   

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,480


11
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,660
 Is this what he meant? 

12
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,270
 Was what he said really true? 

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,930
 Hey! 

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,520
 Don't touch Lee Chan, you sons of bitches! 

15
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,860
   

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,950
    
 Hey, let's run before the police show up.

17
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,800
Are you okay? Can you walk?

18
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,910
First of all, hop on my back.

19
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,130
Don't worry.

20
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,670
I lied about the police being here.

21
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,940
Would you be able to handle it?

22
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,180
Do Jin won't forgive you if he finds out you tricked him.

23
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,860
I should actually call the police, then.

24
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,660
My uncle is a police chief.

25
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,130
Hey, junior. You should've reported before this happened—

26
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,140
Shouldn't we turn this place back to normal?

27
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,200
The security guard will patrol in the morning.

28
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,560
Can we hurry up a bit?

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,660
He'll start patrolling soon.

30
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,650
Hello. I'm a 10th grader on the festival committee.

31
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,430
You were sleeping so soundly earlier.

32
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,990
   

33
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,150
Hey, lean on me. I'll help you.

34
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,520
Gosh, so heavy.

35
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,120
Are you okay? Isn't your head spinning?

36
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,320
Go home, get some sleep, and let's regroup at 12:00 at school.

37
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,340
Hey, you want us to go home looking like this?

38
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,700
Hey, aren't we making our parents too happy?

39
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,270
Well, you're right.

40
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,710
Jindo Dog Gang?

41
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,370
Yes.

42
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,360
So, you've been mugging people, fighting, and stealing from cars since middle school with him.

43
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,130
But you quit doing that since you joined a band.

44
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,060
But he thinks he went to juvenile jail because you turned him in?

45
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,580
Yes.

46
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,720
But you never told the police?

47
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,630
No. But I'm sure he knows I didn't do it, too.

48
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,120
Why did you let him misunderstand, then?

49
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,030
I'm sure he needs to vent at someone.

50
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,190
And he thinks I betrayed him anyway.

51
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,970
Is refusing to steal from cars a betrayal?

52
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,150
Geez, what if they come to ruin the show later?

53
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,170
Don't worry. He's reckless, but he isn't stupid.

54
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,300
He knows better than to cause trouble while on parole.

55
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,650
You're not going back to him. Right?

56
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,270
Huh?

57
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,490
No.

58
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,730
You don't have a tattoo of a Jindo dog. Right?

59
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,980
No.

60
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,810
- Really? 
 - Geez, I said no.

61
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,610
Look for it if you can't believe me.

62
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,920
W-What's going on right now?

63
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,490
 Hey! 

64
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,970
Come here!

65
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,840
What do you think?

66
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,800
What do you think? Not too bad, right?

67
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,580
Hey, pretty good, huh?

68
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,720
Am I really your dad?

69
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,340
Huh?

70
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,320
You said I'm your dad, and you're my son.

71
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,280
You knew my future

72
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,930
and figured out a way to change my life.

73
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,370
That's why you didn't want us to rehearse.

74
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,400
How did you know?

75
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,150
How did you come, knowing I'd get injured?

76
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:03,220
To be honest, my father was against me being in a band.

77
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,660
So, I left home out of anger.

78
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,110
But he ended up finding out our rehearsal date.

79
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,680
I'll be forced to study abroad if I get caught.

80
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,860
So, I had no choice but to lie to you.

81
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,310
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,310
- Really? 
 - Really.

83
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,560
- Is it true? 
 - It's true.

84
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,600
Right? You almost fooled me. Geez.

85
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,610
Gosh, you thought I'd buy a lie like that?

86
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,580
But seriously, do you want to die?

87
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,500
How could you drag Se Kyeong into something like that?

88
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,490
You promised me not to see her before the festival.

89
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,890
Huh? Seriously...

90
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,500
 Hey, the movie's about to start! Where are you going? 

91
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,920
 Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol! 

92
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,090
Hey! Where are you going naked?

93
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,990
Se Kyeong! I know you're inside!

94
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,350
Come out for a second! I need to talk to you!

95
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,840
Se Kyeong! It will just be a moment! Choi Se Kyeong!

96
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,410
Be quiet, or I'll call the police!

97
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,200
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,190
   

99
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,450
I really owe you big time.

100
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,490
To be honest, I have a reason I can't tell you about... No.

101
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,870
I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything.

102
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,630
To be honest, I was worried Lee Chan would get into an accident... I mean...

103
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,470
I managed to cancel the rehearsal, but they still tried to do it...

104
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,410
No...

105
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,990
Anyway, I'm sorry.

106
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,490
 Beat me up if you want to. 

107
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,310
 Swear at me all you want. 

108
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,860
 You can do anything to make you feel better. 

109
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,080
 But please don't avoid me. 

110
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,980
 Give me a chance to apologize sincerely in person- 

111
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,590
There's something you don't know about.

112
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,400
I hate being abandoned...

113
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,800
more than anything.

114
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,520
 I was forgetting for a moment while focusing on Dad. 

115
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,420
 That I have other missions left. 

116
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,350
 I need to make Mom smile. 

117
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,340
 I need to make sure my parents end up together. 

118
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,190
 To do that, I have to make Choi Se Kyeong stay away from Dad no matter what. And... 

119
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,310
You're like a stray cat.

120
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,140
I thought I kicked you out. Didn't I?

121
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,630
 Same with that witch who's next to Mom. 

122
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,280
Since you came, clear out the annex and take the rest of your stuff.

123
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,520
I never said I'd move out.

124
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,290
You skipped classes and you left without notice, too.

125
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,830
Do you need more reasons to get kicked out?

126
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,670
I sent the chairman a fax to let him know in advance.

127
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,820
I told you. He's my boss.

128
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,380
Get out while I'm still treating you like a human.

129
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,840
Cheong Ah is the only one I need to worry about in this house.

130
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,250
Should I get someone to drag you out?

131
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,450
How dare you tell him to leave or not?

132
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,650
Welcome, Chairman.

133
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,980
Did you have a comfortable business trip?

134
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,620
You should go to the study.

135
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,460
I need to talk to you privately.

136
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,070
Okay.

137
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,870
Since when did you pretend to be the head of this house?

138
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,290
- Chairman. 
 - Who let you make that decision?

139
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,430
You must've noticed earlier, but he's a kid without any class.

140
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,140
He's unbelievably arrogant because he has you.

141
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,060
Not only that, we have two grown-up daughters at home.

142
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,000
You're more sensitive than anyone about letting people in the house. How could you—

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,780
I clearly told you not to judge him by his attitude.

144
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,550
- Chairman. 
 - Don't talk back to me!

145
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,880
Chairman.

146
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:02,040
You won't say your relationship with him is thicker than water. Right?

147
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:12,400
What you said just now turned Joo Yeop and Sang Ah into water.

148
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,630
And I became putrid water in a sewer.

149
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,740
Happy now?

150
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,450
- Pardon? 
 - I said I'll cancel the contract.

151
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,820
But the contract period doesn't expire for five days.

152
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,010
It's too slow. Investing and withdrawing is all about timing.

153
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,890
You probably don't know, but Cheong Ah has been changing a lot lately.

154
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,600
Her sign language improved a lot, and she made a lot of friends.

155
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,380
She's been opening herself up a lot, too. And most importantly...

156
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,890
she smiles a lot.

157
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,350
I think you forgot the contract condition.

158
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,260
Didn't you say you'd let me see her smiling?

159
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,200
That's because you're rarely home because of your business trips—

160
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,870
Are you telling me to forget about the company and stay at home?

161
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,100
Anyway, this is unjust.

162
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,040
How could a chairman of a corporation fire a young person unjustly—

163
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,950
That's why I'm saying I'll extend it by a month.

164
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,320
If you keep doing this, I'll report you to the labor administration—

165
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,010
Pardon? Extend?

166
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,920
Let's cancel the original contract and extend it by a month.

167
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,810
Instead, I'll change the conditions a bit.

168
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,650
Conditions...

169
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,980
What exactly...

170
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,950
She has to smile, looking at me.

171
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,770
Who?

172
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,690
Cheong Ah?

173
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,510
Why? Can't you do it?

174
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,880
I'll give it a try.

175
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,490
I'm done talking. Leave now.

176
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,430
- Chairman. 
 - I won't cooperate.

177
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,830
Figure it out on your own.

178
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,500
I'd love you to see it.

179
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,750
See what?

180
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,140
Cheong Ah's smile.

181
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,670
It's really pretty.

182
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,740
 Who did I like more before I left to study abroad? 

183
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,890
 Ha Eun Gyeol. 

184
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,170
 She definitely likes Eun Gyeol. 

185
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,020
   

186
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,060
 Ha Eun Gyeol. 

187
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:43,430
 Se Kyeong will definitely choose Eun Gyeol over Lee Chan today. 

188
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,820
You'll come to the festival later. Right?

189
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,560
 Yes. I'll go. 

190
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,210
 I can never let Mom cry. 

191
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:11,770
 I need to win Choi Se Kyeong over before the festival starts, no matter what. 

192
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,600
Se Kyeong.

193
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,070
Are you going to Baegwang High's festival today?

194
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,110
Well, I think you'll go.

195
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,100
Come on. Why would I go there?

196
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,790
It's obvious that you'll go.

197
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,990
I mean, I thought I should accompany you if you're going.

198
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,490
I can't let you enter the cave of wolves on your own.

199
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,090
You look like you'd go regardless of my attendance.

200
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,080
Why? How do I look?

201
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,060
You look like an Ahssa who wants to be an Inssa. 
  (Ahssa: outsider, Inssa: social butterfly) 

202
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,880
What does that mean? Is that a good thing?

203
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,920
What does that mean? Choi Se Kyeong.

204
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,190
Choi Se Kyeong. Please answer...

205
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,970
Se Kyeong, let's talk for a second.

206
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,940
Hi. Good morning.

207
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,140
What? Did she do sign language just now?

208
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,800
She must be crazy. What if people think she's handicapped?

209
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,720
 I'm sorry. I'll see you later. 

210
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,240
They have something going on. Don't they?

211
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,170
You know something, right...

212
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,650
Are they serious right now? Hey!

213
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,580
Se Kyeong. Let's talk for a second.

214
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,760
I'll tell you everything.

215
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,860
The secret I promised to tell you about when it's time.

216
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,110
I'll tell you all about it now.

217
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,920
I don't know if you'd believe me, but I—

218
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,090
- My parents got divorced. 
 - What?

219
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,890
They've been fighting over me for 12 months a year.

220
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,960
I thought I was being loved.

221
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,440
But I wasn't.

222
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,980
They each had their goals.

223
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,750
Dad didn't want to be a bad person who abandoned his child.

224
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,400
And Mom needed a flashy accessory to make herself shine.

225
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,670
I'll no longer be a child who only gets loved when she's needed or useful.

226
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,240
I'm not interested in becoming anyone's trophy, souvenir, or jewel.

227
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,140
I'm not like that. I—

228
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,330
You're hunting.

229
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,740
- What? 
 - Men naturally compete to win the trophy.

230
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,020
Don't say you're different.

231
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,650
You aren't.

232
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,320
You'll display the taxidermy of me, tell the heroic story it to death,

233
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,520
and when it's no longer useful, you'll ignore me whether I get dusty or disappear.

234
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,970
Choi Se Kyeong.

235
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,450
Give up. I'll never get caught by you.

236
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,170
I don't want to get caught by anyone and get turned into a taxidermy trophy.

237
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,100
So...

238
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,110
will you choose Lee Chan?

239
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,520
Why does it matter?

240
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,860
Don't come to the festival if you're going to.

241
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,990
Choose me if you'll come.

242
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,040
Get out of my face. How dare you give me an order?

243
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,380
Were you waiting for me?

244
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,260
Why? Do you need to tell me something?

245
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,850
 You'll choose Ha Eun Gyeol today. Right? 

246
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,370
No. Bet on Lee Chan.

247
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,570
It's a secret only you know about.

248
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,400
I'll only focus on the mission from now on.

249
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,500
Only the mission.

250
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,900
The watermelons are here!

251
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,760
Sweet and fresh watermelons are here!

252
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,810
- They're good at... 
  - Singing! 

253
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,910
- And they're good at playing... 
 - Instruments!

254
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,900
Tasty watermelons...

255
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,340
 Are here! 

256
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,930
Today at 5:00 p.m.

257
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,150
What time did I say?

258
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,570
 5:00 p.m.! 

259
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,770
One more time. What time?

260
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,080
 5:00 p.m.! 

261
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,900
That's right. And where?

262
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,680
 At the gym! 

263
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,630
Here we are. Here we are. We're here.

264
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,670
Yes, we're...

265
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,820
Who are we?

266
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,920
 Watermelon Sugar! 

267
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,080
- Viva! 
  - La vida! 

268
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,260
Watermelon!

269
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,760
 Sugar! 

270
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,950
We're...

271
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,860
 Watermelon Sugar, everyone! 

272
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,760
Please make sure to come, guys.

273
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,930
- Who wants one? 
 - Me!

274
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,320
Hold on, hold on. Coming through.

275
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,450
   

276
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,890
Surprise.

277
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,170
You came so early.

278
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:20,170
School. Do you want to look around our school?

279
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,380
 I need to go back to school. 

280
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,910
 They suddenly added a supplementary class. 

281
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,030
School? Class?

282
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,390
Oh, you're going back to school?

283
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,860
Seriously?

284
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,370
Why...

285
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,820
did you come so early, then?

286
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,710
Oh, my.

287
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,100
Wow, amazing!

288
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,990
Are you giving this to me?

289
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,450
 It's a present. 

290
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,070
A present? It means a present. Right?

291
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:20,300
Did you make this to give to me?

292
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,570
Wow, thank you. Thank you so much.

293
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,360
I'll make sure to use it for the show today.

294
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,070
Right. You're coming to the show later. Right?

295
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,200
You'll come to the show. Right?

296
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,960
 No. I won't be there today. 

297
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,680
Make sure to come.

298
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,480
Make sure to come and clap like this...

299
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,280
I mean...

300
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,350
do this.

301
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:01,860
 No, I won't be able to shine like you today. 

302
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,480
I'll go.

303
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:12,810
♫  If only I had you to hold my hand warmly  ♫

304
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,650
 It's been fun, Lee Chan. 

305
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,150
 Good luck with the show today. 

306
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,810
 And... 

307
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:27,740
♫  And get through it with your courage  ♫

308
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,530
 Make sure to win the bet, too. 

309
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,260
   

310
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,610
   

311
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,730
Put Eun Gyeol's photo in the front. Don't you know how to do business?

312
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,300
We need a bait, you bastard.

313
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,770
A photo that will make the girls open their wallets. 
    

314
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,590
An art exhibition that expresses a refreshing feeling.

315
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,210
Forget it. Put them away. Donate them to the ghost photo club.

316
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,520
Hey, you came.

317
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,720
I'm sorry. Cleaning took a long time.

318
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,040
Where's Lee Chan?

319
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,240
Gosh, I'm too popular.

320
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,930
Everyone wants to see me wherever I go.

321
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,540
You bastard. We're so busy. Why do you keep roaming around?

322
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,410
I stopped by the woodworking studio to make something.

323
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,490
Make what?

324
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,350
Take a guess.

325
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,940
Shit, this is so cool. Where did you get it?

326
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,300
I don't know. I don't know. Cheong Ah only gave it to me and left.

327
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,690
Mom? I mean, Cheong Ah was here, you mean?

328
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,780
Yes. She's very professional.

329
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,040
She always cares for the frontman.

330
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,870
 What do I do? I haven't made up with Se Kyeong yet. 

331
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,940
You should've brought her with you. Why did you come alone?

332
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,120
She has a class. She'll come after.

333
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,800
A class?

334
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,650
Gosh, the rumor was true.

335
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,690
Rumor? What rumor?

336
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,530
Seowon Arts High is infamous

337
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,490
for suddenly adding a class whenever there's a school festival.

338
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,300
- Why? 
 - What do you mean, why?

339
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,870
The students get excited about the festival, get poor grades,

340
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,750
and start dating and get in trouble. They're controlling them.

341
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,460
What? Does this mean Se Kyeong might not come, either?

342
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,510
Yeah.

343
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:16,570
A model student like her won't skip a class to come here. You dumbass.

344
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,270
That's why I didn't see students in Seowon Arts High's school uniform.

345
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,000
We're screwed. We're a failure.

346
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,460
Gosh, what do we do? We need to sell all this to pay for all the expenses.

347
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,870
It's okay, guys.

348
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,710
Our frontman always said...

349
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,330
if you push a wall, it becomes a bridge. And if you fall—

350
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,560
 - It's Choi Se Kyeong! 
 - Choi Se Kyeong! 

351
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,840
- Hey! 
 - Wait for me!

352
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,950
Choi Se Kyeong!

353
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,950
It's Choi Se Kyeong.

354
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,150
If you fall, there's a jewel in front of you!

355
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,780
Se Kyeong, you came.

356
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,790
Of course. I promised I would.

357
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,520
Se Kyeong, let's talk for a second.

358
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,000
It better have nothing to do with the bet.

359
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,440
You'd better give a good performance today.

360
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,170
Of course. You know who it's for.

361
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,240
- Well— 
 - We have a lot of time to kill before the show.

362
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,480
Do you want a tour?

363
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,470
- Yeah! 
 - Or do you want to check out our booth first?

364
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,700
I'll take a tour of the school first.

365
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,950
I'll help you. I have time—

366
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,390
I was going to say that, but I should check out the booth first.

367
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,680
Let's go. Which way, Ma Joo?

368
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,100
You can follow me!

369
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,640
Let's go.

370
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,950
 Let's go! 

371
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,230
We're here. It's right here.

372
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,270
This is it, huh? It's pretty. You did a good job.

373
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,490
Look, Se Kyeong. I displayed all the photos you took.

374
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,580
But you haven't sold a single thing yet.

375
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,790
Should I be your first customer?

376
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,910
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

377
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,890
Hold on. Let's see. First of all, photos of Ma Joo.

378
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,190
Yes!

379
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,010
And Se Beom.

380
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,010
Hyeon Yool.

381
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,890
Shi Gook.

382
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,870
And our cutie, Lee Chan.

383
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,100
That's it.

384
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,350
I'll take a T-shirt, too.

385
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,310
A t-shirt? Okay.

386
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,970
Coming right up. Here you go.

387
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,700
- It'd look nice, right? 
 - Of course.

388
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,260
What are you talking about? Why say something so obvious?

389
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,260
Take a picture. Take a picture.

390
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,850
Okay, okay, okay.

391
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,630
Yay, yay, yay, yay!

392
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,150
Se Kyeong!

393
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,380
- Hi. 
 - Hi. Well...

394
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,160
Could you please come to our club's game, too?

395
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,470
It's the most famous game in our school's festival.

396
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,670
- No. 
 - Why not?

397
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,350
She's a cellist. What if she hurts her hand?

398
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,320
No, Lee Chan. It sounds fun. Let's do it together.

399
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,460
- Shall we? 
 - Yes.

400
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,300
Hey, you guys should join, too. What do you say?

401
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,360
- Should we? 
 - Okay.

402
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,890
Hold on, hold on, hold on. One person needs to stay with the booth.

403
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,690
Who'll stay?

404
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:24,720
 Choi Se Kyeong! Choi Se Kyeong! Choi Se Kyeong! 

405
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,970
Eun Gyeol. Are you selling a lot?

406
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,190
Where's everyone else—

407
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,490
 Choi Se Kyeong! Choi Se Kyeong! 

408
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,390
Please stay here for a second.

409
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,540
What? Where are you going?

410
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,800
A competition of the century the whole universe and the whole world focuses on.

411
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,020
Today. Right now. Today. The enemies are facing each other on a log bridge.

412
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,990
Round 4! Drink soda and hold burps! Applaud!

413
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:53,790
You get one minute. Are you ready?

414
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,450
Are you ready? Ready.

415
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,740
Start!

416
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,610
 Choi Se Kyeong! Choi Se Kyeong! 

417
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,430
 Choi Se Kyeong! Choi Se Kyeong! 

418
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:27,430
 - Choi Se Kyeong! Choi Se Kyeong!  
 - Four, three, two, one. Success!

419
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,720
 Choi Se Kyeong! Choi Se Kyeong! 

420
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,400
Round 5! Guess who, who, who, who created the biggest bubble?

421
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,520
Ready. Start!

422
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,570
Go, go, go, go, go!

423
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,970
Nice, nice!

424
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,160
   
 Be quiet. 

425
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,820
 Quiet. 

426
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,350
Don't touch. Be quiet.

427
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,460
- Thank you. 
 - Order.

428
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,050
Sit still, sit still.

429
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,050
- Se Kyeong. 
 - Geez.

430
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,940
I suggested we go together. You left without me.

431
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,570
Will you keep upsetting me like this?

432
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,630
Should I have made the chairwoman's daughter skip a class, then?

433
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,330
I know.

434
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,370
I skipped the supplementary class to come here for you, but you're not happy to see me.

435
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,810
I asked you what you thought about my look, but you didn't answer.

436
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,630
You just need to be stylish on your own?

437
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,270
I thought our friendship was stronger than this.

438
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,050
That headband doesn't suit you.

439
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,820
- What? 
 - I think cool summer tones suit you.

440
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,250
Vivid colors like that are like poison to people like you.

441
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,770
Try muted tones or mauve tones instead.

442
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:18,090
S-Summer... Cool... Vivi...Vivi... what?

443
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:23,670
Shall we be quiet and prepare to watch the show?

444
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,440
There's nothing to watch.

445
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,520
They put the band together in a rush. How good could they be...

446
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,800
You can do it. Yes.

447
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,830
Son.

448
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,710
What? Are you already nervous?

449
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,480
Lee Chan.

450
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,330
What? Do you want heart medicine?

451
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,470
I won't go easy on you today.

452
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,310
You think only you have it?

453
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,670
I have one, too.

454
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,340
Stop pretending to be cool. Shit.

455
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,380
Standby. Three minutes left. Are you all ready?

456
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,320
Of course. Come on, brother.

457
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,160
- You can do well. Right? 
 - Yes, I'm always good.

458
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,490
You, too?

459
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,240
You'll lose three teeth whenever you mess up.

460
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,450
- Lee Chan will get dentures soon. 
 - Geez.

461
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,370
Okay. Who are we?

462
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:07,260
 Watermelon Sugar! 

463
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,090
Viva!

464
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,190
 La vida! 

465
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,280
Watermelon!

466
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,970

He's really something.

489
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:48,010
And Ha Eun Gyeol. Isn't he that person?

490
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,840
The one who jammed with Ji Hwan's band.

491
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,180
Who did what with whom?

492
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,290
I mean those two.

493
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,030
With Ji Hwan's band.

494
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,620
Dad...

495
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,070
I mean, Oppa had a band?

496
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,220
What's wrong with you?

497
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,090
You went to Myeongse University's outdoor theater with me.

498
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,540
To see Ji Hwan's band's regular show. Don't you remember?

499
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,200
Yes, it's him.

500
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,610
I knew he seemed familiar.

501
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,570
Se Kyeong, you knew, didn't you?

502
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,400

00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,610
 Was Dad the boy in the band? 

512
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,570
 My first love was... 

513
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,440
 as bright as sunshine and cheerful. 

514
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,740
 He sometimes acted nonchalant, 

515
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,690
 but he was so friendly. 

516
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,420
   

517
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,230
 And he always liked me only. 

518
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,900
Wow, it's so cool.

519
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,290
It's probably not spicy. Right?

520
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,360
It looks spicy.

521
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,130
I'll try it.

522
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,550
It's spicy. Right?

523
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,660
 And he was really good at eating spicy food, too. 

524
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,760
- It's not spicy at all. 
 - It's not?

525
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,390
Try some.

526
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,240
 I couldn't eat anything spicy. 

527
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,020
Gosh, it's spicy! Spicy!

528
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,090
My gosh! He's so handsome!

529
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,200
- What? 
 - Wow, seriously?

530
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,030
He's so handsome, so handsome!

531
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,500
 I didn't know when I was young. 

532
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,550
 We were like siblings. He was like my older brother.

 I was sure it was him at the spring festival. 

539
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:28,170
 He serenaded me on stage that day. 

540
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,150
 Was that person Dad? 

541
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:46,710
 Was Mom's first love Dad of his youth? 

542
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,840
Se Kyeong.

543
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,390

544
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,570

549
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:31,110
- Are you having fun, everyone? 
  - Yes! 

550
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,240
Gosh, I can't hear you.

551
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,100
Say it louder, everyone!

552
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,450
Are you having fun, everyone?

553
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,620
 Yes! 

554
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,550
Yes, thank you.

555
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,560
Our last song is...

556
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,710
dedicated to one girl.

557
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:06,190
Yes. I dedicate this song to the girl who allowed our band to exist.

558
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,070
It's The Classic's "Magic Castle."

559

Hey, we're having a party. Where are you going?

572
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,490
Oppa, give me an autograph before you go.

573

 - Watermelon! 
 - Sugar! 

577
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,920
See? See? Look how beautiful it is since you ordered one dish per person.

578
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,990
Yes. Do you need anything else?

579
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,680
We'll take more complimentary dumplings.

580
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,310
I'd raise a cow than have to raise you.

581
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,850
We'll order another yangjangpi. 
  (Korean Mix Vegetables and Seafood in Mustard Sauce) 

582
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,300
I'm thinking of starting to raise a cow today!

583
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,990
I could tell you're destined to be rich.

584
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,820
I'm sure you'll get rich.

585
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,500
Another order of yusanseul! 
  (Korean-Chinese stir-fried mushrooms) 

586
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,910
 Oh Ma Joo! Oh Ma Joo! Oh Ma Joo! 

587
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,320
Add yangjangpi and yusanseul to their order!

588
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,780
Let's go!

589
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,820
How could you swallow noodles right now?

590
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,490
Didn't you guys notice anything strange on stage today?

591
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,520
It's okay.

592
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,680
Although the bet wasn't a success, the show was.

593
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,570
Yes. Se Kyeong is so mature.

594
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:53,610
She didn't let the whole school see you getting dumped.

595
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,900
Dumped? Who got dumped?

596
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,980
You, of course.

597
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,010
I wasn't dumped by Se Kyeong.

598
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:03,710
She wisely decided to keep things open-ended like Solomon.

599
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,510
Because she didn't want to hurt someone by choosing the other.

600
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,990
Because she couldn't let our band get disbanded.

601
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,190
That's the kind of person she is.

602
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:15,160
She's a girl who's fair and loyal.

603
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,030
Wow, it sounded like a cartoon theme song.

604
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,080
We're done now. Right?

605
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,610
Let's start swallowing noodles, then.

606
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,550
Okay.

607
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,410
What do you mean, we're done, assholes!

608
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,970
Cheong Ah isn't here. Cheong Ah!

609
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,830
- Oh. 
 - Oh.

610
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,870
Oh? Oh...

611
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,660
Oh?

612
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,030
Gosh, you're so disloyal.

613
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,460
Our colleague, who shared joy and sorrow with us, isn't here.

614
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:46,220
But all you care about is food!

615
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,140
You're all practically animals!

616
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,850
 Could I see you for a second? 

617
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,560
 You should choose when and where. 

618
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,810
 Why won't you respond? 

619
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:07,550
 Are you not home yet? 

620
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:10,030
 Did your fax machine break, by chance? 

621
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,440
 Are you sick? 

622
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,270
 Did something happen? 

623
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,710
 I'll be in front of your house in 30 minutes. 

624
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,340
 I could see you briefly. Right? 

625
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,840
 I'll wait until you come out. 

626
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,510
Hi.

627
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,860
Where are you going?

628
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:13,510
Why didn't you come to the show today?

629
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,650
I was waiting for you.

630
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,620
 I'm deaf. 

631
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,220
I know.

632
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,390
 I can't hear. 

633
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:28,910
Yes. I know.

634
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,550
 Why did you invite me, then? 

635
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:36,670
Invite? Why did I invite you? Of course, it's because—

636
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:39,560
 To mock me? To humiliate me? 

637
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,080
 Because you pity me? 

638
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,130
 You wanted to display your disabled friend to look nice? 

639
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:47,750
 You wanted to brag about how much fun you were having when I couldn't hear? 

640
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,750
Hold on. You're going too fast.

641
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,610
Hold on.

642
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,350
You don't enjoy music with just your ears.

643
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:17,920
Music makes you feel with your eyes, mind, and heart.

644
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,090
 Stop acting cool. It makes me sick. 

645
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,600
 You're done, right? 

646
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,500

00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,340
Why have you been helping our band...

648
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,890
I mean...

649
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,860
Why have you been helping me?

650
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,100
♫  I'll tell you about sadness  ♫

651
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,050
Why did you suggest we become friends?

652
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:52,480
♫  That must be a feeling like a sleeve that's getting wet in the rain  ♫

653
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,070
Why...

654
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,730
did you say...

655
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,820
you liked me?

656
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:11,040
♫  I'm stopping right now  ♫

657
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,740
♫  Which way should I go?  ♫

658
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,780
♫  I'm actually afraid  ♫

659

660
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:34,840
♫  I would've leaned on you without a word and face the night approaching  ♫

661
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:41,610
I guess you finally see me.

662
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,010
What am I doing in front of your door?

663
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:56,380
I'm wondering why you ran out in the middle of the show.

664
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,800
I was wondering what I should do to make you look at me, too.

665
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,990
But I think I just achieved the second one.

666
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:13,720
How should I apologize so you'd forgive me?

667
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,670
That was the most difficult one.

668
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:21,660
But I thought this was the best way.

669
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,690
I'm sorry.

670
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,930
It's my fault.

671
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,850
Forgive me.

672
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,870
Should I tell you what I did wrong, too?

673
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,880
I'm sorry.

674
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,300
I was mistaken.

675
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:52,700
You treated me like I was invisible by ignoring, disregarding, and looking down on me.

676
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:56,130
But you changed the concept, and now you're apologizing immediately?

677
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,610
Anyway, I'm sorry.

678
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:02,350
We won't have to see each other again. Well, then...

679
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,290
When someone apologizes sincerely—

680
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:08,360
Please! Could you...

681
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,610
please leave me alone?

682
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:16,140
I have so many thoughts that my head is about to explode.

683
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,220
I don't know how much time I've been wasting.

684
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,990
I don't know if what I learned is true or if I'm confused or mistaken.

685
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:24,420
There's no way to confirm, and it's driving me crazy.

686
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,350
So, please don't make things worse.

687
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,930
Did something happen?

688
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,890
No.

689
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:35,420
Even if it did, it's none of your business.

690
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:39,710
- Hey, Choi Se Kyeong. 
 - I won't choose anyone. Happy?

691
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:42,790
I won't choose either you, Lee Chan, or anyone.

692
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,660
That's why you came. Because you thought I'd choose Lee Chan.

693
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,170
Hey, why are you making me a jerk?

694
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,110
I came because I was worried about you.

695
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,470
Just don't worry, please.

696
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,690
You and I won't be seeing each other anymore.

697
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,270
You and I...

698
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,220
live in different worlds all together.

699
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,990
I'll confirm.

700
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,240
I'll meet with him and confirm in person.

701
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,760
Hello?

702
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:25,500
   

703
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,530

♫  If I saw you in Heaven  ♫

705

♫  If I saw you in heaven  ♫

Why are you here alone?

716
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,220
I just...

717
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,240
like this song.

718
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,640
It's a good song to seduce a woman with.

719
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:51,910
♫  I'll find my way  ♫

720

♫  Through night and day  ♫

721
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:59,300
You've done it already.

722
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,480
Of course not.

723
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,180
It's about how he felt after losing his son.

724
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:07,280
I won't sing it for that purpose.

725
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:16,850
Don't just assume.

726
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:20,900
I don't know if my life will improve, but I'm sure I won't have children.

727
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,650
   

728
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,040
   

729
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,250
Ask me.

730
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,380
Ask what?

731
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,850
I can tell from your face. It's filled with question marks.

732
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,130
I'm all ears. Go ahead.

733
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:42,040
I'm sure it'd be about your friend, not you.

734
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,570
I used to have a mission.

735
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,060
I had to succeed even if I had to risk my life.

736
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:52,260
Have I told you that I can't guarantee a wise answer?

737
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:56,500
The mission was to be chosen by a girl I never should've wanted.

738
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:01,490
But she kept trying to choose another boy. It was so difficult.

739
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,490
- So did you fail? 
 - No, I succeeded.

740
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,310
I mean...

741
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,590
it ended up being a success.

742
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:12,200
So, did you get chosen?

743
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,130
No. She said she won't choose.

744
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:18,370
Wow. How mysterious.

745
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,490
It really is.

746
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:25,380
So, you succeeded in the mission, but you aren't happy.

747
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,430
I'm not so sure about that.

748
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:32,790
It feels stuffy, as if I swallowed something wrong.

749
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:36,770
If I try to force swallowing it, it stings...

750
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:38,310
and hurts.

751
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:41,090
- It's love. 
 - Pardon?

752
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:44,310
Is this your f-first love, by chance?

753
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,930
Don't make fun of me.

754
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:49,070
She's someone I can't be with.

755
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,080
There are no rules in love.

756
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,420
There is.

757
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,900
You can't overcome 28 years of age difference.

758
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,830
Wow... Wow...

759
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,340
28 years? Wow. That's...

760
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,500
That's a bit tricky.

761
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,410
It's okay. Things happen when you're a boy.

762
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,950
Being immature can't be my excuse.

763
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:18,620
You'll be able to write good lyrics about this.

764
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,490
The moon looks nice.

765
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:31,060
It's a perfect night to be rejected.

766
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,220
 The festival is over. 

767
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,610
 Don't ever come to see me again. 

768
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:44,130
 You and I live in different worlds, anyway. 

769
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:58,900
♫  When will the cold wind coming through the windowsill stop?  ♫

770
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:05,070
♫  You're my love  ♫

771
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:12,400
♫  You came to my world where I was left behind  ♫

772
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:26,430

774
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,710
Gosh, I know. Se Kyeong has been acting like a stranger.

775
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,110
It's not like the US is somewhere you can take a local bus to.

776
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:53,510
As if she was going to a grocery store, she said, "I'm going to the US now. Hang up."

777
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:55,950
How does that make sense?

778
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,310
It's true, I said.

779
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:02,270
She said she's going to the US right now.

780
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,620
I just talked to Se Kyeong— Who's this?

781
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,480
What are you talking about?

782
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,880
Se Kyeong is going where?

783
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,300
Do you want to die? Seriously...

784
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,840
The US!

785
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,110
 Just don't worry, please. 

786
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,410
 You and I won't be seeing each other anymore.

00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:11,270
Why are you crying alone? You're making me sad.

809
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:15,840
I don't know how to go back.

810
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:21,460
I need to confirm something with Mom and Dad, too.

811
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:24,270
I have questions to ask, but...

812
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:28,170
I thought I could go back easily, like how I came here.

813
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,880
But I can't find the way back.

814
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:36,170
I thought about not going back, too.

815
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,050
But I can't go even if I want to anymore.

816
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,970
What do I do?

817
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:45,560
What if I can never go back anymore?

818
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,770
I'll help you.

819
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,580
How? What could you do?

820
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:57,190
I'll find a way, no matter what it takes. But...

821
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,580
you should stay here with me for now.

822
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:05,890
♫  Whenever, whatever  ♫

823
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:09,470
Stay with me.

824
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:13,500
♫  Whenever, forever  ♫

825
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,680
♫  Forever with you  ♫

826
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,700
♫  You passed by me briefly  ♫

827
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:27,890
♫  Would you know that I only...  ♫

828
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:31,350
You said you and I live in different worlds. Right?

829
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:34,100
I don't care.

830
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:38,630
I don't care who you are.

831
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,400
I don't care if you're Ahjumma...

832
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,550
or a zombie, even.

833
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,560
So, let us...

834
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,210
stay together.

835
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:03,540
♫  I know. I can feel everything  ♫

836
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:09,550
♫  Whenever, whatever  ♫

837
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:15,050
♫  Forever with you  ♫

838
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:55,250
Looks like you finally found the helper.

839
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,170
I hope it's not too late.

840
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:08,720


841
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:16,980
♫  Even if no one reaches their hand out to me  ♫

842
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,730
   

843
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:30,700
♫  Your voice will embrace me without words  ♫

844
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:38,900
♫  Maybe all the times I hated you  ♫

845
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:44,390
♫  All the times I pushed you away  ♫

846
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:51,800
   

847
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,550
 How will we write an original song in a month? 

848
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:56,300
 How about we go on an overnight songwriting camping trip? 

849
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,010
 We'll come up with a song concept and do hiking, too. 

850
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:01,980
 Looks like it's almost time to end the journey. 

851
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,880
 I was actually happy when I ran into you. 

852
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,070
 That was really me. It was actually me! 

853
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:10,270
 Where's Yoon Cheong Ah? I don't care if she didn't come to the festival. 

854
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:12,030
 I'm not interested even if she doesn't join the camping trip. 

855
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:14,120
 What's wrong with you? 

856
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,960
 If you can shine on your own again, 

857
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,620
 I want you to shine as brightly as you can. 

858
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:22,650
 Because I don't have a lot of time left.
