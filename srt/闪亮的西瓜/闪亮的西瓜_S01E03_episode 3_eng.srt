1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,320


2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,160
   

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,170
   

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,750
   

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,860
   

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,340
   

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,240
   

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,920
   

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,730
    
 Pythagorean theorem. 1 to 2 to...

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,820
square root five. That's right.

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,190
It's four to eight to four and square root five.

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,300
That's right. Two square root 10.

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,090
This is two square root 10.

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,660
This is two square root 10.

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,580
We got everything, then. What do we need now?

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,040
Ptolemy's theorem. It just needs the Ptolemy's theorem.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,580
It's done.

18
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,200
Gosh, that Ptolemy...

19
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,000
If you want to waste your life,

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,810
get out.

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,310
Sir, when was your glorious moment?

22
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,320
Was it when you passed the teacher certification exam?

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,660
Was it when you married your wife?

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,690
Or was it when you had your son?

25
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,670
I have no children, and I'm divorced.

26
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,930
What nonsense are you spewing?

27
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,830
To me...

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,220
it's right now.

29
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,640
Get out. Get out right now.

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,980
Get out right now, you bastard.

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,300
I didn't know you got divorced.

32
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,330
Get out right now. Get out.

33
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,450
You little... Seriously.

34
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,630
That psycho.

35
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,880
 My name is Ha Lee Chan. 

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,980
 I'm currently 19 years old. 

37
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,750
 I'm sparkling the best as I can. 

38
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,430
Faster! Faster!

39
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,140
Let's go!

40
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,020
 The spring of 1995. Unarguably the best years of our youth. 

41
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,990
 In that spring, when I was able to shine spontaneously, 

42
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:19,800
 I met other youths who shook my life to the core. 

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,380


44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,280
Well done.

45
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,230
Sir, did you get a new Slam Dunk?

46
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,420
Yes, check the bookshelf over there.

47
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,620
How about Dragon Ball Z?

48
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,090
Here, here. On the staircase.

49
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:13,170
 The first person who shook my life to the core is... 

50
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,090
"Left hand only supports."

51
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,460
 Kang Baek Ho. 
 (Korean name for Sakuragi Hanamichi in Slam Dunk) 

52
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,030
 A pure positive energy. 

53
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,440
 He's my forever fictional hero. And... 

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,730
♫  I breathe out  ♫

55
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,170
♫  A moment I've been waiting for  ♫

56
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,400
 Choi Se Kyeong. 

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,180
 My goddess. My muse and... 

58
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,630
 Then you need to be in a band. 

59
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,210
 A band man can be worshipped. 

60
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,070
 What? Why are you showing up here? 

61
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,500
 It's not him. So just skip. 

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,050
Hey, hold on. Why are you skipping my part?

63
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,020
What are you doing? You bastard. Come here. You punk. Hey!

64
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,540
I'll give you a really good deal.

65
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,640
It was originally 23,000 won.

66
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,600
I'll give it to you for 20,000.

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,960
What's with that face? Okay.

68
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,210
I like your face.

69
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,120
If so...

70
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,340
I'll be reasonable and make it 12,000 won.

71
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,200
Thank you.

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,200
I'm giving you a good deal because my friend's girlfriend's brother went to Baegwang High.

73
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,600
Okay.

74
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,940
Kurt Cobain.

75
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,950
A man of a legendary band who was idolized by ladies.

76
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,650
Kurt Cobain.

77
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,840
 I learned the truth through his short but impactful life. 

78
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,930
♫  Just like the sparkling in distance  ♫

79
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,400
Why isn't he here?

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,900
♫  I'll give it all for this song that won't grow tired  ♫

81
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,950
 The only way a poor, powerless man to win over a beautiful woman... 

82
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,580
Se Kyeong, you like rock bands, too?

83
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,730
You should have told me.

84
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,730
I also...

85
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,340
am in a band!

86
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,400
Choi Se Kyeong,

87
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,880
want to come to my band's concert later?

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,180
My school is having a festival in a month.

89
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,980
I'll prepare a performance just for you. Make sure to come.

90
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,250
Do you even have a band?

91
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,440
- I'll start one now. 
 - What?

92
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,650
I got the T-shirt,

93
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,880
I got the guitar pick,

94
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,230
and my heart for you has been ready.

95
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,730
I just need to get started now.

96
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,160
You'll come, right?

97
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,410
Why would I go?

98
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,990
I'm creating this band for you,

99
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,460
it'd be a performance for you,

100
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,650
and there'll be a seat just for you, too.

101
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,530
 Answer him. Answer him. 

102
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,180
 Answer him. 

103
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,340
Se Kyeong, you're more forward than you look—

104
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,540
Fine.

105
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,460
Fine?

106
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,810
Fine? Did you say, "Fine" just now?

107
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,770
But...

108
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,700
- under one condition. 
 - Tell me.

109
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,520
What's the condition? Say anything. Go ahead.

110
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,150
Promise me beforehand.

111
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,800
Promise you'll never show up in front of me if you don't keep your promise.

112
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,050
Sounds good.

113
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,770
Instead, promise me one thing, too.

114
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,820
If I keep my promise,

115
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,750
you'd give me a chance to be your boyfriend.

116
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,530
The odds are basically 0%.

117
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,200
Probability can be an unbelievable thing.

118
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Tell me what the condition is.

119
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,340
One. It has to be a newly created band.

120
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,340
Don't even try to join an already successful band.

121
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,540
Two. You must know how to play an instrument.

122
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,880
Having a solo part is obviously mandatory.

123
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,930
Three. I get to pick the song.

124
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,780
Give up now if you were going to get by with an easy song.

125
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,420
What do you think?

126
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,060
Will you still do it?

127
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,340
Of course.

128
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,040
- Which song? 
  - Which song? 

129
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,020
- Which song? 
  - Which song? 

130
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,550
Nirvana's "Come As You Are."

131
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,330
 Can you do it? 

132
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,450
Will you be okay?

133
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,640
What do you mean?

134
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,220
The bet.

135
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,550
What if he succeeds?

136
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,900
There's no way he will.

137
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,580
How are you so certain?

138
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,900
I can tell by looking at his hands.

139
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,310
Those hands never touched an instrument.

140
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,320
Why did you accept the bet, then?

141
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,630
You're making the innocent boy's heart flutter.

142
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,440
You can't start a band on your own, and that Nirvana song isn't easy.

143
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,370
He won't show up for a while; he'll be busy starting a band and practicing.

144
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,210
And if he fails the mission, he can't show up out of embarrassment.

145
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,210
But you don't seem to know this.

146
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,360
What?

147
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,750
A boy in love...

148
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,040
sometimes gains supernatural powers.

149
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,380
I'll bet 10,000 won that he'll succeed.

150
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,570
Mister, whose side are you on right now?

151
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,400
Start what?

152
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,660
A band.

153
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,190
Y-You're not talking about a bandaid. Right?

154
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,210
It's a joke. Right? You're crazy. Right?

155
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,520
You think you can start a band overnight?

156
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,630
You can overnight.

157
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,480
- How? 
 - Baegwang Band.

158
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,430
 You mean our school's Baegwang Band? 

159
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,770
 A party of attention hogs. 

160
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,770
 A band of psychos. 

161
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,390
 They always go crazy trying to stand out from others. 

162
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,990
 And the guitarist, the only sane person, transferred to another school 

163
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,000
 and they were forced to be disbanded. 

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,470
That Baegwang Band?

165
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,590
Yes. I said I'd set them up with college girls, and they showed up immediately.

166
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,490
Are you crazy? You're doing what with them?

167
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,580
Hey, hey. Listen, buddy.

168
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,420
The name Baegwang Band is already long forgotten...

169
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,340
They're long forgotten now. But now...

170
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,510
   

171
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,970
See?

172
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll be every girl's first love from now on.

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Especially Se Kyeong will basically have memory loss.

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,240
Right.

175
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,170
And you'll be our band manager. Congratulations.

176
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,170
What? Gosh.

177
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,650
Gosh, no. I-I...

178
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,810
Buddy, welcome to the scammers' club.

179
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,550
You definitely said they'll be dancers.

180
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,490
I'll kill you if you set us up with martial arts girls.

181
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,830
Geez, were you always lied to?

182
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,250
I'm sure you've heard of them.

183
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,370
Snail Boarding House, which is more difficult to enter than a college.

184
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,690
I'm the grandson of the owner.

185
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,280
Isn't that just for men?

186
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,220
I heard they don't accept female college students.

187
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,800
I guess you didn't know all the tenants go to elite schools.

188
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,750
All their girlfriends are flight attendants,

189
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,080
ballerinas, designers, and—

190
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,670
How much time do we have to practice?

191
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,340
The festival is a month and 10 days away. We have enough time.

192
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,320
Okay.

193
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,560
Should we see how skilled the frontman is, then?

194
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,490
Of course.

195
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,640
It's time to be honest with each other.

196
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,590
One, two, three, four.

197
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,510
What? Why did you stop?

198
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,200
Are you nervous?

199
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,170
I only know up to that part.

200
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,560
Hey, should he be so upbeat about it?

201
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,440
Am I the only one who wants to beat him up?

202
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,050
Hey, hey. I'm the vocalist.

203
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,900
I just need to play the intro and look cool.

204
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,770
I'll just play solo up to the prelude,

205
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,080
and you can play the rest while I'm singing—

206
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,590
Shit.

207
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,520
You think we're a lounge band or something?

208
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,040
Do karaoke on your own if that's what you want to do, you asshole.

209
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,160
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

210
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,860
Just give up, Lee Chan.

211
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,890
We can't have a band without a guitarist.

212
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,470
You heard that. Right?

213
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,760
Geez.

214
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,790
I'm sorry we met.

215
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,630
Let's never see each other again.

216
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,270
Let's go.

217
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,640
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on!

218
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,220
Hold on, hold on.

219
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,100
Hold on.

220
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,350
Okay. I fully understand your position.

221
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,490
Let's just get one, then. Let's do it.

222
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,070
I'll find someone really good at playing the guitar.

223
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,610
Are you an idiot?

224
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,740
When will you find one and get to practice?

225
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,630
Unless it's the legendary Yoon Dong Jin.

226
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,850
Yoon Dong Jin? Who's that?

227
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll bring Dong Jin, then.

228
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,170
Do you even know who Yoon Dong Jin is?

229
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,580
Dong Jin?

230
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,090
I know him well.

231
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,740
I knew you would.

232
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,850
See? What did I tell you?

233
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,620
I said Bal San might know because he's from Chuncheon.

234
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,200
Who cares if he knows him? He has to be friends with him.

235
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,360
I know who Yoon Dong Jin is, too, man.

236
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,030
Yoon Dong Jin.

237
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,600
The genius guitarist who's a sophomore at Chuncheon University.

238
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,800
He even gave a song he wrote at age 13 to an artist.

239
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,320
He's a musician who's gifted in songwriting, too.

240
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,710
I know I taught him, but he's amazing.

241
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,690
You taught him? Yoon Dong Jin?

242
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,490
My gosh.

243
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,540
I should've said something I shouldn't have said.

244
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,540
I actually taught him how to play the guitar.

245
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,360
Hyung, have this. It cooked so well. It's Chuncheon dakgalbi.

246
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,160
Shall I?

247
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,550
It smells like Chuncheon.

248
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,640
Well, Hyung.

249
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,580
Could you give Dong Jin a call?

250
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,930
Lee Chan, it's burning. Flip it.

251
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,390
Hold on, it's burning! You bastard.

252
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,380
Hey, why do you want me to call him?

253
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,200
The thing is, he started a band,

254
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,080
but he needs to find a guitarist before the festival starts.

255
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,860
You think Dong Jin would join a high school band?

256
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,730
That's why I'm asking you to put in a call to him.

257
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,160
If you don't want to, just give me his phone number.

258
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,120
I'm really good at begging people.

259
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,220
You bastard.

260
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,100
Just wait right there.

261
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,150
Dong Jin is a night owl.

262
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,780
I probably can't reach him right now.

263
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,240
I'll try calling his oldest brother instead.

264
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,950
Hey—

265
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,900
- Yes, hello? 
   - Hello? 

266
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,570
I'm Bal San, who used to live in Chuncheon.

267
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,890
 Who's this? 

268
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,140
 I think you called the wrong number. 

269
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,860
Gosh, I know.

270
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,580
By the way, what's Dong Jin up to these days?

271
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,970
What? He went recluse?

272
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:19,550
He went to Mt. Odae to write songs three days ago?

273
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,820
You can't reach him at all?

274
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,620
 Mt. Odae, my foot. You son of a bitch. 

275
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,830
- Got it, Hyungnim. Goodbye. 
   - What the hell in the broad daylight, you f***ing idiot. 

276
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,400
 I'm so sleepy right now. Fu—! 

277
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,810
That's what he said.

278
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,740
Could you give us his phone number, then?

279
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,500
I'm sorry I can't be helpful.

280
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,800
All right. I have to meet someone.

281
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,550
This is a bulletin board of an online club for musicians.

282
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,430
People put up help-wanted ads for bands.

283
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,310
Who knows? Yoon Dong Jin might frequent this site, too.

284
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,620
- Let's just put up a post for now. 
 - Sounds good.

285
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,050
   

286
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,700
Hold on.

287
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,800
The bait is too weak. We can't catch Yoon Dong Jin with that.

288
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,790
What will we catch him with, then? An earthworm?

289
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,470
Say we provide lodging and food.

290
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,800
Huh? Are you crazy? Your grandma didn't even approve—

291
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:34,200
As long as you can join our band,

292
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,880
we'll provide you with...

293
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:46,140
warm food three times a day and a comfortable room free of charge.

294
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,770
 Hello, I'm Ha Lee Chan, the frontman of a band 

295
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:00,220
 Fake First Love Memory-Makers from Baegwang High School. 

296
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,970
 This may be a lot, but would you like to leave the beautiful lakeside city, Chuncheon, 

297
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,070
 and come to Seoul, the epicenter of culture? 

298
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,400
 I'm hoping to have you as a special guest member 

299
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,610
 for the school festival concert that's happening in a month. 

300
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,930
 As long as you can join our band, 

301
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,780
 we'll provide you with warm food 

302
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,860
 three times a day and a comfortable room free of charge. 

303
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,680
 We promise you have a comfortable stay in Seoul in the future. 

304
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,120
 Who's calling this late at night? 

305
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,010
Hello? This is Snail—

306
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,650
 Hey, he posted. 

307
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,370
 Yoon Dong Jin posted on the bulletin board! 

308
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,540
H-Hang up for now.

309
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,050
 Dong Jin! 

310
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,080
 Hello, this is Yoon Dong Jin. 

311
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,600
 I was looking for a place to stay in Seoul since I was planning to move there. 

312
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,750
 Free food and lodging at Snail Boarding House? 

313
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,350
 I'd consider myself fortunate and an honor. 

314
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,270
 I'd be happy to join your band as a guest member for the festival. 

315
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,940
Welcome. Are you looking for anything specific?

316
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,540
Rock... Rock... Do you have any rock albums, sir?

317
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,870
Rock? Hold on a second.

318
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,510
He said he'd be holding the school newspaper?

319
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,230
Yes. I said we'd be wearing the school uniform.

320
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,150
I'm sure he'd recognize us right away.

321
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,370
By the way, I did some research on Yoon Dong Jin.

322
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,730
I guess he's kind of unique. He's kind of odd and a bit crazy.

323
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,450
Ma Joo, he's a musician. Who cares? He's a genius.

324
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,950
Anyway, make sure to please him.

325
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,010
Don't say the wrong thing and make him change his mind.

326
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,360
Don't worry.

327
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,490
Today's Fortune said I'd be really lucky.

328
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,860
What did it say?

329
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,790
 "Just like a butterfly's flapping of wings can affect the weather, 

330
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,750
 a small event will bring an unexpected and tremendous outcome." 

331
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,690
   

332
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,740
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

333
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,980
Wait, excuse me.

334
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,790
   

335
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,840
 What happened? 

336
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,760
 Year 1995? 

337
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,710
Yoon Dong Jin?

338
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,180
It's you.

339
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,770
Ma Joo! Oh Ma Joo!

340
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,660
 - Oh Ma Joo?  
 - Here! He's here!

341
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,640
Gosh, you're early.

342
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,130
   
How can someone be in a band and not know Oh Ma Joo? 

343
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,770
 You know Yoon Dong Jin. Right? 

344
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,110
 Of course, he's the godfather of Korean rock. 

345
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,460
 Oh Ma Joo is the person who raised Yoon Dong Jin to be the best artist that he is. 

346
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,050
 No way. That Oh Ma Joo and Yoon Dong Jin? 

347
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,860
 Then... 

348
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,580
Who are you?

349
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:18,270
I am the frontman of the band "Fake First Love Memory-Makers," Ha Lee Chan.

350
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,140
 Ha Lee Chan? 

351
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,270
 Ha Lee Chan? 

352
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,150
Dad?

353
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,730
 It's Dad. 

354
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,560
 Dad... 

355
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,040
 is talking. 

356
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,260
- Is it really you, Dad? 
 - Probably not.

357
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,430
Born in 1978, the year of the horse. The name is Ha Lee Chan. Correct?

358
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,690
Probably, unless there's a secret about my birth.

359
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,100
You lived with your grandma, who runs a boarding house until you were in high school

360
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,830
and her name is Go Yang Hee.

361
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,660
The boarding house is called Snail. Correct?

362
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,700
Excuse me, Mr. Yoon. Let's go somewhere else first—

363
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,020
Am I right? Am I? Answer me right now.

364
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,830
You're right!

365
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,990
But how are you able to speak?

366
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,320
I have a mouth. I might as well use it, no?

367
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,710
How come you haven't told me all this time?

368
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,880
I thought you were born that way, no?

369
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,630
And what band, Dad?

370
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,330
Where's Mom? Where's she right now?

371
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,390
It's a UFO.

372
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,390
Dad, you can't just leave me here.

373
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,790
I still have so many questions!

374
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,730
Dad!

375
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,120
Hey, are you sure he's an oddball?

376
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,700
He's totally on another level.

377
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,150
I warned you.

378
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,940
I said it'd be difficult to approach him.

379
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,820
Wow, he's crazy. He called me "Dad."

380
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,710
What if Se Kyeong heard that?

381
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,840
So, should we back out now?

382
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,830
Should we give up on the band?

383
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,310
But are you sure he's Yoon Dong Jin?

384
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,120
Yes!

385
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,740
It's true. I'm Yoon Dong Jin.

386
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,550
Gosh, I don't think so.

387
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,040
What would make you believe me?

388
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,650
What school do you currently attend?

389
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,920
Chuncheon University. Mathematics Ed. major. Entering class of 1994.

390
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,950
- What instruments can you play? 
 - Guitar. My go-to is bass guitar.

391
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,660
Above average on the keyboard and pretty good on drums.

392
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,340
- When did you first start the guitar? 
 - Elementary—

393
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,470
In the fourth grade.

394
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,900
- When is your birthday? 
 - March 22nd, 1975.

395
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,990
My nickname was Bambi. Not the rain, but the deer. 
  ("Bi" is rain in Korean 

396
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,530
Oh? You know all that?

397
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,320
Of course, he's the godfather of Korean rock.

398
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,970
You can learn everything if you read his interviews—

399
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,240
Wow, he called himself the godfather of rock.

400
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,310
He's really delusional, isn't he?

401
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,510
How did we first meet?

402
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,840
Through a bulletin board of an internet club.

403
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,390
Why do you keep calling me "Dad"?

404
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,660
Because you're like the father of music.

405
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,820
How was your first impression of me?

406
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,640
I was surprised you were much more handsome than I thought.

407
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,960
Pass.

408
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,340
Welcome to Fake First Love Memory-Makers.

409
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,190
Yes!

410
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,840
I guess this is your first time in Seoul.

411
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,590
Not at all. I've lived in Seoul since I was born.

412
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,250
I'm kidding.

413
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,240
I'm a Chuncheon native, and it is my first time in Seoul.

414
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,480
 I mean, Seoul in the year 1995. 

415
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,930
Anyway, his worldview is so unique.

416
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,140
Right, Ma Joo?

417
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,850
Goodness, here comes the bus.

418
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,300
E-Excuse me.

419
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,690
- Yes? 
 - I lost my wallet. I have no money.

420
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,760
What do we do? I only have a commuter ticket.

421
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,660
Commuter ticket...

422
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,780
Well, since you look so young...

423
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,560
I'll give you two more commuter tickets as a bonus.

424
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,990
 This is a dream. 

425
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,020
 I definitely had a fight with Dad right before I left. 

426
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,860
 But now, I'm with him who's the same age as me. 

427
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,680
 And he's talking. 

428
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,200
 He's in a band? 

429
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,650
 There's no way this isn't a dream. 

430
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,050
- Hey. 
 - Huh?

431
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,650
I don't know what to do.

432
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,750
I think he'll cook me with his eyes.

433
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,070
By the way, when did you leave Mt. Odae?

434
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,110
Mt. Odae?

435
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,800
I heard you were writing songs.

436
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,740
Oh, right!

437
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,820
To write songs... I did go to Mt. Odae to write songs.

438
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,440
I left pretty recently.

439
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,780
Yesterday, I think?

440
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,600
I see.

441
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,030
Since we'll be living together, I can just call you "Big Brother," right?

442
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,750
Pardon?

443
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,050
I know Confucian philosophy is irrelevant these days, but—

444
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,250
I suppose you don't want me to.

445
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,290
I do. Sounds good.

446
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,710
Feel free to call me "Bro."

447
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,720
Really?

448
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,210
You should start talking to me casually, then.

449
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,740
How could I—

450
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,230
Just call me "Lee Chan" like I'm your younger brother.

451
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,080
Say "Lee Chan." Come on.

452
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,970
Lee...

453
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,580
- Chan. 
 - Yes, Bro.

454
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,920
Did you call me?

455
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,820
We need to get off at this stop, Bro.

456
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,510
Let's go.

457
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:56,590
By the way, where are we going right now?

458
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,440
So, who's this supposed to be?

459
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,750
Chuncheon's son. Genius guitarist Yoon Dong Jin.

460
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,710
I said I'll bring him here.

461
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,650
It was around last fall...

462
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,560
when we went to Chuncheon University of Education's festival.

463
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,460
And he finally came up on the stage.

464
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,550
Along with the bright halo.

465
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,050
Oh, my gosh.

466
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,790
Thanks.

467
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,130
He didn't need a band.

468
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,090
He could've covered the drums, bass, and melody with just a guitar.

469
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,970
Hyeon Yool, your greeting is too long. Why don't we start practicing—

470
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,920
Since I was so excited to see him, I...

471
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,530
even went to the bathhouse last night.

472
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,610
Without knowing I'd get pooped on like this.

473
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,460
What are you talking about? Just say it directly—

474
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,860
How could I say it more directly, you asshole?

475
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,340
This bastard. This bastard isn't Yoon Dong Jin.

476
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,760
What are you talking about? He's not Yoon Dong Jin?

477
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Why are you so happy? Is your brain made out of udon noodles?

478
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,620
Bro, speak for yourself.

479
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,060
Oh, me?

480
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,280
You were definitely standing at the meeting spot with the school newspaper

481
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,890
and you knew very well about our boarding house, me, and yourself—

482
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,210
A little too well...

483
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,250
Way too well...

484
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,360
Do you get it?

485
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,580
They call this "scamming" in the industry, you bastard.

486
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,030
You're all dead.

487
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,130
You're dead if I see you again.

488
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,390
Don't stick out from now on.

489
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:44,930
Damn, I should've known better when you wanted to start a band because of Choi Se Kyeong.

490
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,110
   

491
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,770
So you're not Yoon Dong Jin?

492
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:03,300
So, you started a band because of a woman?

493
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,700
- Shit! Who are you? 
 - Who's Choi Se Kyeong?

494
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,070
Are you crazy?

495
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,030
How dare you scam me, trying to ruin my life?

496
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,300
Are you crazy, Dad?

497
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,020
Delinquent at age 18?

498
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,170
What am I, Handel?

499
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,170
Why do you keep calling me "Dad"?

500
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,850
Handel is the mother of music. Bach is the father.

501
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,010
You're supposed to like Yoon Cheong Ah.

502
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,740
Who's Yoon Cheong Ah?

503
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,720
   

504
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,390
It's Frida Kahlo.

505
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,860
I love this painting, too.

506
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,940
You're always wearing the headphones.

507
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,730
Yes, those.

508
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,040
Why are you always wearing them? You can't hear.

509
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,080
I didn't mean it like that at all.

510
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,120
I'm sorry.

511
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,980
You listen to the beat.

512
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,170
Are you into rock bands?

513
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,450
 Are you into rock bands? 

514
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,100
I see. That's so neat.

515
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,420
 Do you like that boy? 

516
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,890
That boy?

517
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,710
Who?

518
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,890
You saw it.

519
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,750
Do I like him?

520
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,620
No. Not at all.

521
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,290
 But I find him funny. 

522
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,040
 It's like reading a comic book. 

523
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,640
 He makes me curious about what'll happen next. 

524
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,520
Hey, Yoon Cheong Ah.

525
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,910
Right, you can't hear.

526
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,880
Gosh, how annoying.

527
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,520
   

528
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,020
Lee Mi Ra.

529
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,370
Is this really your painting?

530
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,950
Yes.

531
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,160
The art teacher brought it over.

532
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,150
He said you keep copying Choeng Ah's paintings.

533
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,380
Why don't you tell me yourself?

534
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,100
Whose is original, and whose is a copy?

535
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,860
This is unfair, sir.

536
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,020
What is?

537
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,800
Why do you only ask me, but not her?

538
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,900
You already think I copied hers.

539
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,030
You'd better stop crying. You don't have the right to cry.

540
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:56,980
Good thing we found out before entering the contest. How embarrassing for the school.

541
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,790
Anyway, you can't enter the contest. Just know that.

542
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,220
No, sir.

543
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,670
Please let me enter.

544
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,260
I need more awards to go to college.

545
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,540
No, we can't submit controversial works to contests.

546
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,780
That's the rule.

547
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,270
What are you doing? Take it with you.

548
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,520
See? What did I tell you?

549
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,600
I said you can't fool the homeroom teacher.

550
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,240
Shut your mouth.

551
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,780
What a bitch.

552
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:53,130
She shouldn't ruin my future if she won't even enter the competition.

553
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:56,470
I'm sure she told the chairman about me.

554
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,970
Yoon Cheong Ah isn't submitting her work?

555
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,220
Why not?

556
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,290
She says she's not satisfied with her work.

557
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,690
She thinks she's an artist or something.

558
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,860
I guess her stepmom is the chairman of the school.

559
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,350
She can't be scared of teachers or worried about going to college.

560
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,450
She got into our school through a special admission, too.

561
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,270
Special admission for the disabled.

562
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,190
You scared me. What's with her?

563
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,890
- My gosh. Seriously. 
 - What's she doing?

564
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:31,010
Go ahead and freak out.

565
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,420
Hey!

566
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,080
My gosh!

567
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,890
Hey!

568
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,150
 Let go! Stop! 

569
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,640
Mom was his first love?

570
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,770
She was the only woman for him?

571
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,610
Yet he started a band because of another woman?

572
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,890
I'm disappointed.

573
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,300
So disappointed.

574
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,100
I'll wake up if it's a dream. I'll go back to the real world right now.

575
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,740
But how do I go back?

576
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,740
   

577
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,710
How strange.

578
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,170
It's definitely this place.

579
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,730
   

580
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,760
Hello. Looking for something?

581
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,940
How long have you been running the used books store here?

582
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,730
It's been about 10 years.

583
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,850
Why do you ask?

584
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,100
Don't you know an instrument shop called La Vida Music, then?

585
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,770
La Vida?

586
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,020
I don't know. I've never heard that name.

587
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,390
If it's not here, I'm sure it's around here.

588
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,530
Please think about it one more time.

589
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:18,450
I've been here for a long time. I've never heard of an instrument shop with that name.

590
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,130
Is that so?

591
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,550
Sorry to bother you, then.

592
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,150
No, not at all.

593
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,860
Okay. Bye.

594
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,110
 Could that door be the portal for time travel? 

595
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,740
 If that door is the passage that connects past and present, 

596
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,160
 the moment I go out this door, 

597
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,750
 I might go back to the year 2023. 

598
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,000
   

599
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,080
Why is it the same?

600
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,550
Why is it still 1995?

601
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,850
Maybe this isn't right. Maybe it only opens at night.

602
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,620
What if...

603
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,250
I can no longer go back home?

604
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,530
No.

605
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,270
I'm sure there's a way.

606
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,050
Let's find the way. Let's find...

607
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,860
 Don't lose this. 

608
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,400
 Then you'll be in trouble. 

609
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,690
   

610
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,980
Oh, she's done already?

611
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,860
I'm sorry. The Wi-Fi isn't working.

612
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,420
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

613
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,490
 The number you dialed does not exist. 

614
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,100
 Please check and dial again. 

615
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,080
 The number you dialed does not exist... 

616
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,100
 Please check and dial... 

617
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,420
I'm hungry.

618
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,100
 The rest, later. 

619
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,190
Yes, come again.

620
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,640
I'll have three servings of tteokbokki and one of each fried veggie.

621
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,570
Just one second.

622
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,960
You take 50,000 won bills. Right?

623
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,350
I don't accept gift cards.

624
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:20,020
It's not a gift card. It's cash...

625
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,080
 They're big. 

626
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,680
 They're big. 

627
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,780
 They're bigger than the bills I have. No way... 

628
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,750
Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation didn't start printing 50,000 won bills yet?

629
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,130
What the hell are you talking about?

630
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,810
So, do you want it or not?

631
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,570
Master, you...

632
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,680
You're dead if I see you again.

633
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,390
You're dead if I see you again.

634
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,520
What are the odds that I ran into a scammer like that?

635
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,360
Shit.

636
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,880
Geez...

637
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,400
I'm home, Grandma.

638
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,010
Hey, you're home.

639
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,660
Yes.

640
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,440
Why are you coming alone?

641
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,310
Where's the customer?

642
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,650
- The customer? 
 - Yes.

643
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,750
What customer?

644
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,630
The one from Chuncheon University of Education or whatever...

645
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:40,100
Anyway, you said you'd get free lessons from him for providing food and lodging.

646
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,140
I decided not to take lessons from him.

647
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,010
- Why not? 
 - Grandma...

648
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,660
I met him, and he's obviously a scammer.

649
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,960
Why? Did he look mean?

650
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,480
Yes. He looked so...

651
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,470
nice. He's definitely considered handsome.

652
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,830
But what is it, then?

653
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,820
What? Did he look dumb?

654
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,130
Yes, he was so...

655
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,590
 I was surprised you were much more handsome than I thought. 

656
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,000
...smart-looking.

657
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,030
I don't know who his parents are, but he's very smart-looking.

658
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,260
Why didn't you bring him here, then?

659
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,810
Goodness. You just don't want to study!

660
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,470
It's not like that.

661
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,520
You don't even know anything.

662
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,090
Gosh, seriously.

663
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,290
Geez.

664
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,960
Gosh, I thought he made a good decision for once.

665
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,480
Hey.

666
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,770
So you parted ways immediately?

667
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,100
What else, then? Have a shoot-out or something?

668
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,850
You should've called me sooner, then.

669
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:48,230
I did grocery shopping and cooked all day, thinking you were bringing a tutor.

670
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:51,360
What's so great about him that you'd feed him, too?

671
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,550
Grandma is talking to you. How dare you talk back like that?

672
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:59,040
You said he was coming all the way from Chuncheon.

673
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,110
I was going to treat him properly since he showed effort.

674
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,880
Is this how I raised you?

675
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,800
No. I'm sorry.

676
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,240
Take a shower and come out to eat.

677
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,460
He must've been tired from taking a train here. It would've been nice to feed him.

678
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,680
You're such a rude bastard.

679
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,060
He's not a kid. Do you think he'd be starving?

680
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,630
 E-Excuse me. 

681
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:33,350
 - Yes? 
 - I lost my wallet. I have no money. 

682
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,600
I wonder if he ate.

683
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,680
He looked kind of tired.

684
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,490
I mean...

685
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,920
Who cares if he starves or not?

686
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,100
He's a lowdown scammer

687
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,800
and complete strangers who don't share a drop of blood.

688
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,650
One, two...

689
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,750
Okay. Nice.

690
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,440
1999.

691
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,190
   

692
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:10,020
1992. Nice.

693
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,420
Gosh, I feel alive.

694
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,810
Mom,

695
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,060
Dad kicked me out.

696
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,010
Mom,

697
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,330
I'm tired.

698
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,030
Mom,

699
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:51,230
I want to eat your soybean stew.

700
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,220
Mom...

701
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,200
Mom.

702
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,530
Yes, Mom.

703
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,850
Why didn't I think of looking for her?

704
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:06,320
Mom and Dad are the same age.

705
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,180
As long as I find her school...

706
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,180
 How come you don't have a yearbook, Mom? 

707
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,990
 They all disappeared after it flooded a long time ago. 

708
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,900
 How about photos of Grandma and Grandpa? 

709
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,150
 Don't you have any other family members? 

710
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,450
 No. 

711
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,830
 I'm basically an orphan. 

712
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,080
 The rest of it is a secret. 

713
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,480
 I'll tell you when you grow up a bit more. 

714
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,250
 Okay. 

715
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,060
 I know... 

716
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,760
 nothing. 

717
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,300
   

718
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,920
 I know a lot less about my parents than I thought. 

719
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,720
 I thought I already knew. 

720
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,430
 So I didn't try to find out more. 

721
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:31,320
 I stopped being curious at some point. 

722
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,980
Cover yourself with it.

723
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,660
You'll freeze to death.

724
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,500
 I was always concerned about myself more. 

725
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,730
 I always cared about my issues the most. 

726
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,070
 That's why I didn't know... 

727
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:41,100
 that Dad became deaf and mute after birth 

728
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,340
 and the reason why Mom said she's basically an orphan. 

729
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:58,040
 And the fact that Mom and Dad  

730
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,600
  used to be called something other than "Mom and Dad." 

731
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,360
- Hello? 
 - Hi. Hello, hello.

732
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,300
Are you enjoying your trip?

733
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,440
What are you, exactly?

734
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,480
Why are you doing this to me, anyway?

735
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,140
Gosh, I guess you're not enjoying your trip so much.

736
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,180
What's the reason you sent me here, anyway?

737
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,570
Well? You probably should find that out yourself.

738
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:16,620
Mister!

739
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,310
What?

740
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,190
H-How do I go back, then?

741
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,780
How can I go back?

742
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:28,280
I don't know. You should figure that out yourself, too.

743
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,470
Just give me a hint or something, then.

744
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,550
Tell me the theme of this world, the rules, or the missions.

745
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:37,220
The boys of the 21st century are into that kind of stuff.

746
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,970
Just enjoy for now, sir.

747
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,940
 Trips are supposed to be fun. 

748
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:44,220
Viva la vida.

749
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,070
I'll call you again when it's time.

750
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,430
Adios, then.  (Bye in Spanish) 

751
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,750
Hello? Hello?

752
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,000
Don't hang up.

753
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,040
Don't hang up. Don't hang up!

754
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,160
Please!

755
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,690
I'm supposed to find out the reason...

756
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:32,130
I came here and...

757
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,780
how to go back, too?

758
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,250
That means...

759
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:45,000
I can't go back for a while.

760
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:54,480
   

761
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:59,200
   

762
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,630
   

763
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,360
It's all over.

764
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:13,240
It's all over? What do you mean?

765
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,480
Yoon Dong Jin just published a post that says we're scammers.

766
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,900
What?

767
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,360
Hey, that wasn't a scam. It was a misunderstanding.

768
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,220
That's what you think.

769
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,330
Hey, let's go to him immediately.

770
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:31,300
Let's apologize properly, explain everything, and recruit him officially.

771
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,700
It's too late.

772
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,360
An indie band from Hongik University recruited him immediately.

773
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,280
It's game over.

774
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:47,200
Let's post a public apology and post another ad for a member—

775
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,820
He even warned people not to get scammed if we post another ad.

776
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,290
Wow, it's as eloquent as the Appeal to Subjugate Huang Chao. 
  (Chinese imperial officer, Gao Pian, and Chinese rebel, Huang Chao, wrote letters back and forth trying to trick the other to submit) 

777
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,500
People are going crazy for it.

778
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,130
Our...

779
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,160
band is already done.

780
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,290
Let's give up, Lee Chan.

781
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:15,770
It's a beautiful thing to know when it's time to leave.

782
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,090
You think Se Kyeong knows, too?

783
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,180
Know what?

784
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,780
That our band is done for.

785
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,290
Gosh, I'm sure she does.

786
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:25,690
People bet on whether the band will be a success or not. Why wouldn't she?

787
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,340
Where are you going?

788
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,730
I need to tell her the truth.

789
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,780
I'm sure she'll understand, too.

790
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,220
Will a week be enough?

791
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,160
To heal your broken heart?

792
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,630
No. To recruit a new member.

793
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:43,740
What?

794
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,330
I'll tell Se Kyeong that we'll start again

795
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,630
so she shouldn't worry about the rumors and wait.

796
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:53,220
Continue to print the flyer for a new member.

797
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,220
Fighting! Ha Lee Chan, Fighting!

798
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,680
I can't stand him. Seriously.

799
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:07,860
Oh, my god!

800
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,370
I'm...

801
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:12,590
so sorry about yesterday.

802
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,030
Wait! Could I join instead?

803
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,970
I wonder what you're talking about.

804
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:25,030
I meant the band. I'm a pretty good guitarist, actually.

805
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,410
You provide free food and lodging, right?

806
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:31,930
Could I stay at the boarding house instead of Yoon Dong Jin, by chance?

807
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:35,510
My gosh, your skin must be made out of steel.

808
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:37,240
I can't stay for long, either.

809
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,330
- Until I figure out how to go back— 
 - Geez.

810
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:42,760
Do you know what I went through because of you?

811
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,050
Excuse me, could you—

812
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:46,480
Other bands think we're scammers

813
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,010
and I've lost credit with Se Kyeong.

814
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,530
If only you didn't scam us that day,

815
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:55,160
if only you didn't follow me, none of this crap would've happened.

816
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,660
You know that?

817
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,490
- Well, I'll make sure to— 
 - Shit.

818
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:01,580
You'd better hide from now on.

819
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,310
If I see even your hair, you're dead.

820
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,090
- Don't be like that. Please— 
 - Don't follow me.

821
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:12,020
Don't follow me, I said.

822
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,680
I...

823
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,820
have no place to go.

824
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,890
Geez!

825
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:25,330
H-Hold on a moment. Please.

826
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:30,860
Hold on, hold on! Seriously...

827
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,520
Se Kyeong.

828
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:37,670
Did you hear the rumor?

829
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,930
The rumor? What rumor?

830
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:41,580
The boy who made a bet with you.

831
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,080
Ha Lee Chan, the psycho from Baegwang High.

832
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,330
What about him?

833
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,900
He's been causing trouble trying to start a band,

834
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,700
and he totally got destroyed this time.

835
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,550
I'm glad it ended sooner than I thought.

836
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,860
I know.

837
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:59,640
What's this? A love letter?

838
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,360
What? This is a ticket for Ji Hwan's band's show.

839
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,200
Is this for me?

840
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,970
I'm sorry, but...

841
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,470
it's not for you.

842
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,830
Where's mine, then?

843
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:19,520
Who will you give that to?

844
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,940
 I'm kind of disappointed about the new story. 

845
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,730
 I was hoping for a twist. It's disappointing. 

846
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,880
The bastard's like a wet leaf.

847
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,950
I can't seem to get him off me.

848
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:57,020
   

849
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:03,620
Ha Lee Chan?

850
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,850
Wow, Yong Joon Gi.

851
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,540
Hey, damn!

852
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,600
Do you go to this school?

853
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,080
Yes. By the way, what happened? Is your...

854
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,490
Is your band really over?

855
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,030
I made a bet. I'm about to lose all of it—

856
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:18,420
Ha Lee Chan!

857
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:21,040
What's going on?

858
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,190
I love you, Joon Gi.

859
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:25,640
No, our relationship isn't like that, Lee Chan.

860
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,450
No, Lee Chan. Hold on.

861
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:29,980
Thank you for your hard work.

862
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,870
Yes, okay.

863
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,400
Hey, hold on.

864
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:37,170
- Hold on. 
 - Lee Chan.

865
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,100
- Come on. Come on. 
 - Ha Lee Chan!

866
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,700
- Talk to me for a second. 
 - About what?

867
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,650
   

868
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,170
Okay.

869
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,870
Hey, could you pass the ball?

870
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,170
The left hand...

871
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,840
- only supports— 
 - He's Baegwang High's Ha Lee Chan.

872
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,300
Who's that? Is he a basketball player?

873
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,130
I feel like I've heard of that name—

874
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:11,720
Gosh.

875
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,680
Damn it.

876
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,360
Come here! Stop right there!

877
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,730
Why are you so fast?

878
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,480
Hey!

879
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,570
 Geez, where did that bastard go? 

880
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:37,650
 Gosh, did he go that way? 

881
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,700
 Is he in here? 

882
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:53,090
 Shit. 

883
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:07,850
 Where's that coming from? 

884
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:10,360
 I definitely heard something here. 

885
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:16,870
Geez, why won't he come out?

886
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:41,170


887
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:45,370
Please stay like this.

888
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:49,960
I'll make sure to return the favor before I die.

889
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:55,460
♫  It's a new beginning, I breathe out  ♫

890
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,270
Ahjumma?

891
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:59,810
♫  A moment I've been waiting for  ♫

892
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,330
Ahjumma?

893
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,670
Gosh, it's really Ahjumma.

894
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:09,420
I never would've thought I'd meet you here. Really.

895
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,620
♫  Don't look back, you won't have any regrets  ♫

896
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,060
♫  No need to hesitate  ♫

897
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:23,330
♫  This chance won't come again, so let's begin  ♫

898
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,890
♫  The days that shone so bright  ♫

899
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:30,550
♫  All our full dreams (shining, shining) just like now  ♫

900
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:34,820
♫  Don't stop here like this, right now  ♫

901
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,310
♫  Run without looking back  ♫

902
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:43,720
♫  So you can dream again, higher, higher, fly higher  ♫

903
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,770
♫  I hope this moment lasts forever  ♫

904
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:52,350
♫  People are talking  ♫

905
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:57,210
   

906
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,840
 I thought life was supposed to twinkle like that. 

907
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,390
 She was the reason you wanted to start a band? 

908
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,170
 At least before I met this jerk. 

909
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:07,820
 I was immature for wanting to start a band because I was in love. 

910
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,500
 I leave to study abroad next week. Keep it a secret for now. 

911
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,220
 Why? Because of Ha Lee Chan of Baegwang High? 

912
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:17,490
 What happened to Dad when he was 18, anyway? 

913
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:18,980
 Do you even want to start a band? 

914
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:21,300
 You just want to get girls' attention. 

915
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,210
 I told you. He goes to Chuncheon University. 

916
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:25,580
 I-I am a tutor.
