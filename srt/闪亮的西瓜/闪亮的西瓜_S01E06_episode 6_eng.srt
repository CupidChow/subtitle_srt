1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:11,220


2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,650
   

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,900
   

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,520
   

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,080
   

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,200
   

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,000
   

8
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,080
   

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,700
What's nanshinjeokja?

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,530
"Nanshin" means servants that disrupt the country.

11
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,040
"Jeokja" means someone who will point a knife at their parents. 
    

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,720
That's what nanshinjeokja means.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,940
 Hi. I wonder if you know who I am. 

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,420
 I don't know if this letter will reach you, 

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,160
 but I'll try writing anyway. 

16
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,590
 Where should I begin? 

17
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,010
   

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,580
 There's no sound in the world I live in. 

19
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,180
 So if I close my eyes, the world disappears. 

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,190
 Instead, I only remember this very old memory vividly. 

21
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,190
 Someone's hands that called my name instead of their voice. 

22
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,750
 Cheong Ah. 

23
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,570
 Clear. 

24
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,600
 Sound. 

25
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,410
 Mom. 

26
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,460
 I like you. 

27
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,460
 I love you. 

28
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,770
 I had a name then. 

29
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,050
 I could smile, too. 

30
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,720
 But... 

31
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,800
 Cheong Ah. Cheong Ah. 

32
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,640
   

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,500
   

34
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,770
 Cheong Ah! 

35
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,210
 You're Cheong Ah. 

36
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,560
 I'm the resident teacher who will educate you starting today. 

37
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,220
 That damn evil lady. 

38
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,200
 A witch who came to ruin my life. 

39
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,610
 Pa. 

40
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,350
 Pa. 

41
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,490
 Pa! 

42
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,510
 All I had left was anger then. 

43
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,360
 Because I lost the language to express myself and my feelings. 

44
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,480
 Hello. 

45
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,880
 So embarrassing! I'm so embarrassed! 

46
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,060
 - Hey! 
 - Gosh, I'm sorry. 

47
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:58,180
 The day I first saw you, I was able to laugh my heart out. 

48
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,550
 The day I saw you for the second time, 

49
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,970
 I felt my heart beating for the first time. 

50
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,210
 I'm giving you this free of charge. 

51
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,790
 Thank you. 

52
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,080
 You got three vanillas, right? 

53
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,300
 Starting from the third time, I went to see you myself. 

54
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,870
 Really? You have a beautiful heart, too. 

55
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,050
 My heart is also... 

56
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,210
 I'm sure you didn't notice. 

57
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,410
 Have a good day. 

58
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,050
 Bye. 

59
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,090
 I also... 

60
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,520
 am in a band! 

61
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,900
 Choi Se Kyeong. 

62
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,630
 Want to come to my band's concert later? 

63
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,990
 If I didn't lend Se Kyeong that T-shirt... 

64
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,040
 My school is having a festival in a month. 

65
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,920
 I'll prepare a performance just for you. Make sure to come. 

66
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,310
 ...would I be standing in front of you now? 

67
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,140
 I closed my eyes again. 

68
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,300
 Because I wanted the world to disappear. 

69
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,210
 But... 

70
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,330
 you somehow always show up whenever I'm trapped somewhere. 

71
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,210
 I'm sorry I bit your hand. 

72
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,200
 I'm sorry I was mean to you. 

73
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,450
 Send me an SOS if you need help. 

74
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,740
 I'm out now, then. 

75
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,200
   

76
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,820
 I didn't do that because I hated you. 

77
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,740
 To be honest... 

78
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,550
 I wanted to say thank you. 

79
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,500
 I wanted to thank you for helping and discovering me. 

80
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,450
 That's why I went to see you. 

81
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,760
 I wanted to express how I feel somehow. But... 

82
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,420
Se Kyeong.

83
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,160
Hi. Long time no see, Lee Chan.

84
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,800
 But... 

85
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,540
 I think I'm too late this time, too. 

86
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,380
   

87
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,580
Wait, Se Kyeong. Wait just a moment. Wait.

88
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,980
What's with you?

89
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,200
I don't know what you're asking because your question is too short.

90
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,810
You said you came back to die.

91
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,310
You said you were still deciding if you should die or not.

92
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,720
You told me not to tell anyone unless I want to die.

93
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,280
You disappeared after threatening me like that.

94
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,100
What's the reason you showed up here yourself?

95
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,960
Oh, my goodness.

96
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,900
The question was that long?

97
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,820
Of course. I'm not bad at understanding—

98
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,510
Stop changing the subject and answer.

99
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,840
It's because of you.

100
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,990
What?

101
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,840
Why are you pretending you didn't hear me? You did.

102
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,310
Because of you, I said.

103
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,250
Hey. Hey!

104
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,690
Hold on.

105
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,990
Right. She can't hear me.

106
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,530
I didn't do it.

107
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,680
I, um...

108
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,780
Hold on.

109
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,040
   

110
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,060
Because of me?

111
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,590
What do you mean?

112
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,390
It stopped raining.

113
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,550
Answer me. I asked you, what do you mean?

114
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,220
You scared me. Why are you yelling at me?

115
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,300
You told me I wasn't supposed to return.

116
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,150
I was curious what would happen if I didn't listen to you, so I came back. Happy?

117
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,920
Do you look down on Lee Chan that much?

118
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,920
You're not just jumping to conclusion. You're provoking me.

119
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,500
When did I say I look down on him?

120
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,240
You're saying you'd toy with his heart out of curiosity right now.

121
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,420
You said you wanted to die. But you want to have fun, too?

122
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,420
Am I not supposed to have fun?

123
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,080
- What? 
 - Or...

124
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,780
are you telling me to decide quickly if I'll die or not?

125
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,030
- That's not what I'm saying— 
 - If not,

126
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:39,050
are you telling me to shut up and die quietly since I'll die anyway?

127
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,350
Don't worry.

128
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,600
I'll disappear for you when the time comes.

129
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,920
Are you really the Choi Se Kyeong I know?

130
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,740
 Se Kyeong! Choi Se Kyeong! 

131
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,020
I am Choi Se Kyeong according to him.

132
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,270
I'm sorry. I made you wait too long.

133
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,880
Not at all. I'm sorry I showed up without notice.

134
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,860
Lee Chan, can we talk for a second?

135
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,630
I-I'll tell the manager real quick and come back.

136
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,770
Sir.

137
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,430
Aren't you leaving?

138
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:22,180
You won't be childish and butt in or anything. Right?

139
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,480
I heard you left to study abroad. What brings you here...

140
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,690
Do I...

141
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,420
So this is what you looked like, Lee Chan.

142
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,420
You're way more handsome than I thought.

143
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,660
A-Are you here to mock me?

144
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,190
No way. The flight is too expensive for that.

145
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,010
I just had a bit of a situation.

146
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,640
What situation?

147
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,390
It seems like no one knows you're back.

148
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,330
Of course not. I came back yesterday.

149
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,430
So far, only you know that I'm back.

150
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,830
Are you back for good?

151
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,290
I don't know. I'm still deciding that.

152
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,310
Why did you come to see me then?

153
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,200
You left without saying a word before.

154
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,390
I wanted to apologize.

155
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,980
I feel guilty that I've been rude to you.

156
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,020
I'm sorry I looked down on you even though I didn't know much about you.

157
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,790
I apologize.

158
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,790
And...

159
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,470
I'd like to learn about you from now on.

160
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,520
Of course, I'll take the bet seriously, too.

161
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,490
Seriously, why isn't he coming?

162
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,030
What did she say? Why did she come?

163
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,690
Why did she come to see you, anyway?

164
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,440
Have you...

165
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,000
been in a relationship?

166
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,550
- A relationship? 
 - Yes.

167
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,990
Well...

168
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,000
of course...

169
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,650
It's okay. I already got your answer.

170
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,400
Your eyes were shaking like crazy.

171
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,300
Poor bastard.

172
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,320
You're a fool who doesn't even know what love is.

173
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,390
You've never been in a relationship. How could you understand

174
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,000
the complex conversation I had with Se Kyeong.

175
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,520
- So she told me— 
 - Forget it.

176
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,260
I'm not curious at all.

177
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,960
Try saying another word.

178
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,260
Hey, boy. Ask me politely one more time.

179
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,050
I might give you the answer.

180
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,730
I know you're actually curious. Okay? Come on.

181
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,770
   

182
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,480
I'm not interested.

183
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,810
I'm not interested at all.

184
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,570
 Ha Lee Chan! 

185
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:18,170
Se Kyeong was standing in front of me with her new haircut.

186
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,150
My heart started getting excited first.

187
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,670
I'm serious. I'm serious. I'm serious.

188
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,120
What else can I do? I had to fall in love again.

189
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,090
Hey, hey, hey. So, who does she look like again?

190
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,530
Lee Young Ae?

191
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,520
She used to. Now she looks like Ko So Young.

192
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,520
She used to seep in subtly like an electrolyte drink before.

193
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,250
But now she's like...

194
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,190
a soda that shocks you from within.

195
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,850
What a crazy analogy. Seriously.

196
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,910
Come close.

197
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,580
How could I hold onto Se Kyeong more securely?

198
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,690
Hey, you already have her.

199
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,820
- Really? 
 - Listen carefully.

200
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,130
Women have veins in their hair.

201
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,130
Blood runs through it.

202
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,790
But she cut it short?

203
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,190
It means she cut off her veins.

204
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,690
She's crying bloody tears.

205
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,480
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

206
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,570
What do you mean, why? Because of you!

207
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,590
My gosh.

208
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,350
- Because of me? 
 - You said she showed up on her own.

209
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,190
- Yes. 
 - And she apologized for being rude.

210
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,220
She said she wants to get to know you

211
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,150
and she'll take the bet seriously, too. What does that all mean?

212
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,520
I don't know. What does it mean?

213
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,530
She realized how precious you are after leaving.

214
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,330
She regretted that she let go of you.

215
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,690
She cried bloody tears, regretting.

216
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,030
And she suddenly finds you handsome?

217
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,180
She was blinded by love. That's it.

218
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,190
- That's it. 
 - Game over.

219
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,320
What do I do, guys?

220
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,470
I can't handle my charm anymore, either.

221
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,740
 Hey, hey, hey! Ha Lee Chan! 

222
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,350
 Ha Lee Chan! 

223
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,560
He really came up with a line straight out of a trot song?

224
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,300
When she was like that?

225
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,580
 Open it. He left this to you. 

226
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,480
But that's how Ahjumma was.

227
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,930
Are they really the same person?

228
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,830
What was she thinking...

229
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,760
 I came to die. 

230
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,450
 To die. 

231
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,340
 To end everything. 

232
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,760
 Don't worry. 

233
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,750
 I'll disappear for you when the time comes. 

234
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,800
She can't...

235
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,420
actually be thinking of dying. Right?

236
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,460
Hey.

237
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,860
What are you doing here?

238
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,880
How did you know where I live?

239
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,730
I've been here with Lee Chan before.

240
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,010
Don't you remember?

241
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,180
Did you?

242
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,750
Lee Chan really is worse than dirt under your toenail.

243
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,250
Whatever. I asked you why you came here.

244
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,380
Forget it. I guess you won't die for a while.

245
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,020
Are you here because you were worried about me?

246
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,610
You're more angelic than I thought.

247
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:52,270
If you threaten people as a hobby, you'll grow up to be a scammer.

248
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,280
You have a lot of potential. So watch out from now on.

249
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,100
You seem to have a lot of potential, too.

250
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,700
Is that so?

251
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,710
Should I try using it more?

252
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,810
Don't show up in front of Lee Chan ever again.

253
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,900
This is my final warning.

254
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,250
   

255
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,680
Hey, where do you think you're going?

256
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,330
I'll borrow it for a second. I'm sorry!

257
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,340
Is he out of his mind? Hey, stop! That's my skateboard!

258
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,120
Move! Out of the way!

259
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:25,950
   

260
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,580
Welcome, Frontman.

261
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,410
We've been waiting for you.

262
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,520
Are you ready to enjoy our first practice together?

263
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,140
You're ready to burn the stage down. Right?

264
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,910
Everybody, make some noise.

265
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,870
 We are ready! 

266
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,930
Come on, brothers.

267
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,360
You're out of your mind. You're late to our first practice?

268
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,730
Did you ride the skateboard here, by chance?

269
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,100
Be late again if you want to live without front teeth forever.

270
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,560
You could've gotten injured on this. You should've just been late.

271
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,340
I made it clear.

272
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,910
You can't be too careful if you want to stay as the frontman.

273
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,660
I made it clear that you should be careful this year.

274
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,200
Hey, could you come to an agreement if you want to freak out at me?

275
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,760
Come on, come on. There's no time to goof around.

276
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,010
I created a tracklist. Have a look.

277
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,830
There are four songs, including the encore songs.

278
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,800
We voted for these songs. No objections. Right?

279
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,090
Okay. We have a tracklist, and our T-shirt is being designed, too.

280
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:56,080
Okay. Shall we start our first practice, then?

281
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,880
- Frontman. 
 - Why, Manager?

282
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,680
What are you doing? Aren't you going to practice?

283
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:38,220
Okay. We'll start our first practice as Fake First Love Memory-Makers.

284
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:46,240
One. Two. One. Two. Three. Four.

Didn't we do pretty well today?

300
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,330
Yes. It wasn't too bad, considering it was our first ensemble.

301
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,280
We can practice the other songs to death before the festival.

302
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,400
But the final song is the issue.

303
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,070
What about the final song?

304
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,790
It's a difficult song to master quickly. I blame you-know-who.

305
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,360
Hey, if I grind my bones into it—

306
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,760
You'll go to the mausoleum, then.

307
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,660
It's risky. Way too risky.

308
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,680
- We should change it as soon as possible— 
 - No!

309
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,770
It's the song Se Kyeong chose herself.

310
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,020
We can never change it.

311
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,940
What an idiot. You don't even know she's trying to sabotage you.

312
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,120
What are you talking about?

313
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,130
Why do you think she chose that song?

314
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,010
Because she likes Kurt Cobain.

315
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,930
Because she wants to hear me sing it.

316
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,530
You've got to be kidding.

317
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,500
She chose a difficult song to screw you over.

318
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,660
Please give up.

319
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,160
If you can't, get humiliated on the stage.

320
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,680
Se Kyeong isn't like that. Okay?

321
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,220
Hey, relax, relax, relax, relax.

322
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,430
I do admire your spirit.

323
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,630
Hey, you're the only one who doesn't know.

324
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,290
Everyone knows in the whole Mapo area's school district.

325
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,840
That's enough. Okay?

326
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,740
The frontman doesn't want to change it.

327
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,240
He wants to try his best.

328
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,430
Just trust him and follow his lead, please!

329
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,110
Geez, okay, okay. We'll go for it even though we'll fail.

330
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,730
Is something going on over there?

331
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,850
Why are they so noisy?

332
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,570
 Take your helmet off. 

333
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,140
 Who did you want to meet? 

334
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,310
 Who did you want to meet? 

335
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,410
 Take your helmet off. 

336
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,490
 Could it be? No way. 

337
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,820
 Take your helmet off. 

338
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,070
 Are you here to see someone? 

339
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:43,850
 No way. Not after I warned her like that. 

340
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,480
 It didn't work at all. 

341
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,240
Lee Chan, hi.

342
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,840
S-Se Kyeong, what are you doing at this crummy place?

343
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,860
I went to the ice cream shop, but I heard you're doing band practice today.

344
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,490
So I came to cheer for you.

345
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,240
Can you guess what I brought?

346
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,930
Ta-da. How does a theme park sound?

347
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,490
Hey, you didn't have to do this.

348
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,850
I got your tickets, too. Want to go?

349
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,410
- Yes, yes, yes. 
 - Yes, yes.

350
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,650
I'm okay.

351
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,400
Yes. I didn't get yours because I knew.

352
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,750
Yes, you can go home. You look so tired today.

353
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,970
Fine. I'll leave.

354
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,790
Se Kyeong, I'm so good at riding Viking.

355
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,960
I can stand and roll forward, too.

356
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,780
Should I do a backflip, too?

357
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,520
- Wow, really? 
 - Do what?

358
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,810
I can lift the front wheel on the scooter.

359
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,830
- Lift what on the scooter? 
 - Want a ride? Let's go.

360
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,190
No!

361
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:10,150
♫  It's a new beginning, I breathe out  ♫

362
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:15,030
♫  A moment I've been waiting for  ♫

363
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:21,370
♫  Erase the times that have already passed  ♫

364
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,150
Hey, I can't go because of you!

365
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,900
Move! Why are you blocking me?

366
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,730
♫  Don't look back, you won't have any regrets  ♫

367
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,210
♫  No need to hesitate  ♫

368
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,250
♫  This chance won't come again  ♫

369
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,610
Se Kyeong, are you back there?

370
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,930
My gosh! You scared me.

371
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,610
- Where are you going? 
 - Se Kyeong, help me.

372
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,690
- Hey. 
 - No, no, no.

373
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,180
Ha Lee Chan!

374
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,660
Calm down.

375
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,350
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

376
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,740
♫  So you can dream again, higher, higher, fly higher  ♫

377
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,760
♫  I hope this moment lasts forever  ♫

378
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,670
♫  The days that shone so bright  ♫

379
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,870
♫  All our full dreams (shining, shining) just like now  ♫

380
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,720
♫  Don't stop here like this, right now  ♫

381
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,440
♫  Run without looking back  ♫

382
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,110
I'll take one.

383
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,560
Thank you. Bark, bark.

384
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,150
Hold on.

385
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,180
I want to be next to Lee Chan.

386
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,970
Come here, Se Kyeong.

387
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,160
♫  I hope this moment lasts forever  ♫

388
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,010
Follow me. Follow me.

389
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,750
Do you need anything else, Se Kyeong?

390
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,940
Do you have enough to drink? How about skewered chicken or buttered squid?

391
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,970
No, this is plenty. It's okay.

392
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,590
By the way, where did the napkin I put here go?

393
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,570
I think it got on here.

394
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:54,270
Napkin. I'll go get it right now. Just wait a second.

395
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,800
It'll take 13 seconds.

396
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,970
So cute. 13 seconds. Okay?

397
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:02,160
13. 12. 11.

398
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,990
- Let go. 
 - Let go.

399
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,430
No, you let go.

400
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,590
Take it, then.

401
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,000
Oops, I'm so sorry.

402
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,480
Just wait 13 seconds. He'll be here soon.

403
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,550
It was definitely on purpose.

404
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,570
She had plenty of ketchup.

405
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,020
She didn't have to squeeze it so hard.

406
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,460
I should've known when she was giving up so easily.

407
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,710
Gosh, seriously.

408
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:51,200
   

409
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,060
What's with you?

410
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,970
I don't know what you're asking because your question is too short.

411
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:01,050
Wow, you learn so quickly.

412
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,690
Why are you so over-protective of Lee Chan?

413
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,640
You're so passionate about it, even though you're ruining a healthy friendship.

414
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,900
I'm trying to prevent an unhealthy romantic relationship.

415
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,210
I'm trying to guide him to the right path.

416
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,410
- What gives you the right? 
 - Me?

417
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,110
I'm Lee Chan's tutor.

418
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,220
It's my responsibility to send him to college.

419
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,790
I'm thinking of removing everything that disrupts his studies. That includes you.

420
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,220
People call you nosy sometimes, don't they?

421
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,970
They usually call me responsible.

422
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,260
Forget it. I'm leaving.

423
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,340
I know you faced struggles...

424
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,270
and I understand you want to be unruly out of spite,

425
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,060
but stop toying with an innocent person.

426
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,260
I beg you.

427
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:51,450
Who told you that I toy with people?

428
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,350
I know you don't even like Lee Chan.

429
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,460
People change their minds all the time.

430
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,800
Just give up. You two aren't meant to be, anyway.

431
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,400
He belongs with someone else.

432
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,230
Who's that?

433
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,790
There's someone. You don't have to know.

434
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:10,610
 I want Dad to be much happier than he is now. 

435
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:14,350
 Someone who cherishes and loves him more than anyone. 

436
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,600
Even if I told you,

437
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,740
you wouldn't believe me.

438
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,500
It's you, isn't it?

439
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,600
You like Lee Chan, don't you?

440
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,760
Huh? What are you talking about—

441
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,400
Come on. It's okay. I'm open-minded.

442
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,410
I have no prejudice against stuff like that.

443
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,880
You're open-minded about what—

444
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,240
Don't worry.

445
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,870
I won't tell anyone. Instead...

446
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,650
we'll play it fair.

447
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,020
Fighting.

448
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,600
Hey. I said it's not like that. Hey!

449
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,470
- Wow, so that's what it was. 
 - It's not like that. Okay?

450
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,110
- Okay. 
 - Se Kyeong.

451
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,360
Where were you?

452
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,920
I looked for you everywhere.

453
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,960
No!

454
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,300
   

455
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,740
 Se Kyeong! 

456
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,500
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

457
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,060
Gosh, seriously! Come on!

458
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,100
I want to talk to you for a second.

459
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,690
What's wrong with you, anyway?

460
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,910
You almost got injured.

461
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,770
You should've been more careful.

462
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,170
Are you my nanny? Are you Astroganger?

463
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:49,950
Do you get all energized when something happens to someone somewhere?

464
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:53,000
You have so much energy that you can't handle it?

465
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,030
Let's get going now. It's almost time for our tutoring.

466
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,730
I'm not going!

467
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,870
You should be helping me. Why do you have to sabotage me all the time?

468
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,870
Why?

469
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,370
- Can't you just do as I say? 
 - Do what?

470
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,350
Why I'm doing this.

471
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:13,840
Don't ask me why, and can't you just listen to me?

472
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,970
It's just for a year.

473
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,130
Not for the rest of your life, but just a year.

474
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,800
I'm asking you to be where I can see you just for a year. Can't you even do that?

475
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,390
No, guys.

476
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,350
So that's what was going on.

477
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,320
I had a feeling.

478
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,300
I didn't know it was like that.

479
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,800
Let's just respect their preference and pretend we didn't see what we saw.

480
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,470
No.

481
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,050
No!

482
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,340
Se Kyeong!

483
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,330
No, it's not like that.

484
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,610
It's okay. I didn't see anything.

485
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,840
It really isn't like that.

486
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,760
Hey, you. We'll finish this off later.

487
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,780
 Se Kyeong. Se Kyeong. 

488
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,490
   
   

489
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,560
It's getting late.

490
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,540
I want to take you home.

491
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,450
It's a short ride on the scooter.

492
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,500
I want to give you a ride, too,

493
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,540
but I promised someone a fair game. So I have no choice.

494
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,210
Okay. Page me as soon as you get home, then.

495
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,840
I gave you my number earlier. Right?

496
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,270
Okay. I'll page you as soon as I get home.

497
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,920
I had so much fun, thanks to you.

498
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,970
See you next time. Bye.

499
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,010
 Bye. 

500
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,580
Let's go.

501
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,480
Keep a 3-meter distance from me.

502
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,370
Wait for me.

503
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,590
It's not like that.

504
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,650
Huh?

505
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,100
Lee Chan and I aren't like that.

506
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,940
I don't like Lee Chan. Well...

507
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,020
Not that I hate him.

508
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,210
I do like him,

509
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,940
but it's not like what you think...

510
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,680
How should I say this...

511
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,470
Anyway, Lee Chan and I can never be in a relationship like that.

512
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,680
I see. That's how it is.

513
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,620
Okay.

514
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,830
I know it looks strange.

515
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,080
But the reason I act strange

516
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,060
isn't because of Lee Chan.

517
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,910
Really?

518
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,480
What's the reason, then?

519
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,290
To be honest,

520
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,910
I have a secret I can't tell anyone about.

521
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,800
A secret? What secret?

522
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,350
I can't tell you that. Because I can't talk about it.

523
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,420
By chance, do you...

524
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,870
Do you like me, by chance?

525
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,630
- What? 
 - It all makes sense.

526
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,440
You interfere, sabotage, and get aggressive whenever I'm with Lee Chan.

527
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,220
I'm sure it's out of jealousy.

528
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,620
But you're saying it's not Lee Chan.

529
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,000
That means you like me, then.

530
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,990
This is when you say, "Out of the frying pan into the fire," right?

531
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,840
Goodbye.

532
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,350
Just be honest.

533
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:31,070
Is it me or Lee Chan?

534
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:52,170
D-Don't be mistaken and think everyone in the world likes you.

535
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,810
I'm not mistaken.

536
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,230
Everyone likes me.

537
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,030
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.

538
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,250
That punk. It's so fun to tease him.

539
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,670
Get it together.

540
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,500
Please, get it together.

541
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,760
Please!

542
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,540
You scared me!

543
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,770
I'm worried about Se Kyeong because she is alone.

544
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,190
G-Give me your pager.

545
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,160
I-I'm confiscating it until the tutoring ends.

546
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,540
My gosh.

547
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,510
There's Se Kyeong.

548
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,350
Se Kyeong.

549
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,530
Se Kyeong.

550
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,550
Is this your home phone number?

551
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,020
I'll save it in my heart.

552
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,300
No. I'm just happy you got home safely.

553
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,190
Hang up while I'm asking you nicely.

554
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,870
The tutoring session hasn't ended yet.

555
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,520
Huh?

556
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,750
That noise just now?

557
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,720
It's nothing. A fly is buzzing around.

558
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,040
Fly? Give it to me.

559
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,050
- Give me! 
 - Se Kyeong.

560
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,520
I'll go kill that fly.

561
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,270
Se Kyeong, I killed it. Sorry for making you wait.

562
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,190
Even my dad never hit me. Come here!

563
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,340
Come here.

564
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,030
There are more bugs than I thought.

565
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,930
I'll kill it real quick...

566
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,620
Don't call me a bug! Give it!

567
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,780
I killed it. I killed it.

568
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,000
You want to change the final song? What do you mean?

569
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,580
The final song is your mission song, too. Would that be okay?

570
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,100
Of course, it's okay.

571
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,990
Se Kyeong told me to change it.

572
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,590
Why all of a sudden?

573
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:59,390
To be honest, I asked her on the phone last night.

574
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,370
I asked her if she was really trying to sabotage me with that song.

575
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,710
I said that's what you guys think.

576
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,300
And?

577
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,680
 Change it, then. 

578
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,290
 You don't have to play American pop songs only because you're a band. 

579
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:17,800
 Korean pop might dominate the Billboard charts and enter the global market someday. 

580
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,310
 You should be leading trends, too. 

581
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,410
Wow, she thinks big now that she's been to the US.

582
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,240
I'm on board. I'm definitely on board.

583
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,700
Me, too. That song would've been too hard for us anyway.

584
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,210
I'm on board, too, then.

585
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:33,200
I'm against it.

586
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,510
What are you all doing right now?

587
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,170
The festival is less than a month away.

588
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,540
I would've been against it even if we had plenty of time.

589
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,810
We're changing the song just because of what she said?

590
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:46,380
Why not? The one who's betting wants me to change it.

591
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,200
What if she changes her mind?

592
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,100
- We'll make changes based on her whims? 
 - Of course.

593
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,150
She gave up on her studies abroad and came back for me.

594
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,790
I'll do whatever she wants me to do.

595
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,740
I'll keep my promise to her with my life on the line.

596
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,490
Is your promise to me in the trash, then?

597
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,250
Gosh, you scared me.

598
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,550
What promise did I make to you?

599
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,000
Okay.

600
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,870
I'll leave, then.

601
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,550
I can just do that.

602
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,350
Hey, hey, hey.

603
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:21,560
Wow, he's acting superior because he's a good guitarist.

604
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,540
If the word "petty" took on a human form, it'd look like him.

605
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,320
What are you doing? Go follow him.

606
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,760
Go to him right now.

607
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,910
Stop right there while I'm asking nicely.

608
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,820
Hey! Seriously...

609
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,820
The mood got ruined because of you.

610
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,960
Everyone's happy about it. Why are you flipping out?

611
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,920
Is the band a joke to you?

612
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,220
Is it just for seducing a woman?

613
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,920
Someone...

614
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,420
broke his parents' hearts because he wanted to join a band.

615
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,670
Dang it...

616
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,930
We're just changing a song. Why bring up breaking parents' hearts?

617
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:59,660
You let her sweet talk you and fiddle around like a fiddle stick.

618
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,920
You don't even remember our promise, do you?

619
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,470
You don't care if other people get hurt except Choi Se Kyeong. Right?

620
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:10,310
Whatever. Just tell me. Will you stay in the band or not?

621
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,610
Okay.

622
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,470
Let's forget it.

623
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,600
I'm getting tired now, too.

624
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,100
I shouldn't care what happens to you.

625
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,130
Let's just forget it.

626
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,300
Don't do anything you'd regret.

627
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,900
I won't take you back if you leave like this.

628
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,140
That includes the band and the boarding house!

629
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,260
Hey! You're rejected everywhere!

630
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,430
Water and oil don't mix.

631
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,880
You scared me.

632
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,580
What a greasy bastard. He never even dated anyone.

633
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,070
He's going through late puberty now.

634
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,750
Why are you alone? Where's Ha Eun Gyeol?

635
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,810
Whatever. Let's just practice.

636
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,310
He'll come back once his juvenile angst goes away.

637
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:58,750
He must think that, but no way. I'll never go back.

638
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,920
   

639
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,780
Young man.

640
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,250
You're the good son who wanted to buy your father a guitar. Right?

641
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,710
Hello.

642
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:11,020
I got a guitar that meets your requirements perfectly.

643
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,920
Have a look and take it if you like it.

644
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,940
I'll sell it to you for whatever price you want.

645
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,600
No, I don't need it anymore.

646
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,080
Well, then...

647
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,060
   

648
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,030
He had a fight.

649
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,710
He had a fight with his father.

650
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:31,810
   

651
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:37,440
   

652
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,740
 Thank you. 

653
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,440
 Get tasty food for yourself. 

654
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,630
 I'm sorry I left without a word, Grandma. 

655
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:08,210
 But... 

656
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,180
 you know, Grandma... 

657
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:15,850
 I just can't stand how immature Dad is. 

658
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,110
I'm home.

659
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,030
Why are you alone? Where's your tutor?

660
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,830
That guy's not home yet?

661
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:43,230
Listen to yourself! How rude!

662
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:45,280
How dare you call your teacher "that guy"?

663
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,490
Is your teacher the dog next door?

664
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,630
You make me sad if you keep talking like that.

665
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,260
People might think I'm the servant of this house

666
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,910
and he's your grandson or something.

667
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:57,180
So I'm asking why you're coming home alone.

668
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,440
He went to school to see you earlier today. Didn't you see him?

669
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,050
I did see him at school, but...

670
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:08,170
He went to Chuncheon. He had business to attend to.

671
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,620
I can put these in the drawer. Right?

672
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,300
Make it tidy. Don't make a mess.

673
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,310
Okay.

674
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,840
Oh, right. Hey.

675
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,450
I found this while doing the laundry. Is this yours?

676
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,510
Someone dropped it.

677
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,910
You should give it back, then.

678
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,730
You shouldn't have let it touch soapy water.

679
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:31,420
It's fine. I can't even talk to her. It's a hassle.

680
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,720
He's too young to be so lazy.

681
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:38,020
I was thinking of roasting a chicken with ginseng.

682
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,770
Is he coming back tomorrow?

683
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:52,390
He's in the late stage of the Eight Grade Syndrome.

684
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,980
You took your bag, too?

685
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,230
Are you really angry?

686
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,480
Do as you like.

687
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,250
You're the one suffering for leaving home.

688
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,390
It's nice to have the room to myself.

689
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,460
 You don't care if other people get hurt except Choi Se Kyeong. Right? 

690
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,280
How dare he act superior?

691
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,550
Just try coming back home.

692
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,960
So spacious.

693
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:44,410
Young man. Young man. Wake up.

694
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:46,360
Young man!

695
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,930
You can't sleep in front of a store like this.

696
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,730
Did you run away from home by chance?

697
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,890
Do I have to report you?

698
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,580
No.

699
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,710
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

700
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:10,260
   

701
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:15,490
   

702
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,670
   
   

703
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,650
Hello?

704
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:40,730
 Bonsoir. 

705
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,810
Did you figure out why you ended up there, sir?

706
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,530
No.

707
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:50,330
I don't care why. Everything is such a mess.

708
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,960
Dad is smitten with his first love

709
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,760
 and I have no idea where Mom is. 

710
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,470
 People have a funny idea about me, and I had a huge fight with Dad. 

711
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:59,220
Nothing seems to be working out.

712
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,980
Goodness, oh, no, that's too bad.

713
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:05,860
I don't care about the mission. I want to go home.

714
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:10,030
I miss my real dad, not the immature Ha Lee Chan.

715
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,570
 I miss Mom... 

716
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:14,160
and Eun Ho, too.

717
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,050
So, please. Please. Please let me go home. Please?

718
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:20,500
I don't know what to say.

719
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,640
The portal for time travel won't open for a while.

720
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,200
When does it open, then?

721
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,810
- You'll find out in time— 
  - Will you really be like this? 

722
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,650
You threw me back in the past without a plan.

723
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:35,090
Will you keep acting irresponsibly like this?

724
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,670
If you go back now,

725
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:42,130
the year 2023 will be a lot different than when you left it.

726
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,230
Do you still want to go back?

727
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,140
What...

728
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,900
are you talking about?

729
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,940
Gosh, I guess you didn't know.

730
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:56,890
Everything started changing the moment you arrived here.

731
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,820
   

732
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,910
 Wait! Excuse me. 

733
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,530
   

734
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:16,250
 Yoon Dong Jin? 

735
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,770
 - It's you. 
 - No! It's true! 

736
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:26,700
 It's true. I'm Yoon Dong Jin. 

737
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,370
 I don't think so. 

738
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:29,770
 What would make you believe me? 

739
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:32,690
 The moment you played someone else's role, 

740
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:36,430
 history has already started changing little by little. 

741
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:41,280
 The fates of people you met probably changed as well. 

742
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,400
 You told me I wasn't supposed to return. 

743
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,220
 I was curious what would happen if I didn't listen to you, so I came back. Happy? 

744
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,920
By chance...

745
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:55,300
Dad's first love suddenly came back and

746
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:59,020
the relationship that should've ended reconnected.

747
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,870
Are those the variables that I caused?

748
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:06,670
I'm not sure. A variable creates another variable, too. Yes.

749
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,510
Stop pretending to be a shaman

750
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,600
 and give me some kind of hint! 

751
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,660
 A way to fix this situation, a way to prevent dad's accident, 

752
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,380
or a way to find Mom.

753
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,240
Give me something, please!

754
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,530
Huh? I already gave you all the hints, then.

755
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:21,800
What hints? What do you mean?

756
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,230
Give it a thought. We'll talk again later.

757
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:31,240
- Goodbye. 
 - Hold on. Hold on.

758
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,020
Hello? Hello? Gosh...

759
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,690
He gave me all the hints, then?

760
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,420
Could it be this?

761
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,070
   

762
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,540
Hold on.

763
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,130
 April 29th is... 

764
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,130
 tomorrow. 

765
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:23,220
 Can I find some kind of a clue if I go there? 

766
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,180
Since it's the first electric guitar released by Jinsung Instruments,

767
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,030
Father is very excited about it.

768
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:32,100
Since I came here as Chairman's proxy,

769
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,870
today's event has to be a success no matter what.

770
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:37,490
Everything is going as planned. Right?

771
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:41,520
Well, there's a bit of a problem.

772
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,750
A problem?

773
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:46,860
The weather forecast says there will be torrential rain with thunderstorms in the afternoon.

774
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:50,050
We can have a press meeting and indoor event as planned

775
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:53,140
and put the outdoor event on hold for now.

776
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,140
What are you talking about?

777
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,090
We have to make a spectacle for the unveiling.

778
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:00,580
Don't you know people lose interest if you postpone?

779
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,800
It's true, but there's even a heavy rain warning—

780
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,920
I heard the contestants we invited are mostly in their 20s.

781
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,260
What's the point of being young?

782
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,520
It's okay to get rained on a bit.

783
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,080
Let's just go as planned. Okay?

784
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,300
Hand out raincoats to the audience.

785
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,280
If there were any accidents, the chairman would be—

786
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,830
Are you...

787
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:24,810
ignoring what I said?

788
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,960
Don't you know who I am?

789
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,670
I'm the heir of this company.

790
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,610
My words are the chairman's words.

791
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:35,510
Go ahead and follow through unless you want to get fired.

792
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:44,350
 Mic check. One more time. 

793
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:48,140
 Mic check. One, two. One. One. 

794
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:52,310
 One, two. One, two. 

795
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,750
That's so amazing.

796
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:10,050
   

797
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,770
If I win the audition,

798
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:17,540
I get their new guitar?

799
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,060
- Are you No. 10? 
 - Sorry?

800
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,410
No, this was—

801
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:25,100
The waiting room is this way. Follow me.

802
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:39,000
Why is she so mopey all the time? She's like scallion kimchi.

803
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,400
She almost caught pneumonia because she got rained on recently.

804
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,140
Yoon Sang Ah hates it. She said she was playing a victim.

805
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,830
Gosh, she's pulling all the stunts.

806
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,510
Gosh, they don't match.

807
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:49,950
Come on, they do match.

808
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,140
- You look pretty. Stop. 
 - It's okay.

809
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:55,760
Guys, there will be a special lecture on respecting lives instead of the final assembly today.

810
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,410
Head to the auditorium now.

811
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,790
Are you serious right now?

812
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:03,030
What auditorium? Shouldn't we go home?

813
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,640
Don't we have to tell her?

814
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,940
She can't hear even if we told her.

815
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,770
She has eyes. She'll see us go.

816
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:10,010
Let's go, let's go.

817
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,310
 Mom. 

818
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,340
 I'm sick. 

819
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,260
   

820
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:51,000
 You're lying. 

821
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:54,220
 You left me. 

822
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,950
 You left me behind. 

823
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,390
Hi.

824
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:19,810
 - I keep...  
 - Have you been well?

825
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,120
 hallucinating. 

826
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:25,510
Oh, this is yours. Right?

827
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,940
I'm sorry about last time.

828
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,230
   

829
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,660
 You're supposed to like Yoon Cheong Ah, Dad. 

830
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:38,480
 Who's Yoon Cheong Ah? 

831
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,180
What? Are you that Yoon Cheong Ah?

832
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,610
What? What's wrong with you?

833
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,230
Are you okay?

834
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,990
This is no good.

835
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,400
   

836
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,980
I'll give you a piggyback ride for a second.

837
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,520
   

838
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:37,110
Yes, thank you, Contestant No. 9.

839
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:41,490
Now, the last but not least, Contestant No. 10.

840
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:45,050
We're finally welcoming the last contestant.

841
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,690
I think it'll start pouring soon.

842
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,660
It won't be too late to stop now.

843
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:05,470
This is supposed to be the last contestant.

844
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:07,390
Just continue.

845
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,490
Call the ambulance. Right now!

846
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:41,500
Excuse me! Excuse me! Are you okay?

847
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,350
So funny.

848
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,700
What?

849
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:33,330
   

850
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:44,560


851
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:50,130
Please move. A patient coming through. Please move.

852
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:53,160
Please move. A patient coming through.

853
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,100
 Dad. 

854
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,010
Excuse me! Where's the ER?

855
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,430
What happened to her?

856
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:00,820
She lost consciousness. Hurry!

857
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,760
Come this way. What's her name?

858
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,280
Yoon Cheong Ah.

859
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:11,760
♫  We could have been together  ♫

860
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,490
 Mom. 

861
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:22,500
♫  Go all the way around a distance, at the end of this road  ♫

862
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:28,620
♫  I sing a love song  ♫

863
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:35,610
♫  These shining moments  ♫

864
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:40,030
   

865
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:50,580
♫  Our small dreams  ♫

866
01:00:50,580 --> 01:01:02,250
♫  I'll protect you until then, so you don't let go  ♫

867
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:12,090
   

868
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,870
 We're friends from now on. 

869
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,860
 Yoon Cheong Ah. 

870
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,170
 He called my name. 

871
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:20,880
 By the way, where's your other half? 

872
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,170
 He ran away from home. He has nowhere to go. 

873
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:25,020
 Where's Eun Gyeol? Isn't he coming with you? 

874
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:27,300
 I don't know. Feel free to look for him if you want. 

875
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,210
 I'm looking for a person. Please take one. 

876
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:31,180
 Ha Eun Gyeol is the only main guitarist in our band. 

877
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:32,380
 I'll find him no matter what. 

878
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:34,860
 I'll find Ha Eun Gyeol and confirm myself. 

879
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,990
 Mom. Dad. I want to go home. 

880
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:42,290
 I'm doing very well. Don't ever contact me again.
