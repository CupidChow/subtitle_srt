00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:39,412
So, I needed the recorder to get his confession...

00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:44,682
Based on his response, I was going to judge him on the spot.

10
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,842

00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:25,212
And they recruited me, so I was playing as the very first star player for the Skin-nation.

183
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:29,832
Wow, I thought you'd be still playing Seotda* in Korea.
(Type of game played with Hwatu)

184
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:31,472
I didn't know I'd get to play Hold'em here.

185
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:33,922
Don't say that elsewhere.

186
00:14:33,922 --> 00:14:36,232
They'll call you LA country bumpkin.

187
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:45,532
It's hot.

188
00:14:45,532 --> 00:14:46,692
Did you play your trick?

189
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:49,302
They say it'll go up to 38 degrees Celsius tonight.

190
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:50,632
Yes.

191
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:54,902
Check.

192
00:14:56,692 --> 00:14:57,742
10 million won.

193
00:14:57,742 --> 00:15:00,902
- I'll die.
- I'm going to die of this heat.

194
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:03,372
- Call.
- It's an ominous night.

195
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:04,672
Call.

196
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:07,382
All right, all right.

197
00:15:07,382 --> 00:15:09,142
- 20 million won.
- Call.

198
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,762
Call.

199
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:14,622
10 million won.

200
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,052
- Call.
- Raise you 50 mil. more.

201
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:20,742
Call.

202
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:25,092
Geez, whatever!

203
00:15:26,322 --> 00:15:27,592
All in.

204
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:30,102
All in. Call.

205
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:38,242
Call.

206
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,342
I'm the best!

207
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:03,432
There.

208
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:07,652
What the f*** is this situation?

209
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:13,802
That's how I declared my independence and challenged him.

210
00:16:16,452 --> 00:16:20,532
One who loses here today can't play in Seoul for a year.

211
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:21,682
How about it?

212
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:26,052
You're so excited since you came close to stabbing me in the back.

213
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:27,732
Raise.

214
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:29,612
- 10 million won more.
- Nah...

215
00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:31,632
You said gambling is all about momentum.

216
00:16:31,632 --> 00:16:34,652
- Raise 25 mil.
- That's right. It's momentum.

217
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:36,842
Call.

218
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:48,922
You have a cosmetics company and much more.

219
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:52,192
Why don't you let me take over the gambling scene?

220
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:53,372
35 million won.

221
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:56,652
Take that whiny trash talk to your mommy.

222
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:59,762
Oh, you don't have a mommy.

223
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:01,392
No, I don't.

224
00:17:03,862 --> 00:17:05,852
What a crazy psycho.

225
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:08,802
Call.

226
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:15,072
- Check.
- Don't play around.

227
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:16,612
Check.

228
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:19,812
5 million won.

229
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:25,222
You raised 35 mil. earlier, right?

230
00:17:25,222 --> 00:17:28,392
Me, too. 35 million won.

231
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:35,142
All in.

232
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:42,812
What's that look in your eyes?

233
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,252
You can't be...

234
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,502
scared, are you?

235
00:17:47,222 --> 00:17:48,572
Scared?

236
00:17:48,572 --> 00:17:51,002
You must be scared.

237
00:17:58,462 --> 00:18:00,762
You don't even have anything in your hand.

238
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,802
Why are you betting so hard?

239
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:05,792
Nah...

240
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:09,052
Must I have something to win?

241
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:28,702
Call.

242
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:44,322
How did you notice?

243
00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:46,462
I noticed your pattern.

244
00:18:55,832 --> 00:18:58,842
So, why bite the hand that feeds you?

245
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:05,112
I'll go without the anesthesia.

246
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:06,612
Let me go!

247
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:11,402
I learned gambling from him.

248
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:14,232
So he knows all of my tricks.

249
00:19:14,232 --> 00:19:16,932
But I don't know any of his tricks.

250
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:19,802
That's why he's lucky.

251
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:22,942
The fact that he was born before me.

252
00:19:28,092 --> 00:19:31,592
I'm telling you this because you might be curious.

253
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:34,712
I reattached it.

254
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:44,712
Guard!

255
00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:20,392
Eight of hearts.

256
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:21,682
Four of clovers.

257
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:22,882
Jack of hearts.

258
00:20:22,882 --> 00:20:24,232
Jack of diamonds.

259
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:30,912
Nine of clover.

260
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:29,022
Whoa, you look pretty.

261
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:30,342
Thank you.

262
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:31,592
Not because you were coming here, right?

263
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:34,832
No, I have a blind date.

264
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:36,782
It's still springtime for you.

265
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:38,252
Do you drink wine?

266
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:42,782
There are over 30 Woo Min Ho's around his age in Seoul.

267
00:21:42,782 --> 00:21:44,632
I haven't found him yet.

268
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:48,262
Is it because you're only an inspector?

269
00:21:48,262 --> 00:21:51,372
Should I recruit a superintendent or a sergeant?

270
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:53,622
That's not the problem.

271
00:21:53,622 --> 00:21:56,392
I'm checking one by one by visiting them in person.

272
00:21:56,392 --> 00:21:57,672
But he really can't be found.

273
00:21:57,672 --> 00:22:01,082
When Inspector Kwon took a leave to pursue the investigation,

274
00:22:01,082 --> 00:22:04,222
he went through the alleys behind the Northern Prosecutors' Office a lot.

275
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,832
I already went there.

276
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:08,232
[YB Bank Transaction History: Kwon Dae Il]
You are referring to the convenience shop, right?

277
00:22:08,232 --> 00:22:11,622
Shin Dal Soo's case was not assigned to the Northern District Prosecutors' Office,

278
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,492
but he kept spending money at the convenience store there.

279
00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:17,772
[Restaurant, convenience store, children's clothing, telecommunications]
And if you look at the items he purchased,

280
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:21,582
they were porridge, bentos, cup ramen,

281
00:22:21,582 --> 00:22:23,212
underwear, and toothbrush.

282
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:25,782
And Woo Min Ho.

283
00:22:27,482 --> 00:22:28,772
But Woo Min Ho...

284
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:29,972
That grandmother...

285
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:31,602
Do you know she passed away?

286
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:32,582
Oh, my!

287
00:22:32,582 --> 00:22:34,362
I didn't even say who the grandmother was.

288
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:37,122
But he reacted that way when I mentioned her.

289
00:22:38,552 --> 00:22:41,252
He was deeply frightened.

290
00:22:41,282 --> 00:22:42,812
Why?

291
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:47,152
Because he was an eyewitness?

292
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:50,222
Perhaps Woo Min Ho saw the killing of Shin Dal Soo?

293
00:22:50,222 --> 00:22:53,442
And Inspector Kwon found that out.

294
00:22:54,692 --> 00:22:58,762
Do you understand the reason for my impatience?

295
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:15,402
Dean...

296
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,562
I heard you woke up.

297
00:23:19,662 --> 00:23:21,342
How disappointing.

298
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:28,202
Why?

299
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,472
By chance...

300
00:23:36,412 --> 00:23:40,562
because of the two-on-two with Chairman Yang?

301
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:44,542
As expected of a corporate financial criminal.

302
00:23:52,522 --> 00:23:54,262
Is he...

303
00:23:55,522 --> 00:23:57,722
your successor?

304
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:01,122
Did you decide...

305
00:24:02,352 --> 00:24:05,472
on Kim Yo Han as the next-in-line?

306
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:09,322
Do you know why I call you Nam Dae Moon*?
(A slang for men's pants zipper fly)

307
00:24:10,842 --> 00:24:14,092
Because I wanted you to open and close

308
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:16,292
whenever I needed you to.

309
00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:26,172
But something keeps getting caught in the zipper.

310
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:28,592
Geez...

311
00:24:29,382 --> 00:24:30,882
I'll be done with you.

312
00:24:44,812 --> 00:24:47,162
If you want even the scraps,

313
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:48,642
just stay in bed.

314
00:24:49,962 --> 00:24:51,372
I'm off!

315
00:25:00,062 --> 00:25:02,882
Stacking isn't an easy skill to master.

316
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:25,342
He and I both, I'm sure we'll be stacking each other all night long.

317
00:25:25,342 --> 00:25:28,592
But he'll never guess that you'll be doing the stacking.

318
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,982
I just have to succeed once?

319
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:38,912
Yes, just once...

320
00:25:40,192 --> 00:25:42,512
If we succeed just once,

321
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:50,002
we can beat them tonight.

322
00:25:58,332 --> 00:25:59,492
Are they a cheering squad?

323
00:25:59,492 --> 00:26:01,652
My legal team. Looking good, right?

324
00:26:01,652 --> 00:26:03,872
When I take over this place later,

325
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:05,292
documents need signatures and such.

326
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:06,872
Aigoo...

327
00:26:06,872 --> 00:26:09,202
How many people are here for a signature you'll never get?

328
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:13,112
Come on. You need at least six hunters to catch one wild hog.

329
00:26:13,112 --> 00:26:15,702
Much less, we get to catch you tonight, Sun Oh.

330
00:26:15,702 --> 00:26:17,302
We should have at least this many...

331
00:26:19,272 --> 00:26:23,082
Oh, he's the one with the knife from the other night.

332
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,552
Boy, your face has healed nicely.

333
00:26:31,252 --> 00:26:34,132
But I see a shadow of death on your face.

334
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:37,842
You don't look like you belong here tonight.

335
00:26:40,002 --> 00:26:41,482
You'll get hurt.

336
00:26:42,742 --> 00:26:44,592
Cut it out.

337
00:26:44,592 --> 00:26:46,532
Those lawyers must charge a lot per hour.

338
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:48,482
Let the class begin.

339
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:54,212
Let's go ahead and start.

340
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,832
This is a four-round Hold'em.

341
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:08,892
Each starts with 100 million won in chips.

342
00:27:08,892 --> 00:27:11,352
After an all-in, you are removed.

343
00:27:11,352 --> 00:27:13,742
Blind is 20/50.

344
00:27:13,742 --> 00:27:16,382
Betting is no limit.

345
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:19,542
The last man standing is the winner.

346
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,482
If I win, this place is mine.

347
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:24,352
If you win, I'll say sayonara.

348
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:27,352
But do you really want to do this?

349
00:27:27,352 --> 00:27:29,072
Start.

350
00:27:30,522 --> 00:27:32,212
Let's go then.

351
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:57,642
Call.

352
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,342
You need to watch him from the start.

353
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:01,912
Raise.

354
00:28:01,912 --> 00:28:03,252
1 million won.

355
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:14,062
Raise 3 million.

356
00:28:19,982 --> 00:28:21,432
Call.

357
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:34,482
Hey, bring me some beer.

358
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:38,952
Check if he's stacking.

359
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:47,982
Betting 3 million.

360
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:57,052
Call.

361
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:09,012
It looks like he's stacking.

362
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,462
Betting 5 million.

363
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:21,602
Call.

364
00:29:28,252 --> 00:29:30,172
Full house.

365
00:29:50,682 --> 00:29:52,402
I think Chairman Yang is stacking.

366
00:29:52,402 --> 00:29:54,122
I'm going to fold.

367
00:29:55,832 --> 00:29:57,392
No.

368
00:29:57,392 --> 00:29:58,892
Keep going.

369
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:02,432
We could lose it all in this hand.

370
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:03,852
We could lose 100 million in an instant.

371
00:30:03,852 --> 00:30:05,552
Keep going!

372
00:30:08,342 --> 00:30:10,252
Raise 10 million won!

373
00:30:19,812 --> 00:30:21,262
Betting 10 mil.

374
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,732
Raise.

375
00:30:29,612 --> 00:30:31,172
20 million more.

376
00:30:32,182 --> 00:30:33,602
It's a first round!

377
00:30:34,322 --> 00:30:36,202
What if we get an all-in here?

378
00:30:37,882 --> 00:30:41,152
Avoid the all-in, but make it look like you're a rookie.

379
00:30:49,332 --> 00:30:50,712
Call.

380
00:31:13,942 --> 00:31:16,102
You must be disappointed.

381
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:23,782
Nicely done. We've laid the groundwork.

382
00:31:42,772 --> 00:31:45,482
Look all you want. See if you can see anything.

383
00:32:06,432 --> 00:32:07,422
Call.

384
00:32:07,422 --> 00:32:08,662
Fold.

385
00:32:08,662 --> 00:32:09,982
Raise.

386
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:12,132
2 million.

387
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:16,022
Raise 4 million.

388
00:32:22,102 --> 00:32:23,612
10 million won.

389
00:32:24,682 --> 00:32:26,832
20 million won.

390
00:32:32,732 --> 00:32:34,202
Call.

391
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:37,792
All right...

392
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,242
Flop.

393
00:32:56,802 --> 00:32:58,012
Check.

394
00:32:58,012 --> 00:33:01,322
Bite! Bite!

395
00:33:04,142 --> 00:33:05,372
20 million won.

396
00:33:12,862 --> 00:33:14,152
Call.

397
00:33:19,342 --> 00:33:20,982
Turn.

398
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:22,972
Ta-da!

399
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:26,892
Here's a 9 to make your hand a straight.

400
00:33:26,892 --> 00:33:28,442
It's an invitation.

401
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:32,982
I gave you 7, 8, 9, 10 for a straight. What more is there to think?

402
00:33:32,982 --> 00:33:35,992
Bite the bait.

403
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:46,022
Fine then. Why not have a memorial service for Lee Tae Gwang?

404
00:33:46,022 --> 00:33:47,572
Check.

405
00:33:49,222 --> 00:33:51,112
I told you it was an accident.

406
00:33:51,982 --> 00:33:53,682
50 million won.

407
00:33:57,562 --> 00:34:01,002
The food for the memorial service table is getting cold. Hurry on up.

408
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:04,422
Lee Tae Gwang used to do business in Macau.

409
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:06,902
But he couldn't eat cilantro.

410
00:34:06,902 --> 00:34:09,922
Unlike his appearance, he had a sensitive taste bud.

411
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:15,102
But a guy like that ate food that was laced with Clorox

412
00:34:15,102 --> 00:34:17,822
and his IQ became a single digit.

413
00:34:19,372 --> 00:34:21,532
No...

414
00:34:21,532 --> 00:34:23,492
that means...

415
00:34:23,492 --> 00:34:27,272
someone had forcibly fed the Clorox into his mouth.

416
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:36,792
Is it stacking or bluffing?

417
00:34:38,252 --> 00:34:42,652
If you lose, too, how will you guys survive the night?

418
00:34:44,842 --> 00:34:46,392
Why would I lose?

419
00:34:46,392 --> 00:34:48,262
The river is a heart.

420
00:34:48,262 --> 00:34:52,132
I have a flush. You have a straight.

421
00:34:54,352 --> 00:34:56,302
Come on in already. Hurry.

422
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,972
My back is uncomfortable.

423
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:01,372
Spit out 50 mil. and get lost.

424
00:35:04,842 --> 00:35:06,232
Die.

425
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:09,562
This guy's different.

426
00:35:10,712 --> 00:35:12,482
Show your cards!

427
00:35:20,892 --> 00:35:23,892
Your staff is watching. Let's maintain some manners in this game.

428
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:36,352
Now, those two will have their eyes on me.

429
00:35:36,352 --> 00:35:37,912
Get ready.

430
00:36:20,442 --> 00:36:22,382
Excuse me.

431
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,732
Aigoo, it's a lot.

432
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:45,392
Can I have some coffee?

433
00:36:45,392 --> 00:36:46,902
Yes.

434
00:36:46,902 --> 00:36:49,522
- Coffee?
- No, thank-

435
00:37:00,772 --> 00:37:03,152
When a person gets into the scamming mode,

436
00:37:03,152 --> 00:37:04,972
his body reacts first.

437
00:37:06,442 --> 00:37:08,772
Lips dry up.

438
00:37:10,682 --> 00:37:13,212
You get goosebumps in your arms and neck.

439
00:37:13,212 --> 00:37:15,082
And suddenly eyes become extremely clear

440
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:17,802
and you see everything so sharply like crazy.

441
00:37:31,982 --> 00:37:33,652
It's now!

442
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:59,862
Don't get distracted by others' gazes.

443
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,822
Just because they're looking doesn't mean they see it.

444
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:04,872
Stay calm and feel each card as you shuffle...

445
00:38:04,872 --> 00:38:06,992
Just as we practiced.

446
00:38:37,262 --> 00:38:39,032
We got him!

447
00:38:39,742 --> 00:38:43,652
Your hand movements are too rusty. It's too noisy.

448
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,512
I got you!

449
00:38:49,512 --> 00:38:51,692
Don't move!

450
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:06,642
What are you doing?

451
00:39:06,642 --> 00:39:08,352
I caught your scam.

452
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:13,802
Unbutton your sleeve!

453
00:39:16,662 --> 00:39:19,792
I said unbutton your sleeve.

454
00:39:39,172 --> 00:39:42,032
I thought my eyes were going to pop out all night.

455
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:51,042
That's why you brought out this amateur bastard.*
(He literally says an "unripened animal")

456
00:39:52,042 --> 00:39:54,172
What are you going to do now?

457
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:58,152
Director Jin was caught cheating. Should I cut off a piece of her for you? Or...

458
00:39:58,152 --> 00:40:00,742
take her eyes?

459
00:40:06,272 --> 00:40:08,412
If you mess her up,

460
00:40:08,412 --> 00:40:10,892
I'll call the real police.

461
00:40:12,172 --> 00:40:14,422
Warden?

462
00:40:14,422 --> 00:40:16,402
You recorded everything, right?

463
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:18,722
Yeah.

464
00:40:24,572 --> 00:40:26,022
This is a prison.

465
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:28,212
There are CCTVs everywhere.

466
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:31,242
Director Jin getting caught while cheating is all recorded.

467
00:40:31,242 --> 00:40:34,992
I'll release the video to the entire country if you report us.

468
00:40:34,992 --> 00:40:39,932
Then how many gambling houses, sites, dens...

469
00:40:39,932 --> 00:40:41,752
do you think will accept you?

470
00:40:42,522 --> 00:40:44,812
You motherf***er...

471
00:40:45,842 --> 00:40:47,022
I'll release Director Jin

472
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:49,712
if you sign a note saying you will never come here again.

473
00:40:50,772 --> 00:40:52,382
Hey, cheering squad!

474
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:54,912
What are you waiting for? Prepare for the signing.

475
00:41:27,892 --> 00:41:29,922
Geez...

476
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:33,212
Spray water in this area later in the morning

477
00:41:33,212 --> 00:41:35,342
and sprinkle some salt.*
(Superstitious act to drive out evil spirits)

478
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:36,772
Yes, sir.

479
00:41:43,402 --> 00:41:48,272
It took me a little over a year.

480
00:41:52,022 --> 00:41:53,432
Doing the stacking.

481
00:41:55,782 --> 00:41:59,202
The best time to scam is when the opponent is scamming.

482
00:41:59,202 --> 00:42:01,662
They are so busy with their own scams that they can't see anything else.

483
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:05,002
Especially that a**hole Yang Joon. Never.

484
00:42:06,092 --> 00:42:08,462
That's why you used me as bait.

485
00:42:11,602 --> 00:42:12,892
Yeah.

486
00:42:14,522 --> 00:42:17,502
There was zero chance you might've gotten hurt, Hyung.

487
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:20,962
If you were going to stack, I knew Director Jin would put a scam on instead of him.

488
00:42:20,962 --> 00:42:23,942
Because he knows that we'd be focused on him, too.

489
00:42:24,832 --> 00:42:28,102
Now, if we get Director Jin, Yang Joon can't do anything.

490
00:42:28,102 --> 00:42:30,102
Director Jin is Chairman Yang's gambling ledger.

491
00:42:30,102 --> 00:42:32,152
A walking human ledger.

492
00:42:35,522 --> 00:42:38,872
It was important to preserve this gambling den earlier,

493
00:42:38,872 --> 00:42:42,552
but it was more important to make him think that you were much inferior to him.

494
00:42:42,552 --> 00:42:46,832
So that you can help me with my vengeance

495
00:42:46,832 --> 00:42:48,602
after you are released.

496
00:42:55,452 --> 00:42:56,732
Are you pissed?

497
00:42:57,382 --> 00:42:58,832
No.

498
00:42:58,832 --> 00:43:00,842
Then, what are you thinking?

499
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:03,342
Going forward,

500
00:43:07,882 --> 00:43:10,082
you have to keep doing it this way.

501
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:14,282
You have to do even better.

502
00:43:14,282 --> 00:43:16,042
Pardon?

503
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:18,872
If you are going to bluff, make sure to do it right.

504
00:43:22,992 --> 00:43:24,412
Make sure?

505
00:43:25,782 --> 00:43:27,372
Aren't you going to get angry?

506
00:43:28,932 --> 00:43:30,862
Shouldn't you get angry?

507
00:43:34,602 --> 00:43:40,212
[One month later]

508
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:03,942
By tomorrow, you'll be outside. What are you looking at?

509
00:44:04,782 --> 00:44:07,452
I want to engrave the view from this perspective in my head.

510
00:44:08,222 --> 00:44:09,652
So that I won't ever forget.

511
00:44:10,462 --> 00:44:12,182
I'll never return.

512
00:44:17,132 --> 00:44:19,502
You really don't want us to prepare anything for tomorrow?

513
00:44:21,022 --> 00:44:25,452
I'll leave quietly as though I was never here.

514
00:44:29,562 --> 00:44:31,112
He's gone.

515
00:45:00,722 --> 00:45:04,562
It always takes time to find a person.

516
00:45:04,562 --> 00:45:06,232
Besides Inspector Park,

517
00:45:06,232 --> 00:45:08,832
I'll assign higher-ranking officers to the case.

518
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:11,102
So let's stay strong.

519
00:45:11,852 --> 00:45:13,312
Yes.

520
00:45:13,312 --> 00:45:15,082
Thank you.

521
00:45:18,162 --> 00:45:20,282
You don't have any injuries anymore.

522
00:45:21,522 --> 00:45:23,432
You must be well-adjusted now.

523
00:45:23,432 --> 00:45:25,802
From the Judicial Training Institute to here.

524
00:45:27,922 --> 00:45:31,382
I felt like the walls of this place would collapse on me if I didn't.

525
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,872
You're quite a talker as well.

526
00:45:35,872 --> 00:45:39,242
Okay, while I'm doing everything to find this kid outside,

527
00:45:39,242 --> 00:45:41,662
what will you do here, Yo Han?

528
00:45:48,932 --> 00:45:50,652
Take over.

529
00:46:00,042 --> 00:46:01,752
What are you doing? Hurry up and find him!

530
00:46:01,752 --> 00:46:03,122
Yes. Hurry up and find him!

531
00:46:03,122 --> 00:46:04,382
Yes, sir!

532
00:46:08,752 --> 00:46:10,172
2345!

533
00:46:12,052 --> 00:46:15,352
Where is Kim Yo Han?

534
00:46:17,212 --> 00:46:19,922
Whatever deal you have with him,

535
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:22,362
I'll give you 20% more.

536
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,332
Come out! Come out!

537
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:25,852
Geez...

538
00:46:29,932 --> 00:46:31,882
Cheosa-nim!*
(A title used when addressing Buddhist believers)

539
00:46:31,882 --> 00:46:33,462
Cheosa-nim!

540
00:46:33,462 --> 00:46:35,392
Kim Yo Han cheosa-nim...

541
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,372
Gosh, no...

542
00:46:37,372 --> 00:46:38,802
Cheosa-nim!

543
00:46:38,802 --> 00:46:40,052
Where did he go?

544
00:46:40,052 --> 00:46:41,942
Gosh, s***...

545
00:46:45,392 --> 00:46:50,252
Please tell me where Kim Yo Han is.

546
00:46:50,252 --> 00:46:51,642
I'm already sold.

547
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,712
I'll offer you more.

548
00:46:55,552 --> 00:46:57,542
But right now...

549
00:46:57,542 --> 00:47:00,202
isn't Kim Yo Han the boss?

550
00:47:01,642 --> 00:47:05,322
He's nothing but a card player.

551
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:11,812
Warden.

552
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:14,902
Everyone in our area decided to follow me.

553
00:47:14,902 --> 00:47:18,652
And I will follow you, Warden.

554
00:47:18,652 --> 00:47:20,102
I am...

555
00:47:21,082 --> 00:47:24,142
different from Jang Sun Oh.

556
00:47:28,032 --> 00:47:31,022
Right now, Kim Yo Han is actually...

557
00:48:07,532 --> 00:48:09,392
You got here faster than I thought.

558
00:48:09,392 --> 00:48:12,592
You also moved faster than I thought.

559
00:48:40,942 --> 00:48:43,162
It's all over.

560
00:48:43,162 --> 00:48:45,352
Now, there is no Jang Sun Oh...

561
00:48:45,352 --> 00:48:47,492
the Security Manager, and Warden's office...

562
00:48:47,492 --> 00:48:51,242
There are no 1st leaguers who will follow you.

563
00:48:54,452 --> 00:48:56,222
I won't kill you.

564
00:48:56,222 --> 00:48:58,342
Just return to the regular cell block.

565
00:48:58,342 --> 00:49:03,482
Go back and spend the rest of your time here quietly

566
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,142
and then leave.

567
00:49:06,522 --> 00:49:08,222
Understand?

568
00:49:10,732 --> 00:49:13,822
From the first day I stepped into the infirmary,

569
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:19,032
what did you see in me that made you suspicious of me?

570
00:49:20,672 --> 00:49:22,322
Your eyes!

571
00:49:22,322 --> 00:49:25,852
Your eyes aren't those of a criminal.

572
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:30,992
Your eyes don't belong to a person with a sense of guilt.

573
00:49:30,992 --> 00:49:32,682
Then it's one of the two cases.

574
00:49:32,682 --> 00:49:34,452
Either you're a psychopath

575
00:49:34,452 --> 00:49:38,432
or you're hiding something big.

576
00:49:41,302 --> 00:49:44,412
What the hell are you hiding?

577
00:49:45,662 --> 00:49:49,342
If I tell you all my secrets and truths,

578
00:49:51,152 --> 00:49:53,972
will you accept me then?

579
00:49:56,382 --> 00:49:58,102
Are you playing with me?

580
00:49:58,102 --> 00:49:59,782
I...

581
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:35,172
I will wait here.

582
00:50:35,172 --> 00:50:37,122
After you settle things in your head,

583
00:50:39,152 --> 00:50:41,022
let's meet again then.

584
00:51:21,132 --> 00:51:23,722
Yes, this is Mok Jin Hyung of Criminal Division.

585
00:51:25,562 --> 00:51:27,372
Is this the Seongju Prison?

586

[Past residences and name change in 1994]

588
00:51:34,462 --> 00:51:36,122
What is...

589
00:51:36,912 --> 00:51:39,562
your relationship with Kim Yo Han?

592
00:51:45,632 --> 00:51:50,732
I asked what your relationship is with Kim Yo Han.

593
00:51:52,852 --> 00:51:54,052
Using the names of the homeless,

594
00:51:54,052 --> 00:51:57,252
she buys assemblymen, the Ministry of Justice, and the police?

595
00:51:57,312 --> 00:51:59,952
If this is exposed, it'll be huge.

596
00:52:02,212 --> 00:52:03,712
I'm hanging up now.

597
00:52:03,712 --> 00:52:06,312
I'm Northern District Prosecutors' Office Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung.

598
00:52:06,312 --> 00:52:08,942
I'm Trainee Kim Yo Han's mentor.

599
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:13,722
Kim Yo Han has a lot of work to do.

600
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:18,022
I'd like to ask that he's not bothered in any way in there.

601
00:52:22,482 --> 00:52:26,192
This girl. She's got layers of charm like peeling onion.

602
00:52:53,312 --> 00:52:55,632
The call you just made.

603
00:52:55,632 --> 00:52:58,502
Please keep it a secret from others.

604
00:53:01,142 --> 00:53:03,172
Chief prosecutor?

605
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,242
The chief prosecutor's got power.

606
00:53:11,252 --> 00:53:15,572
So you think you can't be killed as a suicide in some night?

607
00:53:18,692 --> 00:53:20,332
Forget this prison

608
00:53:20,332 --> 00:53:23,632
and spend your remaining days quietly, then leave.

609
00:53:24,512 --> 00:53:26,732
This is your last chance.

610
00:53:38,242 --> 00:53:39,882
2345.

611
00:54:28,552 --> 00:54:31,002
Why did you follow Jang Sun Oh?

612
00:54:33,992 --> 00:54:36,472
Jang Sun Oh? No way...

613
00:54:36,472 --> 00:54:38,782
I followed the money.

614
00:54:39,742 --> 00:54:42,292
Can't you continue to do that?

615
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,262
What?

616
00:54:45,352 --> 00:54:48,132
I won't...

617
00:54:48,132 --> 00:54:50,002
take my share.

618
00:54:51,042 --> 00:54:53,202
The Dean's share that Jang Sun Oh took.

619
00:54:53,202 --> 00:54:55,502
The half of the house's revenue.

620
00:54:55,502 --> 00:54:58,922
All of it. I'll give it to you and

621
00:54:58,922 --> 00:55:01,262
other 1st leaguers.

622
00:55:01,262 --> 00:55:03,602
I'll share all of it with you all.

623
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,282
What is it that you want?

624
00:55:12,282 --> 00:55:15,452
You. Someone loyal to money to the end.

625
00:56:35,972 --> 00:56:37,622
I found him.

626
00:56:37,622 --> 00:56:39,202
From the immigration record.

627
00:56:39,202 --> 00:56:40,652
Woo Sang Ki.

628
00:56:41,582 --> 00:56:43,252
It's Woo Min Ho's father.

629
00:56:43,252 --> 00:56:47,262
He went to the US on a state scholarship and worked as an investment banker.

630
00:56:47,262 --> 00:56:49,962
He met a Korean-American there, got married, and had a child.

631
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:53,642
Then he got assigned to a Hong Kong branch.

632
00:56:53,642 --> 00:56:55,612
Then he lost his wife.

633
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:58,572
After retirement, he worked as a coin exchange trader

634
00:56:58,572 --> 00:57:00,852
and lived alone with his child.

635
00:57:00,852 --> 00:57:03,212
Last year, he returned to Korea after 15 years.

636
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:05,122
So it's an expired citizen ID number.

637
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:07,492
That's why the police couldn't find him.

638
00:57:07,492 --> 00:57:08,812
Yes.

639
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:12,122
In order to find out the reason for his return,

640
00:57:12,122 --> 00:57:15,402
we have to look into Woo Sang Ki's former employer.

641
00:57:16,172 --> 00:57:18,742
But that's going to take some time.

642
00:57:18,742 --> 00:57:21,822
We are using a lot of people with power,

643
00:57:21,822 --> 00:57:23,172
but it's still going slow.

644
00:57:23,892 --> 00:57:25,192
That power...

645
00:57:25,962 --> 00:57:28,352
how much stronger does it need to be?

646
00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:36,252
Sinseon-dong in here...

647
00:57:37,692 --> 00:57:39,252
Do you know of it?

648
00:57:47,232 --> 00:57:48,812
Are they Beomtul*?
(Literally means tiger fur, but it means felons with ample detention money in prison)

649
00:57:49,562 --> 00:57:53,412
They are pythons.

650
00:57:53,412 --> 00:57:56,952
They are crouched down in the mud right now,

651
00:57:56,952 --> 00:57:59,122
but given a chance to have dragon balls,

652
00:57:59,122 --> 00:58:02,332
they'll transform into dragons and ascend into the sky.

653
00:58:02,332 --> 00:58:05,532
I wonder how powerful these pythons are.

654
00:58:07,862 --> 00:58:10,322
