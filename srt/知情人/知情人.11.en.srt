7
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:32,904
So when you go there that day...

8
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:36,474
the way you teamed up with Jang Sun Oh when you were here,

9
00:00:36,474 --> 00:00:39,534

10
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:41,064
What?

11
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:44,724
Did you think you were the only one working for me?

12
00:00:44,724 --> 00:00:47,154
Jang Sun Oh is also my possession,

13
00:00:47,154 --> 00:00:49,984
who works for me like you.

14
00:00:50,904 --> 00:00:52,494
I will do as you said.

15
00:00:57,574 --> 00:01:00,874
Will you be okay seeing Jang Sun Oh?

16
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:05,494
There'll be only one game table when you get inside the VIP room.

17
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:08,684
<i>In order to enable the VIPs to stay in the room and focus,</i>

18
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:12,894
there are always bartenders, cooks, and security guards there.

19
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:16,224
Staff from each department are always on standby.

20
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:20,214
Our first round of change in clothes can be taken from there.

21
00:02:20,214 --> 00:02:25,814
And I've already transferred the promised deposit of 500 million that the dealer agreed to.

22
00:02:26,874 --> 00:02:31,514
He'll also help you change into the second round of clothes.

23
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:33,154
Good work.

24
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:38,084
Did Chief Prosecutor Mok agree?

25
00:03:12,244 --> 00:03:13,754
What?

26
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:29,324
Are we going to do it here?

27
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:43,524
We haven't met like this in a while, right?

28
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,014
Take a shot.

29
00:03:57,084 --> 00:03:59,134
Three o'clock, seven o'clock, eleven o'clock...

30
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:01,324
Who are these fellas you drag along?

31
00:04:02,444 --> 00:04:04,394
They don't seem like investigators.

32
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:17,084
Part-timers.

33
00:04:19,974 --> 00:04:21,424
Expensive part-timers.

34
00:04:23,984 --> 00:04:28,514
Those fellas have been following you even before you came in here.

35
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:30,074
Did you catch on?

36
00:04:32,244 --> 00:04:34,184
Why didn't you run?

37
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:40,674
Well, really just to

38
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:45,464
have a talk with you.

39
00:04:51,444 --> 00:04:53,274
It's Chief Prosecutor Yoon, isn't it?

40
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:55,164
The one that wants my head.

41
00:04:56,524 --> 00:05:01,064
If it weren't for him, there is no other reason for you to make a move like this.

42
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:04,014
If you rid of me,

43
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:06,904
will he let you stay in Seoul instead of sending you to the Daejeon High Prosecutor's Office?

44
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:14,664
I had my share of dilemmas.

45
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:16,104
For me to figure you out is one thing, but

46
00:05:16,844 --> 00:05:20,714
why is Chief Prosecutor Yoon so eager to get at you?

47
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:22,804
Your life is already in shambles

48
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:26,804
although you were released from prison.

49
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:28,154
Right?

50
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:30,994
Are you interested?

51
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:37,264
Is it a story worth listening to?

52
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:55,224
Mr. Nam* is already at Incheon?

53

I deposited the remaining balance yesterday.

54
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:03,414
Isn't Goldman Casino for foreigners only?

55
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:05,804
The afterparty for The Skin Nation IPO will be held there.

56
00:06:05,804 --> 00:06:09,264
We'll get in without an issue because the party is for local VIPs.

57
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:15,144
Goldman VIP, slush fund, and the

58

Bukyeongpa gang...

59
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:19,624
For a job of this scale,

60
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:26,094
instead of going back to prison if something goes wrong,

61
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,384
you might go in the Incheon sea and never come back out.

62
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:31,414
You don't need to worry about that.

63
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:34,344
If things get even slightly dangerous, withdraw right away.

64
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:37,814
The remaining balance of 300 million won out of 500 million won that Yo Han promised you

65
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,814
will be paid by me for sure.

66
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:44,684
You can swim back out even with one arm for that much money, right?

67
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:55,174
Do you not trust me?

68
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:57,644
No, it's not you that I don't trust...

69
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:01,164
All right. That's that, but...

70
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:03,214
how exactly are you

71
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,864

73
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:16,024
As for Jang Sun Oh...

00:07:57,664 --> 00:08:00,794
You can stay here.

77
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:02,304
It'll be dangerous.

78

Okay.

87

That's what I'll say.

560
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:39,433
Although Director Jin managed the money laundering at the casino,

the one to create a foreign tax haven

562
00:54:42,553 --> 00:54:46,043

Anything is possible there with money and connections.

564
00:54:48,913 --> 00:54:51,773
Woo Sang Ki can make a corporate account with Min Ho's name,

565
00:54:51,773 --> 00:54:54,613
or a personal account with Min Ho's name.

566
00:54:58,593 --> 00:55:00,753
Then, the "Sinkhole" is...

567
00:55:00,753 --> 00:55:04,883
transferring the 300 billion won in Min Ho's corporate account

568
00:55:04,883 --> 00:55:07,793

571
00:55:22,343 --> 00:55:25,083

572
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:29,783
Moving from one corporate account to a personal account under the same name, however,

573
00:55:29,783 --> 00:55:31,373
the bank also suspects nothing much.
