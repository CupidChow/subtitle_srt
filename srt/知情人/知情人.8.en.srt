What are these guys doing here?

363
00:28:39,822 --> 00:28:41,942
Get rid of them!

364

Move it.

365
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:47,922
Move it!

366
00:28:48,822 --> 00:28:51,532
<i>I'll just go to jail!</i>

367
00:28:51,532 --> 00:28:53,082
<i>Geez, come on!</i>

368
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:55,152
Seongju Prison cares about customers' safety.

369
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:57,642
Seoungju Prison will be with you to the end.

370
00:28:57,642 --> 00:28:59,092
For the safe evacuation,

371
00:28:59,092 --> 00:29:02,642

372
00:29:07,682 --> 00:29:08,932
Yeah.

373
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:11,052
What?

374
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:13,622
What are you talking about?

375
00:29:15,282 --> 00:29:17,962
S***! Now you are telling me?

376
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:21,792
What are they doing?

377
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,642
Chief, go in, please.

- Break it down!
<i>- Yes, sir!</i>

Hey! Open!

Out! Out! Hurry!

382
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:01,752
Hey! Burn everything!

383
00:30:01,752 --> 00:30:04,752
What are you doing? That's my lifeline!

384
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:07,092
I have that lifeline, too.

385
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:08,802
Hey! You bastard!

386
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:10,002
Warden!

387
00:30:10,002 --> 00:30:11,662
You have to escape first.

388
00:30:11,662 --> 00:30:13,462
That way, you'll survive

389
00:30:13,462 --> 00:30:15,452
and the house survives, too.

390
00:30:15,452 --> 00:30:17,322
S***!

391
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:25,752
Hey, hey, hey! This way, this way!

392
00:30:25,752 --> 00:30:27,042
Direct the light!

393
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:28,492
- Cut it!
- Okay!

Hurry up!

Hurry!

00:30:31,772 --> 00:30:33,302
Okay, okay. Open it up!

398
00:30:36,482 --> 00:30:38,962
Geez, what the hell are we doing...

399
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,332
Gosh, it's too low!

Hurry!

401
00:30:41,682 --> 00:30:43,462
Hurry! Lower your head!

402
00:30:58,432 --> 00:31:02,192
Chief, bring me the key from that guard at the gate.

403
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:03,692
Bring the key!

404
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:09,622

- Here's more!

Over here!

407
00:31:19,122 --> 00:31:20,752
Don't use your own cars.

408
00:31:20,752 --> 00:31:23,542
Please use the vehicles we've prepared in advance.

409
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:25,402
Which one?

410
00:31:25,402 --> 00:31:27,722
- Which one?
- That one!

411

Come on! Get out!

Hey, break it down!

413
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:38,942
Are you going to be at it all night?

414
00:31:40,262 --> 00:31:41,952
Watch out!

415
00:31:46,652 --> 00:31:47,942
There.

416
00:31:56,312 --> 00:31:57,832
Look around!

417
00:31:57,852 --> 00:32:00,352
Where is everyone?

418
00:32:01,442 --> 00:32:02,282
S***!

419
00:32:02,282 --> 00:32:04,012
Hey! Where?

<i>There's no one here.</i>

00:32:08,932 --> 00:32:10,772
<i>Nothing here.</i>

423
00:32:10,772 --> 00:32:12,772
<i>S***...</i>

424
00:32:50,872 --> 00:32:52,952
What is it?

425
00:33:08,502 --> 00:33:09,872
Hello, how do you do?

426
00:33:09,952 --> 00:33:13,452
I am Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

427
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,062
Yes.

428
00:33:20,452 --> 00:33:22,982
You have an envelope for me?

429
00:33:24,812 --> 00:33:26,882
<i>The envelope you asked me to deliver.
</i>

430
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:29,902
<i>Didn't you hear that I kept it secure from others' hands?
</i>

431
00:33:33,702 --> 00:33:36,282
Even though times may have changed,

432
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:38,992
prosecutors are the same as ever.

433
00:33:42,722 --> 00:33:45,272
What's your dream?

434
00:33:50,022 --> 00:33:51,112
Good health?

435
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,662
Good health. Nice.

436
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:59,292
Do you know what's most important for healthy living?

437
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,772
What you eat.

438
00:34:05,372 --> 00:34:08,592
Before you put the food in your mouth, you have to know by a glance what it is,

439
00:34:08,592 --> 00:34:11,432
so you can enjoy the natural span of life.

440
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:15,852
Your father was able to do that well.

441
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:18,172
That's why he's at where he is now.

442
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:25,502
Will you go and

443
00:34:25,502 --> 00:34:28,672
send my regards to your father?

444
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,092
Now.

445
00:34:36,192 --> 00:34:37,702
Let him in.

446
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:44,542
Boy, here's the Dean.

447
00:34:45,422 --> 00:34:48,342
Like old times, it was a good getaway.

448
00:34:49,392 --> 00:34:51,792
Not too bad, right?

449
00:34:56,082 --> 00:34:58,512
The real top of the class is different.

450
00:35:02,882 --> 00:35:04,852
On the tenth,

451
00:35:06,322 --> 00:35:09,712
did you go outside the prison to receive job training?

452
00:35:14,552 --> 00:35:17,272
I'm getting a certificate in interior architecture.

453
00:35:18,532 --> 00:35:22,722
You didn't ditch your class that day and hang out in Seongjeo-gu?

454
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:24,092
Me?

455
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,682
Do you have proof?

456
00:35:33,402 --> 00:35:37,022
The envelope this man gave you to deliver that day.

457
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:38,572
If you give it to me,

458
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,742
your grandmother's killer...

459
00:35:41,742 --> 00:35:43,922
I'll tell you who it is.

460
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:48,932
Even if you get out of here, do you think you can find the killer?

461
00:35:48,932 --> 00:35:50,692
You'll have a tough time finding a job.

462
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:53,972
Even if you obtained an interior architecture certificate.

463
00:35:53,972 --> 00:35:56,692
Oh, you know you are alone now, right?

464
00:35:56,692 --> 00:35:59,482
Even Chief Prosecutor Mok wrote an apology letter and defected.

465
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:12,342
Love your colleague, love your country.

466
00:36:12,342 --> 00:36:14,162
I'll help you.

467
00:36:14,162 --> 00:36:17,562
Even your gambling in here, I can tack it onto another inmate.

468
00:36:17,562 --> 00:36:20,052
You talk as if you're not guilty.

469
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:23,432
What are you talking about?

470
00:36:33,772 --> 00:36:35,572
As for my grandmother's case,

471
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:37,882
I'll take care of it.

472
00:36:37,882 --> 00:36:39,742
And an envelope?

473
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:43,102
I have no idea what you are talking about.

474
00:37:06,452 --> 00:37:09,102
If I just change the door...

475
00:37:09,952 --> 00:37:11,832
you said you'll make a way?

476
00:37:14,152 --> 00:37:17,272
Then I'm counting on you.

Please take a seat here comfortably.

490
00:38:31,732 --> 00:38:34,262
Okay. Let's get along.

491
00:38:37,512 --> 00:38:39,402
A person...

492
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:41,542
should read books.

493
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:45,892

Thank you.

Oh, no!

No!

Hold still!

503

No! No!

Get him!

So that such nonsense will never happen again,

515
00:40:56,602 --> 00:40:59,572
I will make sure all the violations that have transpired

in these correctional facilities

517
00:41:01,412 --> 00:41:03,492

518
00:41:03,492 --> 00:41:06,572
I plan to clean them up according to the fundamental principles.

519
00:41:06,572 --> 00:41:08,192
However...

520
00:41:10,722 --> 00:41:12,432
the investigation is over.

521
00:41:12,432 --> 00:41:14,592
So what brings you here,

522
00:41:14,592 --> 00:41:17,352
Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun?

523
00:41:18,632 --> 00:41:23,452
This Seongju Prison case was my first case, so I feel very attached to it.

524
00:41:23,452 --> 00:41:26,422
So I wanted to ask that this place will be well-taken care of.

525
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:29,472
I came to greet you properly, however...

Hello.

Aigoo. How nice to see you.

528
00:42:04,762 --> 00:42:06,482
You've changed a lot.

529
00:42:08,502 --> 00:42:10,122
Is that so?

530
00:42:21,612 --> 00:42:23,282
I blocked them all.

531
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:24,822
But how can I avoid exposing my back?

532
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:27,132
They catch you because all you're doing is block.

533
00:42:27,132 --> 00:42:28,042
You have to attack!

534
00:42:28,042 --> 00:42:30,482
So they can't even think about catching you.

535
00:42:37,132 --> 00:42:38,352
You!

536
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:44,602
How do I attack so many...

537
00:42:45,672 --> 00:42:48,222
That's why people have

538
00:42:49,122 --> 00:42:50,982
vital points.

541
00:43:22,882 --> 00:43:25,522
Do you know Elder Yoon Byung Wook?

542
00:43:26,592 --> 00:43:29,552
I've known him since I was little.

543
00:43:29,552 --> 00:43:33,682
My father was Chief Prosecutor Yoon's supervising prosecutor.

544
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:36,972
Your father is?

545
00:43:39,612 --> 00:43:42,462
He is the chief prosecutor of the Central Investigation Department of the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

546
00:43:43,932 --> 00:43:45,982
I see...

547
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:51,692
Actually, the reason I came here

548
00:43:51,692 --> 00:43:54,022
was in large part due to Elder Yoon's guidance.

549
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:55,522
I see.

550
00:43:57,372 --> 00:44:02,072
When you have time, we should all get together for dinner.

551
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:27,192
Bastard...

552
00:44:44,322 --> 00:44:47,592
<i>And at the end, the strongest will emerge.</i>

553
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,052
As for him...

554
00:44:50,892 --> 00:44:52,292
Kill him!

555
00:44:54,582 --> 00:44:56,952
That's the way to scare off the rest.

556
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,312
Gil Sang...

557
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:33,812
Put the knife in his hand.

558
00:45:33,812 --> 00:45:35,182
Hurry up and call the guard.

559
00:45:35,182 --> 00:45:37,662
Or your boss will die here.

560
00:45:37,662 --> 00:45:39,202
Hurry...

561
00:45:39,202 --> 00:45:41,772
Hurry up and put the knife in his hand!

562
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,372
Hurry up and call the guard, you f***!

563
00:45:44,372 --> 00:45:46,492
Guard!

564
00:45:57,642 --> 00:45:59,092
S***.

565
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,062
Geez...

566
00:46:15,892 --> 00:46:19,012
<i>The statements from the inmates in that room are different.</i>

567
00:46:19,012 --> 00:46:22,002
<i>Kim Yo Han smuggled that knife</i>

568
00:46:22,002 --> 00:46:25,112
<i>and he stabbed Song Doo Chul.</i>

569
00:46:28,962 --> 00:46:33,332
Is the fingerprint analysis report on the knife out yet?

570
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,712
There wasn't one fingerprint found.

571
00:46:38,302 --> 00:46:40,652
Are you really suspicious of me?

572
00:46:43,302 --> 00:46:45,742
I need proof that you didn't do it.

573
00:46:45,742 --> 00:46:47,672
Considering witnesses alone,

574
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:49,762
it's four against one.

575
00:46:51,262 --> 00:46:55,902
Before the week's over, you will be transferred to the Jangsong Prison.

576
00:46:55,902 --> 00:46:59,042
And the trial for this case will be conducted there.

577
00:47:07,152 --> 00:47:09,072
Why?

578
00:47:10,852 --> 00:47:15,352
I hear the inmates call you the Dean?

579
00:47:15,372 --> 00:47:20,682
The reason is that the gambling that occurred in the warden's office every Friday night

580
00:47:20,752 --> 00:47:26,452
was run by you, and those testimonies are circulating among the inmates.

581
00:47:26,482 --> 00:47:29,242
On top of that, there's this murder charge.

582
00:47:29,242 --> 00:47:31,362
If we need to isolate you,

583
00:47:31,362 --> 00:47:35,112
we should send you to the Jangsong Prison, don't you agree?

584
00:47:36,382 --> 00:47:38,762
- Guard!
- Wait.

585
00:47:44,332 --> 00:47:47,202
Before that happens, I need to see a lawyer first.

586
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,622
You can call one from the Jangsong Prison.

587
00:47:51,652 --> 00:47:55,352
If anyone is arrested or under custody, he has the right to an attorney.

588
00:47:55,352 --> 00:47:57,652
Isn't that article 12, clause 4 of the Constitution?

589
00:47:57,652 --> 00:48:02,352
I believe the reason for my isolation is unreasonable.

590
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:05,332
Please allow me to see an attorney at once.

591
00:48:10,782 --> 00:48:12,492

The address on the business card in that envelope.

595
00:48:28,082 --> 00:48:30,722
I will remain silent for you, Chairman.

596
00:48:30,722 --> 00:48:32,452
I can add that you had other inmates,

597
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:36,732
including myself, run errands outside continuously, but...

598
00:48:38,772 --> 00:48:40,802

599
00:48:46,392 --> 00:48:48,702
All the matters involving you,

600
00:48:48,752 --> 00:48:53,052
I will forget everything as you wish.

601
00:48:53,782 --> 00:48:55,582
The only thing I want

602
00:48:56,492 --> 00:48:59,052
is that you block Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun.

603
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:00,732
That's all I ask.

604
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:06,712
That's no deal.

605
00:49:06,712 --> 00:49:09,012
Hong Jae Sun's plan

606
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:12,722
is to place the blame for the murder of Song Doo Chul on you

607
00:49:12,722 --> 00:49:16,032
and keep you in prison for a long time.

608
00:49:17,402 --> 00:49:21,032
You only had a few months to go, too.

609
00:49:22,202 --> 00:49:25,742
You've already lost this game.

610
00:49:25,742 --> 00:49:28,682
Fold this game and get up.

611
00:49:29,962 --> 00:49:32,682
And your revenge...

612
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,622
forget all about it.

613
00:49:36,972 --> 00:49:38,252
Or else...

614
00:49:38,992 --> 00:49:42,452
you'll drown in your regrets and die first.

615
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,072
What is it that you really want to say?

616
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:58,752
Be my possession.

617
00:50:00,002 --> 00:50:03,542
You will only listen to me and look to me.

618
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:08,152
Then I'll get Hong Jae Sun and Song Doo Chul...

619
00:50:08,152 --> 00:50:10,162
off of your back.

620
00:50:14,732 --> 00:50:16,272

621
00:50:20,212 --> 00:50:22,432
