<i>- Where is he right now?
- Seongju Prison.</i>

27
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:17,752
<i>Mr. Jo is doing this because it's possible to pay off from there.</i>

<i>Was it you all along, Jang Sun Oh?</i>

49
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:12,622
<i>Why did you help me?</i>

50
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:14,642
<i>Why? Does it hurt your pride?</i>

51
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:17,682
<i>If you're interested in playing in the higher league, come on up.</i>

<i>Field training.</i>

55

<i>Every Friday, they have a gambling hall in the Warden's office.</i>

<i>What are you doing?</i>

57
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:30,492
<i>This is all my money.</i>

58
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:34,492
<i>I thought that Lee Tae Gwang's video would be a lifeline for me.</i>

59
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:38,812
<i>If that's the card I hold, Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung would reinvestigate.</i>

65
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,322
<i>Man, our plan and you!</i>

66
00:02:56,322 --> 00:02:58,532
<i>I still haven't given up on either one!</i>

67
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:02,382
<i>Until I can find the person who recorded that video, I need this guy.</i>

68

69
00:03:04,222 --> 00:03:06,172

71
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:08,912

75
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:17,372
<i>I won't kill you here.</i>

76
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,522

<i>That grandmother. Do you know she passed away?</i>

86
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:42,082
<i>Perhaps Woo Min Ho saw the killing of Shin Dal Soo?</i>

87
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:44,882

<i>I'll share all of it with you all.</i>

97
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:08,642
<i>What is it that you want?</i>

98
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:11,582
<i>You. Someone loyal to money to the end.</i>

99
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:14,832
<i>Do you know of Sinseon-dong in here?</i>

100
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:20,602

101

<i>That power...</i>

102
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:27,082

00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:07,122
If your visitation is over, you should go back.

There's nothing to see here.

114
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:12,012
Is this the Shinseon-dong?

115
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,712
Why do you ask?

116
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:16,382
I just thought I'd get acquainted.

117
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,332
I don't think the Warden would like that.

118
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,162
How much would it take?

119
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:26,922
Hey...

120
00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:30,922
It's not the money.

121
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:33,882
Even the Warden needs to be summoned if he wants to see them.

122

He's a Warden to us only...

123

00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:43,082

00:06:05,642 --> 00:06:07,562
I asked you, what is it?

131
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:09,872
Why? Did someone cause trouble again?

132
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:13,212

00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:33,262
When did you get the call?

140
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:38,712
I don't think I should say anything more.

141
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:40,922
They said not to tell anyone.

142
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:50,772
I guess it's you from now on.

143
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:52,172
Pardon?

144
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:56,622
When did they tell you to come?

145
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,802
They said you would know that.

146
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:17,432
Wait here.

00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:27,932

I'll help you.

151
00:07:56,312 --> 00:07:58,242
Don't be nosy.

152
00:07:58,242 --> 00:07:59,672
How are you going to do this all by yourself?

153
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:02,632
This is my job!

154
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:07,772
Oh, so you are that guy.

Yes.

157
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:16,932
This is not a place for you to be.

Aren't you a helper here?

160
00:08:28,862 --> 00:08:30,782
Stop causing trouble.

161

Stop, or else you'll get into trouble.

Go back.

Excuse me?

00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:54,962
You know, the ones who ignore an old man's warning living in a cabin
