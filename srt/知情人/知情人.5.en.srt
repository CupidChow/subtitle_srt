00:59:45,962 --> 00:59:47,602
you'll do me a favor, right?

544
00:59:47,602 --> 00:59:49,132
What are you doing? Hurry up and find it!

545
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:52,002
Where is Kim Yo Han?

546
00:59:53,342 --> 00:59:56,852
This is Sinseon-dong.

547
00:59:56,852 --> 00:59:58,922
I will have to confirm it myself.

548
00:59:58,922 --> 01:00:01,452
Wow, I feel competitive.

549
01:00:01,452 --> 01:00:04,372
Do you understand the reason for my impatience?

550
01:00:04,372 --> 01:00:06,492
What are you going to do here now, Yo Han?

551
01:00:06,492 --> 01:00:08,032
Take over.

552
01:00:08,032 --> 01:00:09,802
This is the last chance.

553
01:00:09,802 --> 01:00:11,102
It's all over.

554
01:00:11,102 --> 01:00:14,362
No one from the 1st league will follow you.

555
01:00:14,362 --> 01:00:17,202
If I tell you all my secrets and truths,

556
01:00:17,202 --> 01:00:19,092
will you accept me then?

557
01:00:19,092 --> 01:00:21,702
♫ Bring it on, bring it on ♫

558
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:26,202
♫ Another me who hid myself, no one knows ♫
