No. This is not fraud.

Here comes an 8-double.

197
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:48,896
To beat me, the only options are 9-double, 10-double, or kwang-double.

198
00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:49,996
But kwang-double is over.

199
00:21:49,996 --> 00:21:53,776
And since I have a 10, 10-double is over.

200
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:55,166
Ahjussi.

201
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,596

I'm so sorry.

- Did you buy an ink stick?
- Yes.

227

Grandma, where was the ink stone?

230
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,676

355
00:33:26,596 --> 00:33:30,746
the cops were coming from over there.

356
00:33:32,736 --> 00:33:34,686
And the reporters also found out somehow.

357
00:33:34,686 --> 00:33:37,316
They were also running with their cameras.

358
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:40,366
So he ran away to the mountain.

359
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:42,536
I'm talking about your younger brother.

360
00:33:47,156 --> 00:33:48,586
Stop it.

361
00:33:48,586 --> 00:33:50,396
In this day and age?

362
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:52,676
Do you think you'll be okay doing this to me?

363
00:33:52,676 --> 00:33:55,286
This little punk. Where do you think you are?

364
00:33:55,286 --> 00:33:58,776
The regime lasts only five years, but you guys are forever powerful?

365
00:33:58,776 --> 00:34:00,046
Are you the only ones forever powerful?

366
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:03,706
I'm the one who put your father in a wheelchair five years ago.

367
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:08,596
I'm the one who told the reporters that your younger brother was hiding there at dawn.

368
00:34:08,596 --> 00:34:12,466
Do you think the world belongs to you because you were born with a golden spoon in your mouth?

369
00:34:12,466 --> 00:34:13,786
But what do we do about this?

370
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:16,456
I'm the one the country chose to catch you guys.

371
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:19,056
To stop from you guys messing around the country,

372
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:22,186
I'm the one that the country chose to be sheriff.

375
00:34:29,626 --> 00:34:32,956
built the country with tax money, you bastard.

376
00:34:32,956 --> 00:34:35,856
Excuse me, Prosecutor.

377
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:39,566
Why are you still investigating what happened more than 10 years ago?

378
00:34:39,566 --> 00:34:43,686
My father collapsed during the last investigation and is still being treated at a hospital.

379
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:46,596
It's not a show, but it's a fact.

380
00:34:46,596 --> 00:34:48,306
If it doesn't work with your brother,

381
00:34:48,306 --> 00:34:53,486
then I'll say that your daughter is about to swallow up a person.

382
00:34:53,486 --> 00:34:57,736
You sure tried your best to save the child who was close to dying.

383
00:34:57,736 --> 00:35:01,566
She's been to cardiology since she was three for childhood heart failure.

384
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:06,156
I heard you found a suitable person and are waiting for surgery?

385
00:35:06,156 --> 00:35:07,806
It's very weird.

386
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:12,096
It usually doesn't work that fast.

387
00:35:12,096 --> 00:35:14,016
Hey, you punk!

388
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:17,206
- But still, this is wrong!
- Wrong? You asshole!

389
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:21,746
One person is going to die instead to save your daughter's life.

390
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:25,416
It's so sad not to have any money.

391
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,156
Right?

393

It's totally different from 2014.

394
00:35:41,646 --> 00:35:44,356
Corruption Investigation Agency is mainstream! Mainstream!

395
00:35:44,356 --> 00:35:46,686
If we put our guard down, we'll be gone at once.

396
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,396
Even if they're weak,

397
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,476
we're up against the CID of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office.

398
00:35:50,476 --> 00:35:52,406
That's why

399
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:56,816
I planted a "bomb" at their feet.

400
00:35:56,816 --> 00:35:58,166
A bomb?

401
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:02,086
But if something goes wrong, are we the ones who will die?

402
00:36:02,086 --> 00:36:05,626
If something comes up, I'll throw myself and contain it.

403
00:36:05,626 --> 00:36:09,246
We're doing well right now, but aren't we going too far?

404
00:36:09,246 --> 00:36:10,466
Just call it a courageous decision.

405
00:36:10,466 --> 00:36:14,786
If the head flies away, the tail will scatter.

406
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:18,356
This Mok Jin Hyung will do all the dirty work.

407
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:22,386
So, Elders, please trust me and follow this cause.

408
00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:25,526
All right, cheers!

409
00:36:25,526 --> 00:36:27,836
Cheers!

Be responsible and bring him in.

Hey.

Are you awake?

427
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,736
Why did you do that?

428
00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:37,476
I'm the owner of the gambling house that you blew away.

429
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:42,096
But thanks to you, I don't "own" anything anymore.

430
00:39:42,876 --> 00:39:45,886
I just collect things now.

431
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:48,016
Oh, right. Before I started to run the house,

432
00:39:48,016 --> 00:39:51,006
I worked for a while to get back money from the people

433
00:39:51,006 --> 00:39:53,916
who borrowed loans and didn't pay them back.

434
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:57,506
Back then, my nickname was "Ok Jo Hae Do."

435
00:39:57,506 --> 00:40:00,226
Overdue debt was okay. Bad debt was also okay.

436
00:40:00,226 --> 00:40:02,216
I was okay with everything.

437
00:40:04,626 --> 00:40:07,016
You don't seem to believe me, I guess?

438
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:08,966
Okay.

439
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:11,896
This is how I collected what I needed.

440
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:51,856
Let's gargle your mouth.

441
00:41:13,866 --> 00:41:17,906
So how will you pay for my house?

442
00:41:20,316 --> 00:41:22,476
I don't have any money.

443
00:41:22,476 --> 00:41:26,086
Sir, you live with your grandma, right?

444
00:41:26,786 --> 00:41:31,746
Your address is 68-gil, 1123, right?

445
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:36,276
I heard it's getting redeveloped.

446
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:37,276
No!

447
00:41:37,276 --> 00:41:41,546
Aigoo, Sir! Do you think it's a matter of you saying yes or no?

448
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:45,066
If you say no, do you think I can't take it?

449
00:41:45,066 --> 00:41:48,826
Do you think you can prevent that somehow?

450
00:41:48,826 --> 00:41:50,676
Sir.

451
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:53,046
You can't stop me.

452
00:41:55,276 --> 00:41:57,226
You're not afraid of the law, are you?

453
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:58,516
What are you saying?

454
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:02,136
Sir, this has nothing to do with the law.

455
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:06,176
State Public Officials Act, article 33, clause 1.

00:42:14,016 --> 00:42:18,476
"the trainee can be dismissed."

459
00:42:18,476 --> 00:42:20,546
Did I memorize it correctly?

460
00:42:24,216 --> 00:42:26,816
See? I'm good at this.

461
00:42:30,356 --> 00:42:35,266
Is it possible to transfer the title on the deed tomorrow?

462
00:42:57,006 --> 00:43:01,236
No matter how great a person is,

465
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:11,186
Relax your mouth.

If you could go,

you only live once, right?

474
00:44:31,976 --> 00:44:33,546
Does it hurt a lot?

475
00:44:37,446 --> 00:44:39,046
I kind of...

476
00:44:40,076 --> 00:44:42,096
expected it.

477
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,436
I expected the worst-case scenario to go down like this.

478

But after experiencing that worst-case scenario for real,

479
00:44:47,906 --> 00:44:51,406
I'm... a bit stunned.

480
00:44:53,606 --> 00:44:55,426
You expected it?

481
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,046
And you still did it?

00:44:58,766 --> 00:45:00,036
Yes.

00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:36,766
Your father was also

What happened today could be just the beginning.

00:46:16,906 --> 00:46:18,786

Not a problem.

521
00:47:48,386 --> 00:47:51,366
And the frames and clock that fell on the floor?

00:47:51,366 --> 00:47:54,966
They won't move at all, even if there's an earthquake.

Aigoo, look at you sweating.

- Complicated, right?
- Get lost.

532
00:48:25,876 --> 00:48:29,316
Come on. Then your grandma would be disappointed.

533
00:48:30,456 --> 00:48:32,186
Get lost.

534
00:48:36,886 --> 00:48:38,726
Hey.

535
00:48:39,596 --> 00:48:41,196
Why?

536
00:48:41,196 --> 00:48:43,586

00:49:09,676 --> 00:49:13,376
from higher-ups because of that gangster?

545
00:49:13,376 --> 00:49:15,826

546

Are you the only one involved in this?

547
00:49:17,276 --> 00:49:23,276

548
00:49:24,846 --> 00:49:26,526
My apologies.

549
00:49:26,526 --> 00:49:30,386

I'll meet the judge in charge of his case.

556
00:49:50,176 --> 00:49:54,276
So get rid of the thug who keeps sticking around him.
