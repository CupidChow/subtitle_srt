[All people, places, organizations, and incidents

3
00:00:34,286 --> 00:00:37,176
Are you going to scream if I take that off of you?

4
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:54,816
<i>Please take Jin Soo Mi as far as possible and let her go.</i>

5
00:00:56,996 --> 00:00:58,246
<i>And you?</i>

6
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:01,626
<i>The guy who picked us out while we were tailing Kim Yo Han.</i>

7
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:04,956
I caught him while sniffing around Seongju Prison, as you said.

8
00:01:04,956 --> 00:01:06,936
Attorney Koo Bon Chul.

9
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:09,666
He visits his client once a week.

10
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,926
There's an inmate named Do Won Bong.

11
00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:13,146
Do you know him?

12
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:15,186
A long time ago...

13
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:16,276
But still, Yo Han...

14
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,226
A person shouldn't fight with a bear.

15
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:20,156
Kim Yo Han was going to get at Do Won Bong.

16
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:22,226
Even if it's only during hibernation...

17
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:23,676
Do you know anything?

18
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:26,786
He was going to attack the Dosan-ro White Bear.

19
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:28,746
<i>But...</i>

20
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:31,866
<i>the fact that Kim Yo Han got released on time</i>

21
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:39,906
<i>means Kim Yo Han is working under Do Won Bong now.</i>

22
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:45,156
<i>Then does that mean Yoon Byung Wook is running into trouble with Do Won Bong?</i>

23
00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:47,766
<i>A chief prosecutor is...</i>

24
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:50,766
<i>connected to a loan shark rotting in jail?</i>

25
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:55,476
So you're a prosecutor?

26
00:01:57,616 --> 00:01:59,226
Won Bong.

27
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:03,866
I heard you have a brain tumor.

28
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:05,126
Yes.

29
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:10,016
You're a better actor than I thought.

30
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:16,106
I heard you requested the suspension of execution.

31
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:18,316
You can request that at any time.

32
00:02:18,316 --> 00:02:20,326
But why now?

33
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:24,706
Because I'm in much physical pain.

34
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:27,136
Not because of The Skin Nation?

35
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:33,026
You got a job for our Yo Han.

36
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:36,796
Is he Attorney Koo Bon Chul's intern or something?

37
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,886
When you go down to Daejeon soon,

38
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:43,336
it will have nothing to do with you, Chief Prosecutor.

39
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:47,506
What's going on between you

40
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:50,506
and Chief Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook?

41
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:57,736
Why don't you ask him yourself if you're so curious?

42
00:02:57,736 --> 00:02:59,206
<i>They're on the same boat.</i>

43
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:03,076
<i>Do Won Bong is on the same side with Yoon Byung Wook.</i>

44
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:04,326
<i>Why?</i>

45
00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:07,566
<i>Suspension of execution.</i>

46
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:11,516
<i>He's trying to come out of prison and take Chairman Yang's position.</i>

47
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:14,006
<i>And not for The Skin Nation</i>

48
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:17,026
<i>but he seems to be going for the Goldman Casino seat.</i>

49
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:18,946
Bring me a baseball pitching machine.

50
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,456
Jin Soo Mi.

51
00:03:32,236 --> 00:03:34,066
I'm not a bad guy.

52
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:37,376
I'll let you go. I will, but...

53
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:40,486
let me ask you something I'm curious about.

54
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:50,476
At the Goldman Casino,

55
00:03:50,476 --> 00:03:54,216
how much do they make a year laundering money?

56
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,826
Turn on the machine.

57
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:24,196
Quiet.

58
00:04:42,526 --> 00:04:44,356

61
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,746
[Did he kill Shin Dal Soo?]

62
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,506
Send me to a hospital.

63
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:02,126
Something's wrong with my leg.

64
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:04,746
I don't feel anything since earlier.

65
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:09,736
Since when?

66
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:14,926
I have no personal vendetta against you.

67
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:18,066
I just got my money

68
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:20,256
and I'm doing my job.

69
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:21,896
Not that.

70
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:25,596
How long have you been sick?

71
00:05:40,676 --> 00:05:42,616
Did you get any sleep?

72
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,076
Will you stay?

73
00:05:47,076 --> 00:05:50,166
Should I leave?

74
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:52,986
Well, it doesn't matter.

75
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,876
Then I'll watch.

76
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:58,286
It's not my revenge, but

77
00:06:00,456 --> 00:06:02,386
it's finally starting.

78
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:20,466
Fess up.

79
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:24,456
What?

80
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:33,956
That you killed my grandma.

81
00:06:35,716 --> 00:06:39,256
I was also behind bars when your grandma passed away.

82
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:41,326
Chairman Do told you to do it.

83
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:43,086
Did Do Won Bong say that to you?

84
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:45,336
Why would he say that...

85
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:48,326
We can have a three-way confrontation then.

86
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,726
Min Ho recorded it. Woo Min Ho.

87
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:10,626
You remember Woo Min Ho, right?

88
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:13,176
<i>You know. The kid you kidnapped with Woo Sang Ki.</i>

89
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:16,116
Who?

90
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:18,736
<i>No!</i>

91
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:20,506
That's not true at all!

92
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,446
Come on! I'm serious!

93
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:23,996
It's true.

94
00:07:23,996 --> 00:07:26,156
I saw your call history

95
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:29,106
and you've been in contact with Hong Jae Sun a lot.

96
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:31,336
In front of the Seoul Northern District Prosecutor's Office.

97
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:32,536
Geez, this is nuts!

98
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:36,116
Geez, it wouldn't feel so unfair if I actually did that.

99
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:38,176
Well, actually...

100
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:41,476
Actually, that day...

101
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:44,136
That's what I'm saying!

102
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:45,726
But you know...

103
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:49,806
I did promise a sunbae in my organization...

104
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:51,636
So, you'll leave that supermarket just like that?

105
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:54,716
If she dies, it becomes yours.

106
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:57,896
<i>Prosecutor Hong said that your grandma's supermarket will be</i>

107
00:07:57,896 --> 00:08:00,236
<i>worth top dollars due to redevelopment.</i>

108
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:03,916
<i>He did mention I should scare her and take the supermarket away from her.</i>

109
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,086
<i>But then I saw your grandma there that day.</i>

110
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:13,146
Then she suddenly disappeared!

111
00:08:13,146 --> 00:08:15,986
<i>The person who kidnapped my dad and me...</i>

112
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:19,166
<i>It's the one who killed your grandmother.</i>

113
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:26,556
So...

114
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:29,216
just fess up, Sun Oh.

115
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:35,906
If you keep your mouth shut like that, you could really lose that leg.

116
00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:39,996
Not only your legs...

117
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:48,356
I'll send you to the hospital if you spill everything.

118
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:50,256
I promise.

119
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:52,196
On Min Ho's social media account,

120
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:56,046
it's recorded in detail how you killed my grandma.

121
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:01,746
Woo Min Ho...

122
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:03,216
I remember him now.

123
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:04,556
But...

124
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:07,406
he died, though.

125
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:09,526
There's no witness now...

126
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:13,006
and there are only a few posts that the kid uploaded.

127
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:15,806
And what about this video clip?

128
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:19,586
What can you prove with this?

129
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:21,096
Stop it, you a**hole.

130
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:23,206
- Do you know who killed Kwon Dae Il?
- You.

131
00:09:23,206 --> 00:09:25,986
Mok Jin Hyung killed him.

132
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:28,836
And that Lee Tae Gwang's USB you were desperately seeking in prison.

133
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:32,006
Do you know what's in it?

134
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:33,366
But the bulls***.

135
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:36,266
You'd better cut the bulls*** and untie me.

136
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,616
If I die, you'd never get to find out anything

137
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:43,806
and die by Do Won Bong or Yoon Byung Wook's hands.

138
00:09:43,806 --> 00:09:46,296
I said just fess up to everything!

139
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:56,646
You'll never kill me!

140
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:12,856
Lately, for small brain tumors,

141
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:17,156
they don't have to open up your head, and are treatable by gamma-knife radiosurgery.

142
00:10:17,156 --> 00:10:19,746
But since your condition is graver than that,

143
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:22,836
they'll open up your head and for about four to five hours,

144
00:10:22,836 --> 00:10:25,956
they'll perform microsurgery. So, that will be...

145
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:28,646
the official statement by the specialist.

146
00:10:28,646 --> 00:10:31,196
Since your blood pressure is normal

147
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:33,066
and you're very healthy,

148
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,046
you'll just get anesthesia and sleep for four to five hours tomorrow

149
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:38,736
and just leave. That's how I've arranged things.

150
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:40,316
Sounds good.

151
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:43,886
No news from Jang Sun Oh?

152
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:48,116
I think the battery has worn out now.*
(Meaning Jang Sun Oh's time is up)

153
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,886
Did he get caught?

154
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:59,356
Should I check on newly arrived unidentified corpses throughout hospitals?

155
00:10:59,356 --> 00:11:03,336
Don't make a fuss. Just look for a new guy.

156
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:07,286
He's reached his limits on his usefulness.

157
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:08,936
We'll have lots to do going forward.

158
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:11,386
Don't be short on workers.

159
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:17,846
It's Kim Yo Han.

160
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:21,736
How about the money?

161
00:11:21,736 --> 00:11:24,886
I secured the Goldman slush funds.

162
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:28,336
<i>Chairman?</i>

163
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,706
Yes. Good work.

164
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:35,586
It's all thanks to you, Chairman. But...

165
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,366
I finished work just now.

166
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,796
May I visit you at the hospital tomorrow?

167
00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:45,256
Yeah, yes, yes, yes.

168
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,976
Yo Han...

169
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:49,286
Yes, Chairman?

170
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:53,116
I think I'll live 50 more years, all thanks to you.

171
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:57,486
<i>Enduring is the true power.</i>

172
00:11:57,486 --> 00:12:02,526
Thanks for breathing life into me, who was dying away.

173
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:04,486
I'll see you tomorrow, sir.

174
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:06,576
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

175
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:13,236
Thank you...

176
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:14,896
Thank you.

177
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:24,116
And next is...

178
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:26,446
Chairman Do?

179
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,656
<i>Look for two people.</i>

180
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,586
Pardon?

181
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:50,666

I'll lead you inside.

262
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:27,876
You're returning to us what you stole

263

264
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:34,806
I believe you have it wrong.

265
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:36,516
What?

266
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:40,306
Manager Yang is the one who couldn't protect and manage that money

267
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:41,946
and I...

268
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:44,696
went through hell to get that money back to you.

269
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:49,606
So, what is it you want?

270
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:54,306
I heard that the Goldman Casino manager position goes to the most suitable person.

271
00:18:54,306 --> 00:18:55,426
And?

272
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:58,306

(Macau mafia)

273
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:01,466
and they're stumped now that the money disappeared.

274
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:05,926
But if they find out Sinseon-dong's Go-to man got that money back,

275
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:08,966
you'll be able to get the votes from Macau as well.

276
00:19:10,786 --> 00:19:16,386
I did not come here only to ask for Manager Yang's position.

280
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:37,196
The priority for Goldman slush funds is to support the Triad of Macau election. I mean...

281
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:39,766
that is such an absurd situation.

282
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:52,156
If I become the new Goldman Casino manager,

283
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:54,506
I'll prioritize investing...

284

into Sinseon-dong businesses.

285
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:16,566

286

I also...

287
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:34,526

288
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:41,386
I'll hold the sword handle of the law

289
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:44,426

slaughter all these f***ers.

296
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:14,326
If all of you would allow me to get a hold of that handle,

297
00:21:14,326 --> 00:21:16,156
I don't need...

298
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:20,036

it's like food that's poisoned.

They're not human. Those scumbags...

With your head, they're no match for you.

306
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:11,876
You can't handle them!

307
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:14,256
More than anything, I will...

308
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:18,396
I'll never let you get to that position-

309
00:22:25,056 --> 00:22:26,276
So...

310
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:29,086
what will you do then?

311
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:33,026
Chairman, you didn't get released. You got a suspension of execution.

312
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:35,956
You have to return to prison when you regain your health.

313
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:38,006
Isn't that it?

314
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:45,846
Mr. Do Won Bong, how do you feel?

315
00:22:48,676 --> 00:22:50,926
Keep talking.

316

317
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:54,466

Thank you.

319
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,926
You'll feel fine very soon.

00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:28,246
up to my arithmetic.

327
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:35,176
But still, you've managed to come out.

328
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:37,196
Get plenty of rest.

329

If you need anything,

330
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,086
just tell the nephew.

331
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:10,933
Then, will you be personally taking care of finishing up Chairman Do?

332
00:24:11,893 --> 00:24:15,653
He's lived a long time, and it's about time karma got to him.

333
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:18,413
He'll be taken care of naturally.

334
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,783
How about you, Yo Han?

335
00:24:21,783 --> 00:24:23,773
Is Yang Hwa next for you?

336
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,743
Yang Hwa...

337
00:24:27,863 --> 00:24:29,223
Yup.

338
00:24:31,323 --> 00:24:33,823
Which hospital is Jang Sun Oh at?

339
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:37,803
Are you going to go?

340
00:24:41,143 --> 00:24:42,323
No.

341
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:45,583
I'll just go over to CEO Oh's place.

342
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:48,723
Be careful.

343
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:52,393
You now know that your body doesn't belong to you, right?

344
00:24:58,603 --> 00:25:00,983
I won't bring harm to Sinseon-dong.

345
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:26,983
Don't be shocked.

346

00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:32,573
<i>is asking a lot for the cost of the kid.</i>

357
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:33,943
<i>You're going to pay him?</i>

358
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:38,163
<i>What if I get rid of him, and the kid finds out later?</i>

359
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:47,343
What?

360
00:27:51,273 --> 00:27:53,693
<i>You can't tell him he died, man.</i>

361
00:27:53,693 --> 00:27:57,233
<i>You have to say that his dad abandoned him.</i>

362
00:27:57,233 --> 00:28:00,613
<i>A person has to be lonely to look for someone to rely on.</i>

363
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:01,823
Let's go.

364
00:28:02,653 --> 00:28:03,793
Why?

365
00:28:03,793 --> 00:28:05,193
Why?

366
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:06,633
No!

367
00:28:08,523 --> 00:28:11,633
<i>So that the kid will come with me.</i>

368
00:28:11,633 --> 00:28:13,593
A person...

369
00:28:13,593 --> 00:28:16,183
has to be lonely to look for someone to rely on.

370
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:29,583
You know that Chairman Yang is looking for you, right?

371
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:35,443
You're not feeling well and also running out of time.

372
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:40,743
I'll step away for a moment.

373
00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:43,113
This.

374
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:47,113
I took one from the hospital earlier just in case you might need it.

375
00:29:05,943 --> 00:29:07,163
Why!

376
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:11,793
I said I'd share all the profits with you once I become the casino manager!

377
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,513
You don't have to live as Sinseon-dong's dog.

378
00:29:13,513 --> 00:29:18,463
I said I'll help you, so you can lead a new life. So, why?

379
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:21,553
Once a dog, always a dog.

380
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:23,753
You know that people don't change.

381
00:29:23,753 --> 00:29:27,513
You tried to have Jo Hae Do kill me.

382
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:31,513
You had lost Woo Sang Ki but pretended you hadn't and sent over Kim Yo Han.

383
00:29:33,653 --> 00:29:36,303
What were you going to do after you got rid of me and took over the casino?

384
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:41,263
After that, were you going to drive out Sinseon-dong elders out of Goldman?

385
00:29:42,143 --> 00:29:44,583
And after that...

386
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:48,403
you didn't want to become a manager again, but

387
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:52,003
become a Deep Pocket like them, didn't you?

388
00:29:58,453 --> 00:30:00,113
That can't happen.

389
00:30:11,183 --> 00:30:14,403
<i>Dosan-ro White Bear played all the tricks,</i>

390
00:30:14,403 --> 00:30:15,723
but...

391
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:18,853
Kim Yo Han took all the money.

392
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:30,693
You go.

393
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:34,403
I'll go to Oh Soo Yeon and Kim Yo Han.

394
00:30:34,403 --> 00:30:36,393
What are you talking about?

395
00:30:36,393 --> 00:30:39,223
That woman must be with Kim Yo Han.

396
00:30:39,223 --> 00:30:42,593
Our Chairman Yang, are you sure you won't make any mistakes?

397
00:30:45,023 --> 00:30:46,393
Don't worry.

398
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:48,493
I'll bring her back alive.

399
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:51,313
Whether you kill her or not, you do what you want after that.

400
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,043
You don't have to listen to Attorney Koo.

401
00:31:01,043 --> 00:31:03,223
H-he's mistaken about everything.

402
00:31:03,223 --> 00:31:04,513
Right...

403
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:07,993
You said you were a casino manager at one point, right?

404
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:11,773
I guess Yang Joon and Yang Hwa...

405
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:14,663
had listened to you at one point.

406
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:18,153
Do you remember when we recruited Yo Han hyung?

407
00:31:19,063 --> 00:31:21,173
Okay, 500.

408
00:31:23,073 --> 00:31:26,083
Before I get older,

409
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:30,183
I decided to get rid of the two, Yang Joon and Yang Hwa.

410
00:31:31,273 --> 00:31:32,483
Call.

411
00:31:42,123 --> 00:31:45,033
Chairman Do, who doesn't know how to give up. What happened to you?

412
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:51,423
What do you want me to do?

413
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:53,833
A man named Woo Sang Ki

414
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:56,173
will enter the country soon.

415
00:31:56,173 --> 00:31:59,393
<i>So I kidnapped Woo Sang Ki and his son like that</i>

416
00:32:00,243 --> 00:32:03,223
<i>and Yo Han came into the prison.</i>

417
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:07,673
I heard Chief Prosecutor Yoon asked to get rid of that kid.

418
00:32:07,673 --> 00:32:10,523
The kid was investigating him and got caught.

419
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:13,023
He's just a Judicial Institute Trainee...

420
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:17,133
Is that kid holding something over his head?

421
00:32:19,343 --> 00:32:22,563
He was looking for the video that Lee Tae Gwang had filmed.

422
00:32:22,563 --> 00:32:24,023
Lee Tae Gwang?

423
00:32:24,883 --> 00:32:28,993
Oh, that Chairman Yang's underling you messed up?

424
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:31,133
What kind of video is it?

425
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:34,173
Hey, Tae Gwang.

426
00:32:34,173 --> 00:32:35,353
Yes?

427
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:37,743
Go and exchange more money.

428
00:32:37,743 --> 00:32:39,993
Well, how much?

429
00:32:40,843 --> 00:32:42,643
Just enough.

430
00:32:42,643 --> 00:32:43,813
Okay. Got it.

431
00:32:43,813 --> 00:32:46,643
Well, Yang Joon alone gambled abroad.

432
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:49,783
But they got caught together, but Lee Tae Gwang only went to prison.

433
00:32:49,783 --> 00:32:52,083
So I'm sure he felt it was unfair and got pissed off.

434
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:58,163
Then...

435
00:32:58,163 --> 00:33:00,303
make that Kim Yo Han...

436
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:03,583
become one of us.

437
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:04,873
Excuse me?

438
00:33:04,873 --> 00:33:06,293
But how?

439
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:11,683
A person is bound to look for someone to rely on when he's lonely.

440
00:33:11,683 --> 00:33:16,913
I heard he has one family member left. So get rid of that person.

441
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:20,413
And only one person for him to rely on.

442
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:24,063
Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung of Seoul Northern District Prosecutor's Office.

443
00:33:24,063 --> 00:33:28,013
Make a video that makes him look like the killer

444
00:33:28,013 --> 00:33:30,813
and send it to the detective in charge of the case.

445
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,603
Must you take it that far?

446
00:33:35,603 --> 00:33:38,823
Just like you and me, we have to make him

447
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:42,273
rely on nothing else but taking revenge.

448
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:51,093
<i>You said a person looks for someone to rely on when he's lonely.</i>

449
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,953
<i>I thought adults all thought that way.</i>

450
00:33:56,953 --> 00:34:00,283
<i>But the reason I wanted to kill Yang Joon isn't because</i>

451
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:03,673
<i>of my father. But my father...</i>

452
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:06,203
I don't remember much about him anymore.

453
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:10,493
But to let it go makes me feel like such an idiot.

454
00:34:10,493 --> 00:34:14,583
That's why I stabbed Yang Joon behind his back.

455
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:18,223
But that a**hole... He cut off part of my body.

456
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,613
So I was going to take revenge...

457
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:23,433
That's how I've lived.

458
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:25,263
But you...

459
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:31,903
why does it seem like it's only natural that I kill you?

460
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:35,513
Sun Oh... this is...

461
00:34:35,513 --> 00:34:38,403
Even in arithmetic, there is an order to it.

462
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:42,503
My problem was my big mouth...

463
00:34:42,503 --> 00:34:46,653
but Yang Joon is actually the one who knifed you and your father.

464
00:34:46,653 --> 00:34:49,883
Why not settle the score with Yang Joon first

465
00:34:49,883 --> 00:34:52,613
and settle the rest with me...

466
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:54,123
No.

467
00:34:57,483 --> 00:35:01,843
Because someone like you exists, there's also someone like Yang Joon.

468
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:03,853
I'm...

469
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:07,463
I'm already past 70 years old.

470
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:11,253
How many more years would I have to live?

471
00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:15,133
They said not to look down on old people.

472
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:17,863
People who have lived decades

473
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:20,543
are all strong...

474
00:35:21,283 --> 00:35:22,633
and cruel.

475
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:24,213
I'm cruel?

476
00:35:24,213 --> 00:35:27,113
Do you know how cruel this world is?

477
00:35:27,113 --> 00:35:32,023
Do you know how crappy this world and the laws are?

478
00:35:54,273 --> 00:35:55,643
[Oh Soo Yeon's address]

479
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,293
I got Oh Soo Yeon's house address.

480
00:36:06,003 --> 00:36:08,603
<i>Seoul Sangui-gu, World Park-ro 79.</i>

481
00:36:08,603 --> 00:36:11,623
<i>Perimese, Royal 63rd floor.</i>

482
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,423
Wow...

483
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:39,593
It's worth living a long life.

484
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:42,623
Chairman Yang...

485
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:45,323
Forgive me.

486
00:36:47,783 --> 00:36:49,603
Looks like excessive bleeding.

487
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:52,773
Sun Oh,

488
00:36:52,773 --> 00:36:56,043
I knew you'd die before me.

489
00:36:59,373 --> 00:37:01,453
[Hyung]
<i>The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.</i>

490
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:05,003
There is no one who is pure in this world

491
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:08,383
and no one who is completely tainted.

492
00:37:08,383 --> 00:37:10,493
You have to launder people and use them.

493
00:37:10,493 --> 00:37:13,093
Work on them again and-

494
00:37:13,153 --> 00:37:18,553
Anyway, this old man is always trying to dance to a tune.*
(Meaning he never misses a beat)

495
00:37:20,883 --> 00:37:25,033
Send the dead guy over to the incinerator

496
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:27,663
and as for this old man with a big mouth...

497
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:30,033
- Put him in the trunk.
- Yes, sir!

498
00:37:30,993 --> 00:37:32,463
Chairman Yang!

499
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:34,003
Chairman Yang!

500
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:00,153
What's going on?

501
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:09,713
Who are you guys-

502
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:15,633
Hey, erase everything starting from an hour ago.

503
00:38:16,783 --> 00:38:18,843
Security.

504
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:21,153
We received a complaint.

505
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:45,993
How do you do?

506
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:58,003
Mr. Yang Hwa.

507
00:38:58,053 --> 00:39:02,953
You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Jo Hae Do.

508
00:39:09,803 --> 00:39:11,853
Please call my attorney.

509
00:39:20,213 --> 00:39:22,163
<i>Let go! What are you doing?</i>

510
00:39:22,163 --> 00:39:23,503
<i>Let's go!</i>

511
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:47,583
[Hong Jae Sun]
<i>Thanks for letting me use the house.</i>

512
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,283
He caught him.

513
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:50,893
Oh, my goodness...

514
00:39:50,893 --> 00:39:53,083
I can't believe he actually arrested Yang Hwa!

515
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:59,583
The reason you couldn't readily attack Yoon Byung Wook

516
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:02,433
is because of Yang Hwa who was behind Yoon Byung Wook, right?

517
00:40:07,183 --> 00:40:10,453
<i>If you compare it to cards, Yang Hwa is an ace
of spade.</i>

518
00:40:10,453 --> 00:40:12,833
<i>His mere existence is dangerous.</i>

519
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:15,253
<i>The raw violence, shall I say?</i>

520
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:19,723
<i>He's so raw that I can't easily read his next move.</i>

521
00:40:19,723 --> 00:40:21,673
<i>If we don't hold him down like this,</i>

522
00:40:21,673 --> 00:40:24,073
we can't do anything.

523
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:26,873
And...

524
00:40:29,313 --> 00:40:31,493
once we cut off these shackles,

525
00:40:31,493 --> 00:40:33,703
it's finally Yoon Byung Wook's turn.

526
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:41,193
It's because of your medication, right?

527
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:48,773
Excuse my expression,

528
00:40:48,773 --> 00:40:50,913
but we're housemates, after all.

529
00:40:50,913 --> 00:40:52,753
I noticed that...

530
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:54,713
you take lithium.

531
00:41:03,623 --> 00:41:06,173
