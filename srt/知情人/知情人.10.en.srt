00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:41,511
Don't do anything stupid.

179
00:11:44,741 --> 00:11:46,141
Are you...

180
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:48,951
acting like this because of that woman?

181
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:52,181
<i>Why is Soo Yeon doing this...</i>

182
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:54,971
<i>It turns out she had already partnered up with Kim Yo Han.</i>

183
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:56,551
Geez...

184
00:11:57,571 --> 00:12:00,261
Don't waste your time on a woman who's already left you.

185
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,891
You are just causing double the pain.

186
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,791
This is no fun.

187
00:12:21,081 --> 00:12:22,461
Where are you going?

188
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,071

00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:27,771
Hey, Joon!

190
00:12:29,461 --> 00:12:31,031
Geez, that guy...

191
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:32,391
Manager,

192
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:34,931
please spare me.

193
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:39,531
Let's see...

194
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:45,251
Gosh, Manager!

195
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:46,691
Please spare me!

196
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:47,971

[Burj Nadiyya]

200
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:05,211
Chairman Suh of Dongdaemun Taepyeong Plaza.

201
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:07,641
He was released 10 years ago after serving time for embezzlement.

202
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:11,481
He got caught stealing 350 billion won from 3,000 investors.

203
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:14,451
Aigoo, he sure is greedy all right.

204
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:17,071
Playing cards? Is he into things like that?

205
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:18,961
It's been rumored that out of the 350 billion won he embezzled,

206
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:22,091
he lost 80 billion won playing Hold'em.

207
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:23,701
So he's a player, too.

208
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,351
Consider he took all the

209
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:28,051
negative aspects of Do in prison or Yang who took over Namdaemun.

210
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:29,491
You can look at it that way.

211
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:33,231
He's no second fiddle to Do or Yang.

212
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:34,981
- He's that much of a bad guy?
- Right.

213
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,401
When Yang took down Do in Gangnam and took over entire Seoul,

214
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,491
the only one who withstood through it all is

215
00:13:40,491 --> 00:13:41,991
Suh.

216
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:43,621
Chairman Suh.

217
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:45,131
Sounds good.

218
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:47,291
Good, bad, and ugly. He's got it all.

[Chairman Yang Joon]

220
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:54,341
Excuse me.

221
00:13:55,471 --> 00:13:57,581
Hello, Chairman Yang.

222
00:13:57,581 --> 00:14:00,721
Aren't you busy with the listing ceremony?

223
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:02,301
Hey, Soo Yeon.

224
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:04,511
Are you...

225
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,051
available during our listing ceremony?

226
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:09,061
Of course.

227
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,861
I already prepared my dress for that day.

228
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:14,851
<i>I'm sure you'll be pretty.</i>

229
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:17,121
After the ceremony,

230
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:20,361
we plan to have a bash with some of the VIPs.

231
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:23,301
Sounds fun.

232
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:26,011
Am I invited, too?

233
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:27,291
<i>Of course.</i>

234
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,971
There's always a place for you, my Soo Yeon.

235
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,981
I'll also save another place.

236
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:37,991
So if you have a good friend,

237
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:39,691
come together.

238
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:44,741
But don't you need 10-20 million won minimum to play there?

239
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:46,071
<i>Well...</i>

240
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:49,081
Who can I bring who won't get rattled, and

241
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:51,661
enjoy a place like that?

<i>Yo Han takes the shares from the equity holders by playing Hold'em.</i>

<i>Gather all that in the Dosan Holdings</i>

247
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,740
<i>and take The Skin Nation entirely, huh?</i>

248
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,430
What's after that? The casino?

249
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,540
Let's say...

250
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,170
this is the Goldman Casino in Incheon.

251
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,330
I said you have to take over this place to be number one in Korea's gambling scene.

252
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,440
But actually, this is just a cover.

253
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,790
Cover?

254
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,020
The game that makes real money is

255
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,380
not the casino,

256
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,470
but what happens in the casino hotel's upstairs suites.

257
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,830
It happens in the VIP suites where only the ones with

258
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,510
invitations are allowed in.

259
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,160
The real power behind the Goldman Casino

260
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,340
is not the casino

261
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,440
but the slush fund, the money that was laundered from the casino.

262
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,650
Goldman slush fund.

263
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,490
The one who manages the slush fund becomes the casino's manager.

264
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,760
Anyway, if you can control the slush fund

265
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,740
you can acquire the casino also.

266
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,350
So, what's the scenario?

267
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,890
In a given year, there aren't many games held in the VIP suite.

268
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,530
Unless a super VIP wants it or

269
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,340
the game happens on a special occasion.

270
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,410
But you know Yang Joon's The Skin Nation?

271
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,710
I hear they might go public real soon.

272
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:28,500
It's highly likely that a game will take place in the VIP suite on the day of the listing ceremony.

273
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,840
I can't play because I've been marked by Yang Joon.

274
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,770
But you go in and win tons of Yang Joon's money.

275
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,840
If you'll tie up Yang Joon there that night,

276
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,680
I'll get to Director Jin, the one in charge of the slush funds, in the meantime.

277
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,420
I'll get Director Jin.

278
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,190
I'll twist her and get the slush fund in my hands.

279
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,920
You said you need an invitation to get into the room.

280
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,950
How will we get that invitation?

281
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,790
That's the crucial issue here.

282
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,620
Work on someone who's got the invitation

283
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,240
and pretend to be his proxy and get in.

284
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,880
I'll come up with something after my release tomorrow.

285
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,790
Everything is...

286
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,240
coming together at Goldman Casino.

287
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,000
All our plans are entangled.

288
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,180
If one thing goes wrong, then the rest will falter.

289
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,750
Don't worry too much.

290
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,490
If things go according to my plan...

291
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,610
Yes.

292
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,620
Good job.

293
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,440
See over there?

294
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,930
Make that more visible and center it around new products.

295
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,310
Yes, sir.

296
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,680
Good job.

297
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,430
- That drum. Am I hitting it?
- Yes.

298
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,880
Does it make a sound?

299
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,210
Yes, the audio is fine.

300
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,680
Have you tried it?

301
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,510
I'll check it again.

302
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,030
I heard Kim Yo Han was the dean at Seongju Prison.

303
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,730
Oh, man. It was a s***ty period.

304
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,680
He used to be such a baby back then.

305
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,990
What did he eat to get so big?

306
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,390
Jang Sun Oh taught him?

307
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,210
I know, huh?

308
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,970
He took him as his successor.

309
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,730
He picked him

310
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,650
and made him play cards day and night.

311
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,640
And no one knows what happened to him after he was released?

312
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,720
I did hear that he did visit the school* a few times after his release.

313

Sweep that up, too.

Okay.

315
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,520
Sweep over there, too.

316
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,830
Don't you have to go to the visitation room?

317
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,650
I heard your boss is in Sinseon-dong.

318
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,610
Kim Yo Han is back here?

319
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,100
What?

320
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,390
You didn't know?

321
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,740
When you were in here together, you used to be inseparable.

322
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,690
He totally ignores you as soon as he's released?

323
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,510
Oh, my. Kim Yo Han...

324
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,190
He's not the person I thought he was.

325
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,230
He's as cold as dry ice.

326
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,830
Oh, this, too. Take it.

327
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,940
Whoa!

328
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,180
I think I can find out if I asked a few people.

329
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,610

You look familiar.

341

Even if you are tired, don't go straight home.

342
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,470
Like this...

343
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,270
You should always go around twice before going in.

344
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,600
Bye now.

<i>Even if you allowed enough time and distance,</i>

347
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,250
<i>a person or a car keeps popping up. You have to figure that out.</i>

<i>Every time you change direction,</i>

349
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,350
<i>typically a new tail would take over.</i>

<i>The best way to beat them</i>

351

<i>is frequently changing directions</i>

352

<i>and make the tail get up close to you.</i>

00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,990
So, you knew all this in advance earlier?

358
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,190
Have you ever seen me talking gibberish?

359
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,760
Was that Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung?

360
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,520
He's used at least six people to catch you.

361
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,050
That means...

362
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,210
he's trying to kill you.

363
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,760
Is he the one you were talking about earlier?

364
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,990
Yeah.

365
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:41,250
He circled around widely and spotted all of us.

366
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,100
I'm certain I've been exposed.

367
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,990
Most of these guys here also.

368
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,590
You could've been photographed also.

369
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:57,720
<i>Geez! I can never get it right!</i>

370
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,610
<i>Geez!</i>

371
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,180
<i>Lost again!</i>

372
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,440
<i>Nothing works out.</i>

373
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,290
<i>Geez!</i>

374
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,310
<i>Look at this!</i>

375
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,170
<i>Look!</i>

376
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,880
<i>I'll win the lottery next!</i>

377
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,400
You must be hurting bad...

378
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,360
What is it?

379
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,310
Just follow me.

380
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,940
Don't be scared.

381
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,180
Why is your name Nam Dae Moon?

382
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,190
So that I'm not too stiff,

383
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,340
easily open and close.

384
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,520
So that I could live like that.

385
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,590
That's why it's Nam Dae Moon.

386
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,390
How long have you been out?

387
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,660
It's been 20 days.

388
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,300
Life is like a melodrama. I'll speak to you casually.

389
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,010
Do you know where Kim Yo Han is?

390
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,200
After his release, he was eager to make some money.

391
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,270
So he was looking for some games where he can make some money.

392
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,580
That's what I heard...

393
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,710
Really?

394
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,470
How come I haven't heard that?

395
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,950
Maybe because...

396
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,740
he's using an alias, Mr. Koo, to enter the games.

397
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,620
He wants to find whoever killed his grandmother

398
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,640
and he needed money for that. That's what I heard.

399
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,000
Who killed his grandmother?

400
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,410
I'm not sure. That's...

401
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,430
I'm not sure...

402
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,380
Thank you for this.

403
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,210
When a tumor grows in the pituitary gland, it is called prolactin.

404
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,290
It causes an abnormality in hormone secretion.

405
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,660
This drug can mimic similar symptoms.

406
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,780
You have to make it look like you have a real brain tumor.

407
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,640
So your meal menu will be changed accordingly.

408
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,890
To receive a suspended sentence,

409
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,060
you'll need to become sickly that you can't hold a spoon.

410
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,920
When is the PET scan scheduled for?

411
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,800
It's set in two days in the morning.

412

00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,390
How about the head of the Brain Tumor Center?

422
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,980
Did you bribe him?

423
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,290
Yes, his daughter is studying art in college.

424
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,420
We offered to set up an exhibition for her.

425
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,350
After that,

426
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:34,410
the only thing remaining is for the DA to sign off on the suspension of execution.

427
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,000
So all that remains is

428

that I might get indigestion.

440
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,390
I mean, it looks like

441
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,750
no matter who sits in that seat, we won't have to quit our positions.

442
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,520

wouldn't it be better to go with that old man?

You don't really care for Manager Yang.

That's true, but

446
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,240
I've seen too many sunbaes who got burned from gluttony.

452
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,290
You are out?

453
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,670
Thanks to you.

454
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,670
I came out after serving time that was never meant for me.

455
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,690
Well, then go and play.

456
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,240
Give me.

457
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,380
This is a small game for you, isn't it?

458
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,190
Let's see...

459
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:55,240
Oh, my! Your winning streak is going straight up at the end.

460
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,020
I heard you are desperate for money these days.

461
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,680
- What's this?
- An invitation.

462
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:15,690
They are setting up the biggest game in this country there.

464
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,250
We got it.

Did you think you were the only one working for me?

477
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,710
Boy, look at the expression on your face.

478
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:28,210
Jang Sun Oh is also my possession, who works for me like you.

479
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,660
Don't think that I had deceived you.

480
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,460
You just quietly...

481
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,970
do what you have to do.

482
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,000
I will do as you said.

<i>Jang Sun Oh was working for Do Won Bong.</i>

00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,520
<i>Then...</i>

494
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,850
So, how did you do it?

495
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,910
To find someone to get that invitation,

496
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,370
I've been doing everything I could since I got out.

497
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,570
But it didn't work out.

498
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,160
Maybe it's because too many people know what you look like.

499
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,100
True...

500
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,680
Not many people out here know you were the dean at Seongju prison, right?

501
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,840
So, you got an invitation now.

502
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,580
Did you find out how money laundering is done at the casino?

503
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,210
Okay.

504
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,740
In the last five years,

505
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,580
the 50,000 won bills that the banks couldn't recover is worth 12 trillion won.

506
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,960
Move it.

507
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
<i>What do they do if they want to spend that money?</i>

508
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,070
<i>They have to launder it all.</i>

509
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,430
<i>Enjoy!</i>

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

514
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,330
<i>They'd say the cash slush funds that the Deep Pockets handed over</i>

515
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:47,350
<i>came from the foreign tourists who come to gamble here.</i>

516
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,100
<i>It all becomes casino's revenue</i>

517
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,010
<i>and if it's withdrawn from the Macau head office,</i>

518
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,910
<i>the international wiring of the funds is completed.</i>

519
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:56,150

520
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,280
<i>Should I withdraw it as cash like before and deliver it to Woo Sang Ki?</i>

521
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,800
<i>Set it aside for a while in a separate account.</i>

522
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,030
Finally, the money is exchanged for bitcoins in Hong Kong

523
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,490
and wire it to a tax haven where it sits in a business account under a borrowed name.

524
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,480
Exactly.

525
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,050
As expected of a model student, you studied everything already.

526
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,980

527
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,250

<i>There was some controversy over the high valuation...</i>

532
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:54,430
Now, let's check today's final closing price

533
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,930
on the first day of the historic listing of The Skin Nation.

534
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,400
<i>They anticipate a very successful opening day doubling the price.</i>

535
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,460
<i>Five, four, three, two, one!</i>

536
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,140
[The Skin Nation]

537
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,280
<i>Congratulations!</i>

538
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,410
The offering price was 39,000 won.

539
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:17,870
The final stock value is 101,400 won, an increase of 160%.

540
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,790
It's more than double, everyone!

541
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,670
Let's go!

542
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,780
<i>Yang Joon! Yang Joon!</i>

543
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,580
<i>- Yang Joon! Yang Joon!</i>
- CEO, I'm Seok Hong.

544
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,180
It's been a long time since I last saw you.

545
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,820
Congratulations, CEO Cha.

546
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,160
It looks like you will make some money this time.

547
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,990
As for me, I'm sure I'll just get some crumbs.

548
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:55,080
Will you be coming to our after-party planned for this evening?

549
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,010
Who goes to school to study?

550
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,210
You go there to eat your lunch.

551
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,250
Security check, please.

552
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,380
A VIP is entering.

553
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,810
Hey...

554
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,950
Why is Kim Yo Han here?

555
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,600
Geez, I told you not to stir trouble.

556
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,420
Don't you stir trouble, Hyung.

557
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,880
Don't go up against the prosecutors.

558
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,190
They can kill several with just a phone call.

559
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,450
[Annie Stevens]
<i>Would it be possible to hold a virtual meeting with the Deep Pockets?</i>

560
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:09,120
Annie Stevens...

561
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,690
She wants a virtual meeting with the Deep Pockets. S***...

562
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,610
Man...

563
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,030
Geez...

564
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,730
One Gangster, two gangsters, one prosecutor, two prosecutors...

565
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,550
One avenger, two avengers...

566
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,250
Here.

567
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,760
Slush fund in the full...

568
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,000
If an avenger catches a slush fund in the full flop of the account...

569
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:53,310
Sinseon-dong, Sinseon-dong, Goldman, Goldman...

570
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,280
Turn and Chairman Do...

571
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,170
If Chairman Do deals big, the cards and button

572
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,680
Call, call , call...

573
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,310
And then river...

574
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,470
Soo Yeon.

575
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,050
Chairman.

576
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,120
<i>Kim Yo Han has won another hand.</i>

577
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,900
<i>8,000 on this game.</i>

578
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,020
<i>Today's total is 723 million won.</i>

579
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,120
Let's go in.

580
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,030
Ladies first.

581
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,360
All the VIPs inside have been informed, right?

582
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,950
That I will kill Kim Yo Han tonight.

583
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:02,180
Yes, they said they'll all cooperate.

584
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,490
Of course...

585
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,970
Chairman Suh, you are here also.

586
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,210
CEO Cha, long time no see.

587
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:28,080
All right, how are your winning streaks tonight?

588
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,000
This is just the start.

589
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,550
This new guy is something else.

590
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,640
Is that so?

591
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,460
Everyone, take caution.

592
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,460
For an entertaining evening,

593
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,740
[Devil: A slang that means a cheater in Poker]
he's a special 'devil'* I invited tonight.

594
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,910
[Devil: A slang that means a cheater in Poker]

595
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,960
It's been a long time, Kim Yo Han.

596
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,190
Thank you for the invitation, Chairman Yang.

597
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,610
Gosh, Yo Han...

598
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,860
You are shameless.

599
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,600
I invited the elders, so they'll have a good time.

600
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,580
But if you keep winning like that, they'll say you're rude.

601
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,010
Oh, my.

602
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,150
I'm sorry.

603
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,040
I guess I didn't read the room.

604
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,890
I heard this was a major league, so

605
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,930
I swung my bat pretty hard.

606
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:21,260
Chairman Suh? Chairman Suh, right?

607
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,760
Shall I...

608
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,710
tone it down a bit?

609
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,090
Hey.

610
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,020
Even being rude and talking cheap is part of this culture.

611
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,750
Misly a few million won. We'll just say we chewed it out to stay awake.

612
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,350
Right now is just perfect.

613
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,750
Just right.

614
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,360
Now is just right, he says.

615
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,820
What's your name there?

616
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:03,580
I'm Oh Soo Yeon. It's nice to meet you.

617
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,450
It's my first time meeting you. I'm very pleased to meet you.

618
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,480
Are you seeing anyone?

619
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,590
If there is,

620
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,270
- does anything change?
- As for introduction...

621
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,330
I think that's enough.

622
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:24,400
Okay. Let's resume the game.

623
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,950
I've been looking forward to this night all day long.

624
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,290
I can't bear to wait any longer.

625
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,040
Call!

626
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,950
Who are you looking for, sir?

627
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,030
Is there a VIP room?

628
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,590
Where the stakes are higher.

629
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:04,080
The high betting room is over there.

630
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,390
Did you see Kim Yo Han?

631
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,810
He went up.

632
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,480
What are you going to do?

633
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,160
Let's make our move.

634
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,800
Betting.

635
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,060
800 Million.

636
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,510
Call.

637
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,650
Open.

638
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,780
Full house.

639
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,050
I got four of a kind.

640
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:18,930
Fold.

641
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,470
Three.

642
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,480
- Call.
- Fold.

643
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:30,470
Chairman...

644
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:32,560
you should have some fun, too.

645
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:43,450
I'm sorry, Chairman.

646
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,680
At a glance, I can tell this hand is...

647
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,500
straight.

648
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,480
I know.

649
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,620
I can tell it's straight at a glance.

650
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,670
Betting.

651
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:49,270
Check.

652
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,450
1.6 billion won.

653
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,740
Does it seem real now?

654
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,530
What kind of game table you are sitting at?

655
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,040
You don't think I can take 1.6 billion?

656
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,480
That's worth an apartment in Seoul.

657
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:16,460
No one would blame you even if you fold now. Right?

658
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,260
Call.

659
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,430
What is it?

660
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,760
Open.

661
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,920
<i>He's acting.</i>

662
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,380
<i>I didn't know he was at this level.</i>

663
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,250
<i>He's got a partner.</i>

664
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,170
<i>But who?</i>

665
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:22,190
<i>Oh Soo Yeon only folded.</i>

666
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:32,050
<i>D*** it. Who's playing tricks here?</i>

667
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,990
Go ahead.

668
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:54,900
We need to secure Woo Sang Ki.

669
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,450
And also Attorney Koo Bon Chul.

670
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:59,150
Both of them at the same time.

671
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,890
<i>Chairman Do abducted Woo Sang Ki, so he can attack Chairman Yang of The Skin Nation.</i>

672
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,810
I don't exactly know why at this time.

673
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,440
Hold on.

674
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,290
Chairman Yang is on the same team as Prosecutor Hong Sang Wook.

675
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:24,610
Chairman Yang...

676
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:28,610
He must now know that I'm his enemy.

677
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,870
CEO, please be careful.

678
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,450
And I...

679
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:36,870
will definitely get out as scheduled.

680
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:38,760
You do have a plan, right?

681
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,010
<i>You need to look after the first leaguers here.</i>

682
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,750
Especially Nam Dae Moon...

683
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,620
I mean...

684
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,840
There's a man named Noh Seung Hwan.

685
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,980
Please deposit double the usual amount for Noh Seung Hwan.

686
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,880
When you were in here together, you used to be inseparable.

687
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,740
He totally ignores you as soon as he's released?

688
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:03,760
Oh, my. Kim Yo Han. He's not the person I thought he was.

689
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,340
Whoa!

690
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,910
Chairman Yang will come to you now, Dean.

691
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:44,020
<i>To the Dean...</i>

692
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,310
I'll tell him myself.

693
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,980
<i>Chairman Suh, CEO Cha...</i>

694
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,240
<i>They've never even met Kim Yo Han before.</i>

695
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,550
<i>Instead, they are helping me kill Kim Yo Han.</i>

696
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:01,160
Astray, please.

697
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,480
S***...

698
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,500
My luck tonight sucks.

699
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,210
What is it that you want now?

700
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:26,660
Can't you leave me alone?

701
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,390
You'll regret it

702
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,780
if you let an important person get away like this.

703
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:42,490
Fold.

704
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,830
<i>Let's say that all the others are like that, but</i>

705
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,780
<i>how could he cajole Chairman Suh?</i>

706
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:54,450
<i>That old man lacks nothing.</i>

707
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,330
You want me to

708
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:12,360
work with you to overtake Chairman Yang?

709
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,420
Yes.

710
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,770
I've known those brothers for 20 years.

711
