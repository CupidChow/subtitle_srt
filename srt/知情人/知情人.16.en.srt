So you're saying if your wife's company gets the construction job,

83
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:39,839
the Urban Development Corporation will take the loan or the construction fee.

84
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,859
Then your wife's company will take all of

85
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:44,789

86
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:47,229
You'll do the construction with tax money and

87
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,559
you'll take all the profit...

88
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:52,739
- That's what it is, right?

91
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:01,539
He's not going to take and sit on all of it.

92
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:05,169

93

When the regime changes later and this is made known,

96
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,009
I could get a special audit.

97
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:17,289
Can he cover a special audit, too?

98
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,429

181
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,929
<i>He said you're out.</i>

182
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:00,409
- Who said?
<i>- Prosecutor General Hong.</i>

183
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,159
<i>I'll let the Prosecutor General know.</i>

184
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:13,589
<i>You go and check if Oh Soo Yeon is Lee Yeon Su.</i>

185
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:15,029
<i>I'll check right away.</i>

186
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:16,989
<i>I just need to head to Goldman, right?</i>

187
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:40,019
I've lived my life

188
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,779
at least a hundred, thousand times harder than you all.

189
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,019
[Kim Yo Han]

190
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,289
Why?

191
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,469
<i>Are you saying you'll quit?</i>

192
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,859
Are you watching me?

193
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:04,269
<i>I've always been watching you.</i>

194
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:07,129
Ever since finding out that you instigated my murder.

195
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,689
<i>Are you recording this?</i>

196
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:10,449
What is it that you want?

197
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:12,999
What I want?

198
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:15,109
You couldn't possibly have...

199
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:16,779
anything that I want now.

200
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:19,819
<i>If you die there today,</i>

201
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:22,829
your wife's company will go down day after tomorrow.

202
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:25,929
<i>Your family, your children...</i>

203
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:29,229
will spend the rest of their lives being pointed at by the whole world

204
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:32,589
just because they have been your family.

205
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:35,319
<i>All because of me.</i>

206
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:38,469
Like how I went to prison because of you,

207
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:41,329
became an ex-convict and lost my family.

208
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:43,649
All because of me, you will

209
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,559
kill yourself and

210
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,099
<i>because of me, your family will</i>

211
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:52,079
live in agony from now until they die.

212
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:55,499
What goes around comes around, a**hole.

213
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:58,689
Are you doing this because you think I might die right now?

214
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:02,129
When you want to see me suffer for a long time?

215
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:03,579
<i>Fine.</i>

216
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:05,069
I did...

217
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:08,409
try to kill you because you might get Lee Tae Gwang's video in your hands.

218
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:09,919
<i>What a shame, though.</i>

219
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,629
Do Won Bong, who got that order, or

220
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:15,539
the guy who cast your grandma off the bridge,

221
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:18,269
Jang Sun Oh, are both gone now.

222
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:21,939
It's a shame that I couldn't lock you up, but

223
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:27,289
I'm thinking about being satisfied with the fact that I crippled your life.

224
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:29,499
<i>Now, you'll live in the prison,</i>

225
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:32,619
missing the people behind the walls,

226
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,899
telling yourself that you'll now live

227
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:37,869
ordinarily and diligently.

228
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:41,009
That's how you'll be waiting for your death.

229
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:45,629
A trial is long.

230
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:47,779
There are as many chances as long as it is.

231
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:50,349
<i>You want to see this to the end, huh?</i>

232
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:52,219
I never lost.

233
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:57,429
Well, you were always the one with the sword in your hand.

234
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:00,719
<i>Isn't this your first time fighting with the sword pointed at you?</i>

235
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:04,649
If you can, try to take the

236
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:08,959
sword handle that's in my hand.

237
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:12,029
You son of a b****...

238
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:20,435
In addition to creating a private organization that

239
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:25,005
instigates crime using prisoners of Seongju Prison,

240
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:28,895
1998 Chelin Investment Fraud Case,

241
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:33,055
2008 Jeong Mi Seon Disappearance Case,

242
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:37,385
2004 Prosecutor Kim Hong Lee Suicide Case,

243
00:18:37,385 --> 00:18:40,495
Sunshine Surgical Malpractice Case,

244
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:44,935
and 2003 Bareum Market Murder Case.

245
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:53,205
You admit that all of this is true?

246
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:57,675
Defendant?

247
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:04,665
I do.

248
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,695
[Prosecution]

249
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:19,035
You committed all of these crimes by yourself?

250
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,365
Defendant.

251
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:26,165
Let me ask you not as a judge but as another legal professional.

252
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,665
What exactly were you thinking?

253
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:31,405
<i>I won't die.</i>

254
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:34,225
<i>I'll get my revenge no matter what.</i>

255
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:35,895
If you don't read that now...

256
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:38,585
he said he'll release the details of the Yeonguk subcontractors'

257
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:40,685
solicitation to the press now.

258
00:19:40,685 --> 00:19:41,495
Why you...

259
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,655
I barely stopped them from exposing it before the trial.

260
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:44,945
Just read that.

261
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:47,405
That's your best option, Sunbaenim.

262
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:52,335
Defendant?

263
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:58,465
<i>I'll live and get my revenge no matter what.</i>

264
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:11,135
As a legal professional,

265
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,865
more so as a human being,

266
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:18,085
I would like to apologize for my evil crimes.

267
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:19,785
Because I'm-

268
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:30,095
I'm also a father of a family

269
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:33,295
who doesn't want his beloved children to

270
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:37,195
live in a world that is ruined by me.

271
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:40,865
Therefore, I hereby would like to

272
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,625
seek forgiveness from all the victims.

273
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,985
First, during the 1998 Chelin Case,

274
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:47,935
as the prosecutor in charge,

275
00:20:47,935 --> 00:20:50,115
I ill-intendedly framed the victim,

276
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,495
Oh An Na, as the suspect.

277
00:20:52,495 --> 00:20:57,965
Then, committed crimes of abduction and trafficking to her daughter, Lee Yeon Soo.

278
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,405
During the 2008 Park Han Sang Drug Case,

279
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:03,645
I received the complaint from the victim, Jeong Mi Seon,

280
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:07,305
but did not prosecute it due to a lack of evidence

281
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:11,855
because I had colluded with the suspect, Park Han Sang.

282
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,795
Jeong Mi Seon, who caught onto my doing,

283
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:17,385
was reported missing after she left her house to reveal the truth.

284
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:20,325
But she was actually killed by thugs I had hired.

285
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:24,195
And in 2014,

286
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:26,985
the Sunshine Surgical Clinic Malpractice Case, where the bereaved family of

287
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,845
Jang Se Deuk, who came to the hospital for a simple appendectomy,

288
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:33,275
died from a surrogate operation, sued the hospital.

289
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:35,715
I did not prosecute the case because the director at the time

290
00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:37,855
was my colleague and made a request.

291
00:21:37,855 --> 00:21:41,635
In 2003, the Bareun Market Murder Case where I forcibly got

292
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:44,425
three pages of testimony from a developmentally disabled person,

293
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:47,155
Mun Byung Seon, who can't even spell his name correctly,

294
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:50,255
and framed him as the murderer.

295
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:53,895
In 1998, during the Cha Man Geun gate incident,

296
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:57,885
Song Sang Cheol, the colleague of the then-assemblyman candidate Cha Man Geun,

297
00:21:57,885 --> 00:22:01,375
was found to have killed himself during an overnight coerced investigation

298
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,165
for acceptance of money and goods.

299
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:04,975
But he didn't actually kill himself.

300
00:22:07,565 --> 00:22:08,975
Finally...

301
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:15,765
I'm sorry.

302
00:22:16,575 --> 00:22:18,855
- Finally-
- That's enough.

303
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:20,215
Fine.

304
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:23,465
I fully understand your intentions.

305
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:26,935
I'll consider them your last defense and

306
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:30,485
conclude the examination of evidence.

307
00:22:30,485 --> 00:22:34,525
Prosecution, shall we proceed with your demand for punishment?

308
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:40,535
Your Honor,

309
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:43,545
I'd like to tell you something before I make the demands.

310
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:44,905
Proceed.

311
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,575
The center of Korea's power, the Prosecution.

312
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,055
Among them,

313
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,995
the defendant Yoon Byung Wook was called the center of CID.

314
00:22:52,995 --> 00:22:55,595
The reason why he sought those crimes

315
00:22:55,595 --> 00:22:58,455
despite his affluent power is

316
00:22:58,455 --> 00:23:03,225
because of his endless desire for power.

317
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:05,135
So?

318
00:23:07,005 --> 00:23:11,375
I have a piece of evidence here that I would like you to see.

319
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:23,845
<i>How great are these people...</i>

320
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,485
<i>Just how much power do they have...</i>

321
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:30,285
<i>that all these things we're doing are made possible?</i>

322
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:33,315
I heard that there's additional testimony to be made

323
00:23:33,315 --> 00:23:35,715
regarding the "Deep Pockets" mentioned in this video.

324
00:23:39,495 --> 00:23:41,085
Kim Yo Han?

325
00:23:58,445 --> 00:24:00,845
[Witness Seat]

326
00:24:09,205 --> 00:24:10,685
As you saw,

327
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:12,505
the defendant Yoon Byung Wook

328
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:17,305
did commit unforgivable evil using every

329
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:19,995
loophole of the law.

330
00:24:19,995 --> 00:24:21,275
However,

331
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:25,025
he is also just another foolish individual who at least

332
00:24:25,025 --> 00:24:27,345
knows to admit to his crimes.

333
00:24:29,205 --> 00:24:31,655
He only had bigger desires than

334
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:35,045
other people and the power to realize those desires.

335
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:36,565
The reason why those

336
00:24:36,565 --> 00:24:39,335
desires were able to be realized

337
00:24:39,335 --> 00:24:40,675
was because of those

338
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:45,165
Deep Pockets' contamination of our society.

339
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,345
Laws...

340
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:50,025
principles...

341
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:53,255
even prison walls mean nothing to those people. As long as they remain,

342
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:57,125
a second and a third Yoon Byung Wook will surely and definitely

343
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,065
reappear sooner or later.

344
00:25:00,645 --> 00:25:03,985
In order to eradicate this vicious cycle of red-rooted evils,

345
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:08,235
I, the witness Kim Yo Han,

346
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:12,425
as the insider of their vast connection,

347
00:25:13,735 --> 00:25:17,095
hereby pledge to truthfully state all the facts that I know

348
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:19,895
without adding to or removing from the facts,

349
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:22,005
according to my

350
00:25:22,005 --> 00:25:23,925
honest conscience.

351
00:25:25,355 --> 00:25:26,675
<i>This morning at 11:00 a.m.,</i>

352
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:30,805
<i>in an intensive psychological trial of the Goldman scandal that has been going on for the past few days,</i>

353
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:35,445
<i>Lee Tae Gwang's video, which shocked the entire nation, has been released,</i>

354
00:25:35,445 --> 00:25:37,255
<i>raising great controversies.</i>

355
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:41,125
<i>This video is a video of evidence submitted while interrogating Deputy Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook,</i>

356
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:44,745
<i>who was originally charged with a criminal organization and instigated murder.</i>

Inspector Kwon...

402
00:28:23,255 --> 00:28:25,815

I was afraid that everything I endured for would be gone.

454
00:33:33,855 --> 00:33:35,445
Because I'm powerless...

455
00:33:35,445 --> 00:33:36,765
That's the kind of stuff

456

457
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:42,745

it's a crime of concealing a criminal.

502

How are you going to wrap this up?

514
00:37:41,455 --> 00:37:44,335
You think these people can report me?

515
00:37:56,935 --> 00:37:58,915
That part is really sensitive to pain.

516
00:37:58,915 --> 00:38:01,615
You have great endurance.

517
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:05,335
I guess I was right. Not everyone gets to pass the Bar exam.

518
00:38:05,335 --> 00:38:07,175
You scored the highest, right?

The sentence will be bad enough for all of you to be satisfied!

522

A person of your stature...

523
00:38:18,515 --> 00:38:21,535
wouldn't regret your past just because of some years behind the bars.

524

Those knees of yours, give them to me now.

525
00:38:23,955 --> 00:38:28,275
Knees are for kneeling. But you don't even kneel when you need to.

526
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:31,245
But there's a clear difference

527
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:34,015
in quality of life between having

528
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:36,175
just one leg crippled or both legs.

529
00:38:36,175 --> 00:38:37,775
So what?

00:38:38,955 --> 00:38:41,125
What is it that you want?

531
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:45,455
I have to know what you want, so I can do what you say!

Are you really going to do as I want?

533
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,525
I'll do everything you ask for.

534
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:04,635
Why?

535
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:08,245
Why are you doing this to just me?

536
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:15,965
When you sold me off to the brothel...

537
00:39:15,965 --> 00:39:18,335
When I was only 16,

538

who was mentioned as a senior candidate, stepped down due to an unsavory incident.

716
00:54:44,661 --> 00:54:46,351
Even more so for this happening's significance,

717
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:50,581
as the first case of the Corruption Investigation Agency, which will write the new history of the Korean legal field,

718
00:54:50,581 --> 00:54:55,521
I think Deep Pockets of the recent Goldman incident seem fitting.

719
00:54:56,651 --> 00:54:59,291
The thing that the nation desires as a whole.

720
00:55:00,021 --> 00:55:01,581
I'll bring it to

721
00:55:02,711 --> 00:55:04,711
our citizens.

722
00:55:04,711 --> 00:55:06,621
All of you elders...

723
00:55:06,621 --> 00:55:09,611
I'll get you all out by suspension of execution.

724
00:55:10,601 --> 00:55:12,331
How will you do that?

725
00:55:12,331 --> 00:55:15,351
I still have Sajik-dong.

726
00:55:16,531 --> 00:55:18,721
<i>Although the Sajik-dong team disbanded a while ago,</i>

727
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:21,491
<i>the server is still alive.</i>

728
00:55:21,491 --> 00:55:23,431
What's more important than people is the data.

729
00:55:23,431 --> 00:55:25,111
The information.

730
00:55:25,971 --> 00:55:28,181
The corruption of high-ranking government officials

731
00:55:28,181 --> 00:55:32,631
and presidential relatives that Sajik-dong's team has long dug up.

732
00:55:32,631 --> 00:55:35,201
In other words, the Deep Pockets outside the Shinseon-dong.

733
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:39,511
The corruption of political and political figures who are intertwined like cobwebs.

734
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:43,461
I have organized all of that nicely.

735
00:55:43,461 --> 00:55:44,901
So...

736
00:55:45,911 --> 00:55:49,531
you'll rid of those guys personally?

737
00:55:49,531 --> 00:55:52,501
Yes. I'll catch them and lock them up here and

738
00:55:52,501 --> 00:55:56,481
work to make the outside world yours

739
00:55:56,481 --> 00:55:58,741
with all of my life.

740
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:02,791
What is it that you want?

741
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:05,661
I would be so grateful if you can just grant me

742
00:56:05,661 --> 00:56:09,101
a shield as I head out to fight...

743
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:15,031
The newly launched...

744
00:56:15,031 --> 00:56:17,781
Corruption Investigation Agency, for example.

745
00:56:17,781 --> 00:56:19,901
You mean to say...

746
00:56:19,901 --> 00:56:21,821
I'll do my best.

747
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:24,041
We need to get rid of the old ways

748
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:27,371
and make a new world, you know?

749
00:56:37,711 --> 00:56:39,471
Jang Sun Oh?

750
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:11,901
It's a newbie.

751
00:57:54,451 --> 00:57:55,921
<i>Started eliminating Kim Yo Han.</i>

752
00:57:55,921 --> 00:57:58,591
<i>Started eliminating Oh Soo Yeon.</i>

753
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:39,031
Who is it?

754
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:41,961
Get out here, f***er.

755
00:59:32,231 --> 00:59:34,341
What is it? Hey, go out and check.

756
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:35,751
- Okay.
- Okay.

757
01:00:17,951 --> 01:00:19,511
Who are you?

758
01:00:19,511 --> 01:00:21,891
Pretty good face.

759
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:24,201
Where do you belong?

760
01:00:28,871 --> 01:00:31,601
[The National Intelligence Service: Lim Hui Su]

761
01:00:36,051 --> 01:00:37,881
Why would the National Intelligence Service...

762
01:00:38,681 --> 01:00:40,281
You know this person, right?

763
01:00:41,531 --> 01:00:44,621
She needs to be caught as soon as possible.

764
01:00:44,621 --> 01:00:48,231
But the only one who can approach her

765
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:50,061
right now happens to be you.

766
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:53,231
Why don't you...

767
01:00:53,231 --> 01:00:55,081
pull off one more job with us?

768
01:00:55,081 --> 01:00:58,861

772
01:01:06,111 --> 01:01:07,921
or fold.

773
01:01:07,921 --> 01:01:09,611
Either one, no?
