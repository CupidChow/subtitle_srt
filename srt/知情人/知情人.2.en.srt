00:17:57,329 --> 00:18:01,279
I heard you blew away his gambling house and ended up here.

180
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:08,259
Don't be scared.

181
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,509
Hae Do is my hoobae. Many years junior.

182
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:16,689
That much I can resolve on my own.

183
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:19,769
Think about it carefully.

184
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:21,429
Got it?

185
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,600
<i>[48th Judicial Training Institute Trainee, Prosecutors' Office Practical Training Completion Ceremony]</i>

186
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,940
- Congratulations! See you later!
- Thanks, good job.

187
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:41,961
Congratulations on being at the top of the class.

188
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,481
Thank you.

189
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:46,881
Knowing your father, he must be elated.

190
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:51,561
His son received the Chief Justice Award that he couldn't even get.

191
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,931
I owe it all to you.

192
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:03,401
Oh, right. I'm supposed to have lunch with my father later.

193
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:05,251
My father asked me to bring you there.

194
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:08,651
Your father said that?

195
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:14,961
I thought I should buy him jjajangmyeon, at least, since he completed his practicum.

196
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:19,611
You did a good job teaching my son, Chief Mok.

197
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:21,191
Thank you.

198
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:33,371
It's a pity that Director Noh passed away like that.

199
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:41,521
Then what will you do now?

200
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:47,161
Why don't you come to the Central District Prosecutors' Office from the Northern District?

201
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:49,891
We have a shortage of mid-level prosecutors.

202
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:52,981
There's Director Noh's case,

203
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:56,291
and there is that fucking Corruption Investigation Agency.

204
00:19:56,291 --> 00:20:02,191
At times like this, it'd be nice if someone from the 26th judicial class would smooth things over.

205
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:08,651
When you watch team sports such as soccer,

206
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:11,081
it's a battle of the strongest waists.

207
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,111
You have to be strong in the middle so that

208
00:20:14,111 --> 00:20:18,471
the front and rear can show off 200 percent of their skills

209
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:21,001
and eventually, the whole team wins.

210
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:24,491
We need that kind of victory now.

211
00:20:26,031 --> 00:20:27,591
What if...

212
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:33,231
I say I'd stay in the Northern District Prosecutor's office?

213
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:39,161
Then I'll have to look for someone else.

214
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:41,591
How can we live without a waist?

215
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:48,281
Is there anyone from the 26th class in the countryside somewhere?

216
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:53,641
But if we do that, you should fill that vacancy in the countryside.

217
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:57,641
Hey, Hyung Mok Jin.

218
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:01,651
Aren't you being too selfish if you won't even do that?

219
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:06,231
Bring more pickled radish.

220
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,461
Me?

221
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,641
And also that Kim Yo Han.

222
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:26,691
Make sure to sort things out on his case responsibly so we don't hear anything strange about it later.

223
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:31,281
Being one class ahead of you still makes me your sunbae.

224
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:34,361
You'd better use honorifics.

225
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:37,231
Or next time, Sunbaenim...

226
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:42,061
you'll have to go get pickled radish.

227
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:18,361
As promised,

228
00:22:18,361 --> 00:22:22,181
you'll give me the list of Korea Customs Service employees

229
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:24,261
who engaged in sex trafficking abroad.

230
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:28,181
I guess there are various ways to sell alcohol,

231
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:32,001
But what will you do with that list?

232
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:38,441
I need it to sell even more alcohol.

233
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:45,621
Aren't you afraid of people pointing fingers at you for working with a Japanese man?

234
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:52,111
I'm just a bar girl. Why would I be afraid of such a thing?

235
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:58,671
Are you a good person or a bad person?

236
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:03,821
I'm...

237
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:08,901
just a businesswoman.

238
00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:32,021

258

How do you know my grandson?

263
00:25:57,491 --> 00:26:00,461
I met with him for pro-bono legal consultation.

264
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:02,251
For my work.

265
00:26:02,251 --> 00:26:07,341
What kind of work do you do that you're so gutsy?

266
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:09,931
Oh, lawyer?

267

You haven't even visited your grandson because you're busy, right?

268
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:26,221
I heard it's freezing in prison even in the middle of the summer.

269
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,371

<i>Please pay off what you owe to Mr. Jo for your grandma's sake.</i>

<i>Mr. Jo is doing this because it's possible to pay it off from there.</i>

<i>so try to catch his attention.</i>

00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:36,701
<i>Then stay next to him and do me a favor.</i>

00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:41,551
<i>Then I'll take care of Hae Do for you.</i>

313
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:50,161
Yes, Hyungnim.

314
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:58,741
If you say so, then I have to obey, Hyungnim.

315
00:30:58,741 --> 00:31:03,071
So if I let Kim Yo Han go,

316
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:07,441
are you sure you'll give me your Sangju Corporation stock?

317
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:11,331
Right. Then I'll assume we have an agreement.

318
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:13,021
I got it.

319
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:16,201

323
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,571
I put a deposit down with this.

324
00:31:33,571 --> 00:31:37,551
And the balance is that Lee Tae Gwang you asked about.

325
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:40,431
As for that, after you finish your part...

326
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:44,511
I'll introduce Lee Tae Gwang to you after that.

327
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:49,211
Everything will be fine if you're a good gambler.

328
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:51,121
It's all about money.

329
00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:53,771
Be a goose that lays the golden egg.

330
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:58,581
Then he'll be blinded by gold and get close to you.

331
00:32:02,151 --> 00:32:06,321
When I get next to Jang Seon Oh,

332
00:32:06,321 --> 00:32:09,381
what are you going to ask me to do?

333
00:32:09,381 --> 00:32:11,191
Why?

334
00:32:11,191 --> 00:32:15,141
You won't do this if you hear about it and don't want to do it?

335
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:22,301
No. I'll do it.

336
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:26,031
The food used to be too greasy in the past, but it's okay nowadays.

337
00:32:26,061 --> 00:32:30,561
The warden is crazy about gambling, and he lost all his pension.

338
00:32:30,621 --> 00:32:35,451
The kingpin in the country had bitten off the back of his head,

339
00:32:35,451 --> 00:32:37,251
and he was about to die.

340
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:41,781
That kingpin put his henchman here and opened a gambling house

341
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:43,581
to collect the warden's debt.

342
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:46,301
That henchman is the Lee Tae Gwang you're looking for.

343
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:48,741
- And then?
- And then...

344
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:55,301
that Lee Tae Gwang was swallowed up by this freak, who came in later.

345
00:32:55,301 --> 00:32:58,321
No one knows where Lee Tae Gwang is right now.

346
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:00,121
The freak is?

347
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:04,831
The freak is Jang Seon Oh, you met yesterday.

348
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:09,301
If the warden acts as a house owner and attracts customers,

349
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:11,431
Jang Seon Oh plays as a player.

350
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,721

00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:26,041
Look up there.

355
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:29,371
I hear the security manager is a house manager.

356
00:33:29,371 --> 00:33:31,911
All the staff here are in cahoots.

357
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:36,511
And there are three leagues in total in this Seongju Prison.

358
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:40,311
<i>The lowest third league is the changing room.</i>

359
00:33:44,661 --> 00:33:47,491
<i>Cigarettes are used as chips here.</i>

360
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:50,511
Shit! What the hell!

361
00:33:57,851 --> 00:33:59,631
<i>If you play well there,</i>

362
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:02,591
<i>the staff will take you to the staff lounge.</i>

363
00:34:02,591 --> 00:34:04,061
<i>Why?</i>

364
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:07,481
<i>- For a dogfight.
- A dogfight?</i>

365
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:09,781
<i>From the second league on, it's a cash game.</i>

366
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:13,131
<i>They sometimes bet on prisoners while watching them play.</i>

367
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:16,091
<i>Or they sponsor good players and</i>

368
00:34:16,091 --> 00:34:18,251
<i>share the money that the players win.</i>

369
00:34:18,251 --> 00:34:21,721
<i>All the guards are crazy, trying to win a lot</i>

370
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:23,531
<i>while the warden is here.</i>

371
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:27,091
<i>And if you stand out from there, then where would you go?</i>

372
00:34:27,091 --> 00:34:30,101
<i>You'd go to the first league.</i>

373
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,991
<i>The leading battle in the Seongju Prison gambling house.</i>

374
00:34:32,991 --> 00:34:36,241
<i>Next to the dean of the Seongju school, Jang Seon Oh.</i>

375
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:40,011
What kind of person is Jang Seon Oh?

376
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,171
<i>A genius.</i>

377
00:34:41,171 --> 00:34:45,171
<i>They say he's a genius who appears once every few decades in the gambling scene.</i>

378
00:34:45,171 --> 00:34:48,421
<i>Geez, that young punk.</i>

379
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:50,861
Who is the warden bringing in today?

380
00:34:50,861 --> 00:34:53,051
They're Hanguk University professors.

381
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,521
Hanguk University?

382
00:34:57,421 --> 00:34:58,641
Stop.

383
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:01,271
Oh, my. What's wrong?

384
00:35:01,271 --> 00:35:04,461
Don't you know that if you screw over the nerds with bets, they'll get a tilt right away?
<i>(T/N: tilt - emotional breakdown from losing too much)</i>

385
00:35:04,461 --> 00:35:06,881
These punks!

386
00:35:06,881 --> 00:35:08,771
Don't Hanguk University professors poop?

387
00:35:08,771 --> 00:35:11,301
Do Hanguk University professors have three brains?

388
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:12,761
Put your hands together.

389
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,931
Gambling is all about spirit! Spirit!

390
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:17,441
Now, count to three.

391
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:18,541
One, two, three!

392
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:22,201
Seongju, Seongju, Seongju! Go! Fight! Win! Hey! Seongju School! Yay!

393
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:24,261
They're dead.

394
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:30,381
Hello.

395
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:33,071
This is Professor Park of Physics at Hanguk University.

396
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:35,011
Nice to meet you!

397
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:36,971
Good to see you.

398
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:38,851
Yes. He's an IT professor.

399
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:41,031
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to see you.

400
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:04,491
Here he comes.

401
00:36:09,611 --> 00:36:11,671
Sending a player today, right?

402
00:36:13,851 --> 00:36:16,101
- This newbie?
- Yes.

403
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:19,171
With 3369's detention money?

404
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:29,061
<i>[Third League]</i>

405
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:32,801
Hi, Hyungnim!

406
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,241
Sit over here.

407
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:41,071
Check the four cartons of cigarettes.

408
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:43,221
- Correct?
- Okay.

409
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:46,991
<i>One cigarette is 25,000 won.</i>

410
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:48,311
<i>Four cartons are</i>

411
00:36:48,311 --> 00:36:50,671
<i>- 20 million won.</i>
- A new face.

412
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:53,191
- Who is his sponsor?
- Song Doo Chul paid for him.

413
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:55,471
Bukyeongpa Song Doo Chul?

414
00:36:56,931 --> 00:37:00,201
Newbie. Good luck.

415
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,921
Okay, school's out.

416
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,651
Let's play.

417
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:08,561
<i>Texas Hold'em.</i>

418
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:11,111
<i>It's in the same family as Seven Poker.</i>

419
00:37:11,111 --> 00:37:14,321
<i>The difference is that each player is dealt two cards, and</i>

420
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:17,911
<i>the other five community cards are shown to all.</i>

421
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:31,061
<i>Each person gets two cards and makes a bet.</i>

422
00:37:31,841 --> 00:37:33,221
Call.

423
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:34,821
Out.

424
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:43,731
Call.

425
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:45,861
Flop.
<i>(TN: flop: the first three of the community cards are dealt)</i>

426
00:37:45,861 --> 00:37:48,731
<i>They bet again whenever the community cards are dealt.</i>

427
00:37:48,731 --> 00:37:50,131
Call.

428
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:54,541
Call.

429
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,341
<i>Every time you see a card,</i>

430
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:58,831
<i>you pay for a chance.</i>

431
00:38:00,441 --> 00:38:02,611
For two cards, I pay.

432
00:38:04,401 --> 00:38:05,731
- Call.
- Pay.

433
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,111
Pay.

434
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:20,711
Call.

435
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:25,741
One pair of sevens.

436
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:33,591
Wow. You sailed a deep-sea fishing boat, but you only caught trout.

437
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:35,331
Trout.

438
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:41,161
<i>If I keep this up, I'll find Lee Tae Gwang very soon.</i>

439
00:38:50,651 --> 00:38:52,301
<i>One pair of Kings.</i>

440
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:54,781
<i>Good. Let's go.</i>

441
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,281
Raise.

442
00:38:58,281 --> 00:38:59,601
- Die.
- Die.

443
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:01,561
- Die.
- Good job.

444
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:03,151
Out.

445
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:05,391
<i>Was I in a rush?</i>

446
00:39:06,621 --> 00:39:07,981
<i>All right.</i>

447
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,931
- Call.
- Out.

448
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:16,151
- Out.
- Out.

449
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:18,111
<i>Still not following me?</i>

450
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:23,101
<i>Then I'll bluff this time.</i>

451
00:39:23,101 --> 00:39:26,361
- Raise.
- Raise.

452
00:39:26,391 --> 00:39:28,231
Call this time.

453
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:30,121
- Okay.
- Call.

454
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:32,191
Call. Raise one more pack.

455
00:39:32,191 --> 00:39:33,531
Call.

456
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:42,281
<i>How do they know?</i>

457
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:47,361
<i>You were going to do this, right?</i>

458
00:39:47,371 --> 00:39:49,111
Give me some good cards.

459
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:01,681
<i>Nine-Double. No, I mean one pair of nines.</i>

460
00:40:01,681 --> 00:40:03,031
Let's see. Call.

461
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:06,021
<i>Isn't this good enough to go for it?</i>

462
00:40:18,171 --> 00:40:19,891
Raise.

463
00:40:23,391 --> 00:40:25,141
Out.

464
00:40:25,141 --> 00:40:28,651
- I'm out.
- I'm out, too.

465
00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:32,141
Call.

466
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:33,921
Raise two packs.

467
00:40:33,921 --> 00:40:35,241
<i>Raise?</i>

468
00:40:35,241 --> 00:40:36,601
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

469
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,831
<i>Is he holding a higher ranking hand than 9-Double?</i>

470
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:44,831
Call.

471
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:47,341
Flop.

472
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:54,421
<i>Jack, Queen, King, and Ace haven't been exposed.</i>

473
00:40:58,101 --> 00:40:59,571
Three packs.

474
00:41:01,071 --> 00:41:03,071
<i>What can it be?</i>

475
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:06,421
<i>If the final card is 9, then I'll get 9 three-of-a-kind.</i>

476
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:09,751
<i>If the final card is 3, 4, or 8, then I'll get two pairs.</i>

477
00:41:09,751 --> 00:41:11,551
<i>There's a chance.</i>

478
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:16,231
Call.

479
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,071
<i>King.</i>

480
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:35,891
Check.
<i>(T/N: check - pass the action to the next player, but keep their cards)</i>

481
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:38,731
<i>Why did he stall just now?</i>

482
00:41:38,731 --> 00:41:43,851
<i>Is he finishing with a check just in case I have a king?</i>

483
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:46,501
<i>Then I'll go safely.</i>

484
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:49,151
Check.

485
00:41:49,831 --> 00:41:51,621
River.
<i>(T/N: The final community card is dealt)</i>

486
00:41:55,211 --> 00:41:56,711
Raise one carton.

487
00:41:56,761 --> 00:41:59,961
- What the?
<i>- One carton?</i>

488
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:03,731
<i>If he had a King, he'd have done this earlier.</i>

489
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:07,901
<i>I don't think he'd pay one carton for a pair of 10s.</i>

490
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:11,321
<i>Or is he bluffing?</i>

491
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:18,311
Action.
<i>(T/N: All actions such as folding, calling, or raising)</i>

492
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:23,131
Call.

493
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,951
Look at that punk. Call my ass.

494
00:42:32,441 --> 00:42:36,041
<i>He was baiting me with a King from the beginning.</i>

495
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:39,231
I had a good dream last night for some reason.

496
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,911
That was an easy win.

497
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:43,791
Why didn't you cut us some slack?

498
00:42:46,051 --> 00:42:47,251
Hey, Kim!

499
00:42:47,251 --> 00:42:48,711
How did you play the game like that?

500
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:49,781
It's over.

501
00:42:49,781 --> 00:42:52,061
It's over. Hey, what the hell is this?

502
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:54,431
Are you a philanthropist?

503
00:42:54,431 --> 00:42:55,841
I can't help it.

504
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:57,561
This field is...

505
00:43:03,571 --> 00:43:06,951
Your prison labor starts with that thing, fucker.

506
00:43:43,111 --> 00:43:46,331
I keep getting a good hand.

507
00:43:56,661 --> 00:43:57,601
Raise.

508
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,881
- Call.
- Call.

509
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:02,151
- Call.
- Out.

510
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:04,601
- Out.
- Out.

511
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:06,591
Raise.

512
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:07,961
Raise.

513
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:10,591
I should call this time.

514
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:21,291
All in.

515
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,061
All in?

516
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:28,781
All in, too.

517
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:32,751
What's going on here?

518
00:44:35,931 --> 00:44:38,381
- Three-of-a-kind.
- Wow.

519
00:44:38,381 --> 00:44:40,741
Wait. Wait. Wait!

520
00:44:43,301 --> 00:44:45,541
2345.

521
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:48,111
It's Yangbang.

522
00:44:48,111 --> 00:44:51,761
This 234 is also Yangbang!

523
00:44:53,471 --> 00:44:56,331
Yangbang! Yangbang!

524
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:00,791
The meat is burning.

525
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:02,631
Sorry, Hyungnim.

526
00:45:02,631 --> 00:45:08,951
It's hard to win with Western painting* since you only dealt with Asian painting* before, right?
(T/N: Poker vs. Hwatoo, referring to art styles on the cards)

527
00:45:08,951 --> 00:45:11,271
I'll get used to it quickly.

528
00:45:11,271 --> 00:45:13,071
All right.

529
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:20,121
Let's start over again.

530
00:45:20,121 --> 00:45:23,891
Why don't we start over and win back everything we lost?

531

Don't strain too much standing on the edge of the cliff.

Did you lose it all already?

553

You should've come to us as soon as you got some money.

554

It means merciful God.

571
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,751
