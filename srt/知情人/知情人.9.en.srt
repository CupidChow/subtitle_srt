101
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,753

<i>Aside from this, I don't have any other piece of humanity left.</i>

360
00:32:48,158 --> 00:32:52,308
I took all the unpleasant memories and burned them.

361
00:32:52,308 --> 00:32:54,318
And here I am now.

362
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:06,838
- What about Jang Sun Oh?
- Not yet.

363
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,558
Actually...

364
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:26,018
it would be better if nothing was associated.

365
00:33:28,428 --> 00:33:29,648
Later on...

366
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:33,978
let's take all this down together.

367
00:33:35,338 --> 00:33:37,018
Lee Yeon Soo.

368
00:34:28,178 --> 00:34:30,398
Is this the life of an ex-convict?

369
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:32,668
Even though I'm released, it doesn't seem like it.

370
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:36,158
<i>The outside world and a prison cell are not all that different.</i>

371
00:34:50,848 --> 00:34:52,898
What did you do with the watch?

372
00:34:54,558 --> 00:34:57,358
I was in a rush and forgot.

373
00:34:57,358 --> 00:34:59,318
I told you before.

374
00:34:59,318 --> 00:35:01,148
Even if you fall into a firepit,

375
00:35:01,148 --> 00:35:03,308
don't ever take off the watch.

376
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:04,758
Okay.

377
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:09,748
So, what do I have to do starting today?

378
00:35:12,058 --> 00:35:16,588
Woo Sang Ki used a credit card last night in the Gangnam area.

379
00:35:16,588 --> 00:35:19,088
It takes money to stay hidden.

380
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:22,128
Today, you dab some ink on your hand

381
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:24,748
and declare, "I belong to Chairman"

382
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:27,118
and put your thumbprint seal on it.

383
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,988
See that building over there?

384
00:35:37,158 --> 00:35:39,428
There's a sauna on the sixth floor.

385
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:45,048
Woo Sang Ki?

386
00:37:03,968 --> 00:37:05,348
Woo Sang Ki?

387
00:37:08,118 --> 00:37:09,478
Woo Sang Ki...

388
00:37:17,448 --> 00:37:19,548
Woo Sang Ki? One minute.

389
00:37:19,578 --> 00:37:20,608
S***!

390
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,448
Woo Sang Ki!

391
00:37:36,448 --> 00:37:38,108
Hold on, Woo Sang Ki!

392
00:37:39,098 --> 00:37:40,428
Hold on!

393
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:46,508
Hold on!

394
00:37:47,368 --> 00:37:49,688
Please listen to me. I have something to tell you.

395
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:07,448
Can you give me a hand?

396
00:38:37,988 --> 00:38:39,498
I'm done.

397
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,808
Let's lift him.

398
00:39:12,118 --> 00:39:15,858
People who use knives in the kitchen have their biases.

399
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:20,068
There isn't a better knife that won't chip or break easily than this one.

400
00:39:21,078 --> 00:39:22,628
Here.

401
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:27,148
You get shy the first time

402
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:30,018
and especially tough if someone is watching.

403
00:39:30,018 --> 00:39:33,528
Use it to open the lid of the ink pad and seal it.*
(Metaphorically speaking, seal the deal by killing the man and prove yourself)

404
00:39:33,548 --> 00:39:35,998
I'll drive around and will be back.

405
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,938
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

406
00:39:37,938 --> 00:39:40,018
You even give me a time limit?

407
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:43,388
If you can't do it in that time, you couldn't do it even if you had a year.

408
00:40:18,278 --> 00:40:20,608
Spare my life, please.

409
00:40:20,608 --> 00:40:23,058
Please let me live.

410
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:27,208
I'm sorry.

411
00:40:28,078 --> 00:40:30,348
You need to die...

412
00:40:30,348 --> 00:40:31,828
so that...

413
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:35,638
we all can live.

414
00:40:36,618 --> 00:40:39,228
What do you mean?

415
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:48,248
Please, please let me go.

416
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:50,108
Please let me go!

417
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:51,958
Please let me go, sir. Please...

418
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:54,718
Please let me live. Please!

419
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:14,918
<i>At 6 a.m. this morning, on a hillside near Annam-si, Gyeonggi-do,</i>

420
00:41:14,918 --> 00:41:17,248
<i>a man was found dead.</i>

421
00:41:17,248 --> 00:41:19,598
[A body of a man found near Annam-si]
<i>The body was extensively damaged</i>

422
00:41:19,598 --> 00:41:21,458
[A body of a man found near Annam-si]
<i>that the face was not recognizable.</i>

423
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,268
<i>Based on the ID found near the area, the police</i>

424
00:41:24,268 --> 00:41:27,868
[Police says "Confirmed as a Korean-American man"]
<i>confirmed the victim to be Woo, who is an American national.</i>

425
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:30,048
[Police says "Confirmed as a Korean-American man"]
<i>The police are checking through the local CCTV cameras.</i>

426
00:41:30,048 --> 00:41:32,858
<i>The police will also check with the locals and launch an extensive investigation.</i>

427
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:36,548
I think we can use Kim Yo Han for further tasks on the outside.

428
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:48,608
My promise to you doesn't change.

429
00:41:49,818 --> 00:41:53,298
The fact that you secretly stole casino slush funds

430
00:41:53,298 --> 00:41:55,978
in order to drive out the Yang brothers.

431
00:41:55,978 --> 00:41:58,128
And for not reporting those facts to Sinseon-dong,

432
00:41:58,128 --> 00:42:02,268
you promised to share all the profits later. Do you mean that promise?

433
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:03,678
Yes.

434
00:42:03,678 --> 00:42:06,178
What? Are you anxious?

435
00:42:08,418 --> 00:42:13,798
That slush fund doesn't entirely belong to the Sinseon-dong's elders alone.

436
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:17,128
One-third of Goldman funds' account

437
00:42:17,128 --> 00:42:18,808
is held by Sinseon-dong.

438
00:42:18,808 --> 00:42:22,288
And another third by the outside elders of Sinseon-dong.

439
00:42:22,288 --> 00:42:24,608
And the remaining third by Macau.

440
00:42:25,448 --> 00:42:27,918
We may hide this from Sinseon-dong,

441
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:31,388
but the other Deep Pockets...

442
00:42:31,388 --> 00:42:33,748
If you get caught...

443
00:42:35,818 --> 00:42:39,698
That's why I said release Kim Yo Han to the outside.

444
00:42:42,648 --> 00:42:45,558
So, if it turns out that

445
00:42:45,558 --> 00:42:49,328
Do Won Bong can take over the Yang brothers...

446
00:42:49,328 --> 00:42:51,148
Are we out then?

447
00:42:53,778 --> 00:42:55,428
If we get cast aside,

448
00:42:56,578 --> 00:42:58,738
I'll go after Annie first.

449
00:42:58,738 --> 00:43:03,808
I mean, the Yang brothers should take responsibility for Woo Sang Ki's death.

450
00:43:03,808 --> 00:43:05,588
This is how I feel, Sunbae.

451
00:43:05,588 --> 00:43:07,748
Yang Hwa, Yang Joon, or Annie...

452
00:43:07,748 --> 00:43:09,338
We gave them the okay.

453
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:11,588
That's how they've been making a living until now.

454
00:43:12,418 --> 00:43:14,638
How dare she tells us to come and go?

455
00:43:15,518 --> 00:43:17,108
Byung Wook...

456
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:20,528
If you are going to change the line-up, wait until I'm retired.

457
00:43:20,528 --> 00:43:24,878
I want to live out my old age as comfortable

458
00:43:24,878 --> 00:43:26,938
and quiet as possible.

459
00:43:33,648 --> 00:43:35,198
They're here.

460
00:44:01,248 --> 00:44:04,738
I set the meeting here because I thought the casino would be uncomfortable for you two.

461
00:44:04,738 --> 00:44:06,538
Oh, yes. Thank you.

462
00:44:06,548 --> 00:44:11,368
Due to the Corruption Investigation Agency, we do need to be cautious.

463
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,908
I understand you'll be promoted to the assistant prosecutor at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

464
00:44:15,908 --> 00:44:18,148
Congratulations on your promotion.

465
00:44:18,148 --> 00:44:19,668
Thank you.

466
00:44:21,148 --> 00:44:25,988
So, when did you arrive in Seoul?

467
00:44:26,688 --> 00:44:29,268
I came as soon as I heard of Woo Sang Ki's death.

468
00:44:29,268 --> 00:44:32,018
I flew directly from Macau.

469
00:44:32,018 --> 00:44:34,208
It's an emergency.

470
00:44:38,778 --> 00:44:40,668
Am I the only one who thinks that?

471
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:48,598
Since Woo Sang Ki's disappearance until now,

472
00:44:48,598 --> 00:44:52,628
Goldman Casino was unable to launder 260 billion won.

473
00:44:52,628 --> 00:44:55,218
In other words, the Goldman slush fund

474
00:44:55,218 --> 00:44:57,858
is short by 260 billion won.

475
00:44:57,858 --> 00:44:59,838
Now that Woo Sang Ki is dead,

476
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:02,038
if this trend continues, it will be 60 billion won next month,

477
00:45:02,038 --> 00:45:03,328
then another 90 billion the month after-

478
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:05,308
A third of the Goldman account

479
00:45:05,308 --> 00:45:07,268
belongs to the Triad of Macau.

480
00:45:07,268 --> 00:45:09,588
And it's chairman election season over there.

481
00:45:09,588 --> 00:45:13,538
Goldman fund is seeing daily withdrawals of more than 1 billion each time.

482
00:45:15,108 --> 00:45:18,148
Macau is starting to ask for who is responsible for this.

483
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:19,668
This is an emergency...

484
00:45:20,558 --> 00:45:21,718
right?

485
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:22,898
Isn't that right?

486
00:45:22,898 --> 00:45:24,388
Actually Director...

487
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:29,128
This is all because of Do Won Bong, who used to manage the casino previously,

488
00:45:29,128 --> 00:45:30,678
abducted Woo Sang Ki...

489
00:45:30,678 --> 00:45:32,948
To take care of problems like that,

490
00:45:32,948 --> 00:45:35,988
we put you in your position.

491
00:45:35,988 --> 00:45:39,308
So that you will prevent issues like that from becoming.

492
00:45:39,308 --> 00:45:42,778
That's why you are all positioned where you are now.

493
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:50,988
Since earlier, you keep insinuating

494
00:45:51,738 --> 00:45:54,648
and placing us in the same league as these thugs.

495
00:45:56,308 --> 00:45:58,568
Do you think prosecutors are a joke?

496
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:00,678
Of course not.

497
00:46:00,678 --> 00:46:02,438
Prosecutor Yoon...

498
00:46:04,068 --> 00:46:05,428
Hey.

499
00:46:05,428 --> 00:46:06,948
You need to wise up.

500
00:46:06,948 --> 00:46:08,558
All this is because you guys

501
00:46:09,478 --> 00:46:12,508
usurped Do Won Bong and didn't do a good job of wrapping things up.

502
00:46:13,748 --> 00:46:18,048
Wasn't it your wish to keep Do Won Bong alive?

503
00:46:18,058 --> 00:46:19,058
What?

504
00:46:19,058 --> 00:46:22,708
When Do Won Bong was put away in Seongju Prison,

505
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:26,188
you said if he sends out prisoners to put them to work,

506
00:46:26,188 --> 00:46:28,938
there won't be criminals even if they kill people.

507
00:46:28,938 --> 00:46:31,888
And if there was a problem, it would be easy to handle.

508
00:46:31,888 --> 00:46:36,078
I'm saying, wasn't it you who said that?

509
00:46:36,078 --> 00:46:37,538
Thanks to that, you were also

510
00:46:37,538 --> 00:46:39,728
able to do a businessman cosplay without getting blood on your hands.

511
00:46:39,728 --> 00:46:41,988
So...

512
00:46:44,028 --> 00:46:45,988
in this situation,

513
00:46:45,988 --> 00:46:48,678
what makes any of us different from each other.

514
00:46:50,038 --> 00:46:52,158
You bastard...

515
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:03,368
You look very tired.

516
00:47:05,568 --> 00:47:07,508
No, I'm fine.

517
00:47:07,508 --> 00:47:09,938
Come and sit.

518
00:47:09,938 --> 00:47:11,948
Come. Come.

519
00:47:18,808 --> 00:47:21,328
Black or white cat.

520
00:47:21,328 --> 00:47:24,148
As long as it can catch a mouse.

521
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:28,758
When you go to Incheon,

522
00:47:28,758 --> 00:47:31,468
you'll find a casino called Goldman.

523
00:47:31,468 --> 00:47:33,638
I was managing it before.

524
00:47:33,638 --> 00:47:39,198
But I was forced to hand it over to some gangsters.

525
00:47:39,198 --> 00:47:43,218
And now, I'm planning to get it back.

526
00:47:43,888 --> 00:47:46,018
What do you need me to do first?

527
00:47:46,018 --> 00:47:48,008
Go play some games.

528
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:50,118
Go where I tell you to go.

529
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:51,878
If I tell you to win, you win.

530
00:47:51,878 --> 00:47:54,078
And lose when I tell you to.

531
00:47:55,548 --> 00:47:56,908
Yes, sir.

532
00:48:06,628 --> 00:48:08,578
What's the game he's referring to?

533
00:48:08,578 --> 00:48:11,238
A game you need to win if he tells you to.

534
00:48:11,238 --> 00:48:13,498
And a game you need to lose if he tells you to.

535
00:48:15,338 --> 00:48:17,718
Aren't we on the same side now?

536
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,598
Aren't you going to meet the guys from the first league before you go?

537
00:48:24,478 --> 00:48:25,788
No, I'm not.

538
00:48:26,928 --> 00:48:28,708
While you're doing all this,

539
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:31,418
they are most likely still playing the same games.

540
00:48:33,558 --> 00:48:35,468
You are more cold-hearted than you look.

541
00:48:48,438 --> 00:48:51,398
- Aigoo. It's been a long time.
- Welcome.

542
00:48:51,398 --> 00:48:53,918
Water, please.

543
00:48:56,328 --> 00:48:57,528
Diabetes?

544
00:48:58,638 --> 00:49:00,158
How about you?

545
00:49:00,158 --> 00:49:01,838
Not yet?

546
00:49:04,538 --> 00:49:08,048
The last time I had a health checkup was

547
00:49:09,008 --> 00:49:11,098
over 10 years ago.

548
00:49:11,098 --> 00:49:13,298
You're going to croak if you keep that up.

549
00:49:13,298 --> 00:49:14,688
Thank you.

550
00:49:15,718 --> 00:49:17,358
What are you looking for?

551
00:49:18,628 --> 00:49:20,218
Everything.

552
00:49:23,818 --> 00:49:25,698
How many players are there?

553
00:49:27,428 --> 00:49:29,578
Now...

554
00:49:30,518 --> 00:49:33,058
six former prisoners?

555
00:49:33,058 --> 00:49:36,208
Then all of them plus

556
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:38,288
three fixed cards plus

557
00:49:38,288 --> 00:49:40,238
three to five fixed phones plus

558
00:49:40,238 --> 00:49:43,398
one vehicle set up with communication interception equipment.

559
00:49:45,188 --> 00:49:49,418
You have to tell me if the target is a government agency.

560
00:49:49,418 --> 00:49:52,648
Our guys are all criminals.

561
00:49:53,888 --> 00:49:57,438
If they're to attack their original gangs, I have to pull them out.

562
00:49:57,438 --> 00:49:59,138
It's the Central Investigation Department of the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

563
00:50:00,278 --> 00:50:02,958
One person running a private foundation and...

564
00:50:04,688 --> 00:50:06,288
and one ex-convict

565
00:50:19,598 --> 00:50:22,968
On the condition of working for more than two months and that other thing we discussed.

566
00:50:22,968 --> 00:50:27,108
Including wages and rental fees, the total is

567
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:28,428
500 million.

568
00:50:28,428 --> 00:50:30,548
The payment in bearer bonds.

569
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:34,758
Hey...

570
00:50:35,988 --> 00:50:37,988
Do you even have money?

571
00:50:38,808 --> 00:50:40,768
I took out a mortgage loan

572
00:50:40,768 --> 00:50:42,128
against my house.

573
00:50:44,518 --> 00:50:48,408
Aigoo, you're nuts, trying to get yourself killed.

574
00:50:50,978 --> 00:50:52,838
They say if you put your life on the line,

575
00:50:54,578 --> 00:50:56,508
you'll live.

576
00:51:02,548 --> 00:51:04,198
Crazy...

577
00:51:12,818 --> 00:51:14,328
Yes.

578
00:51:14,328 --> 00:51:15,878
That I did a good job.

579
00:51:15,878 --> 00:51:19,698
He's telling me to enter a game now. It looks like it's about to start.

580
00:51:19,698 --> 00:51:21,298
Did you arrive, CEO?

581
00:51:21,298 --> 00:51:25,408
I arrived early and have been waiting here.

582
00:51:25,408 --> 00:51:28,588
I'll be there shortly. Please wait just a little longer.

583
00:52:10,998 --> 00:52:13,438
<i>Who do I have to kill?</i>

584
00:52:13,438 --> 00:52:15,208
<i>Woo Sang Ki.</i>

585
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:18,748
<i>The father of the kid you've been searching for.
</i>

586
00:52:20,488 --> 00:52:23,708
[Min Ho, call me.]

587
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,838
<i>Min Ho, call me.</i>

588
00:52:39,908 --> 00:52:41,718
CEO.

589
00:52:41,718 --> 00:52:44,898
We need to secure Woo Sang Ki.

590
00:52:44,898 --> 00:52:46,778
Here's that thing you wanted.

591
00:52:46,778 --> 00:52:49,148
- Thank you.
- And...

592
00:52:49,148 --> 00:52:52,278
that other thing is ready also.

593
00:52:52,278 --> 00:52:54,298
Find me a corpse that can't be identified.

594
00:52:54,298 --> 00:52:55,418
Please save me.

595
00:52:55,418 --> 00:52:57,868
Please! Let me go! Please!

596
00:52:57,868 --> 00:52:59,668
Please let me live!

597
00:53:07,188 --> 00:53:09,338
Woo Sang Ki, listen to me very carefully.

598
00:53:09,338 --> 00:53:12,818
Run for five minutes toward that direction.

599
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:15,528
You'll find a car there. Get inside the car.

600
00:53:15,528 --> 00:53:18,138
Who are you?

601
00:53:18,138 --> 00:53:19,328
Min Ho...

602
00:53:20,658 --> 00:53:22,758
I was there that day.

603
00:53:23,568 --> 00:53:25,848
What had happened to Min Ho... Min Ho...

604
00:53:26,628 --> 00:53:29,048
If you want to find out what happened to Min Ho,

605
00:53:29,048 --> 00:53:31,098
you need to do as I say.

606
00:53:31,768 --> 00:53:33,388
Please.

607
00:53:44,768 --> 00:53:46,928
If it weren't for me,

608
00:53:46,928 --> 00:53:48,508
Min Ho...

609
00:53:54,868 --> 00:53:56,868
will still be alive.

610
00:54:00,668 --> 00:54:02,408
Just...

611
00:54:05,058 --> 00:54:07,478
What happened?

612
00:54:15,828 --> 00:54:19,698
<i>What happened?</i>

613
00:54:28,988 --> 00:54:31,478
<i>It's safe here, right?</i>

614
00:54:32,448 --> 00:54:34,328
<i>As long you are not followed.</i>

615
00:54:35,728 --> 00:54:37,418
Did you find a solution?

616
00:54:50,898 --> 00:54:53,318
<i>I come and go without notice</i>

617
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:54,988
<i>so feel at ease here.</i>

618
00:54:57,508 --> 00:54:59,658
<i>This is your...
</i>

619
00:54:59,658 --> 00:55:01,568
<i>A lot, isn't it?</i>

620
00:55:03,858 --> 00:55:06,928
We need to secure Woo Sang Ki.

621
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,888
And Attorney Koo Bon Chul.

622
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,538
Both of them at the same time.

623
00:55:22,638 --> 00:55:24,168
Woo Sang Ki.

624
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:28,248
The day you escaped from the kidnappers...

625
00:55:28,248 --> 00:55:30,418
<i>Do you remember the date?</i>

626
00:55:33,918 --> 00:55:35,208
<i>That was...</i>

627
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:39,888
June 9th.

628
00:55:49,728 --> 00:55:52,138
When were you aware of the wiretapping?

629
00:55:52,138 --> 00:55:55,178
You track my location. What will stop you from wiretapping me?

630
00:56:10,428 --> 00:56:14,228
[99-11 Yeongpo-dong 5th Street]

631
00:56:16,438 --> 00:56:18,548
[99-11 Yeongpo-dong 5th Street]

632
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:22,628
[99-11 Yeongpo-dong 5th Street]

633
00:56:23,418 --> 00:56:25,988
[99-11 Yeongpo-dong 5th Street]

634
00:56:34,998 --> 00:56:37,938
Woo Sang Ki escaped from Jang Sun Oh on June 9th.

635
00:56:37,938 --> 00:56:41,528
I went to pick you up after Chairman Do Won Bong gave me the address the day after.

636
00:56:44,048 --> 00:56:45,558
That day, Chairman Do...

637
00:56:45,558 --> 00:56:47,828
intended to kill you and me both.

638
00:56:47,828 --> 00:56:49,958
He wanted to kill us both.

639
00:56:52,738 --> 00:56:54,598
<i>When was this taken?</i>

640
00:56:54,598 --> 00:56:56,558
<i>This was...</i>

641
00:57:01,688 --> 00:57:05,778
<i>Aside from this, I don't have any other piece of humanity left.</i>

642
00:57:05,778 --> 00:57:07,358
<i>I took all the unpleasant memories</i>

643
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:09,808
<i>and burned it.</i>

644
00:57:09,808 --> 00:57:11,868
<i>And here I am now.</i>

645
00:57:16,098 --> 00:57:19,078
Why does Chairman Do want you dead?

646
00:57:25,968 --> 00:57:27,248
Attorney Koo.

647
00:57:28,188 --> 00:57:30,238
If we want to live through this,

648
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:33,128
how about we combine our efforts?

649
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:37,418
[99-11 Yeongpo-dong 5th Street]

650
00:57:48,248 --> 00:57:50,938
Did you prepare the corpse to burn as a substitute?

651
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:53,858
Yes.

652
00:57:53,858 --> 00:57:56,538
Then you can take that car and go down.

653
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:06,448
Don't take the watch off.

654
00:58:10,508 --> 00:58:11,888
Attorney...

655
00:58:13,328 --> 00:58:16,278
