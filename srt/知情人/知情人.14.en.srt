We're stabbing Yoon Byung Wook down from even higher.

13

Then we send Yoon Byung Wook to court

Inspector,

30
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:44,833
which division do you really belong to?

31
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,583
You're registered as an inspector

32
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,003
and you have a desk in your office, too.

33
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:52,193
But you're always working offsite.

00:02:52,193 --> 00:02:55,063

00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:56,823

100
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:38,553
But it's not an exaggeration to say

101
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:41,503
that the first case decides the course of our futures.

102
00:07:42,513 --> 00:07:46,143
The Corruption Investigation Agency must make a good start

103
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:47,683

107
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,613

109
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:06,883

111
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:18,013

00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:22,543
vanished.

115
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,513

116
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:29,883

117
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:32,283

118
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:34,343

119
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:39,673
Can I not?

120
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,313
You haven't heard...

121
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,733

122
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:47,323

124
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:52,183
has set his mind to strike all of you.

125
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:57,883
You can assume that Seocho-dong also fell into Kim Yo Han's hands.

126
00:08:57,883 --> 00:09:00,333
Kim Yo Han decided to turn over

127
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,033
the casino manager's profit to Seocho-dong.

128
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:06,473
That crazy...

129
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:08,703
So why is he taking it that far?

130
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:11,673
He put his life on the line for his revenge.

131
00:09:11,673 --> 00:09:15,893
Right now, I'm the only person who can protect you

132
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:18,973
from Kim Yo Han.

133
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:29,203
How would we trust you?

134
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,793
I also...

135
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:36,293
put my life on the line for revenge.

136
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:45,293
How do you plan to get Kim Yo Han?

137
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,313
That Kim Yo Han, he's a tiger now.

138
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:52,933
He's not the cub you used to know.

139
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:54,373
So...

140
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:57,183
how do you plan to capture that tiger?

141
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:02,523
With the mindset of

142
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:06,393

[Present]

144
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:18,893
Someone definitely told them in advance

145
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:21,213
that we were coming in to strike them.

146
00:10:23,153 --> 00:10:26,983
I'm sure Sinseon-dong's eyes and ears are at Northern District Prosecutors' Office.

147
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:28,263
Right.

148
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:29,783
I'm sure there are.

149
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:38,543
That's why I asked for a warrant

150
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:41,013
for Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes.

151
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:44,703
So that they'll never know my target was Sinseon-dong.

152
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:54,583
Was it you?

153
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:57,753
Excuse me?

154
00:10:57,753 --> 00:11:01,363
To hang a target on my back,

155
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:03,043
did you plan that?

156
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:20,303
Would I create trouble, so all of us could go down together?

157
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:21,773
Besides...

158
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:26,623
I was the one wearing the shackles.

159
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:41,223
In any case,

160
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:44,943
we should watch out for wiretaps more than people.

161
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:46,913
Being wiretapped in Sinseon-dong was part of every day there.

162
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:49,313
So, CEO Oh,

163
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:52,103
you're conducting security checks throughout the casino?

164
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:53,163
Yes.

165
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:54,923
To see if there are any hidden bugs

166
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,863
and to see if the internet network and phone lines are safe.

167
00:11:57,863 --> 00:12:00,923
I'll let you know when I have a specific schedule.

168
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:02,213
Okay.

169
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:04,533
And we don't know what Sinseon-dong will do.

170
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:05,773
For now, I'll tell Mr. Jo

171
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:09,283
to strengthen overall casino and personal security.

172
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:15,663
Too much work has piled up while the owner of this room was switched out.

173
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:17,633
So the Deep Pockets don't worry,

174
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:20,443
let's normalize the money laundering first

175
00:12:20,443 --> 00:12:24,323
and take care of the rest of the tasks one thing at a time.

176
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:32,783
How is...

177
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,003
Attorney Koo?

178
00:12:38,313 --> 00:12:41,603
We can tie up the hands and feet of Sinseon-dong with this hostage.

179
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:43,243
You must keep him alive.

180
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,163
He's being taken care of.

181
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:24,563
You should've used the shot from the get-go.

182
00:13:24,563 --> 00:13:25,913
Why did you hurt his face...

Arrhythmia means your heart will get a cramp.

00:25:02,077 --> 00:25:05,087
Then those owners are...

361
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:08,447
Macau and Sinseon-dong...

362
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:12,837
and the people who own one-third shares of Goldman shares,

363
00:25:12,837 --> 00:25:15,617
the Deep Pockets outside of the Sinseon-dong?

364
00:25:24,347 --> 00:25:26,647
Then why...

365
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:29,037
are you locked up in here?

366
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:33,737
It's not that we can't leave here.

367
00:25:33,737 --> 00:25:35,627
We choose not to leave.

368
00:25:36,907 --> 00:25:40,647
I don't know what the difference is now.

369
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:45,647
Did you look for Attorney Koo's replacement?

370
00:25:57,787 --> 00:26:00,827
<i>There is one candidate who's not too bad.</i>

371
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:03,297
How about your comrades of collaboration and cooperation?

372
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:06,237
<i>Chairman, let's meet.</i>

373
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:10,377
I'm gathering people who have enough motivation.

374
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:16,207
Make sure you kill...

375
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,277
Kim Yo Han.

376
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:25,197
Yes, I got it.

377
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:38,387
I met with the elders in Sinseon-dong.

378
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:44,887
Sinseon-dong?

379
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:52,047
Sinseon-dong said Kim Yo Han is fired.

380
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:56,767
And they told me Sinseon-dong's new Go-to woman is...

381
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:00,967
is me now.

382
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:03,837
<i>Did she part ways with Kim Yo Han?</i>

383
00:27:05,187 --> 00:27:07,267
Is Attorney Koo alive?

384
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:11,137
<i>Is that why Oh Soo Yeon hid Sinseon-dong?</i>

385
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:12,697
Yes.

386
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:16,307
As of now.

387
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:17,927
When that position opens up,

388
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:21,037
I'd like to recommend you, Chief.

389
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:24,507
Me?

390
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:29,847
An errand boy is a lowly slave.

391
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:34,207
But you can say Attorney Koo's position is...

392
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:37,697
kind of like a servant who receives annual pay.

393
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:41,137
I vote for trying it out.

394
00:27:58,317 --> 00:27:59,937
Why me?

395
00:28:00,657 --> 00:28:03,407
Because Mok Jin Hyung is capable of more.

396
00:28:04,337 --> 00:28:07,247
Since Chief Mok never got

397
00:28:07,247 --> 00:28:11,307
a proper chance to shine yet.

398
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:16,787
You could become even bigger than who you are now.

00:28:30,117 --> 00:28:33,867

One chief prosecutor

435

Only in darkness.

437
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,147
A prosecutor in Korea

438
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:16,207
could kill someone in bright daylight in front of all the people.

439
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,667

440
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,717

449
00:32:36,877 --> 00:32:40,167

00:33:23,027 --> 00:33:25,597
Yes. You can team up

you're more than capable of beating Kim Yo Han and Yoon Byung Wook.

Even if he's released from here,

471

536
00:39:34,057 --> 00:39:35,677
What's wrong?

537
00:39:35,677 --> 00:39:37,707
Mok Jin Hyung at Northern District Prosecutors' Office.

538
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:39,327
Who saved him?

539
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:43,017
I heard it was the Minister's office.

540
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:45,797
<i>We have to have that in our hands</i>

541
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:49,827
<i>so we won't get dragged by Seocho-dong later.</i>

542
00:39:49,827 --> 00:39:52,437
<i>Thank you!</i>

543
00:40:06,257 --> 00:40:09,767
Did you hear that the Minister's office revived Mok Jin Hyung?

544
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:11,287
I heard the Minister did that.

545
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:14,837
Whether Mok Jin Hyung kissed the minister or deputy minister's a**,

546
00:40:14,837 --> 00:40:17,277
that's not the problem here.

547

As for Goldman...

551
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:34,537
many people will pay attention to it.

552
00:40:34,537 --> 00:40:37,167
So we don't have to worry too much about it, but...

553
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:38,477
But?

554
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:42,547
But you know...

555

556

00:40:50,137 --> 00:40:52,707

559
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:57,147
You know? He said he had a recording of Yang Joon gambling.

560
00:40:57,147 --> 00:41:00,187
He said you were recorded there, too.

561
00:41:00,187 --> 00:41:03,707

563
00:41:06,307 --> 00:41:08,847
Right. Did you find it?

565
00:41:16,427 --> 00:41:19,027

Okay, use your fingers...

567
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:28,797
Good job. Let's try one more.

568

<i>After Lee Tae Gwang became imbecile,</i>

569
00:41:31,027 --> 00:41:33,457

You'll notice a big difference whether you have your hyungnim with you or not.

573
00:42:19,857 --> 00:42:22,817
Anyway, that a**hole Jo Hae Do

574

587
00:44:07,677 --> 00:44:09,427
As we expected.

588
00:44:12,377 --> 00:44:14,077

and plan to share the casino

603
00:44:53,987 --> 00:44:57,497
to those people who helped you. That's what I'd tell him.

604
00:44:59,277 --> 00:45:00,857
Then...

605
00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:05,957

620

But you know...

649

That we're not Air Line.

651
00:47:42,107 --> 00:47:43,497

How about the other two men?

656
00:48:21,087 --> 00:48:23,847
They've entrusted me with everything.

657
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:25,727
Where is Chief Mok?

658
00:48:30,047 --> 00:48:33,307
If we don't remove all the bugs tonight, we're all dead.

659
00:48:33,307 --> 00:48:34,967
You can't miss even one.

660
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:36,297
Got it?

661
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:40,677
You're a busy man.

662
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:45,547
So...

663
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:49,277
why did you ask us to come?

664
00:49:03,977 --> 00:49:06,947

665
00:49:11,127 --> 00:49:12,817
And the daughter from back then...

666
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:14,777
Lee Yeon Soo...

667
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:16,617

Your Oh Soo Yeon?

672
00:49:27,157 --> 00:49:31,157
Kim Yo Han will stand Yoon Byung Wook in court for instigating murder,

[Jin Soo Min: ID number, phone number, ID, Password]

678

679
00:49:54,217 --> 00:49:55,867
You want me to open up everything?

680
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,137
This is going to cost you.

681
00:49:57,137 --> 00:49:59,877
Seventy million won you owe in prison.

682
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:02,397
If I cancel that, would that work?

683
00:50:02,397 --> 00:50:06,687
<i>I hear he has Jin Soo Mi's ledger with a record of the payments</i>

684
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:10,127
<i>you received from Manager Yang way back when.</i>

685
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:13,317
In that ledger, if it records Yoon Byung Wook wanted us dead...

686
00:50:13,317 --> 00:50:15,657
I'm sure it's me he wants dead.

687
00:50:15,657 --> 00:50:18,887
If he instigates Kim Yo Han to kill me,

688
00:50:20,077 --> 00:50:23,207
Kim Yo Han's weapon is set.

689
00:50:26,937 --> 00:50:29,427
So I was thinking...

690
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:32,717
if you scare Yoon Byung Wook a little bit-

691
00:50:41,187 --> 00:50:42,987
It's been a while...

692
00:50:42,987 --> 00:50:45,877

693
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,417

696
00:51:17,877 --> 00:51:19,437
Why...

697
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,627
Why are you dragging your feet?

698
00:51:23,627 --> 00:51:25,717
Oh Soo Yeon.

699
00:51:25,717 --> 00:51:27,767
You prepared a lot.

700
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:32,277
You worked hard. But whether it's a ledger or a recording inciting murder...

701
00:51:32,277 --> 00:51:35,707
You need a corpse and a criminal who confesses to the killing.

702
00:51:35,707 --> 00:51:38,267
That's when the crime has occurred.

703
00:51:38,267 --> 00:51:39,267
Pardon?

704
00:51:39,267 --> 00:51:42,777
You need Yang Hwa in your plan.

705
00:51:42,777 --> 00:51:44,247
You need Yang Hwa to stand in court

706
00:51:44,247 --> 00:51:47,757
and confess that he killed people because Yoon Byung Wook told him to.

707
00:51:47,757 --> 00:51:50,317
Then you can put away Yoon Byung Wook.

708
00:51:50,317 --> 00:51:52,417
Using Kim Yo Han,

709
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:55,117
you'll try to catch Yoon Byung Wook?

710
00:51:55,117 --> 00:51:57,497
Then Kim Yo Han really has to kill a person.

711
00:51:57,497 --> 00:51:59,897
Do you think he could do that?

712
00:52:01,287 --> 00:52:04,947
Hey! You're on the same team with Kim Yo Han, right?

713
00:52:07,507 --> 00:52:09,677
I have no idea what you're talking about.

714
00:52:09,677 --> 00:52:14,467
You got me once. You think I'd fall for it twice, you rotten b****!

715
00:52:17,147 --> 00:52:19,817
I already told Chairman Yang everything.

716
00:52:21,127 --> 00:52:24,067
Chairman Yang reported to Annie.

717
00:52:31,397 --> 00:52:32,457
[VIP J]

718
00:52:36,617 --> 00:52:41,617
Kim Yo Han asked to meet with Annie. And they sent the Yang brothers there.

719
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:44,297
Hand over your phone while I'm using my words.

720
00:52:51,387 --> 00:52:53,257
I said give me your phone.

721
00:52:56,937 --> 00:53:00,447
Your pretty little hands shouldn't hold something like that.

722
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:05,257
Give it to me.

723
00:53:05,257 --> 00:53:07,417
Didn't you see Chairman Yang's leg?

724
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:10,727
If you don't listen to me,

725
00:53:10,727 --> 00:53:13,297
[Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook]
I have no choice but to call him.

726
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:18,917
If you shoot,

727
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:20,977
this place will be the source location.

728
00:53:20,977 --> 00:53:22,727
If you can't shoot,

729
00:53:22,727 --> 00:53:26,007
Yoon Byung Wook will find out you and Kim Yo Han's plan.

730
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:29,437
<i>Yo Han should kill this moron.</i>

731
00:53:29,437 --> 00:53:31,577
If you put that down...

732
00:53:31,577 --> 00:53:33,697
and let me leave,

733
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:36,777
considering my affection for you in the past, I'll give you

734
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:38,827
a day to run away.

735
00:53:38,827 --> 00:53:42,057
<i>I shouldn't kill this moron right now.</i>

736
00:53:43,907 --> 00:53:46,747
It's all over.

737
00:53:46,747 --> 00:53:49,587
Your plan is ruined.

738
00:53:49,587 --> 00:53:51,207
You said you know someone in Japan, right?

739
00:53:51,207 --> 00:53:54,317
Run away there and depend on them to hide you.

740
00:53:55,387 --> 00:53:57,787
If you must...

741
00:53:57,787 --> 00:54:01,257
capture Yoon Byung Wook with your hands,

742
00:54:02,747 --> 00:54:05,177
you must survive for now.

743
00:54:08,427 --> 00:54:10,557
I've been pushed out from Sinseon-dong.

744
00:54:10,557 --> 00:54:12,197
By Oh Soo Yeon.

745
00:54:13,637 --> 00:54:17,397
And Oh Soo Yeon helped Yang Hwa escape while on transport.

746
00:54:17,397 --> 00:54:19,357
It was her doing.

747
00:54:26,637 --> 00:54:30,027
Thanks. I enjoyed the drink.

748
00:54:32,067 --> 00:54:34,077
S***!

749
00:54:49,367 --> 00:54:51,497
<i>- The call is not going through.</i>
- S***...

750
00:55:03,607 --> 00:55:05,387
My gosh...

751
00:55:16,137 --> 00:55:18,607
Why are you here?

752
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,877
[To Yang Hwa: Kim Yo Han and Oh Soo Yeon are on the same team]

753
00:55:40,877 --> 00:55:45,287
Two managers have already been taken in just this week.

754
00:55:46,607 --> 00:55:49,367
How on earth do you handle the work?

755
00:55:53,357 --> 00:55:55,587
You're my substitute?

756
00:55:57,617 --> 00:56:00,247
I'm not a substitute.

757
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:07,077
I'm replacing you. You're fired.

758
00:56:54,257 --> 00:56:58,257
This was used for animal anesthesia.

759
00:56:58,257 --> 00:57:01,627
You're supposed to use half the size of your pinky nail on a human.

760
00:57:02,617 --> 00:57:04,257
I'm sorry.

761
00:57:08,177 --> 00:57:09,937
And I'm extremely grateful...

762
00:57:11,307 --> 00:57:13,727
for things I was grateful to you for.

763
00:57:19,747 --> 00:57:23,697
Chief Mok Jin Hyung became Sinseon-dong elders' new representative.

764
00:57:23,697 --> 00:57:25,407
A current prosecutor?

765
00:57:26,637 --> 00:57:28,297
I'm sorry, but...

766
00:57:28,297 --> 00:57:30,627
if I lose the casino,

767
00:57:30,627 --> 00:57:32,547
if I go down,

768
00:57:32,547 --> 00:57:34,557
you're next, Chief Prosecutor.

769
00:58:04,217 --> 00:58:07,457
[To Yang Hwa: Kim Yo Han and Oh Soo Yeon are on the same team]

770
00:58:08,847 --> 00:58:11,297
Send out the message.

771
00:58:11,297 --> 00:58:13,387
Whoever kills Kim Yo Han

772
00:58:13,387 --> 00:58:16,597
is the next manager of the casino.
