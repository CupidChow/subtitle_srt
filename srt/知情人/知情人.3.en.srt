[Insider]

2
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:14,788
On June 8, in the first episode of "Insider",

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,755
we apologize for causing concern to the Buddhist community and viewers by describing the shrine where Buddha,

4
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:21,880
a symbol of Buddhism, was enshrined as a gambling hall,

5
00:00:21,904 --> 00:00:24,958
and broadcasting a scene where a person posing as a monk illegally gambles.

6
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:28,924
The temple shrines and characters that were the background of the scene are fictional creations

7
00:00:28,948 --> 00:00:31,832
and revealed that we have no intention of destroying a particular religion.

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,103
We will pay more attention during the production process so that there is no inconvenience in viewing in the future.

9
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:39,206
Once again, we apologize to the viewers.

10
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:43,741
(All people, places, organizations, and incidents
appearing in this series are entirely fictional.)

11
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,430
The trump card has a total of four pictures.

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,450
It has a total of 52 cards.

13
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,650
And those 52 cards can create for the first 2 cards a variety of

14
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,230
169 different hands.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,620
After receiving a hand of the first 2 cards,

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:11,180
you have to know how your cards are stacked up against the other hands.

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:11,890
Raise.

18
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,630
A pair of Aces is considered the top rank cards.

19
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,620
A pair of aces is considered the best hand in all the games, but

20
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,190
how about a 10-double?

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,420
How do you think a 10-double would rank?

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,730
Ace one pair, K one pair, Q one pair, J one pair.

23
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,110
Isn't that a fifth-place hand?

24
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:35,230
In Hold'em, a 10-double is lower than a pair of A and K.

25
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,210
So, starting now, from 1st to 169th,

26
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,160
I will recite it for you.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,830
A-all in one time?

28
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,880
Why? Do you want me to do it in parts?

29
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,140
No, go ahead.

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,100
W-wait...

31
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,680
(He chants the hands in the rhythm of Buddhist chant)

32
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,530
Do you know how to calculate a winning percentage?

33
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,520
Imagine I have a 7 and an 8.

34
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,900
The received hand has a 7 and an 8.

35
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,970
And the middle is lined up with a 5, 6, and an A.

36
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,180
If a 4 or 9 comes up, it's a straight.

37
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,110
Is this worth a match?

38
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,310
There's a total of four 4's.

39
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,710
And four of 9's.

40
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,850
And there are 8 cards that can create a 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

41
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,010
You have only a few out of the 8 cards.

42
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,990
You can say that your opponent has beat you in this game.

43
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:21,070
If you subtract those 5 from the total of 52 cards, and out of the remaining 47,

44
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,100
if eight cards belong to me...

45
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,400
Eight out of 47 cards...

46
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,080
The probability of getting one of eight cards on the next turn is 17%.

47
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,670
If going all the way to the river, then it's twice that at 34%.

48
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,550
In Hold'em, the position...

49
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,280
Your position is very important in this game.

50
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,560
[Dealer]

51
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,730
[Small Blind]

52
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,600
[Button / Big Blind]
Those who have to bet from the start like this

53
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,500
[Early-Late positions / Hijack / Cut-off]
have no choice but to inevitably expose themselves

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,780
[Under the Gun]
to others by how they bet.

55
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,170
Call.

56
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,620
Those who bet later

57
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,540
can plan their moves according to how the others made their bets.

58
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,270
So it's very advantageous.

59
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,110
Even though they may have the same hands,

60
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,300
they can have a different result.

61
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,070
I see...

62
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,860
I think I'll be leaving shortly.

63
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,150
I lost a sense of time.

64
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,710
Although it may not be exact.

65
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,130
By any chance,

66
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,740
are you Lee Tae Gwang?

67
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,320
Are you asleep?

68
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,640
Sir...

69
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,380
Hey, 2345.

70
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,680
I called out to the one in the next room, but there was no response.

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,040
He went back to his room last night.

72
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,300
- What?
- You need to come out, too, 2345.

73
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,000
Your 20 days are over.

74
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,120
What's with you?

75
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,600
Please give me one more chance.

76
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,540
I can even pay for the game myself with the detention money I received.

77
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,690
The money you lost before, I will get it back

78
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,960
including interest.

79
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,600
And I will go up to the 1st league

80
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,680
and I will surely complete

81
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,450
what you asked of me.

82
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,610
Fold.

83
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,300
Fold.

84
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,470
Fold.

85
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,000
Fold.

86
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,880
This, I can do.

87
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,060
Raise.

88
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,970
Call and raise.

89
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,140
I guess he's got a pretty good hand.

90
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,380
Let's check the flop.

91
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,400
Call.

92
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,850
Flop.

93
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,950
Check.

94
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,420
Check.

95
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,340
He's got a mediocre hand also.

96
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,800
If he's got even one Jack, he would've bet instead of checking.

97
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,680
But he raised even before seeing the first three cards.

98
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,460
He may not have a J, but he might have at least a pair.

99
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,900
Turn.

100
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,800
I got a J, 4, two pair.

101
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,500
Let's find out what he's got.

102
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,820
Raise.

103
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,430
Call.

104
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,560
River.

105
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,590
It's impossible to make a flush with five diamonds.

106
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,290
No straight, either.

107
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,890
Let's bet aggressively and see how he reacts.

108
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,590
Raise a carton.

109
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,980
- What a man!
- He's the bomb.

110
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,440
Okay! Call.

111
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,930
All in.

112
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,270
That's right! Right on!

113
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,800
- Amazing!
- Look at that.

114
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,900
Look at that.

115
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,500
All right. Are you for real or are you bluffing?

116
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,220
What's certain is that you think I'm a pushover.

117
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,680
You're looking at me as someone beneath you.

118
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,840
You are bluffing.

119
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,050
Call.

120
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,430
Another raise.

121
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,750
He's raising again?

122
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,170
I'm getting chills. The chills...

123
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,750
What's this?
(Qs-Js over As-5s)

124
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,630
Wow, what the heck?

125
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,560
Hey, what are you doing?

126
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,330
- If you've lost it all, get up.
- One second.

127
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,320
Wait!

128
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,950
D*** it!

129
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,220
W-wait...

130
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,010
Okay.

131
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,360
All of you should go to sleep.

132
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,440
It's time to start taking care of your physical condition.

133
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,130
Gil Sang,

134
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,090
do you know what movie they are planning to show?

135
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,480
Yes, well, I'm not sure what it's about, but

136
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,580
it's two and a half hours long.

137
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,140
That's enough.

138
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,360
If you miss this day, he'll be getting out soon.

139
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,280
- There's no next year.
- Yes, Hyungnim.

140
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,300
[The 18th]

141
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,610
Two.

142
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,690
Four.

143
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,690
Six.

144
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,970
Eight.

145
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,270
Each pack is 50, so it's 400 altogether.

146
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,220
This should be more than enough to cover the last three weeks' missed payment plus interest.

147
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,670
You freak, you think this is money?

148
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,020
That's why...

149
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm including extra for labor.

150
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,010
Wow, I'm dumbfounded.

151
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,490
You guys were also after my house instead of money.

152
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,560
Don't I just have to pay the price that matches the money I owe?

153
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,720
We do have a debtor-creditor relationship, but

154
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,200
we are in jail.

155
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,080
For a person to leave as a cripple.

156
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,650
It's not strange at all.

157
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,320
What is it?

158
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,840
Paying for damages.

159
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,120
Hey!

160
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,320
Back off. Back off!

161
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,280
How dare you puny gamblers act like gangsters?

162
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,080
We can beat them 500,000 won worth, right?

163
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,550
I don't think this is enough, though...

164
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,210
Bite down, or you'll lose your teeth.

165
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,760
Does no prison staff want to take you to the break room yet?*
(It means going up to the next league)

166
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,420
No, not yet.

167
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,570
Then it will take some time to see Jang Sun Oh's face.

168
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,790
As for these flowers,

169
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,150
you have to keep looking at them, touch them.

170
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,970
That's how the friendship blossoms.

171
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,780
You'll have to go to the outpatient today.

172
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,150
- Outpatient?
- Yeah.

173
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,870
That guy is pretty much at the infirmary all the time.

174
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,420
So, go and smell some antiseptic

175
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,590
and make some friends before coming back here.

176
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,530
Gil Sang will help you.

177
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,290
Come on!

178
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,980
Let go! Let go of me!

179
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,200

If your hand is injured, it'll affect you holding the cards at night.

181
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,860
But if we stab your stomach with the hoe or shovel,

182
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,170
we have to worry about you getting tetanus.

If your injury is not convincing, then Jang Sun Oh will cause you more pain.

That's why I need money.

It's a physical reaction that shows up, like locking and loading right before lying.

287
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,060

00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,520

You knew the cops were coming that night also.

299
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,500
No. I'll stay a little longer.

Why did you keep checking up on Chairman Yang?

312
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,570
According to the tabloid rumors,

00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,170

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,950
Yeah.

00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,270
5735. This one?

330
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,060
I pressed it.

331
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,440
Is that it then?

332
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,710
What about the camera?

333
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,510
Do you see it?

334
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,590

[Warden's Office]

336
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,900

337
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,350
Have a seat over there.

338
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,640
I understand you were about to graduate from the Judicial Research and Training Institute.

339
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,560
That's pretty intense.

340
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,570
So, you're playing...

341
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,020
cards in here again?

342
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,870
No, no.

343
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,760
Don't worry. I'm not leading you with questions.

344
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,860
Hold'em is not gambling. It's a sport. A recreation.

345
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,380
Like a game of Go or Gomoku.

346
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,710
I think a recreation like that could be enjoyed

347
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:04,710
like that in here in our free time.

348
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:10,300
I think the human rights of prisoners are important.

349
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,180
But you shouldn't become addicted to it.

350
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,930
Then that would become a problem for all of us.

351
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,180
So who was the visitor earlier?

352
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,430
No.

353
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:48,770
It's rare for the Department of Justice to directly request a change of venue,

354
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:52,580
unless it's by the higher-ups in Sinseon-dong over here.

355
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,940
Who was that VIP visitor?

356
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,690
If you return to your room like this, what will you tell Song Doo Cheol?

357
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,850
In order to maintain a gambling den here, you have to be extremely careful.

358
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:26,020
You have to be aware of everything that happens here.

359
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,720
That's the reason why I'm asking you.

360
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,850
So you can relax and just tell me.

361
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,560
Who was it?

362
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:45,880
Who was the Department of Justice VIP who came to visit you?

363
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,040
- May I?
- Sure.

364
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,020
At the gambling house, when I was outside,

365
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,180
she had faced some trouble there.

366
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,930
And I helped her with it.

367
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,210
A little bit.

368
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:45,160
Is that right?

369
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,830
So, that's what happened.

370
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,720
So that's who that was...

371
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,500
Gosh, really.

372
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,270
Here. Have another one.

373
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,750
What do I need to do if I want to move up to the 1st league?

374
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,430
Actually, I hear you keep winning in 3rd league.

375
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:16,210
But the proper order is for you to be verified in 2nd league before moving up.

376
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,320
But let's see...

377
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,070
You are on good terms with Jang Sun Oh.

378
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,280
That concerns me a little bit.

379
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,630
Unless you can defeat Jang Sun Oh yourself.

380
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,860
That's right.

381
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,730
Then he has no reason to stand against you.

382
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,500
Yes, that's it!

383
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,980
Did you meet with him?

384
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,390
Yes.

385
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,110
How did you meet him?

386
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,440
Pardon?

387
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:07,100
Even if you went into the infirmary,

388
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,980
I don't think he'd just be anywhere.

389
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,050
I went to look for him in his solitary cell.

390
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,250
Did he open the door for you?

391
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,300
Actually, he was just coming out of the room.

392
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,170
And nobody was there to bother you?

393
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,380
No, I wasn't in any more danger, thanks to you.

394
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,710
All right.

395
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,100
When did they ask you to come in for a checkup?

396
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,280
They told me to come once a week to get medicine.

397
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,060
Good job.

398
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,990
Here he comes, Hyungnim.

399
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,820
Since you keep winning lately, even the warden wants to talk to you.

400
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,580
Mr. Hwang, in the Occupational Training, even got a new car.

401
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,250
Unless you can defeat Jang Sun Oh yourself.

402
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:33,310
Then he has no reason to stand against you.

403
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,980
- I mean, look at you.
- Jang Sun Oh...

404
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,500
- You have to win now.
- I have to beat Jang Sun Oh...

405
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,450
- Geez, the gambling is so...
- But how?

406
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,810
- But it doesn't seem...
- So, do you want me to teach you?

407
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,080
What if he is...

408
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,120
- Lee Tae Gwang?
- 2345.

409
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,530
How much is it to make a phone call?

410
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,190
- Fifty won, isn't it?
- Not the landline.

411
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,890
Your cell phone.

412
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,840
That's not allowed.

413
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,270
Yes, that's a violation.

414
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,330
Would a cost of a car be enough?

415
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,150
Here.

416
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,090
Enjoy your phone call.

417
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,500
Hello?

418
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,230
This is Kim Yo Han.

419
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,390
Whose cell phone is this?

420
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,700
What you said earlier about helping me, you still mean it?

421
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,910
What do you need?

422
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,530
I need some money.

423
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,070
And Lee Tae-

424
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,810
5735. This one?

425
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,080
Yeah, I pressed it.

426
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,480
Is that it then?

427
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,380
I don't know his name.

428
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,270
But when I was in solitary confinement, he was in the room next to mine.

429
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,620
I'm looking for him.

430
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,020
Let me talk to the owner of this cell phone.

431
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,300
It's not Lee Tae Gwang.

432
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,400
Is your name...

433
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,780
Just...

434
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,490
call me Professor.

435
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:42,750
So, starting now, from 1st to 169th, I will recite it for you.

436
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,150
I heard you've been looking for me so desperately.

437
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,340
He's the one.

438
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,850
The one who was in the room next to you.

439
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,990
Why did you help me?

440
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,300
You needed my help then.

441
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,180
And back then,

442
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,900
this...

443
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,050
I was better than you.

444
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:29,210
This gambling thing needs more than just a theory.

445
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,100
You need to have guts.

446
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,630
So, why did you look for me?

447
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,920
It must've cost you some money to get help from the prison staff.

448
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,320
Lee Tae Gwang.

449
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,680
Where can I find him?

450
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,400
Lee Tae Gwang...

451
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,430
Lee Tae Gwang?

452
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,640
Lee Tae Gwang...

453
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,580
He's in the infirmary now.

454
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,460
You can't go back there now.

455
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,220
Then can you set up a meeting with him outside the infirmary?

456
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,770
- That's going to be tough.
- I'll give you a commission.

457
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,140
Money is not the problem.

458
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,140
It's the Dean that's the problem. You know?

459
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,680
Jang Sun Oh.

460
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,690
I'm done.

461
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,430
Fold.

462
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,620
Raise.

463
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,140
Fold.

464
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,980
When will you get to 2nd league?

465
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,490
It won't be long.

466
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,440
In business,

467
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,510
you have to go full force when you've got the momentum.

468
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,340
Look at this.

469
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:13,720
Once the flow stops, I can't start another game the way I want to play it.

470
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,180
I'll fix it.

471
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:26,180
I heard you're dilly-dallying at the gambling den lately.

472
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,290
Are Mr. Jo's guys still bothering you?

473
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,470
No, sir.

474
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,810
It's not like you have any family to worry about outside.

475
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,590
You just have to shape up.

476
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,460
Yes, I'll stay focused.

477
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,230
You are not alone anymore.

478
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,710
Gil Sang?

479
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,100
What! What is this?

480
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,170
It's because we are out of time.

481
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,220
- Time?
- Yeah, something like that.

482
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,880
You'll find out soon enough.

483
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,440
Hyungnim, the fertilizer storage room is locked.

484
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,100
Hey, let's do it there.

485
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,430
Wait!

486
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,450
No! No!

487
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,460
It's hard to hurt yourself the first time, but the second time is...

488
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,510
- Put the tape on him.
- No, don't!

489
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,690
Don't!

490
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,770
I'm sorry. This greenhouse is not soundproof.

491
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:30,070
Hey, stop acting like amateurs. Hold him tight!

492
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,400
I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

493
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,000
I'll get it done in one blow.

494
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,140
Okay...

495
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,890
What the hell are you doing?

496
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:46,120
Our newbie was messing around, so we just wanted to scare him a bit.

497
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,570
You call this just scaring him? Looks like you're about to kill him!

498
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:52,360
Everyone who was holding down 2345, stand over there. Do it now!

499
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,860
2345, are you hurt?

500
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,160
I'm fine.

501
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,710
Get up.

502
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,100
Get up.

503
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,500
Careful.

504
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,440
I should take you all in. D*** it!

505
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,740
Let's go. You're fine now.

506
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,120
Excuse me...

507
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:21,840
Why did you help me again?

508
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,560
For a person to help another person,

509
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,390
should there be a reason?

510
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,630
- What about Lee Tae Gwang-
- Geez, I said I can't.

511
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:45,270
I didn't help you, so I can arrange a meeting with Lee Tae Gwang.

512
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,310
Actually,

513
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:54,670
there's a way to move up without Jang Sun Oh's permission.

514
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,050
You know...

515
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:01,550
You can get on the Warden's good side.

516
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,670
If Jang Sun Oh objects...

517
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,700
Not if your sponsor is more powerful than him.

518
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,260
In the 2nd league,

519
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,830
you know that the prison staff members sponsor the game fee

520
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,370
and take a cut of the winnings, right?

521
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:19,700
So, if you keep winning in 2nd league and move on upward,

522
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,340
the sponsor keeps getting a cut of the winnings.

523
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,080
So, it's important for the sponsor for his player

524
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,400
to play in the 1st league.

525
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,190
In other words,

526
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:32,900
as long as the player is skillful

527
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,780
and if the sponsor is powerful enough,

528
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,460
you can definitely move on upward.

529
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,730
Which sponsor is powerful?

530
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,000
In ranking order, after the warden,

531
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,590
it's the security manager.

532
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:59,630
I hear the security manager is a house manager.

533
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,970
And that security manager is

534
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,060
a hoobae from my hometown.

535
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:14,560
If you want, I can make the introduction, but...

536
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,540
But?

537
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,820
The commission you mentioned before.

538
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:23,660
How about 40% of your winnings?

539
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,190
My stomach is full, but why am I still hungry?

540
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:23,210
Hunger pang like that isn't good for you.

541
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,960
Food is dangerous

542
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,050
but money doesn't make you fat.

543
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,150
I also have a debt to repay.

544
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:33,440
How about taking just 30%?

545
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,160
All the players I select give me 60%.

546
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,400
Same for all.

547
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,160
How about increasing it little by little?

548
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,400
You are the one who came looking for me.

549
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,370
No?

550
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,460
I'll get you the 60.

551
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,220
If you lose, you lose your own money.

552
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,690
If you win,

553
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,600
then it's mine.

554
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,640
I understand.

555
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,920
Lunch's on me.

556
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,030
Check, please.

557
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,950
Hey.

558
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,710
[2nd League]

559
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,910
Call.

560
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,220
Call.

561
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,590
Call.

562
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,670
Call.

563
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,540
Call.

564
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:06,950
All in.

565
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,700
I'm out.

566
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,040
- Fold.
- Fold.

567
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,660
- Fold.
- Fold.

568
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:19,180
Where is the confidence you showed while playing Seotda*?
(Type of game played with Hwatu)

569
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,870
How does it feel to be robbed blind?

570
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,020
Maybe because I was beaten silly.

571
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,960
I'm craving some meat. It's driving me crazy.

572
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,900
How about you, monk? You can't eat tripe, can you?

573
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,960
Aigoo. Didn't you know that I'm a fake monk?

574
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,010
I go crazy for tripe.

575
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,070
Is that right?

576
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:44,190
If we have to afford your share of meat, monk, we must have it out with him.

577
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:47,060
Hey, dealer, why are you holding up the hand?

578
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:58,780
Wow, what's going on here?

579
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,670
All the enemies are gathered around one table.

580
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,370
Take a rest.

581
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,060
It's okay if I watch, right?

582
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,080
I just want to know how good you guys are.

583
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,120
Okay?

584
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,610
You're holding the lie right now.

585
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,980
By the way, Yangbang...

586
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,660
My body still smells like it's burnt.

587
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:36,380
All right...

588
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:47,220
What are you doing? Blind, come on.

589
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,940
How about you go first, ahjussi? Action!

Call.

591
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:12,180
Call.

592
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:14,740
Two 10s.

593
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,340
Call.

594
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,090
Raise 80.

595
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,920
I see you.

596
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,370
Call.

597
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,520
Call.

598
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,090
Call.

599
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:37,740
Call.

600
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,530
Call...

601
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,430
Flop.

602
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:00,040
I'm going all in.

603
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,790
Fold.

604
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,400
- Fold.
- Fold.

605
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,630
Fold.

606
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:16,650
Here you go. Aigoo.

607
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:19,160
All for me.

608
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,020
- Congratulations.
- Gosh, thank you.

609
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:32,850
There.

610
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,770
Flop.

611
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,530
Geez, my ear hurts!

612
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:20,230
If you keep doing that, I'll cut off your wrist.

613
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,260
I don't think I'm the one who should lose a wrist.

614
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,090
Oh, got some education already?

615
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,720
Also, do you know how to cheat?

616
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,860
I should know it well.

617
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:08,890
In a scam, several people group together to cheat against one.

618
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:12,400
They do it by exchanging silent signs amongst each other.

619
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,030
I use the color of chips.

620
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,680
Colors?

621
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:23,660
The quickest thing your eye catches are colors.

622
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:27,670
White chip is a diamond...

623
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,420
Green chip is a clover

624
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,110
blue chip is a spade

625
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:34,780
and red chip is a heart.

626
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:40,100
If you use your right thumb, index, and middle finger to push the chip, then it's K.

627
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,120
But if you do the same with your left hand, then Q.

628
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:50,620
If you use both hands to round up the chips and push forward, then J.

629
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,460
Q spade.

630
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:05,900
If you use your index and middle finger to push the chips in a V shape, then it's an ace.

631
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,850
Ace of hearts.

632
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,700
Was it you all along, Jang Sun Oh?

633
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:21,760
Faking you by making noise with the chips

634
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:28,500
they're communicating through hand gestures holding the chips and the colors.

635
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,510
Raise.

636
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,310
I see you.

637
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:37,590
Call it.

638
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,330
Call.

639
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,560
Q spade and ace of hearts.

640
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:47,240
Did Jang Sun Oh just signal me the monk's hand?

641
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,560
Or...

642
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,210
Why did Jang Sun Oh help me from the adjacent room?

643
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:55,310
What does he get by helping me?

644
00:55:55,310 --> 00:56:00,740
But when you fake out another fake...

645
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,110
The real sign is...

646
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:06,820
communicating through the amount of the exchanging bets.

647
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,910
1010.

648
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:16,010
10 in a turn?

649
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:19,300
Is this a scam?

650
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,540
Call.

651
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,560
Okay, call.

652
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,610
Turn.

653
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:42,690
Fold.

654
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,300
Here I go.

655
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:52,790
Fold.

656
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,250
Fold.

657
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,460
Fold.

658
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,520
Raise.

659
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,470
Call. 60.

660
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,630
I'm going all in.

661
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:31,480
Call.

662
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:38,310
Okay, all in from both sides.

663
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,060
I'll open the cards then.

664
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,420
Monk, you first.

665
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,310
Relieve my suffering and return to Buddha...*
(Buddhist chant)

666
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:53,200
Relieve my suffering and return to Buddha.

667
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,560
You, too, Yangbang. Open your cards.

668
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,260
There's still one more river.

669
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,380
If there's an ace from the river, it'll turn the table.

670
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:23,590
Then river!

671
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:25,980
Hold!

672
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:32,590
As for the river, I'll open it.

673
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,790
Okay, monk.

674
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,380
River.

675
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,350
To cross a river you can't return from.

676
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:54,690
To survive through this on the back of Jang Sun Oh...

677
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,430
or get killed tonight by getting hit by Jang Sun Oh.

678
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:11,210
I don't see it... no side...

679
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,150
Please...

680
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:24,480
No side!

681
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,410
It's an ace!

[Insider]

683
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:03,120
Why me?

684
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:06,110
Isn't having an ego a luxury for you right now?

685
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,610
Are you staking me out?

686
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,800
Kill him.

687
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:14,080
When I get out of here,

688
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,560
I'll take over the gambling scene in Korea.

689
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,060
In the world of scamming, finding one you can trust is a priority.

690
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:24,210
I'll give you what you want if it's worth my life.

691
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:26,290
I have a plan.

692
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,240
You have nothing to lose in a deal like this.

693
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:33,210
He'll reinvestigate if that's the card I hold.

694
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,760
I heard you're moving up to Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

695
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,560
What did that cost you?

696
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,110
Was it erasing me out of the system?

697
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:42,660
Did you forget I'm the only one who can get you out of here?

698
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,830
You are not a Judicial Institute trainee anymore.

699
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:46,600
You're a criminal.
