00:00:09,913 --> 00:00:12,038
On June 8, in the first episode of "Insider",

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:17,005
we apologize for causing concern to the Buddhist community and viewers by describing the shrine where Buddha,

4
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:19,130
a symbol of Buddhism, was enshrined as a gambling hall,

5
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:22,208
and broadcasting a scene where a person posing as a monk illegally gambles.

6
00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:26,174
The temple shrines and characters that were the background of the scene are fictional creations

7
00:00:26,198 --> 00:00:29,082
and revealed that we have no intention of destroying a particular religion.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,353
We will pay more attention during the production process so that there is no inconvenience in viewing in the future.

9
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,456
Once again, we apologize to the viewers.

10
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:40,991
(All people, places, organizations, and incidents
appearing in this series are entirely fictional.)

The Buddhist Goddess of Mercy...

12
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:47,291
- Then river!
- Hold!

13
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:53,061
As for the river, I'll open it.

14
00:00:56,201 --> 00:00:58,511
Okay, monk.

15
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:13,501
I don't see it... no side...

16
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:26,231
No side! It's an ace!

17
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:27,881
Oh, yeah!

18
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:44,481

19
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:59,281

20
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:02,101
1648!

21
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,941
Yangbang is the winner!

22
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:05,181
Why did Jang Sun Oh help me?

23
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,671
I met Jang Sun Oh yesterday.

24
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:56,031
Good work.

25
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:04,341
You go to pick up your medicine today, right?

26
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:08,251
Yes.

[Infirmary]

28
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:17,471
- How about a drink after?
- Sure, sounds good.

29
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:21,821
It's the best for us.

30
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:33,631
Emotion... What is emotion?

31
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:37,181
It's a phenomenon in which a feeling occurs toward another.

32
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:39,331
For something that's more light in nature, you call it a feel.

33
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:43,261
To put it simply, joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure.

34
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:44,821
Well...

35
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:50,421
Welcome.

36
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:54,551
Why did you help me?

37
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:56,801
Must there be a reason for helping out a man in need?

38
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:00,151
Why? Does it hurt your pride?

39
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:02,941
Isn't having an ego a luxury for you right now?

40
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:08,081
Then at the repair shop, why...

41
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:11,071
It's kind of my own personality test.

42
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:13,281
If you look, it's always the ones who don't bathe who put on cologne

43
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:15,471
and ones with skin problems who always wash their faces.

44
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:19,501
Finding one you can trust is a priority in the world of scams.

45
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:23,741
- That guy earlier, too?
- 5464?

46
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:27,351
He's a professor in the theatre and film department.

47
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,151
A former child actor.

48
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:32,961
It was all an act.

49
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:36,421
We wrote the script, and we rehearsed to make things go right.

50
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,651
So from the solitary confinement...

51
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:47,561
Why me?

52
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:51,331
You are smart and gutsy.

53
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:58,701
When I get out of here...

54
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:02,121
I'll take over the gambling scene in Korea.

55
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:06,471
The gambling scene. The entire scene.

56
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:08,801
Not just a gambling den, like the one you destroyed before coming in here.

57
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,381
The one who collects taxes from all the dens in the country.

58
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:13,971
I'll become the top in this arena in the country.

59
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,421
That's bigger than passing the bar exam.

60
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:18,991
Once I reach the top of the gambling world in our country,

61
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:20,671
the judges and prosecutors in Korea?

62
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,491
They'll all be in my pocket.

63
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:27,981
But since the scale is so massive, it's a little tough for me to do it alone.

64
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:33,221
So I'm gathering all the talented people in here.

65
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:40,231
If you're interested in playing in the higher league, come on up.

66
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:42,261
You can make money and learn the skills, too.

67
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:46,251
I'm giving you a chance to enjoy wealth and glory next to me.

68
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:50,621
You are not a Judicial Institute trainee anymore.

69
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:51,951
You're a criminal.

70
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:57,091
When you get out of here, the reality will wash over you like a wave.

71
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:59,131
No one will want to get involved with you.

72
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:01,231
For me, nothing's different from when I came in here.

73
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:03,781
But you'll be treated like a bug because you have a criminal record.

74
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:07,961
Guys like us have to take control of our own future.

75
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,921
Geez! Is it a go or stop?

79
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,471
Hyung!

80
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:45,991
You're here.

81
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:19,791
How's the room? You like it?

82
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:28,981
This isn't free.

83
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,921
You have to earn it, Hyung.

84
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:36,971
Since we are on the subject of money...

85
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:39,291
I heard you split all your shares to get here.

86
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,831
Sixty percent to the security manager and 40% to our professor.

87
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:46,751
All right. Listen up.

88
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,531
For any profit from 1st league, 60% goes to the Warden.

89
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:51,121
The rest, the 40%, is for us.

90
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:53,441
But I will do the math. I do that.

91
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:57,521
In other words, no one knows how much you make besides me.

92
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:00,831
You get what I mean, right?

93
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,831
Yes.

94
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:04,271
So, you go to the security manager to give his share first.

95
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,681
And tell him this is the 60% you promised him before.

96
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:10,981
And the share you promised the professor...

97
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:12,521
You don't have to give it to him.

98
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:15,071
What? But...

99
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:17,261
I told you I told him to do everything.

100
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:20,001
You don't have to honor it. Keep the rest for yourself.

101
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,211
Answer me!

102
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,711

I said we'll be there.

108

And I got a move-in present for you.

109
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:34,991
This is Lee Tae Gwang, the one you've been desperately searching for.

110
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:39,861
But do you know Lee Tae Gwang?

111
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:44,341
That Lee Tae Gwang was swallowed up by this freak, who came in later.

112
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:46,951
No one knows where Lee Tae Gwang is right now.

113
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,271
The freak is?

114
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:52,131
The freak is Jang Sun Oh you met yesterday.

115
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:10,791
Why is he like this?

116

They said someone put something in his food.

117

Was it Clorox or detergent?

118
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:17,401
Anyway, after he ate a bowlful of it,

119
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:20,691
he became a completely different person.

120
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:22,301
But Mr. Lee...

121
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:27,541
So why were you so desperately looking for Lee Tae Gwang?

There's this guy Lee Tae Gwang.

123
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:34,381
He brought a video of Chairman Yang gambling and

124
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:36,601
offered us a deal to get him out as well.

125
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:40,591
Since you got started, why don't you take one more step?

126

You, me, and your grandma.

For the three of us to stay alive,

128

we need Lee Tae Gwang's video in our hands quickly.

129
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:51,351
It's not what you think.

130
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:55,641
There was a brief setback in operation.

131
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:02,831
I asked why you were looking for him so badly.

132
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:08,721
Is that a hard question?

133
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:12,111

134
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:13,841
He...

135
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:22,961
This bastard owes me some money.

136
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:25,811
With that, I can pay off some of my gambling loans, too.

137
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:27,621
I see...

138
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:29,141
Is that right?

139
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:32,621
Is that it?

140
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:35,001
Yes.

141
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:41,161
There should be an IOU back at home.

142
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:43,611
Should I get someone to bring it in?

143
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:49,901
No, no.

144
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:52,011
No need for that.

145
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:57,451
Then by chance,

146
00:13:58,591 --> 00:14:01,011
can I see his belongings?

147
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:04,441
Just in case there's something worth money.

148
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:06,411
He's a gambler. What belongings?

149
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:08,441
Really, not even a penny...

150
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:09,991

I think there was a little cash and a USB?

153
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:23,811
If he had the skill to make money gambling, he wouldn't even be in here, to begin with.

154
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:25,431
Right?

155
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:31,051

00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:48,531
You might say I'm missing the final piece to a puzzle.

354
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,751
Are you asking me to be your assassin?

355
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:53,021
No.

356
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:55,811
I need you to be my dagger.

357
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:59,301
Don't worry. I'll do the stabbing.

358
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:05,191
I planned this for 20 years.

359
00:34:05,951 --> 00:34:07,561
For 20 years,

360
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:12,841
I've been searching for an opportunity, looking around,

361
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:14,721
pulling together people.

362
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:18,691
Doing whatever to increase the odds of success.

363
00:34:19,611 --> 00:34:22,061
That's how I've been living.

364
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,551
The probability of my failure is arguably

365
00:34:24,551 --> 00:34:29,961
lower than that of your revenge on your own.

366
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:40,651
So?

367
00:34:42,091 --> 00:34:45,751
Who do you plan to stab, Oh Soo Yeon?

368
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:55,941
Yoon Byung Wook.

369
00:34:56,901 --> 00:34:59,881
The chief prosecutor of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

370
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:05,201
In order to get Yoon Byung Wook,

371
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:10,881
I was also chasing Chairman Yang Joon.

372
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:16,911
Why?

373
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:23,101
When I was 16...

374
00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:26,871
That bastard had killed me once.

375
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:32,951
For the past 20 years, I lacked the power to get Yoon Byung Wook.

376
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:37,121
But I can at least capture the culprit for your grandmother's death.

377
00:35:37,121 --> 00:35:38,851
I have a plan.

378
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:40,941
I'll capture the culprit first.

379
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:43,751
I'm sure of it.

380
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:46,401
Yoon Byung Wook's involved in this case, too.

381
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:50,621
You got nothing to lose with a deal like this. Isn't that right?

382
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:54,571
Join me. I'll carry you.

383
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,641
No matter how exceptional you are, you are still here.

384
00:35:57,641 --> 00:35:59,321
If you join me,

385
00:35:59,321 --> 00:36:03,361
I'll carry you and run with it.

386
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,771
The culprit who killed your grandmother,

387
00:36:05,771 --> 00:36:07,561
and whoever is behind it.

388
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:12,621
In order to catch him, I'll go all-in for you. My past 20 years.

389
00:36:25,971 --> 00:36:28,591
Do you need time to think?

390
00:36:38,481 --> 00:36:40,421
What do I need to do first?

391
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:46,631
Seoungju prison.

392
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,091
Take it over.

393
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,561
You need to be strong.

394
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:59,431
[Oh Su Yeon]
As long as you stand your ground like that,

395
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:02,511
The culprit who killed your grandmother...

396
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,931
I'll catch him and bring him to you.

397
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:43,841
What? Is it so so?

398
00:37:44,921 --> 00:37:46,651
No...

399
00:37:47,861 --> 00:37:49,661
It's good.

400
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:51,101
We make our food separately.

401
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:52,251
Where was it?

402
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:55,091
This guy used to run a restaurant in Seohwa-dong and came here for beating up a drunk.

403
00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:58,361
Whoa, his cooking skills are really top-notch.

404
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:07,321
Get plenty to eat. Lessons will start today.

405
00:38:08,531 --> 00:38:10,171
Lessons?

406
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:34,791
- This is...
- Hyung.

407
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:36,891
You know it's over if you turn your back on them when guys gang up on you, right?

408
00:38:36,891 --> 00:38:38,221
Here.

409
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:40,411
Go.

410
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:44,511
He wants to learn to fight. So please help him out.

411
00:38:44,511 --> 00:38:45,541
What?

412
00:38:48,421 --> 00:38:52,321
Hold on... wait... Dean! Dean!

413
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:54,181
Guard, guard! Guard!

414
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:55,721
Hey there!

415
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:00,561
You wanted to learn to fight?

416
00:39:06,831 --> 00:39:09,731
Well, here are your teachers.

417
00:39:35,961 --> 00:39:37,181
Come now!

418
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,341
Listen to Buddha!

419
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:53,631
Please step on him very carefully, instructors!

420
00:39:53,631 --> 00:39:56,371
That's it. A good kick to the head. Right on!

421
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:01,811
Wait, wait.

422
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:21,901
What is it?

423
00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:23,241
Carp.

424
00:40:24,031 --> 00:40:27,021
Some guys brought it in after working out in the rural areas.

425
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:28,411
Bottoms up.

426
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:46,301
Take this.

427
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:53,811
They say if you want to be reborn, you have to die first.

428
00:40:55,531 --> 00:40:57,291
Who said that?

429
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:00,361
Go to the second period and ask yourself.

430
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:01,681
What?

431
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:14,661
[YHJE, BTC set the highest daily record...]

432
00:41:39,661 --> 00:41:41,081
Where did he go?

433
00:41:55,081 --> 00:41:57,111
Mr. Nam!

434
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:12,081
This is Nam Dae Moon.* Mr. Nam.
(Sounds like the Great South Gate - Namdaemun)

435
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:14,751
A corporate crime. An elite like you, Hyung.

436
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:16,501
He used to work for a securities firm until he got addicted to gambling.

437
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:18,201
He got caught embezzling company funds and received...

438
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:20,401
- How many years?
- I got four years.

439
00:42:20,461 --> 00:42:23,921
Wow. He only got four years for stealing 10 billion won.

440
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:28,431
Hey, Mr. Nam is going to teach you how to scam from now on.

441
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:33,491
He's also in the 1st league?

442
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:36,161
He's our number two. Number two.

443
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:41,701
Hold the cards.

444
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,771
You do speak.

445
00:42:47,771 --> 00:42:51,831
You still don't get what I'm saying, huh?

446
00:42:57,311 --> 00:42:59,361
Don't you know how to hold the cards?

447
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:06,011
What do you mean?

448
00:43:06,011 --> 00:43:09,671
I asked you if you knew how to stick the cards in your hand.

449
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:24,531
Flip them.

450
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,071
Don't you know how to do stuff like this?

451
00:44:30,221 --> 00:44:32,671
Take a break.

452
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:35,851
Aren't you going to clean the floor?

453
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:38,691
I'm only doing it because the Dean told me to.

454
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:41,741
And here in the 1st league,

455
00:44:41,801 --> 00:44:46,501
if the Dean tells you to show it, you show. If he tells you to die, then you die.

456
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:50,341
That visitor who comes to see you.

457
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:52,661
That VIP, I mean.

458
00:44:54,311 --> 00:44:55,891
Is she your girlfriend?

459
00:44:59,691 --> 00:45:01,461
Or family?

460
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:05,001
Let's eat!

461
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:08,051
How was the second period?

462
00:45:09,721 --> 00:45:12,971
He's not it.

463
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:14,261
What?

464
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:19,471
It took me more than a day to stick the cards in my hand, too!

465
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:25,741
Let's eat. We have to get to the third period.

466
00:45:27,381 --> 00:45:30,201
Th-third period? What's that?

467
00:45:30,201 --> 00:45:31,751
Field training.

468
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:42,121
Every Friday, they have a gambling hall in the Warden's office.

469
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:10,811
What are you doing?

470
00:46:15,401 --> 00:46:17,291
Hey, lift this.

471
00:46:19,101 --> 00:46:21,671
- Lift it together.
- Geez...

472
00:46:22,401 --> 00:46:24,401
One, two, three!

473
00:46:25,961 --> 00:46:27,801
Six players to a table.

474
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:31,191
They collect a fee of 100,000 won per person per hour.

475
00:46:33,381 --> 00:46:37,631
To keep the games tight, the players are Nam Dae Moon,

476
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:40,321
Warden...

477
00:46:42,151 --> 00:46:43,821
Two hundred.

478
00:46:43,821 --> 00:46:45,681
Two hundred...

479
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:47,961
and me. The three of us.

480
00:46:52,731 --> 00:46:53,881
Thank you.

481
00:46:59,821 --> 00:47:01,281
Wish you good luck.

482
00:47:02,901 --> 00:47:06,091
And including you, Hyung, the rest are servers.

483
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:15,501
Big pot!

484
00:47:18,721 --> 00:47:21,841
On a given night, the tips alone are several millions won.

485
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:28,161
Add to that, a percentage of each person's winnings.

486
00:47:29,631 --> 00:47:31,241
Did you add salt, sweetie?

487
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:33,431
Yes, two pinches.

488
00:47:37,011 --> 00:47:38,971
Where is your pocket?

489
00:47:38,971 --> 00:47:40,791
Here it is.

490
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:43,131
Thank you, sweetie.

491
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:45,801
Wish you good luck.

492
00:47:45,801 --> 00:47:49,381
That alone can add up to a sizable gain.

493
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:17,531
But the real money is in the loan.

494
00:48:17,531 --> 00:48:18,811
Come on.

495
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,581
IOU, and more IOUs.

496
00:48:25,161 --> 00:48:28,821
Forfeiture declarations of real estate, body parts...

497
00:48:28,821 --> 00:48:30,801
Hyung, you are no longer running away because of your debt, but

498
00:48:30,801 --> 00:48:33,221
one who gives out loans.

499
00:48:34,521 --> 00:48:37,121
This is how I collected what I needed.

500
00:48:41,761 --> 00:48:42,981
You have to work hard.

501
00:48:42,981 --> 00:48:45,831
If you do this well, you can do everything, including taking revenge.

502
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:56,561
What are you doing right now?

503
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,101
What?

504
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:00,411
I mean...

505
00:49:01,831 --> 00:49:04,081
you are showing him everything?

506
00:49:05,301 --> 00:49:07,021
So what?

507
00:49:07,021 --> 00:49:08,891
This is all my money.

508
00:49:19,591 --> 00:49:22,731
Everyone is very concerned.

509
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:58,031
I've been busy.

510
00:50:04,911 --> 00:50:06,601
Do you know who did that?

511
00:50:06,601 --> 00:50:08,941
There wasn't even a fingerprint.

512
00:50:08,941 --> 00:50:12,161
Even the karaoke employee was threatened to keep her quiet.

513
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:14,061
So she claims to know nothing.

514
00:50:14,061 --> 00:50:15,451
Still...

515
00:50:16,301 --> 00:50:18,651
we have a cop on our side.

516
00:50:22,071 --> 00:50:23,901
You went through a lot.

517
00:51:57,101 --> 00:51:59,181
Is this for real?

518
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:01,981
They don't see any signs of fabrication.

519
00:52:10,271 --> 00:52:11,841
Yo Han.

520
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:15,621
Even if something goes wrong,

521
00:52:15,621 --> 00:52:16,971
do you think we'd ignore you?

522
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:18,901
I'll protect your grandmother.

523
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:21,711
I'll protect your grandmother.

524
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:29,291
I thought...

525
00:52:33,001 --> 00:52:34,911
that Lee Tae Gwang's video...

526
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:38,451
would be a lifeline for me.

527
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:40,111
For the three of us to stay alive,

528
00:52:40,111 --> 00:52:43,491
we need Lee Tae Gwang's video in our hands quickly.

529
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:45,571
I thought that once I found Lee Tae Gwang's video,

530
00:52:45,571 --> 00:52:49,451
I would find my grandmother's culprit and recover my life.

531
00:52:49,451 --> 00:52:51,281
Because...

532
00:52:51,281 --> 00:52:53,181
Because...

533
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:54,791
if that's the card I hold,

534
00:52:56,231 --> 00:52:58,491
Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung

535
00:52:58,491 --> 00:53:01,111
would reinvestigate.

536
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:04,461
Investigation?

537
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,561
2345, you have a visitor.

538
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:21,521
[The attitude of reflection]

539
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:32,321
By now, I'm sure any evidence that I was following orders for an undercover investigation

540
00:53:32,321 --> 00:53:34,941
has been deleted and can't be found in Sajik-dong.*
(Area where major government institutions are located in the heart of Seoul)

541
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:41,451
A person's life is at stake.

542
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,361
How can they so easily...

543
00:53:43,361 --> 00:53:45,701
Because it's a matter of survival.

544
00:53:45,701 --> 00:53:50,231
I can't blame someone for wanting to survive by camouflaging.

545
00:53:53,381 --> 00:53:54,661
But this...

546
00:53:55,561 --> 00:53:57,151
But this is...

547
00:54:01,421 --> 00:54:03,031
Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung.

548
00:54:03,981 --> 00:54:06,561
There is a talk of him being promoted to Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

549
00:54:06,561 --> 00:54:09,631
Public Security Division from the Seoul Northern District Prosecutor's Office.

550
00:54:13,401 --> 00:54:15,181
Ms. Oh Soo Yeon.

551
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:16,341
Yes?

552
00:54:17,071 --> 00:54:21,581
Inspector Kwon Dae Il could have been chased just like you.

553
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:26,251
Could you find out if Inspector Kwon Dae Il sought out help from others

554
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:28,061
before he died?

555
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:30,611
What about Mok Jin Hyung? What should I do about him?

556
00:54:30,611 --> 00:54:32,581
I'll confirm it myself.

557
00:54:41,231 --> 00:54:42,611
Yo Han...

558
00:54:56,431 --> 00:54:57,741
So...

559
00:54:59,111 --> 00:55:01,481
where is Lee Tae Gwang's video?

560
00:55:03,211 --> 00:55:05,661
Before I tell you, please reinstate me.

561
00:55:08,481 --> 00:55:10,441
Of course, man.

562
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:12,891
That's that.

563
00:55:12,891 --> 00:55:14,961
Where's the video?

564
00:55:14,961 --> 00:55:16,811
Can't I get reinstated?

565
00:55:16,811 --> 00:55:18,331
S***!

566
00:55:21,211 --> 00:55:24,951
Your investigation plan documents are safely in Sajik-dong.

567
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:30,541
Is something the matter with you?

568
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:32,701
When people lie, there are certain habits people display.

569
00:55:32,701 --> 00:55:36,651
It's a physical reaction that shows up, like locking and loading right before lying.

570
00:55:36,651 --> 00:55:38,921
But with you, that comes out of your hand.

571
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:40,511
He's lying.

572
00:55:47,741 --> 00:55:50,391
I heard you're moving up to Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

573
00:55:52,961 --> 00:55:55,461
What was the cost?

574
00:55:55,461 --> 00:55:57,681
Was it erasing me out of the system?

575
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:01,341
S***!

576
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:06,881
What are you talking about, man?

577
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:10,921
December 8th, 15:20. On the northern end of Paldang Bridge.

578
00:56:12,491 --> 00:56:15,061
The video of you abandoning my grandmother's body.

579
00:56:15,901 --> 00:56:17,291
I saw it all.

580
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,991
Where did you see it?

581
00:56:21,941 --> 00:56:23,221
Huh?

582
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,741
Where did you see it, man?

583
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:29,371
Did you kill my grandmother, Chief Prosecutor?

584
00:56:29,371 --> 00:56:30,491
Are you crazy?

585
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:33,311
Hong Jae Sun caught on that I approached him for an investigation

586
00:56:33,311 --> 00:56:36,051
and went to my grandmother to reveal everything about this investigation.

587
00:56:36,051 --> 00:56:37,991
And my grandmother went to see you to ask questions.

588
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:40,631
You used her grandson and abandoned him. She demanded that you put everything back

589
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:44,271
but you knew that was impossible because you'd already deleted me from the Sajik-dong's servers.

590
00:56:44,271 --> 00:56:46,131
And...

591
00:56:46,131 --> 00:56:49,951
because you've been lying to me all this time to avoid taking responsibility.

592
00:56:49,951 --> 00:56:53,681
Is that why you argued with my grandmother?

593
00:56:54,461 --> 00:56:55,991
Is that why you killed her?

594
00:56:55,991 --> 00:56:58,311
- Hey, Kim Yo Han...
- Then...

595
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:01,281
was it Chief Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook?

596
00:57:02,921 --> 00:57:06,031
Chief Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook ordered someone to kill the Director Noh Young Gook

597
00:57:06,031 --> 00:57:08,191
and kill my grandmother.

598
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,961
Because I was looking for Lee Tae Gwang's video?

599
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:13,451
And the person who Chief Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook hired to kill...

600
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:16,061
Was it you, Chief?

601
00:57:18,261 --> 00:57:21,461
For that, he offered you the Central District Prosecutor's Office.

602
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:35,441
Boy, don't you dare cross the line.

603
00:57:41,951 --> 00:57:46,461
Did you forget I'm the only one who can get you out of here?

604
00:58:09,211 --> 00:58:10,771
Guard!

605
00:59:11,521 --> 00:59:14,541
[Insider]

606
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:53,011
This is no place for you.

607
00:59:53,011 --> 00:59:55,771
I came in showing all of my cards.

608
00:59:56,701 --> 00:59:58,731
Why do you hate me so much?

609
01:00:00,011 --> 01:00:02,011
There should be a ledger.

610
01:00:02,011 --> 01:00:04,081
Nam Dae Moon's slush fund ledger!

611
01:00:04,081 --> 01:00:07,491
Find out where that ledger is.

612
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:09,701
Him and you!

613
01:00:09,701 --> 01:00:11,971
I didn't give up on either one of you, man!

614
01:00:11,971 --> 01:00:16,401
Inspector Kwon was hiding something else besides a camera.

615
01:00:17,221 --> 01:00:19,101
Don't worry.

616
01:00:19,101 --> 01:00:22,401
I won't kill you in here. For now.

617
01:00:22,471 --> 01:00:25,181
Chairman Yang will be here personally.

618
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:28,331
He wants you to bring him also.

619
01:00:28,331 --> 01:00:29,571
Is he the bastard?

620
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:31,411
It's not what you think.

621
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:33,791
The blade should face up

622
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:35,981
so you won't hurt your hands.

623
01:00:35,981 --> 01:00:39,101
I found the video.
