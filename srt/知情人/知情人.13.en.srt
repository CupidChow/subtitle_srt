S***.

00:23:08,645 --> 00:23:11,535
Seocho-dong it is, huh?

363
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:20,795
You know where my hyung is?

364
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:23,275
Seocho-dong probably has him.

365
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:27,295
It means they're already working with Kim Yo Han.

366
00:23:27,295 --> 00:23:29,525
How the heck do you know that?

367
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:32,155
Aigoo, Chairman.

368
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:35,305
How are you not aware of this still?

369
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:37,065
If your hyung is captured,

370
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:40,325
then it means you're next.

371
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:51,015
Well, a boat to Macau...

372
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:53,875
Please get me a one-way ticket.

373
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,435
I can't fly there at this point.

374
00:23:57,435 --> 00:24:00,295
I just want to spend the rest of my life

375
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:04,575
at a place where I have a fond memory of.

376

If you can do that for me,

377
00:24:07,215 --> 00:24:10,395
I'll help you meet your hyung.

378
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:15,425
You lost everything. How would you do that?

00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:29,095
Just one ticket, please...

384
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:39,355
What if...

385
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:42,535
I made you a Deep Pocket, Chief Prosecutor?

386
00:24:47,615 --> 00:24:51,485
I'll make a distinct Labuan account for you.

387
00:24:52,615 --> 00:24:57,575
And half of my commission that I receive for each money laundering case...

388
00:24:57,575 --> 00:25:00,715
I'll deposit that in an offshore borrowed-name bank account of yours.

389
00:25:08,445 --> 00:25:09,995
Chief Prosecutor...

390
00:25:09,995 --> 00:25:14,675
It means 2.5 percent of the amount of money that is laundered at the casino

391
00:25:14,675 --> 00:25:16,725
becomes yours.

392
00:25:19,015 --> 00:25:20,575
How much is that?

393
00:25:24,235 --> 00:25:26,285
It's more than enough to make a Seocho-dong

394
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:29,655
deputy chief prosecutor into a three-time Assemblyman of Yeouido.

395
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:36,195
Eight to two.

396
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:41,965
I'm telling you this for the first time.

397
00:25:41,965 --> 00:25:44,325
I'm going to Yeouido and

398
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:47,275
go straight, over the river.*

You need to come in using the registered pass.

Oh, you see...

405
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:30,875
I left it on my desk.

406
00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:34,625
What is your division?

407
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:41,365
Isn't this the renowned Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

408
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:42,685
If a chief prosecutor shows up,

409
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:45,485
they should know I have my reason for coming here and lead the way.

410
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:47,605
What is he doing, interrogating me like that?

411
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:48,875
How inflexible.

412
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:52,075
That part is off-limits even within the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

413
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:54,275
So, what do you need me to find?

414
00:26:54,275 --> 00:26:58,235
Let me see what that off-limits CCTV is showing right now.

415
00:26:58,235 --> 00:27:00,345
I told you that area is off-limits.

416
00:27:00,345 --> 00:27:02,735
Of course, there is no surveillance.

417
00:27:04,855 --> 00:27:06,245
One second.

418
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:13,335
Hello. This is Chief Prosecutor Mok Jin Hyung of the Northern District Prosecutors' Office.

419
00:27:13,335 --> 00:27:15,935
Is Prosecutor Hong Jae Sun there?

420
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:17,335
Not there?

421
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:18,735
Do you know where he is?

422
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:21,195
Oh, okay. Okay.

423
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,395
Let me see if there is an interrogation room

424
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:29,215
that occupied by the name Hong Jae Sun.

425
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:30,805
Hong Jae Sun?

426
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:35,265
Oh, there is one. Hong Jae Sun.

427
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:34,525
We've never met, right?

428
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:42,125
I heard you're going down to Daejeon.

429
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:45,855
I must say, the Goldman Casino Manager

430
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:49,135
is a powerful position, huh? They didn't even announce it yet.

431
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:53,465
I also heard the latest news about the casino.

432
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,895
That you resigned from the manager position?

433
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:01,585
Who updates you on Seocho-dong news?

434
00:29:01,585 --> 00:29:03,065
Hong Sang Wook?

435
00:29:03,065 --> 00:29:05,085
Yoon Byung Wook?

436
00:29:05,085 --> 00:29:06,635
Jae Sun?

437
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:10,735
But where did they all go now?

438
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:14,255
I guess they cut ties since you stepped down.

439
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:16,055
That makes sense...

440
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:18,365
since Jo Hae Do is

441
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:20,515
alive and well.

442
00:29:20,515 --> 00:29:22,685
Yet they got you locked up here like this.

443
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:24,565
What did you say just now?

444
00:29:24,565 --> 00:29:25,695
Why?

445
00:29:25,695 --> 00:29:27,515
Are you hoping for a chance

446
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:31,145
to be released as not guilty since Jo Hae Do is alive?

447
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:33,215
I think that'd be difficult.

448
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:44,345
What do you want from me?

449
00:29:45,595 --> 00:29:47,695
Well, what is it that you want?

450
00:29:49,225 --> 00:29:51,975
You took over an organization from the bottom

451
00:29:51,975 --> 00:29:55,035
and made your brother a CEO of a company.

452
00:29:56,235 --> 00:29:58,655
Why didn't you stop there?

453
00:29:58,655 --> 00:30:03,505
What is it that you tried to gain from laundering money for the meanest

454
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:06,565
and strongest bastards in this country?

455
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:19,605
My mother was devoured by my father's drunken stupor.

456
00:30:19,605 --> 00:30:23,265
My father was devoured by a typhoon at sea.

457
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:28,455
When I was wandering around with my younger brother,

458
00:30:28,455 --> 00:30:34,485
we used to just eat and sleep at like a gym.

459
00:30:34,485 --> 00:30:40,065
I thought, "My parents must've felt this way before they died."

460
00:30:41,085 --> 00:30:44,285
Whoa, the world

461
00:30:44,285 --> 00:30:50,165
fell on my head like a tsunami wave.

462
00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:54,325
"If I don't devour the world first,

463
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:57,045
it would devour me."

<i>Hong came out to the parking lot with someone.</i>

465
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:15,235
You get only one call

466
00:31:15,235 --> 00:31:17,265

467
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,595
How much are you charging me for this one?

468
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:25,205
I won't rip you off.

469
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:27,395
Don't worry about it.

470
00:31:27,395 --> 00:31:28,755
Instead,

471
00:31:29,475 --> 00:31:31,495
we know each other now.

472
00:31:31,495 --> 00:31:35,295
Yoon Byung Wook is not the only one at Seocho-dong.

473
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:43,035
<i>I'll be in your care.</i>

474
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:46,735
Aigoo.

475
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:52,815
Let's do our best.

476
00:31:52,815 --> 00:31:53,835
Thank you.

477
00:31:53,835 --> 00:31:55,545
Make sure to listen to my orders.

478
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:57,005
Yes.

479
00:31:57,005 --> 00:31:58,305
Thank you.

480
00:32:12,105 --> 00:32:14,045
I'm getting together with our colleagues next weekend.

481
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:15,395
You want to come?

482
00:32:16,205 --> 00:32:17,715
Is being an ex-convict a flaw?

483
00:32:17,715 --> 00:32:20,095
Half of the assemblymen are ex-convicts.

484
00:32:21,095 --> 00:32:22,855
Let's go together.

485
00:32:27,765 --> 00:32:29,045
Hey.

486
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:31,965
Is there anything for me?

487
00:32:48,075 --> 00:32:50,325
If you go in now, it's a sentence for life.

488
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:51,805
You're at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, right, Hyung?

489
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:52,965
<i>Chairman Yang.</i>

490
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:57,095

00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:03,725

Hyung!

494
00:33:05,345 --> 00:33:07,445
That was gone long ago.

495
00:33:09,265 --> 00:33:12,925
Right now, the one who makes the first move will lose.

496
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:15,935
So don't make a move until

497
00:33:15,935 --> 00:33:17,605
I give you the sign.

498
00:33:17,605 --> 00:33:22,485
October 10th, the year of the fowl...

499
00:33:22,485 --> 00:33:25,375
On the day of the Year of the Fowl Revolt,

500
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:28,145
the sun was slowly setting.

501
00:33:28,145 --> 00:33:29,895
Even the mighty Prince Sooyang was hesitant

502
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:33,205
to actually start the coup d'état.

503
00:33:33,205 --> 00:33:37,605
Do you know what Han Myeong Hoi told him at that moment?

504
00:33:37,605 --> 00:33:42,685
Even if you built a house for three years by the road, you couldn't finish it.

505
00:33:42,685 --> 00:33:45,785
If you miss the timing to make a decision,

506
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:48,445
you can get dragged around by the other person's betting

507
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:52,595
and lose all your money even when you have an AA in your hands.

508
00:33:57,275 --> 00:34:00,415
Before I kick that mouth of yours,

509
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:02,375
what is it you're trying to say?

510
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:05,525
In Hold'em or in history...

511
00:34:05,525 --> 00:34:10,945
the one who goes all-in first during a crisis wins the battle.

512
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:20,475
Even if The Skin Nation is finished,

513
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:24,315
the casino is as good as alive, right?

514
00:34:24,315 --> 00:34:29,245
Anyone with skills can take the manager position, no?

515
00:34:29,245 --> 00:34:32,165
You've been pushed back momentarily, so if you strike back properly,

516
00:34:32,165 --> 00:34:35,285
I'm saying you can take it back.

517
00:34:36,095 --> 00:34:38,045
Even though I failed,

518
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:40,425
if I just help you

519
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:43,625
a little bit by your side...

520
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:48,005
Don't give up that opportunity.

521
00:34:49,575 --> 00:34:51,175
So what?

522
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:58,655
Gather your army first.

523
00:35:02,215 --> 00:35:03,625
Then...

524
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:06,045
I'll tell Woo Sang Ki to prepare

525
00:35:06,045 --> 00:35:08,035
Chief Prosecutor Yoon Byung Wook's account.

526
00:35:08,035 --> 00:35:10,955
Yes. Please have it done before Mr. Jo or Chief Mok arrives.

527
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:12,275
Yes.

528
00:35:26,705 --> 00:35:31,225
Now, we can casually meet up with Yoon Byung Wook, right?

529
00:35:31,225 --> 00:35:33,695
Have dinner...

530
00:35:33,695 --> 00:35:35,925
and maybe even drink together?

531
00:35:39,065 --> 00:35:41,005
What is it that you want to say?

532
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,965
What else? We have to kill him.

533
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:48,955
What is it?

534
00:35:50,865 --> 00:35:52,635
I think...

535
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:56,625
the priority is to stabilize the casino right now.

536
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,975
I need to free this shackle before Yoon Byung Woo-

537
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:02,975
Did you get scared from visiting the CID?

538
00:36:04,355 --> 00:36:07,865
Yoon Byung Wook is not someone we can just

539
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:14,855
draw out at once easily, CEO.

540
00:36:14,855 --> 00:36:18,415
That's why you're doing it with me.

541
00:36:18,415 --> 00:36:19,995
Is it not?

542
00:36:32,665 --> 00:36:35,565
<i>That's why you're doing it with me.</i>

543
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:36,975
<i>Is it not?</i>

544
00:36:36,975 --> 00:36:38,555
<i>CEO.</i>

545
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:40,765
I plan to...

546
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,005
punish Yoon Byung Wook by law as well.

547
00:36:43,005 --> 00:36:44,245
How?

548
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:45,895
I'll become Yoon Byung Wook's new Yang Hwa and Yang Joon.

549
00:36:45,895 --> 00:36:49,025
I'll give if he says to give and kill if he says to kill.

550
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:51,125
Then I'll amass all of those crimes

551
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,775
to expose them to the world.

552
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:54,405
Insider...

553
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:57,015
You'll become an insider...

554
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,205
and expose everything, huh?

555
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,795
Yes.

556
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:11,955
[You'll become an insider and expose everything, huh?]

557
00:37:11,955 --> 00:37:14,425
[Yes]

558
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:16,155
Yo Han...

559
00:37:16,155 --> 00:37:18,325
Why are you being a sucker?

560
00:37:18,325 --> 00:37:22,115
I'm not trying to use the law because it's fair.

561
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,025
We need to use the law

562
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:26,895
to reduce the casualties as much as possible.

563
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:31,935
Even if you die...

564
00:37:33,035 --> 00:37:34,845
I'll go my way.

565
00:37:34,845 --> 00:37:36,485
Please...

566
00:37:43,825 --> 00:37:47,095
Please take it easy, Oh Soo Yeon.

567
00:37:49,795 --> 00:37:51,325
You.

568
00:37:52,365 --> 00:37:55,025
You knew everything from the beginning, didn't you?

569
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:58,835
<i>Does it all show up?</i>

570
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:00,695
<i>What about the camera?</i>

571
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:04,605
<i>Is that all?</i>

572
00:38:04,605 --> 00:38:07,025
<i>The judicial trainee who went into Seongju Prison.</i>

573
00:38:07,025 --> 00:38:08,215
<i>Why?</i>

574
00:38:09,265 --> 00:38:11,765
<i>He got caught while digging into Chief Yoon.</i>

575
00:38:11,765 --> 00:38:14,725
<i>I think he's from the side that supports Corruption Investigation Agency.</i>

576
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:18,955
<i>For what would you have dug up that mountain...</i>

577
00:38:20,205 --> 00:38:21,435
<i>Chairman Yang?</i>

578
00:38:21,435 --> 00:38:24,575
You also knew that I went to prison for stalking the CID Chief.

579
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:26,775
<i>Chairman Yang, The Skin Nation.</i>

580
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:28,735
<i>Why did you keep checking Chairman Yang?</i>

581
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:32,305
Only the Director of Judicial Research and Training Institute, me,

582
00:38:32,305 --> 00:38:35,355
and Chief Mok Jin Hyung knew about that at the time.

583
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:39,995
You extracted that info out of Chairman Yang's phone.

584
00:38:39,995 --> 00:38:41,955
Isn't that too much of a leap?

585
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:45,395
<i>Have you heard about a place called Sinseon-dong...</i>

586
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:49,255
<i>Yes, Oh Soo Yeon.</i>

587
00:38:49,255 --> 00:38:50,665
<i>Do Won Bong.</i>

588
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:53,395
Was that really the first time you got to see him in a while?

589
00:38:53,395 --> 00:38:58,355
Or did an actor and an actress toy with me?

590
00:38:58,355 --> 00:39:01,955
Stop framing me with baseless claims.

591
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:10,885
<i>Just how much does CEO Oh know?</i>

592
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:16,295
<i>Actually, she came to see Chairman Do before</i>

593
00:39:16,295 --> 00:39:19,565
<i>meeting you for the first time.</i>

594
00:39:21,635 --> 00:39:26,095
<i>Do you also have that conversation, Attorney Koo?</i>

595
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:30,605
<i>Why do you have an interest in that kid?</i>

596
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:32,845
<i>He's a former judicial trainee.</i>

597
00:39:32,845 --> 00:39:34,685
<i>He's young and</i>

598
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:36,485
<i>also has short sentence.</i>

599
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:39,035
<i>It's hard to find an ex-convict like him.</i>

600
00:39:39,035 --> 00:39:42,295
<i>He'll have a hard time adjusting after getting out of prison.</i>

601
00:39:42,295 --> 00:39:45,895
<i>So I plan to take him in and raise him.</i>

602
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:50,345
<i>Chairman Do, for sure since that time,</i>

603
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:53,125
<i>showed an interest in you, Manager.</i>

604
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:02,075
You're alive, thanks to me.

605
00:40:02,975 --> 00:40:05,775
When Chairman Do started to have an interest in me,

606
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:11,625
my grandmother died.

607
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:14,395
<i>I'll deal with him.</i>

608
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:16,625
<i>So you take him off your mind.</i>

609
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,785
<i>How do you plan to...</i>

610
00:40:18,785 --> 00:40:20,975
<i>lure him, Chairman?</i>

611
00:40:25,195 --> 00:40:26,465
<i>You...</i>

612
00:40:27,665 --> 00:40:30,475
<i>knew that Do Won Bong would go after my grandma.</i>

613
00:40:32,185 --> 00:40:33,635
<i>But you still left...</i>

614
00:40:33,635 --> 00:40:34,655
<i>Thank you.</i>

615
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:36,715
<i>my grandmother all by herself.</i>

616
00:40:40,295 --> 00:40:41,745
So what?

617
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:43,215
You get back at me, too, then.

618
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:44,645
Kill me!

619
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:47,195
Or you want to use the law on me as well?

620
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:54,655
Trust me, just once.

621
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:57,635
So that there isn't another Kim Yo Han and

622
00:40:57,635 --> 00:41:00,975
there isn't another Oh Soo Yeon. Also...

623
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:03,675
so that I can believe in the existence of justice in this world.

624
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:07,215
So that I can punish those predators in my way. Just once...

625
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,915
Just once...

626
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:15,425
please trust me.

627
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:24,575
Hey, this is the Manager's room. Right?

628
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:26,675
[Trust me just once]
Yes, why?

629
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:29,965
[Trust me just once]

630
00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:31,815
Never mind.

631

[Trust me just once]

632

<i>Trust me just once.</i>

00:41:43,755 --> 00:41:48,595
<i>During this crackdown, the police stormed 31 illegal prostitution businesses for search and seizure.</i>

636
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:53,425
<i>- It's a rare arrest that does not involve organized gangs.
- Hey, move!</i>

637
00:41:53,485 --> 00:41:55,415
<i>The police said that after their search and seizure crackdown,</i>

638
00:41:55,415 --> 00:42:00,975
<i>they stressed that they received reports of human trafficking and the sexual trafficking of minors.</i>

639
00:42:03,945 --> 00:42:06,395
Help me...

640
00:42:06,395 --> 00:42:08,355
Please don't do that...

641
00:42:09,885 --> 00:42:11,535
Please don't hit me...

642
00:42:14,095 --> 00:42:16,125
Please let me out.

643
00:42:17,365 --> 00:42:19,725
Please let me out.

644
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:23,775
It's all my fault.

645
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:26,905
Please save me. Please.

646
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:28,535
Please save...

647
00:42:29,905 --> 00:42:34,985
I can say that she's not addicted to drugs, but

648
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:38,975
<i>because of the hormonal injections and due to the PTSD,</i>

650
00:42:40,505 --> 00:42:44,695
<i>She can show symptoms of so-called Bipolar Disorder.</i>

651
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:49,285
<i>Does the patient have a family member to watch over her?</i>

652
00:42:49,285 --> 00:42:52,225
I contacted all of her family and relatives,

653
00:42:52,225 --> 00:42:54,235
but they all told me to stay away.

654
00:42:54,235 --> 00:42:56,285
Saying, "A daughter just like her mom."

655
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:58,285
"We don't know such people."

656
00:42:58,285 --> 00:43:00,145
I understand, but

657
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:04,205
Bipolar Disorder is hard to treat without a guardian.

658
00:43:07,665 --> 00:43:11,345
<i>Even if you die, I'll go my way.</i>

659
00:43:33,607 --> 00:43:36,857
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office is the same old stuff, just like everywhere else.

660
00:43:36,857 --> 00:43:40,947
But still, the view is different than the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

661
00:43:41,797 --> 00:43:43,237
Different?

662
00:43:44,757 --> 00:43:46,507
It's still Seocho-dong from here

663
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:49,297
and it's still Seocho-dong from there.

664
00:43:49,297 --> 00:43:53,137
We look out the window at the same thing all our lives.

665
00:43:53,137 --> 00:43:55,557
That's why we become stale.

666
00:43:56,597 --> 00:43:58,987
That's why we rot fast.

667
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:02,227
Am I...

668
00:44:02,227 --> 00:44:04,797
really getting transferred in the end?

669
00:44:13,347 --> 00:44:16,767
You failed to give me your answer sheet in time.

<i>You'll expose everything as an insider?</i>

672
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:28,677
Right?

673
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:34,547
It's not Daejeon.

674
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,557
It's Yeosu, actually.

675
00:44:36,557 --> 00:44:40,397
Yeosu, where they say you recover the decade of health you lost in Seoul.

676
00:44:40,397 --> 00:44:41,767
Isn't it great?

677
00:44:44,357 --> 00:44:47,507
It's fine as long as it's not Daejeon, right?

678
00:44:47,507 --> 00:44:50,087
I have a favor to ask.

679
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,617
Go on.

00:44:51,617 --> 00:44:54,207
For the upcoming personnel transfer...

684
00:45:03,277 --> 00:45:05,037
What's the reason?

685
00:45:07,717 --> 00:45:12,477
I need to clear up the population in my playground at the moment

686
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:14,847
but a chief prosecutor is a little...

687
00:45:14,847 --> 00:45:16,807
A little bit overwhelming for me, too.

688
00:45:16,807 --> 00:45:18,707
Any objections?

696
00:45:54,697 --> 00:45:56,867

[Kim Jung Gyu, Commissioner Candidate for Corruption Investigation Agency]
You want to transfer to the Corruption Investigations?

You know I've been supportive ever since the establishment talks.

699
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:10,367
Do I not count as an original member?

700
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,077
After Young Gook hyung died like that,

701
00:46:13,077 --> 00:46:15,227
you became the CID's dog, no?

702
00:46:15,227 --> 00:46:16,377
Who the f*** said that?

703
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:18,067
I heard you even knelt at the Chinese restaurant.

704
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:22,627
Well, there's no reason I should self-destruct in front of all the CID people.

705
00:46:22,627 --> 00:46:24,637
We need to achieve judicial reform, right?

706
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:27,447
Not because you don't want to go down to Yeosu?

707
