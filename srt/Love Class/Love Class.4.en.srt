[A gay couple appears in a matchmaking class!]

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,760
- Hey, hey. Look at this.
- What?

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,280
What is it?

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
Is this for real?

7
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,680
Is this our school?

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,590
Hey, hey, hey. Isn't this Lee Ro Ah?

9
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,100
- It is.
- Right?

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,430
What are they doing?

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,160
Is he feeding him?

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,750
Okay, everyone.

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,520
Did you enjoy your fun date?

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,410
Okay, the next assignment is like a quiz.

15
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,280
"I love you. I'm sorry. Thank you."

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,600
Words expressing emotions are all ideological.

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,100
Even if I confess "I love you" to someone,

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,130
it's hard to deliver 100% of my feelings.

19
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,280
"I love you."

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,080
"I'm sorry. Thank you."

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,180
"I like you."

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,240
Without using these words,

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,520
try to find a way

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,570
to express love, sorriness, fondness,

25
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,710
and gratefulness.

26
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,440
Okay.

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,920
I will end today's lecture here.

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,050
Good job.

29
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,590
And student Cha Ji Wu?

30
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,630
Could you help me move the reports?

31
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,170
Sure.

32
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,520
Ji Wu...

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,300
I'll be back after helping the professor.

34
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,260
Let's talk about that post later.

35
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,190
I think there was a misunderstanding.

36
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,520
Ji Wu, hold on—

37
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,370
You can leave them here.

38
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,090
Okay.

39
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,000
I heard you have been taking Yu Na home these days.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,620
Yes.

41
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,000
You are a great friend.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,360
Yu Na looks very comfortable these days, thanks to you.

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,350
Oh, really?

44
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,890
But today...

45
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,210
the class atmosphere was a bit discordant.

46
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,340
Is something going on?

47
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,450
I don't really know much, either.

48
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,250
What exactly is going on...

49
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,870
I see.

50
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,890
If you ever need my help, you can talk to me whenever.

51

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,740
Okay. Thank you.

53
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,220
Sure.

54
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,120

[Episode 4 of 6]

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,520
That bastard is weird! He told me he was on a date.

57
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,930
Wait, Lee Ro Ah! Is this true?

58
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,330
Ro Ah... you are done for.

59
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,760
True, my foot! You can totally tell this person is just trolling.

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,120
Hey, how many times do I have to tell you that this Cha Ji Wu is credible?

61
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,780
This bastard is the guy who has been following Yu Na around!

62
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,820
Oh, second-year Bae Yu Na?

63
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,380
Yes! Even during the freshmen welcome party,

64
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,110
he followed Yu Na around like a damn dog.

65
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,180
He's a damn attention whore.

66
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,460

- I don't know.

Why did Professor Lim call you over?

80
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,380
I don't know why you are—

81
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,360

82

Go ahead and speak informally, too, then.

83
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:41,680
I said, why did Professor Lim single you out and take you with him?

Well, he just...

85

You have to admit that the atmosphere during the lecture was a bit weird.

Everyone was just snickering.

87
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,180
It's because you mentioned that weird post.

88

How am I supposed to keep quiet when I'm curious?

89

- What is?
- That post!

91
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,440
It is already one of the recommended posts because they think it is true.

92
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,530
People really believe that you and Ro Ah Seonbae are a couple.

93

Why would they believe something that is not even true?

94

Don't worry too much, Ji Wu.

95
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,980
The truth isn't important.

96
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,990

97

But hey, that post was intended to screw you over.

98

But it's anonymous, so we don't know who wrote it.

Well, it's not true anyway.

101
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,920
And not that many people know me. None.

102
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,660
It's not something you should take lightly, Ji Wu.

103
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,100
That's right.

104
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,850
Do you know the saying, "A carelessly thrown stone can kill a frog?"

105
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,830
The frog should also do some thinking

106
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,880
and not just sit there and wait for the stone to be cast.

107
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,120
It will be forgotten over time.

108

- You are weird.
- I'm telling you, he is cute.

- He is cuter the longer you look.
- What the hell?

- Look at him closely.
- What is wrong with you?

He is cute from this angle too.

Look, take one look.

123

- I don't want to.

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,190
Ro Ah!

168
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,920
♫ I just missed you ♫

169
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,530
[Is everything okay? The weather sucks today. Low percentage of rain today, but still take an umbrella.]

170
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,090
♫ I'll stay by your side ♫

171
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,330
♫ Even if you're not by my side ♫

172
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,110
♫ I'm full of thoughts of you ♫

173
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:56,180
♫ It's just because I missed you ♫

174
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,030
Seonbae, were you able to get in touch with Ji Wu?

175
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,690
The others are saying Ji Wu has been absent for two days already.

176
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,580
He won't pick up my calls, so I wondered if you knew anything.

177
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,330
Why would you be curious about that?

178
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,200
What?

179
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,560
You have no right to be.

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,600
What are you talking about?

181
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,550
You are selfish.

182
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,830
You only look for him when you need him.

183
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,670
- You shouldn't manipulate someone's feelings like that—
- Excuse me.

184
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,640
We met your stalker.

185
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,870
Ji Wu got hit by the bat your stalker swung at him.

186
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,800
You probably don't know anything.

187
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,710
Because Ji Wu asked me not to tell you.

188
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,500
Because you would be worried.

189
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,460
And you will be anxious.

190
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,460
You manipulated those feelings

191
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,240
with no intention of accepting them in the first place.

192
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,370
In this situation, I don't like the fact that innocent Cha Ji Wu is the one suffering.

193
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,000
Because of your unidentified stalker and the anonymous forum, too.

194
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,520
So... are you saying that my stalker targeted Ji Wu?

195
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,290
[I scared the guy who was loitering around you. I did well, right?]

196
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,010
This scumbag.

197
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,690
Seonbae!

198
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,670
[I'll be back. Wait for me and don't fall asleep.]

199
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,780
Get lost!

200
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,380
Ji Wu!

201
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,060
Ji Wu, it's me!

202
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,930
Ji Wu!

203
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,970
Ji Wu!

204
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,440
Ro Ah Hyeong?

205
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,400
Are you okay?

206
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,290
Just leave. I want to be alone right now.

207
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,810
Just open the door.

208
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,840
I got drenched in the rain.

209
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,590
My hair is all wet too.

210
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,480
So just go home.

211
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,990
You know I can't wash my hair on my own with this arm.

212
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,400
- So you should—
- Hyeong, please!

213
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,260
I will stay here until you open the door.

214
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,170
You did nothing wrong.

215
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,650
And you have no reason to be hurt.

216
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,420
Anyway, I will be right here,

217
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,900
so open the door when you are ready.

218
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,620
There is a grandma who started writing poetry at the age of 92

219
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,650
and published her first poetry book at 98.

220
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,890
Among the poems that she wrote,

221
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,750
there is one that I like.

222
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,600
Would you like to hear it?

223
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,210
It's a poem called, "Deposit."

224
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,870
"You know,"

225
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,120
"when people are kind to me,"

226
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,410
"I deposit it inside my heart."

227
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,690
"When I feel lonely,"

228
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,190
"I take it out and cheer up from it."

229
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,830
"You should try depositing, too."

230
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,260
"It will be more helpful than a pension."

231
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,300
The kindness you showed me...

232
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,460
I also deposited everything.

233
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,130
Washing my hair,

234
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,470
doing my dishes,

235
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,470
feeding me...

236
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,640
You should try depositing from now on, too.

237
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,980
"One rainy day,"

238
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,790
"someone came running for me"

239
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,060
"and waited for me throughout the night."

240
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,890
Then later on...

241
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,290
not today, but later on...

242
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,180
when you are really lonely and miserable,

243
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,280
you can take it out and feel better.

244
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,590
[Love Class]

245
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,840
That post... We might be able to find out who wrote it.

246
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,730
Even so, he is just a mere criminal.

247
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,670
After escorting the female student home,

248
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,250
I was attacked by her stalker on my way back.

249
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,890
Do you know who it is?

250
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,100
- Everyone else besides Ji Wu was scary—
- I'm sure.

251
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,630
But Ji Wu is also a man.

252
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,780
One who likes you.

253
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,260
How does it look in your eyes?

254
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,540
Ji Wu and Yu Na...
