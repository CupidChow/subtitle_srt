00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,960
Okay, the first half of the class is about dating,

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,270
and the second half will be about marriage and family.
[Marriage and Family Occupational Therapy]

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,600
Of course, the result of dating doesn't have to be marriage,

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,920
but it remains to be a way of life that many people choose.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,060
And given that this system has lasted this long,

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,450
there's also a need to analyze it meticulously.

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,650
- Pass it back.
- Okay.

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,800
On the paper I handed out just now,

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,470
please write the name of the person you want to partner with and submit it.

10

I am Cha Ji Wu. A second-year student from the Department of Journalism and Communication.

And age difference doesn't matter at all.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,190
I like someone intelligent, so someone who wears glasses.

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,820
If you enjoy raising plants, I like that even more.

- Yes?

33
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,980
Must it be a male-female partnership?

34
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,110
I want to pair up with a girl.

Well... That's a little...

You can't!

37

Th-That's...

38
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,080
I don't th-think that should be possible.

39
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,240
- Why not?
- What?

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,780
Why do you think that shouldn't be possible?

41
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,750
Oh, well...

So...

00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,680
The Marriage and Family lectures we'll... be starting going forward...

44
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,780
are lectures that will be h-harmonious only if a male and female... pair up together.

45
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,170
I think it doesn't make sense for girls to be partners.

46
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,470
Marriage and Family class is where you learn about the community.

47
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,110
I don't think there will be a problem because two girls pair up.

48

Oh... okay. I guess you can...

I see that's what you think.

- B-But... given the circumstances—
- Oh, I see...

51
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,290
There was a lot of talk in the reviews for this lecture saying that

52
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,750
it's for flirting, practically pushing us at each other to flirt...

53
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,010
I mean, who comes to class to flirt?

54
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,730
I think you are totally misunderstanding this lecture, my dear classmate.

55
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,670
Or is there a female classmate you want to flirt with?

00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,030
Yes?

61
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,790
I also want to partner up with a girl.

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,050
Okay, then no one has a complaint, right?

- Yes.
- Yes.

69
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,660
There was a small debate, but

70
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,740
I assigned a majority of the groups so they are male-female partnerships.

71
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,980
And there are a lot of male students this semester,

72
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,290
so there will be some groups with only male partners out of necessity.

73
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,250
Even so, I will not be accepting any more objections,

00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,010
Me?

167
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,300
Now, the first assignment

168
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,700
is a 10,000 won date. (~ 7,50 USD)

169
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,120
Each of you puts in 10,000 won and spends a meaningful time together.

170
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,820
Time and cost are limited,

171
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,790
so you should coordinate your opinions.

172
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,070
A meeting is the start of a relationship and the first button.

173
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,380
Contemplating together and coming up with plans

174
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,790
is the objective of this assignment.

175
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,460
Couple set beverages.

176
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,350
I see...

177
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,330
Try it. This place is good.

178
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,160
Okay.

179
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,530
Seonbaenim.

180
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,510
Yes, Hubaenim.

181
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,740
Why do you keep staring at me so intently?

182
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,470
Because you're cute.

183
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,580
Okay...

184
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,610
I was sucking on that one.

185
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,660
Why are you recording?

186
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,620
I'm making a record of our assignment.

187
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,610
- Thank you for the food.
- Me, too.

188
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,310
Oh, yeah, Seonbaenim. I'll write the first draft of the report.

189
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,820
You can review it, make your edits, and finish it up.

190
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,410
Do you already want to part ways?

191
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,530
What?

192
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,040
We had our meal, so we should leave now.

193
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,840
But we have 4,000 won left. (~ 3 USD)

194
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,880
What can we do with that?

195
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,360
I've never done this before.

196
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,300
Try it out today... for our first date.

197
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,220
Stop saying the word "date," damn it!

198
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,720
I got it!

199
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,730
The couple set was 12,000 won,

200
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,160
The iron-fist game was 400 won. We both played two games.

201
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,700
- 1,600 won.
- Yeah.

202
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,370
And the air hockey was 800 won, and

203
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,710
- the claw machine was 1,000 won.
- 1,000 won.

204
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,390
Then...

205
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,410
19,400 won.

206
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,770
- Yeah.
- We have 600 won left over.

207
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,010
You can keep it as pocket money.

208
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,880
Wow. Such a large amount?

209
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,290
Today was really fun.

210
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,990
I know.

211
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,150
It's been a while.

212
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,790
No. It's practically my first time.

213
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,740
Having fun with someone like this.

214
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,170
It's pretty fun.

215
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,890
Ji Wu, you're an outcast, aren't you?

216
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,080
Where are you going?

217
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,780
We need to spend the remaining 600 won.

218
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,870
- Follow me.
- Wh-Where are we going?

219
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,020
Ouch.

220
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,070
Where are we going?

221
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,080
Let's just walk there!

222
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,920
I'm so tired.

223
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,880
We came so far.

224
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,770
Wow.

225
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,130
Was there a place like this?

226
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,800
[Cocoa]

227
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,040
Here, have a drink.

228
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,470
Does something like this still exist?

229
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,880
But Seonbaenim, I think this is too old.

230
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,010
Just try it. You won't die.

231
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,490
It's good.

232
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,880
Hot cocoa after a good sweat is the best.

233
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,950
Haven't you heard of it?

234
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,890
I never heard of it.

235
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,640
Why is it so good?

236
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
Wow, this is really good!

237
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,420
Sorry, you were just so cute.

238
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,250
Seonbae, can I ask you something?

239
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,110
Seonbae, by any chance... do you like men?

240
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,340
♫ Falling for you ♫

241
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,750
Seonbae, I'm joking. Just joking.

242
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,040
Wow, why is it so hot?

243
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,320
The hot cocoa is pretty hot.

244
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,780
- Is it because it's "hot?" Because it's hot—
- Hold on.

245
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,740
There.

246
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,600
- Yu Na.
- Ji Wu.

247
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,280
Help...

248
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,170
Help me.

249
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,940
♫ I'm just falling ♫

250
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,390
[Love Class]

251
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,850
Did you file a police report?

252
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,300
I became afraid of men at one point.

253
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,430
There's someone like that.

254
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,920
Who is it? Let me see!

255
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,890
What? That's too dangerous.

256
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,390
By chance, do you like Yu Na?

257
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,740
It's not like that.

258
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,580
Then don't stop me.

259
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,620
Where are you?

260
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,630
Ji Wu?
