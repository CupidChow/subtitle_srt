The hot cocoa is pretty hot. Is it because it's "hot?"

Fine.

168
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,650
Let's switch places now.

169
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,520
Thank you.

170
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,580
Okay.

171
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,510
Wait! Wait, hold on!

172
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,650
Hey, hey!

173
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,730
Hey, hey! Kim Nam Jun!

174
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,630
You're nice to Lee Ro Ah!

175
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,530
Why do you always mess with just me?

176
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,740
Shit, so annoying.

177
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,280
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

178
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,760
So you're saying you became afraid of men because of that stalker, right?

179
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,410
Is that why you said you will pair up with me?

180
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,210
But it's a class where you pair up with a man you don't know.

181
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,880
I wonder if it might have been better for you not to take this class.

182
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,860
To be honest, I took it because Professor Lim recommended it to me.

183
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,570
He told me that I would overcome my fear of men if I took this class.

184
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,360
Stop.

185
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,240
What?

186
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,480
What's your relationship with my professor Lim?

187
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,020
Oh.

188
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,350
Professor Lim is my uncle's student.

189
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,940
Daebak.

190
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,850
Yu Na.

191
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:10,770
Can you ask your uncle what Professor Lim's taste in women is like?

192
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,350
- Huh?
- I can ask him, but...

193
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,340
I'll ask him!

194
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,820
Hey, your answer was so ambiguous.

195
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,270
But why did you say you want to pair up with a girl?

196
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,930
I'm... making him think about me.

197
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,330
You know...

198
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,180
someone constantly hangs around you and makes you uncomfortable,

199
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,090
and at one point, you are subconsciously thinking about them.

200
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,570
You did it intentionally so he would think about you?

201
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,390
Exactly. Oh, and there's also this message.

202
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,370
"I don't want to pair up with any of these punks."

203
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,330
Why?

204
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,130
"Because my partner is none other than you, Professor Lim."

205
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,670
Aren't I so cute?

206
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,850
Yeah... you're cute.

207
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,870
Right.

208
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,510
Professor Lim should recognize it, not you.

209
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,540
That girl from earlier was Hye Won.

210
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,910
Oh, from that time...

211
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,380
That's right. The one who argued with you—

212
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,840
No, please forget about that. Please.

213
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,000
Hey.

214
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,710
Your hair is a mess.

215
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,460
Let me see.

216
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,170
- Hey, you have gray hair!
- Huh?

217
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,650
Hold on.

218
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,180
- Wait...
- Ouch!

219
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,340
Did it hurt a lot?

220
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,860
No, it's fine. Is there another one?

221
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,200
No.

222
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,920
I should plant it.

223
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,850
Back into my head.

224
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,810
Bye.

225
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,340
Yeah, bye.

226
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,000
Yu Na, sweet dreams.

227
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:12,340
[It's raining later. Take an umbrella when you meet Yu Na.]

228
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:17,560
[Thank you.]

229
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,150
Why isn't he replying?

230
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,930
He's making me worry.

231
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:22,140
[Where are you right now?]

232
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,530
Where are you?

233
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,900
Ji Wu?

234
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,380
Hello? Ji Wu.

235
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,120
Please help me!

236
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,340
Who told you to loiter around her? So annoying.

237
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,580
Seon– Seonbae. Seonbae...

238
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,840
You scumbag.

239
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,760
[Love Class]

240
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,970
... got drunk and fell.

241
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,490
What the hell are you doing these days?

242
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,670
You didn't even come home last night!

243
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,090
- There is someone, isn't there?
-Thanks for worrying, but

244
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,080
let's not overstep our boundaries.

245
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,110
Ji Wu. What should I do?

246
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,440
Let's talk it out! Ouch!

247
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,990
Don't play around with someone's heart, acting all innocent.

248
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,860
Multiple people will see blood because of you.
