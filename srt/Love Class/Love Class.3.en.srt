Please help me!

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,860
Who told you to loiter around her? So annoying.

00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,610
Seon– Seonbae. Seonbae...

4
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,570
You scumbag.

5
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,550
Seonbae. Seonbae, are you okay?

6
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,860
Who the hell are you?

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,690
Hey! You psycho!

8
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,350
Seonbae, are you okay?

9
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,810
Oh, no, no!

10
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,340
- What are you doing? We need to catch that bastard!
- No.

11
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,460
Yu Na will feel guilty.

12
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,810
All the more reason to catch him!

13
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,180
You could have been in danger, too!

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,220
I know. I know that, too, Hyeong...

15
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,550
But please...

16
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,970
You have a hairline fracture in your right wrist.

17
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,150
You will have to wear a cast for a while.

18
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,090
But how did this happen?

19
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,260
Oh, H-Hyeong... got drunk and fell.

20
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,020
Oh, I see.

21
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,560
You will have to come back in two weeks for a consultation,

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,210
- and don't use a stick inside to scratch.
- Okay.

23
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,710
You can hold an ice pack against it if it gets hard to resist.

24
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,200
If the pain becomes intolerable, don't wait

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,560
- and come to the hospital to get examined.
- Okay.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,590
Take it easy.

27
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,030
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,780
For my fractured arm? Or...

29
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,900
for stopping me from reporting him?

30
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,220
For both.

31
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,470
But Seonbae, how did you know I was there?

32
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,090
What do you think?

33
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,140
I was passing by and took a look when I heard a familiar voice.

34
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,430
Oh, really? Wow, daebak!

35
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,150
How did we just run into each other like that? That's unbelievable—

36
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,870
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,930
Oh, Seonbae.

38
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,480
I'll scrape up the treatment fee as soon as possible and make sure to pay you.

39
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,000
- It's fine.
- No, really! You got injured because of me,

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,180
- so I will make sure to—
- I said, it's fine.

41
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,880
No, really, Seonbae. Truly, no.

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,940
I... don't have money right now,

43
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,830
but if I get my part-time pay next month, I will—

44
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,490
I said it's fine! Gosh.

45
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,470
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,740
Forget about the treatment fee.

47
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,550
But become my right arm instead.

48
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,510
Huh?

49
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,790
Since I can't use my arm because of you,

50
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,910
you should become my right arm.

51
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,830
It's not like I'm left-handed.

52
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,940
Oh!

53
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,500
Yes, Hyeongnim!

54
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,810
I will serve you with my whole being!

55
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,550
With my whole being...

56
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,480
I'll serve you. With my whole...

57
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,470
Sorry.

58
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,940
Sit down.

59
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,460
Yes, Hyeongnim.

[Episode 3 of 6]

61
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,970
That was rushed!

62
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,770
That was too rushed!

63
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,810
Your timing is too rushed, so it keeps hitting the net!

64
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,040
Yeah?

65
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,190
Keep your eyes on the ball! Try it again.

66
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,570
The door is closed.

67
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,050
- You're home?
- Hey, what's wrong with your arm?

68
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,900
Did you get hurt?

69
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,450
Yes, it just happened.

70
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,040
What the hell are you doing these days?

71
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,310
You didn't even come home last night!

72
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,350
How did you break your arm?

73
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,720
It's not a big deal.

74
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,180
- Is there someone you like?
- What are you saying?

75
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,600
You've never been like this before.

76
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,120
Your mind is somewhere else all day long!

77
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,900
You stay out overnight and even injure your arm.

78
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,760
There is someone, isn't there?

79
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,440
Hey, Kim Nam Jun.

80
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,840
I think you have... just overstepped your boundary.

81
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,590
- I'm just worried about—
- Thanks for worrying, but

82
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,210
let's not overstep our boundaries.

83
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,720
- What? Hey, Lee Ro Ah.
- The door is open.

84
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,130
My friends!

85
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,160
I see you waited up for me, huh?

86
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,570
Aigo, I missed you a lot, too—

87
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,970
Please!

88
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,190
As I said, Kim Nam Jun, that idiot,

89
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,840
always gets temperamental with just me.

90
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,750
Right, Ro Ah?

91
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,330
Nam Jun!

92
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,410
Kim Nam Jun!

93
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,970
I looked everywhere for you.

94
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,870
Let's go home.

95
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,510
- Get up. We should go home.
- Let go.

96
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,990
What are you doing here? Let's go home—

97
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,130
I said, let go of me, damn it!

98
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,350
Are you okay?

99
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,260
I'm fine.

100
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,780
What did you come here for?

101
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,310
I was worried you would drown yourself.

102
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,000
Who cares if a guy like me drowns or not?

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,180
You can't do that.

104
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,860
You are my most precious friend.

105
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,250
I'm aware that you don't think of me as... just a friend.

106
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,150
But I consider you as such a precious and close friend,

107
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,250
so I wish you would stay that way for a long time.

108
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,130
If I didn't have you,

109
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,650
I would be too lonely.

110
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,230

111
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,880
You're right. I'm selfish.

So my Nam Jun, who's so much kinder and more charming than I am,

113
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,480
should meet a boyfriend better than me, don't you agree?

114
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,870
Whatever.

115
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,380

- Yeah?

- There is nothing going on, is there?
- Huh?

120
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,700
I am more reassured since you walk with me,

121
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,800
but I can't help but worry.

Oh, no. No. Nothing like that will happen.

124
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,480
Don't worry.

125
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,050
Okay. Thanks.

126

If something happens, make sure to let me know.

127

I don't want you to be harmed.

No. Of course, I should wash your hair.

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,810
What are you doing here?

168
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,060
Well, I was just passing by.

169
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,550
Aigo!

170
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,850
What? What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

171
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,190
Hurry and take it.

172
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,330
You didn't poison it, did you?

173
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,470
- Just give it back then—
- Okay! Okay.

174
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,520
But...

175
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,750
is Ro Ah hanging out with anyone these days?

176
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,140
He's always by himself. Who would he hang out with?

177
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,510
Now that I think about it, he

178
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,660
does seem to be hanging out with Ji Wu

179
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,000
because of the Marriage and Family lecture.

180
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,110
- Ji Wu?
- Yes, Cha Ji Wu.

181
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,580
A hubae from our major.

182
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,040
There he is! Ji Wu!

183
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,010
Min Jae Seonbae!

184
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,450
Huh? What about Ro Ah Sunbae? Is he not here yet?

185
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,010
Geez.

186
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,760
Why are there so many questions involving Lee Ro Ah today?

187
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,340
Is no one curious about me?

188
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,650
It's because I'm indebted to Ro Ah Seonbae for something.

189
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,840
- I'm leaving first.
- Okay.

190
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,950
Bye.

191
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,770
Aigo.

192
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,660
Hey! Hey, Kim Nam Jun!

193
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,560
That bastard! What's wrong with him now?

194
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,340
Gosh.

195
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,040
This is you, isn't it?
[Hyeong! Get better soon!]

196
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,660
Yes.

197
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,480
When you tell someone to get better, it's just "Get better."

198
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,030
You add the bottom consonant when someone gives birth.

199
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,960
Why did you do the dishes?

200
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,510
It's not like I'm going to cook anyway.

201
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,220
- You're trying to say thank you, right?
- Yes.

202
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,330
Why aren't you...

203
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,940
What's wrong now?

204
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,950
Hyeong, you can eat with your left hand!

205
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,360
It's fine. Don't worry about me and eat.

206
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,140
Really, just pretend I'm not here.

207
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,450
Fine, give it to me.

208
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,970
What do you want, Hyeong?

209
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,710
This one first.

210
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,240
You are really wicked.

211
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,150
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.

212
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,100
This one, too. This one.

213
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,510
Again. This is mine, though.

214
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,040
- Do you want it?
- Yes.

215
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,560
Not that one. You were eating that. I want a new one.

216
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,910
Hyeong, geez. Just...

217
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,800
Cha Ji Wu. See me.

218
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,640
Why are you doing this?

219
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,530
Let's talk it out! Ouch!

220
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,430
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

221
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,990
Lee Ro Ah's roommate.

222
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,810
A-And?

223
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,460
I'm someone who lives with Ro Ah.

224
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:59,480
If... this is about me doing the dishes without permission yesterday,

225
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,730
it's because Ro Ah Hyeong hurt his arm and can't—

226
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,040
Ro Ah called you over to the house too?

227
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,380
Shit. This is driving me nuts.

228
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,250
- Hey!
- Yes?

229
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,640
You are the reason Ro Ah's arm got injured, aren't you?

230
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,880
Don't play around with someone's heart, acting all innocent.

231
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,420
Multiple people will see blood because of you.

232
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,150
What?

233
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,490
Do you really not know why Ro Ah is acting like that?

234
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,400
Do you have something to say?

235
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,340
No.

236
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,280
I have only seen this on TV, but they are sitting right there.

237
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,930
I guess it's true.

238
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,160
Daebak! Is this for real?

239
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,380
This is about our lecture, right? Right?

240
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,310
Wow, that's crazy. That's crazy.

241
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,930
- Hold on. Stay put for now.
- Why?

242
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,980
I can just ask him directly. Hey, Cha Ji Wu!

243
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,070
Why? Yu Na, what's wrong?

244
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,680
Ji Wu...

245
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,740
Is this for real?

246
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,620
Are you two really dating?

247
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,960
[Love Class]

248
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,500
- Isn't this Lee Ro Ah?
- Cha Ji Wu, that bastard

249
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,320
doesn't see you as a man.

250
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,380
You are just a seonbae from the same major!

251
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,170
You are selfish.

252
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,590
You only look for him when you need him.

253
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,100
- You shouldn't manipulate someone's feelings like that—
- Excuse me.

254
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,570
He can't understand your feelings!

255
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,320
He will only feel disgusted!

256
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,370
Get lost!
