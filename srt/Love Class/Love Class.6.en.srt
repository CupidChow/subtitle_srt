00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,410
This is me confessing right now...

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,080
that I like you.

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,990
We're going first!

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,500
I had fun.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,060
Take care.

6
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,770
Hyeong.

7
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,630
Yu Na confessed to me today.

8
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,120
That's so good for you! Congratulations.

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,480
Your one-sided love is finally ending.

10
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,570
What's wrong with your expression, though?

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,800
I don't know.

12
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,740
Don't know what?

13
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,870
It's the moment I've been waiting for,

14
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,880
but as soon as I heard her say she likes me,

15
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,450
someone else... kept coming to mind.

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,770
Ro Ah Hyeong, I...

17
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,120
Don't act like a fool.

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,000
What?

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,470
What are the chances in this world that you will receive a confession from your crush?

20
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,500
This might be the first and last chance in your life.

21
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,850
Do you want to blow this chance like this?

22
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,920
Get it together.

23
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,630
I like you.

24
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,640
I'm saying that I have come to like you.

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,660
- Ji Wu...
- Why were you...

26
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,100
Why were you so kind to me all this time?

27
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,990
Why were you kind to me without permission?

28
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,180
You're not even a weatherman, but you always tell me to bring an umbrella.

29
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,420
You got drenched in the rain because you came to my house when I cut off all communications.

30
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,710
Why did you stay by my side when I was down?

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,210
Because you're a hubae from the same major

32
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,020
and assignment partner.

33
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,990
That's it.

34
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,180
I'm sorry for making you misunderstand.

35
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,770
Lies.

36
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,900
Stop lying.

37
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,630
I'm going first.

38
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,770
I only had eyes for you today,

39
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,220
and you were the first to come to mind after I heard Yu Na's confession.

40
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,010
But... you're saying I misunderstood by myself?

41
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,140
Look me in the eye and say it!

42
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,930
Yes.

43
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,910
It was a misunderstanding.

I...

48
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,210
There is someone who helps me.

49
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,700
He worries about me and protects me.

50
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,780
He's someone who leads me.

51
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,110
So what I'm saying is...

52
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,230
It's my first time rejecting anyone,

53
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,240
so I don't really know how to go about it.

54
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,250
I'm sorry, Yu Na.

55
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,820
I want to stay by that person's side.

56
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,790
So annoying...

57
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,970
Why are you so cool when you're the one rejecting me?

58
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,470
What?

59
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,780
Is this a hidden camera?

60
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,290
I don't know. Don't ask someone who was just rejected.

61
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,900
Sorry.

62
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,870
You've changed a lot.

- It's nothing.

71
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,210
Are you rejoicing after rejecting me?

73
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,540
An eventful semester has passed, yet again.

74
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,720
Yes, Sir.

75
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,980
- Did everyone make a good relationship?
- Yes.

76
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,390
- No.
- No.

77
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,570
Oh, dear.

78
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,630
Well. The thing that connects one person and another together,

79
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,770
we call that yeon.

80
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,250
Words like wu-yeon, in-yeon, and pil-yeon.

81
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,480
I wanted to give you guys wu-yeon (coincidence)

82
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,570
through a class together.

83
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,960
The process of that wu-yeon becoming an in-yeon (destiny)

84
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,280
and then becoming pil-yeon (fate)

85
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,640
is quite a special experience, in my opinion.

86

If those special experiences came to you,

- Oh right, Yu Na.

97
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,650
- Did you erase your Instagram on purpose?
- Yes.

98
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,390
The lecture is done, and the culprit was caught.

99
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,090
I erased it to also erase all the bad memories.

100

- I see...
- I have a new account.

It's private, but I will let you follow me on exception.

The blooming period is usually from November to March.

108

You have to pay attention to the temperature and

109
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,220
watch the soil so that it doesn't dry out.

And my feelings just grew more certain.

169
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,090
♫ There are so many things I'm grateful for ♫

170
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,650
So I made up my mind

171
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,160
that I should make my heart stronger.

172
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,410
So I won't get tired even after a long wait.

173
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,740
- Ji Wu.
- Please tell him that I'm really okay.

174
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,770
That I'm really okay with waiting for him.

175
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,580
That he doesn't have to accept someone like me,

176
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,970
so please just tell him he doesn't have to run away anymore.

177
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,590
This is why I wasn't going to see you.

178
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,670
Where the hell are you going?

179
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,450
Ji Wu...

180
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,610
If Ji Wu ever looks for me,

181
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,030
tell him you don't know, either.

182
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,600
So he can forget everything.

183
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,360
How could you tell me to...

184
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,060
I beg of you.

185
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,960
As a friend.

186
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,370
Hey. Did you ask him out or something?

187
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,400
Did he reject you, saying you're dirty?

188
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,720
You can't go to school because you're embarrassed? Is this high school?

189
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,780
He said he likes me.

190
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,560
Ji Wu did...

191
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,810
The reason he suffered so much, it's all because of me.

192
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,600
That kind of gossip spread because I was by his side.

193
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,820
If it weren't for me, he could've lived happily with Yu Na.

194
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,530
He was hurt because of me.

195
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,790
So much that he couldn't go to school.

196
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,420
So what are you going to do?

197
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,460
He will realize one day

198
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,650
that his feelings right now were a misunderstanding.

199
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,240
What if they were not?

200
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,120
What if he becomes more sure? What will you do then?

201

For what?

209
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,670
I don't think

210
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,410
I ever said this to you in the past ten years.

211
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,790
I'm really glad...

212
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,950
you're my friend.

Thank you.

214
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:12,030
You can't ever tell Ro Ah that I told you this.

215
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,780
Where is he right now?

[Surf Ground]

217
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,090
Give it a rest.

218
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,960
No one is going to come on a day like this.

219
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,710
I'm just keeping the stray thoughts away by keeping busy.

220
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,110
Please don't mind me.

221
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,990
Isn't it cold?

222
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,530
Of course, it's cold.

223
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,570
But if you call yourself a real surfer,

224
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,700
you can't miss the winter waves of the East Sea.

225
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,410
The waves are good and strong.

226
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,890
Why do you like surfing, Boss?

227
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,080
Hey, that's not something I can explain to you with words.

228
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,470
You will know if you try it yourself.

229
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,870
Do you want to give it a try?

230
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,380
No, it's impossible for me.

231
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,190
Why would a guy who hates surfing work at a surfing shop?

232
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,440
Don't you find the sea scary?

233
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,240
I do.

234
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,350
I do, even though I go in there every day.

235
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,920
Because the sea is unpredictable.

236
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Even the most skilled surfer shouldn't be sure of himself.

237
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,940
Because the waves don't act as you wish.

238
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,380
Why surf if it's scary?

239
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,550
Hey, why would I give up just because I'm scared?

240
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,020
Let's say I failed to ride this wave and fell.

241
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,040
then I just need to wait for the next wave.

242
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,580
Because my wave will come for sure.

243
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,650
If you keep avoiding things out of fear,

244
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,940
you're going to die without knowing the good things in life.

245
