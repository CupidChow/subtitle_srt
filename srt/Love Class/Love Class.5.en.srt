Hyeong.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,450
Yeah?

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,810
Is that Grandma poet still alive?

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,740
She passed away in 2003.

5
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:19,590
She passed away at the age of 102,

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,610
so she lived a full life.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,720
She wrote poetry until she was 100 years old.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,020
She even published two poetry books.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,400
She lived diligently.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,810
She did live diligently.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,790
But doesn't it affect you?

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,400
Yeah.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,020
When I discovered that poem,

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,630
- she had already passed away.
- Not that,

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,870
the post on the forum.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,290
That post...

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,570
We might be able to find out who wrote it.

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,840
How?

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,600
What class we are taking,

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,690
and our relationship with Yu Na...

21
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,060
It was written by someone who knows all that.

22
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,440
It might be

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,670
one of the students taking the class with us.

24
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,120
- Then...
- You bit his arm, right?

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,660
There should be a wound on his arm.

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,760
But do you think we will find him?

27
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,180
I mean, you are right, but...

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,960
I feel like that guy is meticulous

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,010
and always observing us...

30
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,440
Even so, he is just a mere criminal.

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,430
All he knows is how to swing a mere bat.

32
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,650
That's more than scary.

33
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,050
So I'm saying we should give him a scare.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,610
What is wrong with you?

35
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,050
I mean...

36
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,970
Lying in the same bed like this...

37
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,820
It's like we were really dating.

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,090
I'm going to the bathroom.

39
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,160
See you soon, Hyeong.

[Love Class]
[Episode 5 of 6]

41
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,880
What? Are you crazy?

42
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,320
What were you doing when you should have smacked him in the head?

43
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,670
What is a classmate good for? He can walk you home, no problem.

44
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,420
How could he treat you like a criminal, accusing you of manipulation?

45
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,660
Hey, tell him to cut the bullshit.

46
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,090
Who does he think he is to talk to you like that?

47
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,130
He seemed to have a reason.

48
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,450
When he was talking about Ji Wu...

49
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,700
It felt like he meant it.

50
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,850
Hey... Even so, right?

51
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,180
What Seonbae said is right.

52
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,670
He definitely knew about it,

53
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,750
that Ji Wu had feelings for me for a while.

54
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,520
I...

55
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,110
manipulated Ji Wu.

56
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,690
Do you think Ji Wu is the only one who likes you?

57
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,720
I'm sure there is a truckload out there.

58
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,270
Don't talk about this so easily.

59
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,870
Do you remember how I told you I was being stalked by a man I didn't know?

60
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,050
He threatened me, saying he even knew my house's passcode.

61
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,170
I was miserable every night,

62
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,590
scared that he might break in at any time.

63
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,700
But...

64
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,480
But?

65
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,730
But Ji Wu...

66
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,540
has innocent feelings for me,

67
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,890
so I thought I would be okay.

68
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,870
Isn't what you are saying a little weird?

69
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,680
- Everyone else besides Ji Wu was scary─
- I'm sure.

70
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,260
But Ji Wu is also a man.

71
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,380
One that likes you.

72
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,990
[If you're truly sorry to Ji Wu, do me a favor.]

73
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,960
Who is it?

74
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,460
A friend.

75
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,010
Will you be okay?

76
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,170
You have to stand in front of everyone.

77
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,380
Yes. Since I have you, Hyeong.

78
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,970
I'm thankful to hear that.

79
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,100
This is the end of our presentation.

80
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,160
We have something to tell you all.

81
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,440
Professor. Please excuse us.

82
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,040
Shall we hear them out?

83
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,660
Okay.

84
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,360
As you all know,

85
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,760
recently, there was a post

86
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,290
on the school's anonymous forum.

87
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,260
I'm a classmate of the female student mentioned in the post.

88
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,840
The student, who has been suffering because of a stalker,

89
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,150
asked me to escort her on her way home.

90
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,460
After escorting the female student home,

91
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,480
I was attacked

92
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,410
by her stalker on my way back.

93
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,120
As I escaped from that attack,

94
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,900
I bit the stalker's wrist.

95
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,900
Then do you know who it is?

96
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,770
We have no way of knowing,

97
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,860
but I'm sure there is a wound on his arm.

98
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,080
Yes.

99
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,400
Could everyone pull up their sleeves, please?

100
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,930
What are you doing during class time?

101
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,010
Aren't I right?

102
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,360
- You can just show them.
- No!

103
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,260
The fact that we are being suspected is unpleasant.

104
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,880
This is clearly an infringement of my rights.

105
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,980
I mean, it's not that difficult of a request.

106
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,890
They become fools, if they are incorrect,

107
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,480
but they are doing this to catch the culprit.

108
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,450
[Even the picture of Lee Ro Ah and Cha Ji Wu feeding each other is fucking romantic. Apparently, Cha Ji Wu followed Yu Na, who is the goddess of Department of Journalism and Communication. But I heard that he is a damn loser without any friends.]

109
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,050
It's not me!

110
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,210
What the hell?

111
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,570
Hey. This?

112
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,400
Does this prove that I'm a criminal?

113
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,710
Then how did you hurt your arm?

114
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,640
Why do I need to tell you that? Huh?

115
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,790
If you are going to do politics and witch hunt like this,

116
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,430
do it on the forum! Shit.

117
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,070
Sure.

118
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,360
Explain it to those men.

119
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,520
Shit!

120
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,640
It's over now.

121
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,400
Let the cops handle the rest.

122
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,020
Then Yu Na will walk home with me from now on.

123
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,640
Thanks so much, everyone.

124
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,240
Thank you, Seonbae.

125
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,100
You did well.

126
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,470
- Let's go, Hye Won.
- Okay.

127
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,750
Bye-bye.

128
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,400
- Take care.
- Bye.

129
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,580
Be careful, the steps...

130
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,510
I think I can sleep soundly now, Hyeong.

131
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,030
Thank you... so much, Hyeong.

132
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,890
Not at all. I didn't do anything.

133
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,820
You did a good job.

134
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,570
Shall we go now?

135
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,040
Yes.

136
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,220
Get home safe then.

137
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,000
Get home safe.

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,830
Yes, Hyeong. I'll be off.

139
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,070
There was a brief commotion
[Humane Relationships]

140
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,240
but assignments must go on, right?

141
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,590
This one is a restful assignment, so don't be like that.

142
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,730
This assignment is called "Double Date."

143
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,470
Going on a date with another couple for a day.

144
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,270
It will be a fun experience to expand your relationships and learn about each other.

145

- Yes?

168
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,120
Shall we t-take one together, too?

169
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,480
Don't get nervous now.

170
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,280
I'm not nervous at all.

171
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,980
Let's take it while laughing.

172
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,860
One, two, three.

173
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,700
It's a little awkward, right?

174
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,170
Should we take one acting handsome?

175
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,320
Like a celebrity.

176
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,630
One, two, three...

177
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:46,300
♫ I want to give you what I saved up ♫

178
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,640
- Did it come out well?
- No, Hyeong. It's terrible.

179
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,440
- I don't think you need to see it.
- You can't do that.

180
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,770
- Let me see it, too.
- N-No.

181
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,210
Y-You really can't.

182
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,110
You can't.

183
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,500
It's really bad. Absolutely bad.

184
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,430
R-Really.

185
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,250
Cheers!

186
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,280
So Yu Na suddenly says to that seonbae's face,

187
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,530
"D. I. E."

188
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,870
- I swear.
- Really?

189
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,110
Daebak. That's my girl.

190
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,240
Hey, when did I tell him to go die?

191
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,260
I said, "L. A. M. E."

192
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,360
"Let's Aim for a Marvelous and Epic year."

193
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,710
Oh, you're right.

194
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,300
Anyway, you should have seen that seonbae's face, Hyeong.

195
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,970
- It was really worth seeing.
- Didn't you see it?

196
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,880
I was there, too.

197
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,690
But by the time I arrived, you were all drunk already.

198
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,170
You came late, Hyeong.

199
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,150
You latecomer.

200
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,000
We are short on the booze. I will go buy some more.

201
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,050
- Let's go together, Hyeong.
- You sit and wait.

202
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,190
A guest must stay seated at all times.

203
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,720
I will go by myself, okay?

204
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,430
- Okay then.
- Then...

205
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,310
I'm going to the restroom.

206
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,760
Again?

207
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,310
This is why beer sucks.

208
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,190
Are you going again?

209
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,180
- It tastes good, right?
- Yes, it does.

210
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,480
What are you doing here?

211
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,610
I was requested... to let them be alone together.

212
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,940
- From Ji Wu?
- Hm?

213
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,630
Nope, from Yu Na.

214
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,000
Why? Does it bother you?

215
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,850
How does it look in your eyes?

216
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,100
Ji Wu and Yu Na.

217
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Uh, well.

218
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,620
Just a pretty girl and a bit of a loser but cute boy...

219
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,340
Why?

220
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,560
Because Ji Wu likes Yu Na.

221
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,150
Since quite a while ago.

222
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,520
Drink up!

223
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,240
He must be crazy.

224
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,150
Hey.

225
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,930
He's definitely drunk.

226
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,860
The world is really unfair.

227
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,990
That girl.

228
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,160
She's flawless.

229
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,280
She's that pretty...

230
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,410
has a good personality...

231
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,270
and is good at studying...

232
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,100
Her family is well off too. Probably.

233
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,340
♫ I'm wandering endlessly ♫

234
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,330
Isn't it so much fun?

235
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,420
♫ My heart and ♫

236
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,270
♫ My two eyes ♫

237
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,210
Are you a freshman?

238
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,630
Why did you drink so much?

239
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,420
Why, you ask?

240
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,860
♫ And so I cried ♫

241
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,430
There's no other way...

242
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,940
to appeal to her except doing these things.

243
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,720
This is all someone like me...

244
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,000
can do.

245
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,740
♫ And I hold on ♫

246
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,420
♫ 'Cause I hear a song ♫

247
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:57,020
♫ All the melody in me is in you ♫

248
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,450
I'm sorry.

249
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,440
For what?

250
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,080
You got attacked by the stalker because of me.

251
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,980
Ro Ah Seonbae's arm even got fractured.

252
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,990
It's because of me.

253
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,100
- I'm really sorry.
- No, Yu Na.

254
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,440
This is why I didn't tell you.

255
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,270
You really don't need to be sorry.

256
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,750
No.

257
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,420
I manipulated your goodwill.

258
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,300
I knew it was dangerous,

259
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,880
but you had feelings for me,

260
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,970
so I manipulated them.

261
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,730
I'm the worst, aren't I?

262
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,310
I guess...

263
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,160
I was really broken all this time.

264
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,620
Never mind. I won't make excuses.

265
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,310
Not at all, Yu Na.

266
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,500
Anyone can be like that in your situation.

267
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,880
And I helped you because I wanted to.

268
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,010
Ji Wu.

269
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,740
I...

270
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,740
was at least able to smile thanks to you.

271
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,080
Really? I'm glad.

272
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,400
At some point,

273
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,840
I started looking forward to walking home with you.

274
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,600
So that's why...

275
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,980
from now on,

276
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,060
can I walk you home?

277
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,760
Huh?

278
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,400
Why?

279
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,640
I'll eat with you and

280
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,150
help you with assignments on the weekends.

281
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,990
No, it's fine.

282
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,440
Yu Na, why would you do that?

283
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,380
This is me confessing to you right now...

284
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,440
that I like you.

285
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,930
[Love Class]

286
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,460
What are the chances in this world that you will receive a confession from your crush?

287
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,070
This might be the first and last chance in your life.

288
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,630
Do you want to blow this chance like this?

289
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,330
I'm saying that I have come to like you.

290
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,550
How many times do I need to tell you?

291
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,490
I don't know where he is, either.

292
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,700
If you keep avoiding things out of fear,

293
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,260
you're going to die without knowing the good things in life.

294
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,940
Ro Ah Hyeong!
