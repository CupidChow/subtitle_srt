=Episode 6=

3
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,050
Jinbei is here for the first time.

4
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,341
It's normal that she didn't know.

5
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:42,616
She can ask.

6
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,530
How can she use the sacrifice at will.

7
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,300
Your were at the kitchen.

8
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,775
Why didn't you tell her.

9
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,150
I...

10
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,800
I forgot.

11
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,116
But she destroyed the sacrifice.

12
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,400
What should we use
for the ancestor worship tomorrow?

13
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,683
Grandma.

14
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,900
It's OK. I'll take care of it.

15
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,044
How?

16
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:04,175
I'll prepare one tonight.

17
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:05,442
It is very late.

18
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:07,197
Can you make it?

19
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:14,676
She makes a trouble as soon
as she arrived at our family,

20
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:16,325
and you have to take care of it.

21
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,950
Brother.

22
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,850
Don't you hate this kind of person?

23
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:21,100
No.

24
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:28,159
Do you eat or not?

25
00:02:28,243 --> 00:02:31,425
The family's reunion dinner is important.

26
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:32,675
Uncle Zhou.

27
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,350
Place an order from FuRongLou.

28
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,625
OK.

29
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,391
I'm full of madness.

30
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:43,541
Enjoy yourself!

31
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,458
Yingying.

32
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,283
Jinbei.

33
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,700
Yingying is still young.

34
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:50,357
Don't take it to heart.

35
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:58,775
Ready for lunch.

36
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:02,200
I haven't had a hot pot for so long.

37
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,125
Even If I had hot pot before.
It's for work.

38
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,300
I can't enjoy it.

39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,050
That's a pity.

40
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:12,325
Such a sacred thing.

41
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:16,016
You should calm yourself down
and enjoy the process.

42
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,851
So.
You can eat at your own will,

43
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,391
and eat as much as you like
as long as you like.

44
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:23,150
If there are not enough
I'll go and buy more.

45
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,225
Come, have a taste.

46
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:28,366
Thanks!

47
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,478
Dip this.

48
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,850
What about it?

49
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,509
Good!

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,450
My secret recipe sauce.

51
00:03:42,694 --> 00:03:44,010
That is interesting.

52
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:46,037
I can come more often if you like.

53
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:50,000
I think.

54
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,177
We lack something.

55
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,775
What?

56
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:54,808
Cheers.

57
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:02,017
We promised
that I'll prepare everything.

58
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,500
You told me.
Courtesy on one side only last not long.

59
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,133
Fine.

60
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,575
You returned the egg and now own me beer.

61
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:11,008
It's good.

62
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:01,978
Come out.

63
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:03,462
I know it's you.

64
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:10,027
Oh, you've caught me out again.
I came here to see.

65
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:12,087
Do you need help?

66
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:15,819
No, thanks.

67
00:05:16,076 --> 00:05:17,645
Don't make trouble.

68
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:20,614
You look down on me.

69
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:29,947
A delicately hand.

70
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:34,142
It's often used on girls
but I think you can use this word as well.

71
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:35,059
Dr. Zhou.

72
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:39,305
Have someone in the hospital
said that your hands are so delicate?

73
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:44,898
Fine, I won't disturb you.

74
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:47,809
I came here to cheer you up,

75
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:52,604
to be a beautiful
silent cheerleader.

76
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,825
What an adorable kitten!

77
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,449
So cute!

78
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:10,294
Don't move.

79
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:33,292
Don't move.

80
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,778
Where are we going?

81
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:56,413
Grandma. Let's go.

82
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:09,281
Amazing!

83
00:07:09,683 --> 00:07:12,451
Your time tomorrow.

84
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,889
Miss Su.

85
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:33,711
Aunt Song.

86
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:35,506
I'll go call her, you do your work.

87
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:36,456
OK.

88
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:54,372
Hey.

89
00:07:55,828 --> 00:07:56,941
Wake up.

90
00:07:57,072 --> 00:07:59,452
Open the door,
or you'll fall asleep again.

91
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:05,039
I'll get changed.

92
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:09,897
Coming, coming.

93
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:16,603
Wait, wait.

94
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:17,607
Come out.

95
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:19,656
Wait, I haven't worn makeup.

96
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:21,600
It's too late. Forget it.

97
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:22,824
No, I'll be quick.

98
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:26,597
Go.

99
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,095
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

100
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,012
Fine.

101
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:39,715
It's fine.

102
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,485
I'll take her to change the clothes.

103
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:45,340
Come here.

104
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,389
Yingying.

105
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:57,840
Are you doing it on purpose?

106
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:00,522
Jinbei is your sister.

107
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:01,863
Behave yourself.

108
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:06,344
I got it, brother.

109
00:09:14,905 --> 00:09:16,303
Like I will.

110
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:23,209
I'll get changed.

111
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:28,603
Oh, my gosh. Nothing fits.

112
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,686
I brought just a few clothes.

113
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:31,919
Wait a moment.

114
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:45,755
Where is she?

115
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,840
It's late, where is she?

116
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:47,866
Is there anything?

117
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,549
She's wasting time.

118
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:50,548
What's the matter?

119
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:53,231
We will start the ceremony soon.

120
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,485
Someone is still not here.

121
00:09:56,883 --> 00:09:57,854
Uncle Zhou.

122
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:00,222
Go see if Jinbei is ready.

123
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,449
OK.

124
00:10:04,218 --> 00:10:05,416
My sister.

125
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:08,898
Your future granddaughter-in-law
is not so polite to us.

126
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:12,864
The right time is coming.

127
00:10:13,435 --> 00:10:16,660
It's not appropriate to pass it.

128
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,488
I say.

129
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:20,198
She can come or not.

130
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:21,626
If she doesn't, we should start.

131
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:22,654
I agree with that.

132
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:24,794
Sorry to keep you waiting.

133
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:38,976
Su Jinbei.

134
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:43,201
-Beautiful.
-So pretty.

135
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,518
Wonderful.

136
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:49,021
Try this one on.

137
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,876
This one.

138
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:56,384
My mother left it for me.

139
00:11:01,236 --> 00:11:02,491
Alright.

140
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:04,431
Let's go inside.

141
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:07,628
Go.

142
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:11,623
-Go in.
-Come on, let' s go inside.

143
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:25,692
My brother is the head of the family.

144
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:26,776
He should stand in the front.

145
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:28,460
You stand beside Yingying.

146
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:29,573
Go ahead.

147
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:48,352
Zhou's ancestors are respectfully
invited to the upper position.

148
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:49,587
Burn joss sticks piously.

149
00:11:55,684 --> 00:11:57,168
Kneel.

150
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:10,586
Yingying.

151
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,093
You are not young anymore.

152
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:14,548
Why are you so rude in the ancestral hall?

153
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:16,154
-Grandma.
-Fine.

154
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:18,307
We'll talk later.

155
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:19,827
Don't interrupt the ceremony.

156
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:24,165
Kowtow...

157
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:29,929
to pray for the happiness of Zhou family.

158
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:31,898
Get up.

159
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:36,820
-Dr. Xiao.
-Hello.

160
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:48,584
You're about to leave the hospital.

161
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:50,876
And you look better.

162
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:52,930
Beautiful.

163
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:56,041
Your aromatherapy should take the credit.

164
00:12:56,265 --> 00:12:58,524
Fresh air, fresh flowers.

165
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:01,606
I feel good and the disease is gone.

166
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:03,974
It sounds like praising me.

167
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,430
It's thanking you.

168
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,452
Here is my card.

169
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:13,079
I have a restaurant.

170
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:14,562
It tastes good.

171
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:16,759
If you don't feel good, Dr. Xiao.

172
00:13:16,873 --> 00:13:18,214
I welcome you to my restaurant.

173
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:20,383
OK, I will come.

174
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:22,900
-Bye.
-Bye.

175
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:39,218
Su Jinbei. You did this.

176
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,607
You put cocklebur in the mat.
It's not me.

177
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:46,714
I didn't do it.
I don't want you to kneel beside me.

178
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,854
I didn't expect you to change it.

179
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:50,737
How did you do it?

180
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:53,279
It's magic.

181
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:56,331
Your future sister-in-law
played a part as a magician once.

182
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,442
I learned some tricks.

183
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:00,868
I'm unlucky this time.

184
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,866
Just wait and see.

185
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,266
How did I offend you?

186
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,749
Why did you do that to me?

187
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,460
You know what you did.

188
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,688
I just don't know.

189
00:14:09,772 --> 00:14:12,570
Can my little sister remind me a bit?

190
00:14:12,654 --> 00:14:15,081
You've done so many bad things
and you can't even remember?

191
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:19,276
You kept close with my brother Jiawei,

192
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,445
and now you pretend to come home
with my second brother.

193
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:22,699
What do you want?

194
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:25,240
Oh, my gosh.
The world is so small.

195
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,549
You are a fan of Xu Jiawei?

196
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:29,948
We...

197
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:32,835
No.

198
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:36,083
The thing between me and your Jiawei
is a misunderstanding from the media.

199
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:39,111
It doesn't exist at all.
Really.

200
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:40,765
You don't have to pretend in front of me.

201
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:42,777
I'm not my second brother,
I'm not that foolish.

202
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,244
Why is your second brother foolish?

203
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:52,464
See it yourself.

204
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:54,404
I know.

205
00:14:54,918 --> 00:14:56,573
It's old news now.

206
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:59,198
The news is old
but the thing is real.

207
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,939
She's flirting with other man.

208
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,858
-You don't care?
-I do.

209
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:04,850
But she didn't.

210
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:06,848
-You believe her?
-Yes.

211
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:09,306
-You don't believe me.
-Yes.

212
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:10,818
Shiyun. Shiyun.

213
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:12,213
Su Jinbei.

214
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:14,211
What did you trick my brother with?

215
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:16,438
He doesn't even believe me
I am his sister.

216
00:15:16,522 --> 00:15:17,548
Zhou Suying.

217
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,287
That's too much.

218
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:25,852
You yelled at me.

219
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:30,505
Since I was a kid,
you've never talked loudly to me.

220
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:32,130
You yelled at me for her.

221
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,358
I...

222
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,582
And you stared at me.

223
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,235
I hate you.

224
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:42,461
I hate you.

225
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:05,091
Fine, brother.

226
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,176
You choose that wicked girl!

227
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,857
You don't want your sister anymore.

228
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,363
Go see her.

229
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:17,624
No.

230
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:18,846
So spoiled.

231
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,189
I see that...

232
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:22,215
Your family loves this little sister.

233
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:23,585
Yingying is still young.

234
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:25,012
Please don't take it to heart.

235
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:26,816
Of course, I won't.

236
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:28,692
But in my opinion...

237
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,432
In this situation.

238
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:32,687
She's being jealous.

239
00:16:34,684 --> 00:16:41,684
You are the worst brother in the world.

240
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:46,784
This.

241
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:48,783
It's for her.

242
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,666
She kept saying
that her brother used to treat her well.

243
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,665
Then think about it.

244
00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:54,718
When did that change?

245
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:57,259
Isn't that after I showed up?

246
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,176
Brother.

247
00:16:58,342 --> 00:17:00,083
Don't you hate this kind of person?

248
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:01,172
No.

249
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:04,135
You gave me her favorite rose sugar.

250
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:06,903
She lost her temper.
The whole family helped me.

251
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:09,300
But she's the little princess
of the family.

252
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:11,840
How could she be happy.
She must make troubles.

253
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:14,837
I'm a girl.
I can totally understand.

254
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:20,715
What?
Starting to reflect on yourself?

255
00:17:22,228 --> 00:17:24,341
You should.

256
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:27,659
How did you suddenly treat me well?

257
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:30,675
Don't you think it's weird?

258
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,044
No.

259
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:35,069
Go.

260
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:45,748
Jiawei.

261
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:47,369
Coming right up!

262
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:01,267
Zitong.

263
00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:09,657
Zitong.

264
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,709
The last spot of Heartbeats
is about to be decided.

265
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,590
This time, it would do a lot of help
if Jiawei can say something.

266
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:20,115
I told you.

267
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:22,327
He's busy enough.

268
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:23,868
I don't want to trouble him.

269
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,643
Alright.

270
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:31,088
I just think this is a good opportunity
and you two are close to each other.

271
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,881
Let's have some coffee.

272
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:38,622
Zitong, I have to go.

273
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,759
Take this first.

274
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:49,010
Jiawei.

275
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:53,178
We're off duty early today.

276
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:54,376
Let's have dinner together.

277
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,687
In the old place, what do you think?

278
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:59,797
No, thanks. I have to go home
for my secret second career.

279
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:01,852
I knew.

280
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:04,620
No one can stop your love for music.

281
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:06,503
I'll leave now.

282
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:07,987
Jiawei.

283
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:12,991
Nothing.

284
00:19:13,454 --> 00:19:15,192
Have fun on your production.

285
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:16,109
See you.

286
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,124
Bye.

287
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:18,421
Bye.

288
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:33,713
Hi, Didi.

289
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,402
Oh, god... it's like one mind.

290
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:38,067
I was about to call you.

291
00:19:38,152 --> 00:19:39,017
What about it?

292
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:41,029
Are you disliked by the Zhou family?

293
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:41,946
How is that possible?

294
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:45,707
I'm so lovely and beautiful...

295
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,264
I can get their recognition in no time.

296
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:53,488
Even their cat loved me like hell,

297
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,689
and refused to move out of my room.

298
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:56,643
Fine.

299
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,877
Since the ancestor worship is over
you should stop thinking about that,

300
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:01,946
and move your whole attention to work.

301
00:20:02,816 --> 00:20:04,201
Why are you in a hurry?

302
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:06,651
I took a late ride and got up early.

303
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:08,636
Let me have some rest.

304
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:12,795
I want to but how about your work?

305
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,980
The contract of Heartbeats
is about to be decided.

306
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:17,473
They are in a hurry now.

307
00:20:17,557 --> 00:20:20,984
So you have to pack up today
and arrive at night.

308
00:20:21,664 --> 00:20:22,668
Tonight?

309
00:20:22,752 --> 00:20:24,248
Why are they in a hurry?

310
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:27,402
My dear Didi.

311
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,833
Let's discuss something.

312
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:33,250
OK?

313
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:35,725
No.

314
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:40,536
It's not that I don't want to go.

315
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,394
Didn't I get eczema some time ago?

316
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:46,250
I'm afraid I will affect their shooting.

317
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:50,683
So can you discuss with them...

318
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:54,599
to leave the opportunity
to the new artists who need this.

319
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:55,932
Su Jinbei.

320
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:01,426
What is that sound?

321
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:03,030
Don't interrupt this.

322
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:05,125
How is that an eczema?

323
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:06,999
Don't you just have two pimples?

324
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,072
I gave you the tea tree essential oil
and it will restore after you used it.

325
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:12,033
Who are you fooling?

326
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:16,466
I have a bad memory, you know this.

327
00:21:16,738 --> 00:21:19,947
Why are you in a hurry?
I was being thoughtful.

328
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,667
They invited Xu Jiawei.

329
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:23,717
You know.

330
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:25,685
The public still has misunderstanding
between us.

331
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:27,725
I'm afraid this gossip will keep going,

332
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:30,931
and it will be hard for you to deal with.

333
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:33,654
And I thank you for that
I don't need it.

334
00:21:33,845 --> 00:21:35,694
You think I don't know you?

335
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:37,296
Are you doing this for me?

336
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,801
You're afraid Zhou Shiyun will be jealous.

337
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:42,701
You.

338
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:44,496
Hold on.

339
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:45,638
I heard...

340
00:21:46,165 --> 00:21:49,010
I say there's a voice
and a man's voice.

341
00:21:49,102 --> 00:21:50,269
Who's that? Who?

342
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:51,186
I...

343
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:52,828
It's from the TV.

344
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,521
Let me tell you.
Business is business.

345
00:21:55,684 --> 00:21:56,851
How about you and Dr. Zhou?

346
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:59,706
I don't care but coming here
for work is your duty.

347
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,623
End of story.

348
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:02,753
What?

349
00:22:02,837 --> 00:22:04,251
It's done.

350
00:22:16,217 --> 00:22:17,305
Alright.

351
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:19,236
Don't worry about work.

352
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:23,343
Let's have a good meal tonight.

353
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:27,939
You place the order and I will pay.

354
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:31,693
I don't care about this meal.

355
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,042
I care about Miss Wu Di.

356
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:39,075
I, Xiao Yuansong wants
to have dinner with you.

357
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:43,605
Can you consider this.

358
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,084
I will.

359
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:59,416
Do you think it's not appropriate
for me to go on a show with Xu Jiawei,

360
00:23:00,358 --> 00:23:01,800
and it's a love show.

361
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,785
How should Zhou Shiyun
explain to his family?

362
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:08,542
Can you help me?

363
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:09,578
Can you...

364
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:12,270
Xu Jiawei is on it.

365
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,881
Will he be jealous and get mad?

366
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,413
But.

367
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:22,183
I can't let him uninformed about this.

368
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,350
Fine.

369
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:26,984
I can't count on you.

370
00:23:27,582 --> 00:23:29,296
Let's go. Go with me.

371
00:23:35,796 --> 00:23:36,666
Wait.

372
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:38,488
Why am I so honest?

373
00:23:39,658 --> 00:23:41,262
Who are you?

374
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:44,254
I'm the beautiful lady Su Jinbei.

375
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,898
When I need something...

376
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:53,147
How can anyone not listen to me.

377
00:23:56,438 --> 00:24:00,214
Wait. I'll go dress up.

378
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:03,771
This one.

379
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,349
-You can go now.
-OK.

380
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:11,369
Hey.

381
00:24:12,947 --> 00:24:14,334
Dr. Xiao.

382
00:24:15,095 --> 00:24:15,939
I...

383
00:24:16,374 --> 00:24:17,217
I'm fine.

384
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,930
I recovered well.

385
00:24:20,372 --> 00:24:21,432
What?

386
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:26,056
Dr. Xiao didn't call
to ask about my condition, right?

387
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,035
Well.

388
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:29,918
I have a very important female friend.

389
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:32,501
I want to take her
to your restaurant tonight.

390
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:35,112
Can you prepare it?

391
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:38,863
Important female friend?

392
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:41,439
OK.

393
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:42,864
What do you want?

394
00:25:04,485 --> 00:25:07,096
The hidden coquettish
and to bewitch unintentionally.

395
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:10,060
I don't believe
you will get mad at me.

396
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,929
My hair blower is broken.

397
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:16,966
I can't fix it.

398
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,908
What should I do?

399
00:25:23,904 --> 00:25:25,699
I will have someone to buy you a new one.

400
00:25:26,188 --> 00:25:28,935
It is too troublesome.
Do you have one? Can I borrow it?

401
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,008
Under that washbasin.

402
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:36,496
Thank you.

403
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:41,925
Brother.

404
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,948
What's up?

405
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:44,944
Nothing.

406
00:25:45,117 --> 00:25:46,205
I'll come back later.

407
00:25:51,128 --> 00:25:53,358
Your brother and you are alike.

408
00:25:53,603 --> 00:25:54,436
What?

409
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,300
Cold, proud and less talking.

410
00:25:57,384 --> 00:25:59,151
Like to turn around and go away.

411
00:26:00,756 --> 00:26:01,735
He misunderstood.

412
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:02,959
What?

413
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:07,011
That I came to your room to blow my hair?

414
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:09,377
More than that.

415
00:26:14,762 --> 00:26:15,595
Come here.

416
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:22,350
The Internet-famous restaurant.

417
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:24,795
The really interest part
of that show is yet to come.

418
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:26,620
Hi, table for two.
Do you have reservation?

419
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:28,603
Yes.

420
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,455
Your boss reserved it for me.

421
00:26:30,563 --> 00:26:32,764
Mr. Xiao.

422
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:34,942
-Which table?
-Mr. Xiao, right?

423
00:26:35,105 --> 00:26:36,547
Yes, this way, please.

424
00:26:49,112 --> 00:26:50,254
Good!

425
00:26:50,716 --> 00:26:53,763
Mr. Xiao.
My boss has prepared the food.

426
00:26:53,871 --> 00:26:55,313
Do I bring them now?

427
00:26:55,612 --> 00:26:57,134
-Yes.
-OK.

428
00:26:57,218 --> 00:27:00,426
Never know that
Dr. Xiao is welcoming here.

429
00:27:00,997 --> 00:27:01,976
That's sure.

430
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:10,788
Hi, I'm the boss of the restaurant
and a friend of Dr. Xiao.

431
00:27:11,223 --> 00:27:12,392
You can call me Julie.

432
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,167
It is such an honor for me.

433
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:19,192
Boss Julie
will bring the food for us personally.

434
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:20,443
My pleasure.

435
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:24,060
Dr. Xiao come here
I have to treat you myself.

436
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:28,899
Thank you.

437
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:29,907
You're welcome.

438
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:42,200
I'll take a call.

439
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,027
Dr. Xiao, what do you think?

440
00:27:49,326 --> 00:27:50,604
Are you satisfied?

441
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,970
Julie treats us herself.

442
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:54,085
Very satisfied.

443
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:35,126
You want to look at me but dare not.

444
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,084
You've been looking at the cat.

445
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:39,015
Keep pretending.

446
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:41,163
This is the atmosphere.

447
00:28:53,076 --> 00:28:54,781
Dr. Zhou.

448
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:58,124
I...

449
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:01,833
There's something I want to tell you.

450
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:11,434
Wu Di called me today
saying that a show needs me.

451
00:29:12,277 --> 00:29:15,839
I haven't said yes
and she took it.

452
00:29:16,737 --> 00:29:17,716
I...

453
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:22,748
I might have to leave tonight.

454
00:29:22,965 --> 00:29:23,798
OK.

455
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,647
It's a love variety show.

456
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:29,764
You know that right?

457
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:31,149
We have scripts.

458
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:33,681
We should
only play according to the script.

459
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:40,344
By the way.
It seemed that they invited Xu Jiawei.

460
00:29:41,051 --> 00:29:41,921
You...

461
00:29:43,254 --> 00:29:44,668
Will you mind?

462
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:48,248
No, it's fine.

463
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:50,597
Let me drive you there.

464
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:52,610
You just agree like this?

465
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:55,357
If I knew I wouldn't have
taken so much trouble.

466
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:01,530
What's wrong?

467
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,704
It's fine.

468
00:30:03,788 --> 00:30:05,229
Then I'll go pack up.

469
00:30:07,215 --> 00:30:08,055
By the way.

470
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,363
This cat is really close to people.

471
00:30:09,526 --> 00:30:10,641
What's his name?

472
00:30:11,974 --> 00:30:12,817
Wutong.

473
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:14,802
Wutong.

474
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:19,696
So cute!

475
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,895
So cute!

476
00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:22,979
I'm leaving.

477
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:26,660
Cute?

478
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,752
You had a bad temper.

479
00:30:36,261 --> 00:30:38,137
Are you relaxed here?

480
00:30:38,355 --> 00:30:39,361
I bet it is.

481
00:30:39,824 --> 00:30:41,508
Speaking of relaxing.

482
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:45,715
Your place is better than
the aromatherapy in our hospital.

483
00:30:46,623 --> 00:30:47,956
That's not the same!

484
00:30:48,636 --> 00:30:49,587
What?

485
00:30:50,485 --> 00:30:51,573
You're not the same.

486
00:30:52,715 --> 00:30:54,211
I feel a bit shy from your words.

487
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:00,592
Have a try.

488
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:01,952
How is it?

489
00:31:05,715 --> 00:31:07,075
What are you doing?

490
00:31:15,988 --> 00:31:16,836
Come here.

491
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,899
Come here.

492
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:19,151
Look.

493
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:21,161
All the food is here.

494
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:23,366
Our romance dinner begins.

495
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:29,349
All the food is here?

496
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:30,655
Yes.

497
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,877
Then you can enjoy the romance
with that Julie or Jolie.

498
00:31:42,513 --> 00:31:43,383
Go away!

499
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:46,229
Wu Di.

500
00:31:47,136 --> 00:31:48,088
Wu Di.

501
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,582
We haven't had the food.

502
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,584
-What are you doing?
-Enough, Xiao Yuansong.

503
00:31:55,758 --> 00:31:56,601
That ends.

504
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:57,931
No.

505
00:31:58,015 --> 00:31:58,848
What?

506
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:00,843
What does it mean?

507
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:04,243
Didn't we promise
to have a romance dinner together?

508
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:08,105
These are all prepared for you.

509
00:32:10,988 --> 00:32:12,593
Such a beautiful dinner.

510
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:14,496
What are you mad at?

511
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:16,128
Like hell it's beautiful.

512
00:32:41,095 --> 00:32:42,373
She just left...

513
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:45,501
and my brother has to carry her luggage.

514
00:32:46,317 --> 00:32:47,758
What the hell?

515
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:11,039
Hi, Shui.

516
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,405
The company decided
to let you on the Heartbeats.

517
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:14,602
Really?

518
00:33:14,982 --> 00:33:16,424
Thank you.

519
00:33:16,886 --> 00:33:17,974
Don't worry.

520
00:33:18,273 --> 00:33:20,568
I will focus on the show
and care about nothing else.

521
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,788
OK. Do your best.

522
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:24,829
-OK.
-OK, goodbye.

523
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:33,474
You're all in the same company.

524
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:34,591
You helped her.

525
00:33:35,244 --> 00:33:39,324
Why did you ask me to be the good guy
and you have to owe me one.

526
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,043
Well, Shui,

527
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:44,271
I've known Zitong for a long time

528
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,096
I know her.

529
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:49,659
She is a careful and strong girl.

530
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:53,058
So I think
I should give her more opportunity.

531
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:54,364
However,

532
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,464
I don't want any misunderstanding.

533
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:00,535
Listers in the company can't have
romance relationships with each other.

534
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:02,550
You got the point.

535
00:34:37,552 --> 00:34:38,531
It's late.

536
00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:40,299
Go to bed earlier.

537
00:34:41,442 --> 00:34:42,636
Thank you, Dr. Zhou.

538
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,944
You too.

539
00:34:44,406 --> 00:34:45,249
Good night.

540
00:34:45,494 --> 00:34:46,391
Good night.

541
00:35:21,775 --> 00:35:23,758
This has been here for a long time.

542
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:25,745
I kept it for your mother.

543
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:28,112
It's time to give it to you.

544
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,479
This is a precious gift passed on by
the daughter-in-laws of Zhou family.

545
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:34,065
It passed on to your mother.

546
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:37,005
She should give it to Miss Su.

547
00:35:37,114 --> 00:35:39,670
Now you just find an opportunity
to give it to Miss Su.

548
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:48,265
I saw her holding Wutong.

549
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,724
I remember that Wutong
accepted no one except your mother.

550
00:35:56,424 --> 00:35:58,355
Since she's so close to Miss Su,
it's a kind of fate.

551
00:35:58,953 --> 00:36:00,286
If mother is here.

552
00:36:00,476 --> 00:36:02,516
She should be pleased.

553
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:05,018
Marry and settle down.

554
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:07,411
You should marry first
and then settle down the career.

555
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:10,104
You've had accomplishments on your career.

556
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,953
It's time to start a family.

557
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:43,964
Why are you still here? You miss me?

558
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:47,255
Or...

559
00:36:48,044 --> 00:36:52,069
You want to tell me something?

560
00:36:58,895 --> 00:36:59,738
It's cold.

561
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:02,213
Remember to close the window.

562
00:37:05,232 --> 00:37:06,646
I see.

563
00:37:08,115 --> 00:37:09,339
Good night.

564
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:10,780
Good night.

565
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:23,308
Good night.
