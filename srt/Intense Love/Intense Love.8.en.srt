=Episode 8=

3
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,791
Coming.

4
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,925
Coming, coming.

5
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:45,700
You're home alone?

6
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,225
Can't you walk?

7
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:54,025
Yeah.
But here comes Dr. Zhou.

8
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:57,773
Anyway, I will open the door for you.

9
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:00,511
Let me help you.

10
00:02:02,036 --> 00:02:02,986
No, thanks.

11
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:20,569
Wait a moment.

12
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,444
Sit down.

13
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,261
Any pain here?

14
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:48,444
Yes.

15
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:51,344
Here?

16
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:53,705
Yes.

17
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:56,436
And how about here?

18
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:58,886
It hurts most.

19
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:04,711
Then, then what should I do?

20
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:06,486
Amputate.

21
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:13,711
In the photo, it is the right foot.

22
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,444
Right.

23
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,652
Yeah, right, right.

24
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:23,486
Yo.

25
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:26,961
It is the right foot.

26
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:11,006
Remember to apply
the medicine before sleeping.

27
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:13,677
That's all?

28
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:16,136
Doctors will give patients
a period of observation, right?

29
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:19,836
What if the wound
become seriously deteriorate.

30
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:21,586
Call 120.

31
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:26,636
Shiyun.

32
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,678
I'll go to the hospital
and make the rounds of the wards.

33
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:35,761
Well, thank you.

34
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:38,686
A doctor's duty is to retrieve the dying
and rescue the wounded.

35
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,311
I'll get out of your way.

36
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:42,169
Go to bed earlier.

37
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:44,611
Good night.

38
00:04:47,436 --> 00:04:48,686
Since your legs are not so good.

39
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:51,011
Don't move.

40
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:27,011
Dr. Zhou, what a coincidence!

41
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:29,436
Is that a part of your show?

42
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:33,177
Jinbei got hurt during the show.

43
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:36,136
So I came to see her.

44
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:40,311
Visiting hours are over.

45
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:41,786
My patient needs rest.

46
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:43,094
What?

47
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:46,486
Dr. Zhou is the attending
physician of Jinbei again.

48
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:52,786
It's not that simple.

49
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:07,236
These are not conducive
to patient's recovery.

50
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:08,861
You'd better go back.

51
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:24,561
Dr. Zhou.

52
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:29,486
It seems that you have
a special relationship with Jinbei.

53
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:36,611
It's difficult to develop
a relationship with stars.

54
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:41,236
What they have to undergo and bear
is more than what you could imagine.

55
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:43,636
Above all.

56
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:45,836
Nothing will happen in the end.

57
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:53,411
I won't give it up.

58
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:31,436
Where have you been?

59
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:34,111
I've been waiting all night for you.

60
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:35,794
Come in.

61
00:07:48,486 --> 00:07:51,427
I don't want to go back
to that sad place.

62
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:53,936
Once I realize there's a door
that will never open for me.

63
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:58,136
I can't help but be sorrowful.

64
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:02,436
I used half a year of luck to see you,

65
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:06,161
though a long and arduous journey.

66
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:10,886
Dr. Zhou.

67
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:12,761
What do you think I should do?

68
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:16,136
I've tried my best to chase the girl.

69
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:18,361
But she was headstrong.

70
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:20,452
It's too hard.

71
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:22,761
It is too difficult.

72
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:31,386
Can you give me some advice?

73
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:37,536
Alright, alright.

74
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:41,236
People like you can only look at the data.

75
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:47,136
You even have a fiancee.

76
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,411
Isn't this destiny playing with me?

77
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:52,386
Could you tell me about your story?

78
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:54,261
To be inherent or innate.

79
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:55,994
A bully.

80
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,386
Such a bully.

81
00:08:58,186 --> 00:08:59,786
It doesn't mean there always has been.

82
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:04,286
The unrequited love
made me exhausted.

83
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:07,761
Is it easy if you get a response?

84
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:10,836
What are you talking about?

85
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:15,961
You don't pay concentrated
attention, so you don't get a response.

86
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:18,986
Pay concentrated attention?

87
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:21,611
Yeah.

88
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,661
I should talk to her from the heart
and cater to her pleasure.

89
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:28,936
Thanks, bro.
I will see myself out.

90
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,810
Where is she?

91
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:49,061
Hurry up!

92
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:51,802
Well, got it?

93
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:53,952
Before the security guard kicked my ass
I finally did it.

94
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,111
Well, let me have a look.

95
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:02,469
No, no.

96
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:03,911
Really?

97
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:07,586
Jiawei is so self-contained.

98
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:09,452
I used to think Su Jinbei
was up to something.

99
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:11,011
And Jiawei will ignore her.

100
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:12,886
But now.

101
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:19,111
My illusion about Jiawei
is going to be dashed.

102
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,527
Don't say that, glowworm.

103
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:24,102
I do believe
there must be a reason for this.

104
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:25,827
-Right?
-But look at this picture.

105
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:29,027
As fans we have to trust Jiawei.

106
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:30,127
You said you are a glowworm.

107
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:33,411
If we don't believe him
then no one would trust him, right?

108
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:35,477
That's right.

109
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:36,761
I am the firefly.

110
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:42,261
Even there's a glimmer of light
I will light his way.

111
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:46,452
-He can't be blinded by bad guys.
-That's right.

112
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:48,202
-Jiawei is always right.
-That's right.

113
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:50,702
If he made a mistake,
then it must be Su Jinbei's fault.

114
00:10:50,786 --> 00:10:53,677
That's right.
It must be Su Jinbei's fault.

115
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:57,386
Su Jinbei, you just wait and see.

116
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:57,177
Hello, Didi.

117
00:11:57,261 --> 00:11:58,836
How are you, Miss Su?

118
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:02,136
Is your wound quietly healed
in your dream?

119
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:04,327
You know I got hurt.

120
00:12:04,411 --> 00:12:06,361
Buy why are you harassing me
so early in the morning?

121
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:07,961
Early?

122
00:12:08,236 --> 00:12:09,977
I'm going to take a yoga class.

123
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:12,252
Have a healthy life, Miss Su.

124
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:14,661
Well, well, I'm pretty good.

125
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:18,152
I will send you the short video
I took just now.

126
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:23,754
While you're searching for treasure
you can also see my beautiful face.

127
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,361
You are very self-indulgence.

128
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:30,011
What's this?

129
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:35,386
Intermountain Medical Assistance Program.

130
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:39,211
Maybe Dr. Zhou left it here yesterday.

131
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:41,194
What?

132
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,886
Dr. Zhou visited you yesterday?

133
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:46,764
Talk to you later.

134
00:12:47,086 --> 00:12:49,402
What if he really needs this file?

135
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,553
I must send it to him at once.

136
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:56,580
Su Jinbei, you'd better be careful.

137
00:12:56,936 --> 00:12:57,852
Don't worry.

138
00:12:57,936 --> 00:13:01,086
I'll wear both sunglass and mask.

139
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,761
You never do me all a favor.

140
00:13:35,811 --> 00:13:38,486
Su Jinbei wants to marry into Zhou family?

141
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:41,011
Wait till I give the picture
to my second brother.

142
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:42,561
I will teach you a lesson.

143
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:53,136
Hello.
How to fill this registration form here?

144
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:55,802
Hello. Excuse me, how can I get
to Cardiothoracic surgery?

145
00:13:55,886 --> 00:13:56,877
Go straight ahead.

146
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,286
Thank you.

147
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:08,786
It's you.

148
00:14:09,536 --> 00:14:10,886
How could you be here, Zhou Suying?

149
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:12,361
Why are you here?

150
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:14,636
I have something for your brother.

151
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:16,736
How come this is with you?

152
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:18,111
He left it at my house yesterday.

153
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:19,577
Your house?

154
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:21,086
Why he went to your house?

155
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:23,886
Isn't that normal?

156
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:24,936
You.

157
00:14:26,836 --> 00:14:28,736
Well, give it to me.
I'll send it for you.

158
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:31,286
No, thanks.
You don't have to do such a little thing.

159
00:14:31,711 --> 00:14:34,086
Give it to me.
Leave my brother alone.

160
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:37,294
Give it to me.

161
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:39,802
Give it to me. Let go of it.

162
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:41,111
What are you doing?

163
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:42,094
Give it to me.

164
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:48,961
You don't stay with Su Jinbei today?

165
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:50,252
What are you going to do?

166
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:52,336
Have a class! I'm a regular customer.

167
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:54,911
Don't you believe that?
Look at my outfit.

168
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:56,761
It looks professional.

169
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:58,286
Hi, Miss Wu.

170
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:03,994
Please show me your card.

171
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:07,923
I forgot.

172
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:09,336
Maybe next time.

173
00:15:09,936 --> 00:15:10,802
Sorry.

174
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:13,336
You need a credit card to get in.

175
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:16,786
OK, I'll get another one.

176
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:18,702
OK, this is our charge standard.

177
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:19,827
Please have a look.

178
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:21,986
No, I'll choose the most expensive one.

179
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:23,519
Alright.

180
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:44,202
Sorry, sir.

181
00:15:44,286 --> 00:15:45,277
What's wrong?

182
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,702
I've got the card, but why?

183
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:49,104
This is the ladies' locker room.
The men's locker room is over there.

184
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:52,486
Thank you.

185
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:54,986
Stop that now, give it to me.

186
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:56,402
No.

187
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:57,711
I won't allow you to see my brother.

188
00:15:58,111 --> 00:15:59,561
It's none of your business.

189
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:00,836
Give it to me.

190
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:02,811
Su Jinbei, give it to me.

191
00:16:03,911 --> 00:16:05,361
Su Jinbei.

192
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:09,786
I am a fan of yours!

193
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:13,177
-It's her!
-Su Jinbei, why are you here?

194
00:16:13,261 --> 00:16:15,281
-It's her.
-You are so pretty.

195
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:17,027
Hello, everyone.

196
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:17,944
Hi, Beibei.

197
00:16:18,132 --> 00:16:20,105
-Can I get a picture with you?
-Can I have your autograph?

198
00:16:20,386 --> 00:16:21,627
Sorry, it's not very convenient now.

199
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:23,127
Can we get your autograph, Jinbei?

200
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:24,052
Star!

201
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:27,152
-Excuse me, please let me pass.
-Don't disturb the order of the hospital.

202
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,170
Be careful, there's a child.

203
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:29,536
Watch out!

204
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:31,744
This girl.

205
00:16:32,936 --> 00:16:33,986
What's the matter?

206
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:37,752
It's OK, Paopao.

207
00:16:37,836 --> 00:16:38,786
Mommy's here.

208
00:16:38,936 --> 00:16:40,480
Stop taking photos!

209
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:42,427
Sorry.

210
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:44,286
-I'm so sorry.
-It's OK, Paopao.

211
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:48,801
Beibei.

212
00:16:48,886 --> 00:16:50,611
-Could you give me your autograph?
-I am really a fan of yours!

213
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:52,152
-My daughter is crazy about you.
-What are you doing here?

214
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:54,361
Go away.
Don't disturb the order of the hospital.

215
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:55,552
-Go away!
-Go away!

216
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:57,552
-Go away!
-Go away!

217
00:16:57,636 --> 00:16:58,902
Come on. Go there.

218
00:16:58,986 --> 00:16:59,819
Go away!

219
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:03,052
-That's right.
-Send me the photos later.

220
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:05,986
-Send me a copy of the ones you just took.
-So many!

221
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:13,336
Well, last posture.

222
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:14,736
Just follow me.

223
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:16,286
Sorry.

224
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:19,586
Aerial yoga.

225
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:23,136
OK, put down.

226
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,152
Well, that's the warm-up part.

227
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:27,069
Sorry.

228
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:29,011
She and I...

229
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:32,769
Fine.

230
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:34,169
Thank you.

231
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:36,927
Alright.
Now for today's lesson.

232
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:38,236
Come and learn from me.

233
00:17:38,461 --> 00:17:39,536
Hang Low.

234
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:42,320
Hu Kou adown.

235
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:44,777
OK, straighten our hind legs.

236
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:45,961
Fold the side.

237
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:49,136
And keep.

238
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,261
Didi, it's not so easy.

239
00:17:52,386 --> 00:17:53,386
Then you can stop.

240
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:56,286
OK, lay down.

241
00:17:58,236 --> 00:17:59,386
Well, you.

242
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:02,227
Aerial yoga could be dangerous.

243
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:05,511
So you'd better choose
the junior level lesson.

244
00:18:06,761 --> 00:18:07,861
I'm fine.

245
00:18:08,236 --> 00:18:09,636
Do I look like I'm in trouble?

246
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:24,336
Get angry?

247
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,411
I am angry too!

248
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:28,011
Such a bad service.

249
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:30,611
And I don't think
the coach is very professional.

250
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:32,052
I'll find another one.

251
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:33,886
Find a good one to practice.

252
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:35,136
Where are we going now?

253
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:36,761
Stop using "we".

254
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:39,261
Xiao Yuansong, I tell you
I have my own life.

255
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:40,761
Go do your bit.

256
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:41,902
But.

257
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:43,261
Leave me alone.

258
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:49,836
I've got my own life too.

259
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,169
Jiawei.

260
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,765
Why have you come back so late?

261
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:02,827
I just finished the rehearsal with
Xiaotao for the rest of the show.

262
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:05,036
We'll go to the rehearsal hall
the day after tomorrow.

263
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:06,686
May I join you?

264
00:19:08,936 --> 00:19:12,561
And Xiaotao
and Wang of the programming division.

265
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:19,536
Fine.

266
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:23,569
Jiawei.

267
00:19:26,086 --> 00:19:29,086
Zitong, howdo you celebrate
your birthday the day after tomorrow?

268
00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:42,819
Who is there?

269
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:52,886
My brother.

270
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:55,486
Yingying?

271
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:07,211
Stop.

272
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:13,636
What is it?

273
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:16,361
I didn't mean to.

274
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,561
But I saw that you...

275
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:20,911
What?

276
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:26,411
Su Jinbei seduced Jiawei.

277
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:29,577
I've told you before,
but you don't believe.

278
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:31,336
Now there're inarguable proofs.

279
00:21:33,511 --> 00:21:34,961
Why you snapped pictures?

280
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:41,011
It's too late. I'm going to bed.

281
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:47,536
Wow! Is he really mad?

282
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:59,011
It's difficult to develop
a relationship with stars.

283
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:03,486
What they have to undergo and bear
is more than what you could imagine.

284
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:05,761
Above all.

285
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:08,711
Nothing will happen in the end.

286
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,536
What you... you let me
say about you Su Jinbei.

287
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:29,476
Sorry, it's my fault.

288
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:31,286
I didn't think about this.

289
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:32,311
Look.

290
00:22:32,836 --> 00:22:34,902
I'm already covered up.

291
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,286
It shouldn't have gone wrong.

292
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:38,786
But I'm out of luck.

293
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:41,486
I met Zhou Suying
as I entered the hospital.

294
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,536
Then you met Zhou Shiyun.

295
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:45,352
You were shot in the same photo.

296
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:46,269
No.

297
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:49,842
As I entered the hospital,
I was possessed with her sister.

298
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:55,337
Don't you tell Dr. Zhou.

299
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,036
Come on.

300
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:02,861
Don't bother him about such trifles.

301
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:05,377
Alright. It looks everything goes well.

302
00:23:05,461 --> 00:23:07,161
I'll take care of it if something's wrong.

303
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,567
That's very kind of you, dear Didi.

304
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:12,319
Love you.

305
00:23:13,236 --> 00:23:14,286
OK, stop.

306
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:16,211
Let me talk about the job tomorrow.

307
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,736
Fine.

308
00:23:18,961 --> 00:23:22,536
There's a cover shoot for two tomorrow.

309
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:24,261
With who?

310
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,504
Xu Jiawei.

311
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:26,489
Xu...

312
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:28,136
Jia...

313
00:23:28,436 --> 00:23:29,269
Wei.

314
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:32,986
-I'm.
-What?

315
00:23:34,936 --> 00:23:36,611
I agree.

316
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:41,736
I'll talk to you later.

317
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:43,411
Don't forget about tomorrow.

318
00:23:43,986 --> 00:23:45,253
Don't worry, you can count on me. Bye.

319
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:56,236
It is him.

320
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:12,011
Zhou Shiyun.

321
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:16,061
You come to my house
very often these days.

322
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:19,161
Did I leave my file with you?

323
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:21,411
What file?

324
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,361
I am not sure.

325
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:27,286
I'm sorry I may have misremembered.

326
00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:34,161
Then do you know what this is?

327
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:46,119
Stop.

328
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,111
What is this stuff?

329
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:30,327
This is our hospital's...

330
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:31,986
Intermountain Medical Assistance Program.

331
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:37,211
What is the Intermountain
Medical Assistance Program?

332
00:25:38,836 --> 00:25:41,511
That is, in those remote
mountainous areas,

333
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:45,377
medical conditions and facilities
may be relatively backward.

334
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,102
Our hospital will provide
medical assistance...

335
00:25:47,186 --> 00:25:49,136
as the circumstances may require.

336
00:25:49,336 --> 00:25:52,486
The villagers can go
to the doctor for free.

337
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:55,086
Sounds good.

338
00:25:55,536 --> 00:25:56,369
Will you go there?

339
00:25:57,761 --> 00:25:59,161
I've done this for five years.

340
00:26:00,336 --> 00:26:02,111
You're so good-hearted.

341
00:26:10,598 --> 00:26:11,873
It's getting late.

342
00:26:12,511 --> 00:26:13,561
I will go back.

343
00:26:26,111 --> 00:26:26,944
Good night.

344
00:26:28,261 --> 00:26:29,161
Good night.

345
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:48,336
Morning, bro.

346
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:50,336
Morning, Suying.

347
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,211
Why are you here?

348
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:55,044
He'll pick you up.

349
00:26:56,711 --> 00:27:00,761
I just come here lately
I want to stay longer.

350
00:27:01,361 --> 00:27:02,636
Leave after breakfast.

351
00:27:14,586 --> 00:27:15,419
Help yourself.

352
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:27,311
Where's Zhou Shiyun?

353
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:30,044
Zhou asked for a leave in the morning.
He'll be here later.

354
00:27:30,186 --> 00:27:31,019
Fine.

355
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:47,386
Go and have the look at Paopao.

356
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:48,502
She is blubbering.

357
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:51,577
She refused to eat and take a cure
no matter who coaxes her.

358
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:52,711
What's the matter?

359
00:27:53,261 --> 00:27:54,986
It is all your superstar's fault.

360
00:27:57,686 --> 00:28:01,311
She went to the hospital yesterday
and someone took short videos.

361
00:28:01,936 --> 00:28:03,936
It's normal that a superstar appeared.

362
00:28:04,311 --> 00:28:06,477
But the point is, Paopao was there too.

363
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:07,711
Her hat was scratched off.

364
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,886
How a bald girl of twelve or thirteen
can bear such a thing?

365
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:13,548
You go to the inpatient ward.

366
00:28:14,014 --> 00:28:14,952
I'll get changed.

367
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:15,869
Fine.

368
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:36,311
Dr. Xiao, you see.

369
00:28:36,836 --> 00:28:38,436
What should we do?

370
00:28:48,836 --> 00:28:49,711
Paopao.

371
00:28:50,658 --> 00:28:51,961
Look who's here to see you.

372
00:28:52,461 --> 00:28:54,352
Dr. Zhou, bro Zhou.

373
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:56,586
You like talking to him best.

374
00:28:57,261 --> 00:28:58,094
Paopao.

375
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:00,419
Hey. Have a look.

376
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:03,536
Do you like it?

377
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,036
Leave me alone. I don't want to talk.

378
00:29:09,236 --> 00:29:10,069
Come on.

379
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:12,519
Fine.

380
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,336
Be closer.

381
00:29:19,511 --> 00:29:20,361
Fine.

382
00:29:27,911 --> 00:29:28,861
Fine.

383
00:29:33,111 --> 00:29:35,253
Well, excellent!
Let's prepare the next group.

384
00:29:35,836 --> 00:29:37,261
Thank you for your efforts.

385
00:29:37,536 --> 00:29:38,369
Thank you.

386
00:29:38,536 --> 00:29:39,711
You must be tired.

387
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:45,936
The day's work begins.

388
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:47,986
Dr. Zhou's busy?

389
00:29:55,736 --> 00:29:56,569
Coffee.

390
00:30:06,711 --> 00:30:08,561
Have a cup of coffee, Jinbei.

391
00:30:09,811 --> 00:30:10,786
Thank you.

392
00:30:25,161 --> 00:30:26,684
Dr. Zhou, the director
wants to talk to you.

393
00:30:26,769 --> 00:30:27,836
Yeah, I got it.

394
00:30:46,986 --> 00:30:47,819
Aunt.

395
00:30:48,836 --> 00:30:50,336
Have a seat.

396
00:30:53,911 --> 00:30:54,811
Director.

397
00:30:59,911 --> 00:31:01,561
Do you know what a hospital is?

398
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:02,994
Yes.

399
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,686
But how could it happened
to Paopao?

400
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:09,436
The environment of recuperation
is very important to the patient.

401
00:31:09,836 --> 00:31:12,161
No one can destroy it casually.

402
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:13,836
It's an accident.

403
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:16,036
It's you!

404
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:20,811
I must be so blind
to place great hopes on you.

405
00:31:21,386 --> 00:31:24,786
You think just an "accident"
can explain your mistake.

406
00:31:25,486 --> 00:31:29,561
With your qualifications in our hospital,
you are able to be a good example.

407
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:34,161
You and Su Jinbei have an affair.

408
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:36,786
No.
Are you my favorite pupil now?

409
00:31:40,436 --> 00:31:41,661
We don't have an affair.

410
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,711
You'd better not.

411
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:48,686
She is my fiancee.

412
00:31:55,111 --> 00:31:57,761
You should figure out how to fix Paopao.

413
00:31:59,436 --> 00:32:00,269
Director, goodbye.

414
00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:01,894
Go out.

415
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:16,211
What?

416
00:32:16,736 --> 00:32:19,511
It's been a day
that he didn't know to reply a message.

417
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:20,961
Never send message to me.

418
00:32:22,586 --> 00:32:24,111
Thank you a lot.

419
00:32:25,336 --> 00:32:26,361
It was good today.

420
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:27,665
The style is also very fashionable.

421
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,295
I'm leaving if there
is nothing to trouble you.

422
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:34,202
Why don't you come with me
after I change my clothes?

423
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,686
I made an appointment for a massage
at the spa. It's too late. Bye.

424
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:37,944
Bye.

425
00:32:40,336 --> 00:32:42,036
I knew you had no loyalty.

426
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:43,761
Let me go home alone.

427
00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:56,645
Jinbei, if you don't have
anything to do,

428
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,405
shall we have dinner together?

429
00:32:58,636 --> 00:32:59,469
My treat.

430
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,211
No, thanks.

431
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:05,461
How can I let you to pay.

432
00:33:05,636 --> 00:33:07,102
You took the job for me.

433
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:08,711
So you pick the place.

434
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:09,911
My treat.

435
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:13,075
No problem
I know a nice place.

436
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,531
The environment is good
and there are few people.

437
00:33:14,636 --> 00:33:16,477
-The food was also delicious.
-What are we waiting for?

438
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:17,827
Go get dressed.

439
00:33:17,911 --> 00:33:18,744
Fine.

440
00:33:27,161 --> 00:33:29,786
Jinbei, try this.
That's the specialty.

441
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:36,553
Delicious. I didn't realize you
were pretty good at picking a place.

442
00:33:36,736 --> 00:33:37,661
That's great.

443
00:33:38,711 --> 00:33:40,502
No wonder you have so many fans.

444
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:43,786
You are a handsome
and gentlemanly sunshine boy.

445
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:45,994
I remember.

446
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:47,736
You have many followers on Weibo.

447
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:49,886
There should be a lot of top movie
waiting for you.

448
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,761
Actually, I miss
the days before the debut.

449
00:33:53,586 --> 00:33:56,911
At least then
I can immerse myself in music every day.

450
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,336
Do what I love.

451
00:34:00,061 --> 00:34:04,061
Jiawei, don't you like acting
and the announcement?

452
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:08,911
Compared to being a star.

453
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:11,436
I prefer to be a simple singer.

454
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:14,061
You are not lost by fame and fortune.

455
00:34:14,311 --> 00:34:15,936
What a pure man.

456
00:34:16,711 --> 00:34:18,011
You really think so?

457
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:20,486
Of course, I never cheat.

458
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:26,711
You're not much older than I am.

459
00:34:27,286 --> 00:34:31,086
Please don't call me brother.

460
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,336
How about call me Jiawei
and I'll call you Jinbei?

461
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:35,408
What do you think?

462
00:34:35,711 --> 00:34:36,636
That's not good.

463
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:38,144
Why?

464
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:40,502
Do you forgot we were having rumors?

465
00:34:40,586 --> 00:34:42,086
Even though it's all media bullshit.

466
00:34:42,311 --> 00:34:43,211
But if I'm not careful.

467
00:34:43,386 --> 00:34:45,286
There's nothing I can do
to remove the stigma off my name.

468
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:48,736
You're right.

469
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:52,086
Then I'll call you sister Jinbei.

470
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:59,336
Jiawei, if all you want to do
is to play music to break your identity.

471
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:00,811
You just...

472
00:35:02,011 --> 00:35:03,577
might declare yourself in love.

473
00:35:03,661 --> 00:35:05,886
Then no one cares
about our rumors.

474
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:10,386
The company will kill me.

475
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,511
Just like you I also have a crush.

476
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,636
I've been waiting for him.

477
00:35:22,311 --> 00:35:23,961
Jiawei, let me ask you something.

478
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:26,886
Do you have someone you secretly like?

479
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,486
Secretly like a person?

480
00:35:36,286 --> 00:35:40,436
I think like is a kind of feeling.

481
00:35:41,736 --> 00:35:46,036
Liking a person and liking a song
is the same feeling.

482
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:52,661
Perhaps surprisingly
but inadvertently.

483
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:54,369
What I hear.

484
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,069
What I see.

485
00:35:57,186 --> 00:35:58,311
I'll never forget it.

486
00:35:59,786 --> 00:36:05,361
So you love music more than anything.

487
00:36:07,811 --> 00:36:09,611
I'm working on a song recently.

488
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:11,611
Maybe you should listen first.

489
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:12,686
Give me some advice.

490
00:36:13,086 --> 00:36:13,919
Ok.

491
00:36:15,236 --> 00:36:16,069
Waiter.

492
00:36:22,236 --> 00:36:23,636
She's been like this all day.

493
00:36:24,536 --> 00:36:26,586
Nothing to eat or drink.

494
00:36:27,111 --> 00:36:28,986
No injection, no medicine.

495
00:36:29,386 --> 00:36:32,311
If I can't persuade her again,
I'm afraid that...

496
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:36,075
Don't worry. Take a rest.

497
00:36:37,936 --> 00:36:40,486
Paopao, you should eat something.

498
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:42,286
How about some porridge?

499
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:43,311
Don't cry.

500
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:46,111
Thank you, Dr. Zhou.

501
00:36:51,736 --> 00:36:53,386
The person in the picture...

502
00:36:55,036 --> 00:36:57,436
This is a star that Paopao likes.

503
00:36:57,911 --> 00:37:00,586
Her name is Su...

504
00:37:01,111 --> 00:37:02,086
Su...

505
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:03,269
Su Jinbei!

506
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:05,661
Right, it's her.

507
00:37:06,936 --> 00:37:08,761
Paopao likes to watch her TV series.

508
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:11,261
She said the sister was so beautiful.

509
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:12,519
Yes.

510
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:15,886
Especially the little princess she played.

511
00:37:16,961 --> 00:37:18,486
Paopao really likes her.

512
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:26,236
The name of the song
is still up in the air.

513
00:37:26,436 --> 00:37:28,577
But the melody has almost been written.

514
00:37:28,661 --> 00:37:30,061
Try listening, Sister Jinbei.

515
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:05,719
Hey?

516
00:38:07,082 --> 00:38:08,486
Can you come to the hospital?

517
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:10,186
Now?

518
00:38:10,486 --> 00:38:11,386
Yes, something urgent.

519
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:13,711
Okay, I'll be right there.

520
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:15,344
OK, OK.

521
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,511
I'm sorry, Jiawei.
I have something urgent. I got to go.

522
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:21,486
All right, bye.

523
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:24,161
I'll pay this.
I'll talk to you another day.

524
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,186
That's what happened.

525
00:38:40,711 --> 00:38:42,411
The comments were not very friendly.

526
00:38:42,736 --> 00:38:46,011
Paopao loves to be beautiful.
It's a little overwhelming emotionally.

527
00:38:48,086 --> 00:38:49,136
One moment.

528
00:38:49,611 --> 00:38:50,486
Where are you going?

529
00:38:51,111 --> 00:38:52,761
I'm good at handling this.

530
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:05,069
Here you are.

531
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:06,144
Let's go.

532
00:39:08,336 --> 00:39:09,644
-Quickly.
-Fine.
