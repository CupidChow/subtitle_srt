=Episode 4=

3
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:37,720
Hey.

4
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:39,829
Su Jinbei.

5
00:01:40,377 --> 00:01:41,210
Hey.

6
00:01:41,913 --> 00:01:42,746
Hey.

7
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:44,547
Su Jinbei, can you hear me?

8
00:01:48,746 --> 00:01:49,579
Su Jinbei.

9
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:52,223
If you can talk to me!

10
00:01:54,803 --> 00:01:55,636
Hey.

11
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:57,438
Hey.

12
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,653
Su Jinbei, I will be on line all the time.

13
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,963
So if you can hear this
you can talk with me at any time.

14
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:10,040
Here we are.

15
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:16,011
Hurry up, please.

16
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:20,888
Okay.

17
00:02:20,972 --> 00:02:21,805
Thank you.

18
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,394
-Su Jinbei.
-Follow me and check in.

19
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:24,744
Well.

20
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:32,536
Su Jinbei.

21
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:38,049
Su Jinbei.

22
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:42,595
Why are you so severe?

23
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,239
Don't touch my phone.

24
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:59,408
I'm still on the phone with him.

25
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:34,892
What is this?

26
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,612
It is the tailsman that I've got for you.

27
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:41,694
Come on, put it on.

28
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,739
The other one is for Dad?

29
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:56,214
They are in pairs.

30
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,489
One for you.

31
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:01,489
Another for my daughter-in-law-to-be.

32
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,945
You want to steal a kiss from me again?

33
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:10,333
You are having a fever.

34
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:12,436
Talk nicely.

35
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:15,014
I am suffering from
a really severe headache.

36
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:18,087
Hardly had I fainted,

37
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,929
then you came.

38
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:34,869
Come here.

39
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:50,545
Can you feed me?

40
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,436
No.

41
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,764
You are so mean.

42
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,615
Water.

43
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:03,026
Lid.

44
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:09,174
The phone is turned off.

45
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:10,595
Sleep tight...

46
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:12,628
and you will feel better tomorrow.

47
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:22,407
All right, there you go again.

48
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:24,914
You're leaving without any words.

49
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:27,598
Otherwise?

50
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:33,268
I'm super hungry.

51
00:05:33,593 --> 00:05:36,466
I only had one prop meal today.

52
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,144
And I just threw it up.

53
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:40,500
My stomach is upset now.

54
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:43,880
You are Doctor Zhou of noble character,

55
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:47,498
so could you please
make a loving dinner for me.

56
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:57,683
You come and go, just like a gust of wind.

57
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:04,142
Oh, you are here too, Jiawei.

58
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:10,836
I heard that our company has achieved a
strategic cooperation with XinDongShiFen.

59
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:13,335
They plan to recommend two entertainers
to participate their variety shows.

60
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:14,252
Is that true?

61
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:16,061
Yeah, I guess.

62
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,571
That role-play reality show
is going viral. Do you know that?

63
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:22,098
It ranks third among all variety shows.

64
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:23,240
Really?

65
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:24,339
Yeah.

66
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:26,245
But here are only two places.

67
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:28,092
There are so many
entertainers in our company.

68
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:29,543
You are definitely in.

69
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:30,584
How about another?

70
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:33,111
Who do you think is the lucky one?

71
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:36,563
It is a matter requiring the seniors'
consideration. I have no idea.

72
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:41,157
But.

73
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:44,256
There is something I want to ask you.

74
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:48,617
What's going on with you and Su Jinbei?

75
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:55,136
You aren't the one who
is playing tricks, are you?

76
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:57,604
In your eyes,

77
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:00,804
I am super unbearable. Am I right?

78
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,798
You think that...

79
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:07,961
I as an actress is trying to frame others,

80
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,571
at the expense of being almost disfigured.

81
00:07:15,097 --> 00:07:16,563
But you are not to be blame.

82
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:18,241
You said that...

83
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:22,156
cause you like her.

84
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,222
I get on to avoid my fans.

85
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,598
Upon the car accident happening.

86
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:30,543
Su Jinbei saved me.

87
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:32,295
And she was injured and in hospital.

88
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:35,847
I really appreciate her for this.

89
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:39,475
But I see her as my friend.

90
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,536
You are also my friend...

91
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:47,178
before and after.

92
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:48,095
Got it?

93
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:50,587
So.

94
00:07:51,563 --> 00:07:54,861
You just have me as a friend.

95
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,488
I'm busy now.

96
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,465
I got to go.

97
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:21,695
The milk has expired.

98
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:28,238
The bread is mouldy.

99
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:32,128
I've got a lot of food...

100
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:35,734
but none is eatable.

101
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:38,587
Well, I am such a poor guy.

102
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:41,467
It's my doomsday.

103
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,658
The power is back on.

104
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:59,264
Zhou Shiyun?

105
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,089
Why did you come downstairs?

106
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:09,714
I'm full.

107
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:11,264
It's rather late.

108
00:09:11,714 --> 00:09:13,139
I got to go.

109
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,864
Good night!

110
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,734
Why don't you tidy your house up?

111
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:32,328
I... I rarely stay at home.

112
00:09:33,285 --> 00:09:35,636
Well I'll call housekeeping tomorrow.

113
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:41,452
If you keep the rubbish for another day,

114
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:44,081
your cold will be worse.

115
00:09:58,809 --> 00:09:59,953
At such a moment.

116
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,619
I am just looking at him quietly,

117
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:06,004
tidying my clothes up,

118
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:08,228
cleaning the floor...

119
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:10,975
making my bed.

120
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:16,323
He just get involved in my life naturally.

121
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:20,803
From him doing chores.

122
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:23,911
I feel the warmth.

123
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,688
Time passes by,

124
00:10:28,914 --> 00:10:30,820
but I hope it can go slower...

125
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,880
and slower...

126
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:35,159
and slower.

127
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,336
Haven't you been home these days?

128
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:07,726
Wu Di,

129
00:11:08,397 --> 00:11:10,006
you are always making mistakes in work.

130
00:11:10,534 --> 00:11:12,724
The car accident before was clarified.

131
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,597
Another negative news appears.

132
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:16,418
It's not the first time we've been...

133
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:18,951
snapped under our noses.

134
00:11:22,027 --> 00:11:23,663
I'm not the boss of reporters.

135
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:24,914
What are you mumbling?

136
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,896
Mr. Wang I'm saying
that it is an emergency,

137
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,963
which is also unexpected.

138
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:37,130
What really matters is to fix it.

139
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:41,454
All right, since you are her agent
you fix that.

140
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:45,651
One day for you.

141
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:48,008
You settle it down in only one day.

142
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:53,676
Deal.

143
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,006
The cleaning-up work is almost done.
Take care of yourself.

144
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,431
Don't go.

145
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:36,851
Shiyun, don't go please.

146
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:12,571
Thank you.

147
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:15,030
Could you please get me more people?

148
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:17,026
Thank you!

149
00:13:39,544 --> 00:13:42,023
I'll buy you a drink. Dare or not?

150
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:49,751
You want to eat humble pie
or you want to poison me?

151
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:53,254
Yeah, the poison is ready.

152
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,182
I'm waiting for you to come.

153
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:03,432
Nothing happened last night.

154
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:05,324
From now on, you go your way,
I'll go mine.

155
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:54,352
How is your leg?

156
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,807
I'm suffering from poor circulation.

157
00:15:58,052 --> 00:15:59,586
Just let me stand for a while
and I'll be okay.

158
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:11,236
I got to go.

159
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,748
Keep our ancestors worship in mind.

160
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,084
I'll go home to worship our ancestors
this Sunday.

161
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,874
Do you want to go with me?

162
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:31,048
Well.

163
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:39,283
It seems not to be appropriate to do so.

164
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:42,169
He just invited me
to their worship ancestors.

165
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:44,253
Does he take me as his family?

166
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,936
What's wrong with it?

167
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:48,097
Well,

168
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,788
if I go with you
what role I'm going to play?

169
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:57,288
That is, what do I mean to you?

170
00:16:58,743 --> 00:16:59,718
Fiancee.

171
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:02,249
He has already admitted
that I am his fiancee.

172
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:04,286
Should I say yes right now?

173
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,863
Well, I'll think about it.

174
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:13,363
You should give me a reply.

175
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:16,673
12:00 this Friday.

176
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:21,360
Take your medicine on time.

177
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:22,828
Well.

178
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,855
Think it over.

179
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:42,501
Goodbye.

180
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:06,319
What a coincidence.

181
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:09,870
I meet you bright and early.
I'm going to exercise.

182
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,006
You haven't started running
but you are already sweating.

183
00:18:13,444 --> 00:18:14,957
Are you suffering from kidney deficiency.

184
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:16,602
How come? I...

185
00:18:16,978 --> 00:18:18,153
I have a sound kidney.

186
00:18:18,553 --> 00:18:20,409
All right, wish you good health.

187
00:18:20,644 --> 00:18:21,678
Well.

188
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:26,802
I did warming-up at home
and that's way I sweat.

189
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,975
The elevator is broken.

190
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:45,607
Slow down.

191
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:46,839
Watch out!

192
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:52,250
Are you ok, Miss Su?

193
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:53,402
Feeling better?

194
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:56,873
Thanks for your concern.

195
00:18:57,696 --> 00:19:01,437
Your fairy lady Miss Su
is going to be healed up.

196
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:03,006
It's so magical!

197
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:05,165
Did you take some panacea?

198
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:06,549
I think so, yeah.

199
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,065
I tell you.

200
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:11,466
He came again.

201
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:13,680
Who is it?

202
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:14,924
Who else would it be?

203
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:19,294
It's Zhou Shiyun
the aloof and impenetrable Zhou Shiyun.

204
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,212
So he has thrown himself at your feet?

205
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:25,718
I think so, yeah.

206
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:27,816
In such case,

207
00:19:28,198 --> 00:19:31,174
you should honor your own words
and then dump him.

208
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:36,643
Now?

209
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:40,180
What's going on?
Are you unwilling to do so?

210
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:46,468
Of course not.

211
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,400
I am planning to dump him,

212
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:51,125
when he loves me deeply.

213
00:19:51,448 --> 00:19:55,542
And then I'll make his life a hell.

214
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:58,841
According to your current condition,

215
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:01,886
it is hard to say
who will live in hell.

216
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:03,092
It can't be me.

217
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:04,412
I am Su Jinbei.

218
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:10,033
Su Jinbei, everyone loves me.

219
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:12,050
Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.

220
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:15,569
Don't keep that filming site thing in mind
I'll fix it as soon as possible.

221
00:20:16,904 --> 00:20:18,068
What is the filming site thing?

222
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:21,949
I almost forget.
Why did you remind me of that?

223
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,362
Okay. Forget it!

224
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:25,988
Fend for yourself!

225
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:28,481
Bye.

226
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:31,355
What do you mean?

227
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,241
Is anything wrong with my running here?

228
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:34,915
It's okay for you to run.

229
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:36,903
But you are making noises,

230
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,132
and lots of owners here complain
about you.

231
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,659
Well you say that I got many complaints.

232
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,135
Deal, Jiawei.

233
00:20:43,518 --> 00:20:45,562
You join Heartbeats from next week on.

234
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,237
Set aside other jobs...

235
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:49,395
and go all out for the variety show.

236
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:53,625
Bro, it's recording time
will last so long,

237
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:55,655
while I'd like to be devoted to my music.

238
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,159
I still need time to make music.

239
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:58,536
To hell with your music.

240
00:20:58,706 --> 00:20:59,785
The music market is terrible.

241
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:01,900
Nowadays, variety shows reign. Got it?

242
00:21:02,212 --> 00:21:03,433
You are on your way up.

243
00:21:03,944 --> 00:21:07,947
If you join this show
you can win more popularity.

244
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:10,254
-Well I...
-That's it, Jiawei.

245
00:21:10,338 --> 00:21:11,633
Keep your place in mind.

246
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:13,515
You should think for our company.

247
00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:20,222
Dr. Zhou.

248
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:52,203
A clean hands wants no washing
and the rumor will disappear.

249
00:21:54,421 --> 00:21:56,208
I'll go home to worship our ancestors
this Sunday.

250
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:58,470
Do you want to go with me?

251
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:01,220
It seems to be inappropriate.

252
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,613
You should give me a reply.

253
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:05,918
12:00 this Friday.

254
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:08,400
Let me think about it.

255
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:31,581
You deserve it, Su Jinbei.

256
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,261
Well done.

257
00:22:41,363 --> 00:22:44,155
So excellent.

258
00:22:54,627 --> 00:22:56,871
One day has gone.

259
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:00,751
What is he doing?

260
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,877
The cold has gone.

261
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:15,057
Thanks for your medicine.

262
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:20,891
I'll go home to worship our ancestors
this Sunday.

263
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,553
Do you want to go with me?

264
00:23:22,638 --> 00:23:23,471
Well.

265
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:29,309
It seems to be inappropriate.

266
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:32,349
You should give me a reply,
12:00 this Friday.

267
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:34,034
Tell me weather you will go or not?

268
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:36,310
I... eh... yes, I do.

269
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:41,595
You're being so aloof and so impolite.

270
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:42,794
Undo.

271
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:52,977
Dr. Zhou.

272
00:23:59,936 --> 00:24:00,769
Zhou.

273
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,124
A news about your Su Jinbei.
The shoe is on the other foot.

274
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,521
You don't know that?

275
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,015
I tell you.

276
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:15,307
The director, cast and crew
were all interviewed.

277
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:16,754
And Su Jinbei didn't hit anyone.

278
00:24:17,371 --> 00:24:18,952
She was getting into her role.

279
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:20,557
I see.

280
00:24:24,828 --> 00:24:25,661
I see.

281
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,364
You don't care about your fiancee.

282
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:32,592
Jiawei.

283
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:37,351
Shui and others don't understand
your pursuits and talents in music,

284
00:24:37,906 --> 00:24:40,534
these years but I understand.

285
00:24:41,237 --> 00:24:42,540
I believe in your talents.

286
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:46,455
And I also believe that you
will be successful if you stick to it.

287
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:49,294
Gao Zitong.

288
00:24:51,084 --> 00:24:52,453
What's wrong, Shui?

289
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:54,324
Give me an explanation.

290
00:24:55,504 --> 00:24:56,848
What the hell is going on?

291
00:24:57,911 --> 00:25:00,630
Now, everybody says that
you took a beating on purpose...

292
00:25:01,086 --> 00:25:02,844
to have Su Jinbei framed.

293
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:40,328
Again?

294
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:41,526
That's all for today.

295
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:44,578
Okay.

296
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:48,841
Don't embarrass yourself
but what's going on with you today.

297
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,360
You kept missing.

298
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,921
You're not yourself today.

299
00:25:52,162 --> 00:25:52,995
It's quite normal.

300
00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:56,080
Are you preoccupied
with things about Miss Su.

301
00:25:57,202 --> 00:25:58,706
Oh, how is everything?

302
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:01,469
I invited her to worship our ancestors
yesterday.

303
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:04,558
So fast.

304
00:26:05,324 --> 00:26:06,959
You are going to return your native place?

305
00:26:07,044 --> 00:26:08,400
But she wanted to think about it.

306
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:10,624
Does it hurt?

307
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,366
Answer me!

308
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:14,762
Well.

309
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:17,095
I'll find out what she is thinking.

310
00:26:17,682 --> 00:26:18,562
How?

311
00:26:19,303 --> 00:26:20,507
Just ask her what she thinks.

312
00:26:20,856 --> 00:26:22,594
She must give me a reply.

313
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:24,517
It isn't necessary.

314
00:26:25,381 --> 00:26:26,420
How come?

315
00:26:26,934 --> 00:26:28,322
It is necessary.

316
00:26:28,478 --> 00:26:30,429
Indeed, am I right?

317
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:32,650
What if she decline your request?

318
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:35,433
You have to give you an out.

319
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,498
What a coincidence!

320
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:40,546
Wu Di the agent of Su lives upstairs.

321
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:42,822
I'll ask her.

322
00:26:42,906 --> 00:26:44,162
And I'll get the details.

323
00:26:56,618 --> 00:26:57,451
Who is it?

324
00:27:02,644 --> 00:27:04,595
Do you have boiled water
for instant noodles?

325
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:11,055
It's unlucky.

326
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:14,062
My kettle doesn't work
so does the water fountain,

327
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:17,898
and so does the gas stove
so I have to ask you for help.

328
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:20,022
What a coincidence!

329
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:20,939
Over there.

330
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,021
It's okay, let me do it.

331
00:27:22,105 --> 00:27:23,805
You just continue your work
and never mind about me.

332
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,460
By the way,
you are staying late these days.

333
00:27:28,616 --> 00:27:30,299
You are so busy.

334
00:27:31,337 --> 00:27:34,796
You are very observant
to tell that.

335
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:36,738
Yeah, when I was jogging
this early morning,

336
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:38,260
I happened to see you returning home.

337
00:27:40,611 --> 00:27:41,475
It's too hot!

338
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:42,748
I can't hold it.

339
00:27:44,004 --> 00:27:45,973
I will go back home
after my instant noodles is ok.

340
00:27:47,514 --> 00:27:50,056
Does your work have anything to do with...

341
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:51,377
Su Jinbei.

342
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,684
Nonsense.

343
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:55,616
I am her agent so my work is absolutely
bound up with her.

344
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:57,360
True.

345
00:28:01,606 --> 00:28:06,400
Well you must know something
about her and...

346
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,371
Professor Zhou.

347
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,936
What?

348
00:28:11,177 --> 00:28:13,983
Well, Zhou Shiyun invited her...

349
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:15,858
to go back to his native
place the day after tomorrow.

350
00:28:17,216 --> 00:28:18,049
Sorry.

351
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,515
It's my break now.

352
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,411
And Miss Su has her own personal affairs.

353
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:25,542
I don't want to meddle
in her personal affairs.

354
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:29,301
It makes sense. Neither do I.

355
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:31,807
Of course I don't care
about her personal affairs.

356
00:28:32,532 --> 00:28:35,749
But Zhou kept bothering me,
pleading me to ask for Su's information.

357
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:37,483
I was bothered to death.

358
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,093
To be frank, Wu Di.

359
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:48,399
Actually.

360
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:55,325
I just want to find
an excuse to go upstairs.

361
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:57,582
You are the one I really care about.

362
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:02,716
Eh...

363
00:29:03,777 --> 00:29:05,377
I really can't bear
the smell of instant noodles.

364
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:06,999
Go home and eat it up, okay?

365
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:10,127
OK.

366
00:29:30,831 --> 00:29:31,664
Hey.

367
00:29:32,344 --> 00:29:33,695
How is your cold?

368
00:29:35,362 --> 00:29:36,551
I have long gotten over it.

369
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:38,966
That's alright.

370
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,074
How is the Misty Rain?

371
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,469
You have two scenes tomorrow.

372
00:29:42,553 --> 00:29:44,700
So you should be on filming site.

373
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,316
I am sick.

374
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,361
Can I skip it, my dear agent?

375
00:29:52,198 --> 00:29:55,029
How come you feel ill
when it comes to work?

376
00:29:55,388 --> 00:29:57,453
Cut off this shit.
See you on the set tomorrow.

377
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,458
Okay, see you.

378
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:00,706
How cruel you are!

379
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,306
I must be killed one day.

380
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,604
It's me who will be killed some day.

381
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:07,474
Bye.

382
00:30:09,753 --> 00:30:12,781
She is hiding something from me.

383
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:14,422
Come on, put away that bunch of flower.

384
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,093
Okay.

385
00:30:17,722 --> 00:30:19,039
Here comes Miss Su.

386
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,283
-Miss Jinbei.
-Miss Jinbei.

387
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:22,732
Morning. Morning.

388
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:24,909
Thank you for your hard work these days.

389
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:27,621
Jinbei prepared some little gifts
for you all.

390
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:29,512
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

391
00:30:29,596 --> 00:30:30,603
Here you are.
Here you are.

392
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:31,443
-Thank you.
-Thanks for your hard work.

393
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:32,940
-Thanks for your hard work.
-Thank you.

394
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:34,540
-Thanks for your hard work.
-Thank you!

395
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,865
-You've been working so hard!
-Thank you.

396
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:37,371
-My pleasure.
-Thanks.

397
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:40,011
-Here you are.
-Give it to me.

398
00:30:40,095 --> 00:30:41,326
-Thanks for your hard work.
-Thanks.

399
00:30:41,728 --> 00:30:43,176
Miss Su is so kind.

400
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,093
Yeah.

401
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:45,422
She is really kind.

402
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,645
I've read the news that Gao Zitong
played tricks behind Miss Su's back.

403
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:49,562
Yes.

404
00:30:51,525 --> 00:30:52,358
Is the tract ready?

405
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:53,477
It's fine.

406
00:30:53,582 --> 00:30:54,415
I'm so sorry.

407
00:30:56,048 --> 00:30:57,411
Damn it!

408
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:03,446
Sorry, I rush to refine the make-up.

409
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:06,850
So you mean
that I should feel sorry for you.

410
00:31:07,303 --> 00:31:08,750
I just bumped into you.

411
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:10,790
It's no big deal?

412
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:12,377
Are you sure?

413
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:14,720
Miss Zhang, you don't know
who you were bumping into?

414
00:31:15,452 --> 00:31:17,541
You are going to be famous.

415
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:18,832
Oh, hell no.

416
00:31:19,293 --> 00:31:21,258
I can't afford to such a ill name.

417
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:24,202
I want to be famous in a normal way.

418
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:25,790
-Indeed.
-It's fine.

419
00:31:27,393 --> 00:31:28,569
She never know her place.

420
00:31:28,676 --> 00:31:30,642
-Indeed.
-May I have your attention.

421
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,610
I know that you are venting
your anger for me.

422
00:31:32,811 --> 00:31:33,835
I really appreciate it.

423
00:31:34,164 --> 00:31:36,824
But the whole thing
is just a misunderstanding.

424
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:38,347
And in this circle.

425
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,859
Maybe, everyone is apt to be misunderstood
cause paparazzo need hot topics.

426
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:44,745
We are all the victims
of the entertainment era.

427
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,043
But I think,

428
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:48,939
those negative voices
should be ignored.

429
00:31:49,852 --> 00:31:50,806
As an actress,

430
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:55,173
or as a film maker
we should respond those negative voices,

431
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:57,196
with our professional attitude
and excellent performance.

432
00:31:57,739 --> 00:31:58,572
Good point!

433
00:31:59,688 --> 00:32:00,521
Good point!

434
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:03,232
Well, hurry up!

435
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,203
Go about your business.

436
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:06,385
-Hurry up.
-Come on, hurry up.

437
00:32:06,469 --> 00:32:07,924
-Let's go! Go! Go!
-Be as quick as possible.

438
00:32:14,992 --> 00:32:16,848
Dr. Zhou, I'm counting on you.

439
00:32:17,451 --> 00:32:18,284
Don't worry.

440
00:32:39,022 --> 00:32:40,228
Zhou Shiyun.

441
00:32:40,782 --> 00:32:42,193
Why aren't you texting me?

442
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,470
Jinbei everything is ready.

443
00:32:49,262 --> 00:32:51,116
-Thank you.
-See you on site later.

444
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:52,956
See you. Bye.

445
00:32:56,964 --> 00:32:57,865
Hello Zitong.

446
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:03,466
Jinbei, can I come in?

447
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:04,624
Zitong.

448
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:07,404
Of course, get on.

449
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:08,686
-Come here.
-OK.

450
00:33:14,984 --> 00:33:15,901
Take a seat.

451
00:33:22,802 --> 00:33:23,635
Jinbei.

452
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:25,991
Thank you for helping me out.

453
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,118
Never mind that.

454
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:29,955
It was a misunderstanding
I should step out early.

455
00:33:31,287 --> 00:33:32,120
Jinbei.

456
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,825
I didn't do that thing.

457
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:37,306
It's all right. It's all over now.

458
00:33:37,762 --> 00:33:39,153
We should make a good acting later.

459
00:33:39,335 --> 00:33:41,065
Let them know that we are good actresses.

460
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:42,553
Stop thinking about the mess.

461
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:45,115
I will be professional.

462
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,093
Alright.

463
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:53,452
How is it going, Julie?

464
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:56,577
Are you in an elevated mood
after having a walk in the garden?

465
00:33:59,006 --> 00:34:00,004
Full of fresh air,

466
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:04,349
flowers and bird sings
it is much better than inpatient ward.

467
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,373
I bet it is.

468
00:34:05,497 --> 00:34:07,476
It is a doctor's medical ethics
and professional quality,

469
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,082
medical ethics
and professional quality to...

470
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:12,055
keep our patients in good mood.

471
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:17,272
Dr. Xiao you are not only experienced
but also kind-hearted.

472
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:20,958
I'm so lucky to have you
as my attending physician.

473
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:22,346
Indeed.

474
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,012
My biggest wish is to see
my patients recovering.

475
00:34:29,448 --> 00:34:30,646
Well, Julie.

476
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,461
You need more rest and walk.

477
00:34:33,545 --> 00:34:35,114
I have something
to talk with my colleague.

478
00:34:36,035 --> 00:34:37,325
-OK
-Bye.

479
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,242
Bye.

480
00:34:44,837 --> 00:34:45,851
You are shaking your head.

481
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:47,216
Why?

482
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:50,238
It is normal to chat
with a patient, isn't it?

483
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:54,112
You are a despicable man
slandering me all day long.

484
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:56,118
I have said nothing.

485
00:34:56,453 --> 00:34:57,541
Indeed.

486
00:34:57,837 --> 00:34:59,304
But I can tell what
you are thinking in mind.

487
00:35:00,828 --> 00:35:02,460
Oh, do you have any news?

488
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:05,045
What?

489
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,265
About your ancestor worship.

490
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:08,520
About the super star?

491
00:35:11,762 --> 00:35:12,595
Not yet.

492
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:16,573
Alright, wait with patience.

493
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:17,846
A reply will come soon.

494
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:19,695
I asked Wu Di to inquire
about some information.

495
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:34,170
Sorry.

496
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:45,603
Zhu family is swaying
in the midst of raging storm,

497
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:49,054
full of gloomy mist.

498
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:55,165
And you and I are both
the illusion and ghost.

499
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:02,042
Ok, Cut.

500
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:03,384
Well done.

501
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,648
Jinbei, you did an excellent job.

502
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,830
So did Zitong.

503
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,424
Everyone is doing well today.

504
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,646
But I have to especially express
thanks to...

505
00:36:10,803 --> 00:36:12,065
Jinbei.

506
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,774
Your words sparked our passion.

507
00:36:15,113 --> 00:36:17,700
That's why we are so productive.

508
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:19,060
Well, that's all for today.

509
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,231
Thanks, director.

510
00:36:21,366 --> 00:36:23,188
-Thank you.
-Thank you, director.

511
00:36:24,574 --> 00:36:26,080
-Thanks, Jinbei.
-My pleasure.

512
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,398
Come in.

513
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,432
Zhou, time to get off.

514
00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:40,454
Go home and leave me alone
I want to read more materials.

515
00:36:42,105 --> 00:36:43,012
Okay.

516
00:36:43,097 --> 00:36:44,569
You grabbed the patient from our director.

517
00:36:44,654 --> 00:36:46,321
The patient was diagnosed
with complicated disease.

518
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:52,987
Have Su Jinbei called you back yet?

519
00:36:54,051 --> 00:36:54,884
No.

520
00:36:56,476 --> 00:37:00,017
Do you need my help?

521
00:37:00,282 --> 00:37:01,115
Whatever.

522
00:37:18,638 --> 00:37:19,993
What are you doing?

523
00:37:20,078 --> 00:37:22,054
You should take care of yourself
no matter how busy you are.

524
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:24,330
It's good for your health to talk with me.

525
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,135
Miss Wu Di.

526
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:31,461
One of your little
Valentine is texting you.

527
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:33,071
Why don't you text him back?

528
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:35,997
Don't bother about me.

529
00:37:36,081 --> 00:37:39,918
You keep staring at your phone
day and night and mind-absented.

530
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,441
To be frank.

531
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,946
Whose message are you waiting for?

532
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:46,344
Dr. Zhou?

533
00:37:46,903 --> 00:37:48,941
He invited me to go
back to his native place.

534
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,133
So you said yes?

535
00:37:51,598 --> 00:37:53,688
To worship his ancestors.

536
00:37:54,716 --> 00:37:55,598
You are in trouble.

537
00:37:56,295 --> 00:38:01,274
If you go that means you admit
that you are his fiancee.

538
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:04,692
He said I should give him an answer
before tomorrow noon.

539
00:38:04,776 --> 00:38:07,377
Well, just decline his invitation
directly, slap him hard.

540
00:38:07,563 --> 00:38:08,529
What a great revenge.

541
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:14,621
You're screwed, Su Jinbei.

542
00:38:15,716 --> 00:38:17,792
You're totally screwed!

543
00:38:20,707 --> 00:38:21,571
What?

544
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:27,012
I was texting you
and I was cut by the blade then.

545
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,781
Holy shit.

546
00:38:33,807 --> 00:38:37,030
Miss Wu Di, replied to the message.

547
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:38,276
You.

548
00:38:44,731 --> 00:38:47,360
Eh... Wu Di texted me back.

549
00:38:47,768 --> 00:38:50,063
She said she'd find a chance
to ask Su for you again.

550
00:38:52,618 --> 00:38:54,243
Well if there's nothing else,
I'm going now.

551
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:55,766
Well.

552
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:56,683
Bye.

553
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:19,267
Hello, Bro.

554
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:20,803
Are you off work?

555
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:22,112
I just got home.

556
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:25,513
Tomorrow, you two will come back, right?
