=Episode 16=

3
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:44,162
Would you please check
the e-mail address for me?

4
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:47,698
Okay.

5
00:01:54,286 --> 00:01:56,311
Why? You find me an unpleasant woman?

6
00:01:57,395 --> 00:01:58,920
You're a superstar.

7
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:02,085
Also, you are beautiful and famous.

8
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:04,572
Yeah, I'm an actress.

9
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:05,896
But what's the big deal?

10
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:07,658
We are the same.

11
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:10,561
We walk along the mountain road in flats
and drink water with big earthenware bowl.

12
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:12,257
So I don't think we are different.

13
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,890
Even though there is a difference,

14
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,964
that's because
I'm in love with someone.

15
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,680
But everyone can have their own love.

16
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,189
You don't need to be afraid or uneasy.

17
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:31,045
Just wait for your
Mr. Right with patience.

18
00:02:31,592 --> 00:02:34,758
There must be someone
who suits you and only belongs to you.

19
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:36,187
Really?

20
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:40,603
But I'm just so ordinary.

21
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:45,000
Why? You are so cute.

22
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:47,409
Sis,

23
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:52,535
now I really know why
Dr. Zhou has a crush on you.

24
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,810
Thank you. I'm flattered.

25
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:02,474
You do live streaming?

26
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:05,238
Yeah, I registered a account...

27
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:07,929
to make charity live streaming for
impoverished children in the village.

28
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,330
But I have few followers.

29
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,374
So I haven't helped them at all!

30
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,403
Well, do you think I can help them?

31
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,160
Sis, you mean that...

32
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:22,688
Yeah! Alright!

33
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:26,710
Yeah, I understand
that you are forced to urge me.

34
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:28,666
Well, Miss Su is coming back.

35
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,073
And I'll keep her schedule available for
you immediately.

36
00:03:31,114 --> 00:03:31,964
Is that okay?

37
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:35,046
That's great!

38
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:36,294
I'll treat you later.

39
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:37,175
Thank you!

40
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:38,657
Okay.

41
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,480
Yes! Another deal done!

42
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,500
Enjoy your meal!

43
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:56,914
I'll make another phone call.

44
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:05,779
-Hey.
-Su Jinbei.

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,018
Yes, I can hear you.

46
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:12,234
Can you be gentler?

47
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:14,707
And let's talk in a happy manner, okay?

48
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:18,710
I just want to remind you
that your schedule is full.

49
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,170
You just left as you wish.

50
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:24,113
But I have to deal with various people
for you.

51
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:25,185
How is it going?

52
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:27,220
You are comfortable and
happy to be with your honey.

53
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:28,895
So you decide not to come back, don't you?

54
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,820
Alright!

55
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,435
I'm not that kind of
love-is-all person, okay?

56
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:34,185
I'm a fair lady with integrity.

57
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm telling you that
the children here need me.

58
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:38,695
Only another two days!

59
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,941
My dear, the beautiful and reliable Di.

60
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:42,132
Please, do me a favor.

61
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:45,420
I know you are the best.

62
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:48,569
I'd like to thank you on
behalf of those children here.

63
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,860
You are such a caring person.

64
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,280
Love you!

65
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:54,753
Hey.

66
00:04:57,044 --> 00:04:58,653
You are not showing love,

67
00:04:58,694 --> 00:04:59,994
but breaking my heart.

68
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,719
I was on the phone too long.
The dishes have gone cold.

69
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:15,283
Wait a moment and let me heat them.

70
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:37,975
Enjoy your meal!

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,860
Why don't you eat? Do you feel ill?

72
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:48,721
What's wrong?

73
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,250
Well,

74
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:53,196
a wish just crossed my mind.

75
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:55,219
It's a good thing,

76
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,585
but why don't you eat?

77
00:05:56,848 --> 00:05:57,798
Loss of appetite?

78
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:00,254
I'm afraid that
you're not willing to support me.

79
00:06:00,582 --> 00:06:01,585
Nonsense.

80
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:02,592
Just say it!

81
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,558
I won't break my promise.

82
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:15,794
Hello, everybody.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,712
I'm Tingting of Hope
Primary School in the village.

84
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,078
Nice to see you.

85
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:21,060
Today, we're going to speak with.

86
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,405
Su Jinbei, the well-known actress.

87
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,630
Sis Jinbei, say hello to everybody.

88
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,356
Hello, I'm Su Jinbei.

89
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:31,880
Glad to have you here.

90
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,319
Today, I'm going to share
Children's school life here with you...

91
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,285
in Tingting's live streaming chat room.

92
00:06:38,326 --> 00:06:39,166
Follow me.

93
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:40,662
We can see that...

94
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:44,560
many classrooms remain to be constructed
because of the flood before.

95
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:47,405
And the road is bumpy and rough,

96
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:50,440
so it's not an easy for children here
to go to school.

97
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:51,880
Come on, they are having meals.

98
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:54,120
I'm coming.

99
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,095
Hello.

100
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:57,081
Get some more
and then you can be beautiful.

101
00:06:57,121 --> 00:06:58,261
Have some more, okay?

102
00:06:58,302 --> 00:06:59,307
Okay.

103
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:01,734
Hi.

104
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:03,519
Have you been a good boy lately?

105
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,401
Does it taste good?

106
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:05,394
Delicious.

107
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:08,060
Sis, you're so beautiful.

108
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:13,671
Have a taste. It tastes good!

109
00:07:14,772 --> 00:07:15,612
Try it!

110
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,171
Wow, delicious!
I was telling the truth.

111
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,370
Yeah.

112
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:21,550
You are so cute.

113
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:23,662
Please have more.

114
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,680
Okay.

115
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:26,664
Get some more vegetables.

116
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,042
So do you.

117
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:28,931
Okay.

118
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:29,812
Okay.

119
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:31,978
The classrooms were flooded,

120
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,244
but children are still
thirsty for knowledge

121
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:35,363
I have stayed here for days...

122
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:36,825
and I find that
the condition here is difficult.

123
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:38,664
But even so,

124
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:41,985
children here always smile and
seek knowledge with eagerness.

125
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,794
I feel proud of them.

126
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:47,351
I will try to help them.

127
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:50,910
Also, I hope you can do something
and make active action.

128
00:07:56,972 --> 00:07:58,747
Sis Jinbei, look.

129
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:04,074
Thank you.
Thank you for your gifts.

130
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,166
I promise that
every gift you offer here...

131
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:10,557
will be converted into
cash for those children.

132
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,039
Thank you all.

133
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:13,938
Thank you!

134
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:25,008
I know that I'm wrong,
so please let me go.

135
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:27,600
Of course not!

136
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:32,210
You were excited to
make me changed before...

137
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:34,512
and now it's your turn.

138
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:35,928
How could you flinch?

139
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:38,798
Alright.

140
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,615
Nice.

141
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:48,193
Bright color.

142
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:49,074
You look beautiful.

143
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,900
Okay.
Come on, let's go shopping.

144
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,335
What's going on?

145
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:02,410
Can I put on those dresses at home?

146
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:04,235
It's a weekend day,

147
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,549
a lot of people are shopping outside,

148
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,869
so what if we bump into an acquaintance.

149
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,460
You know that?

150
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,780
I thought that people like you
engaged in film-and-television industry...

151
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:14,021
don't need any day off.

152
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:16,785
Do you remember your promise?

153
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:18,295
First.

154
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,120
Obedience.

155
00:09:20,548 --> 00:09:21,388
Second.

156
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:23,017
In compliance with transformation.

157
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,240
Third.

158
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:25,831
Unconditional conformance
to transformation.

159
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:30,449
So today,

160
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:32,144
forget about work.

161
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:33,085
Let's get hammered.

162
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,504
Okay.

163
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:37,535
Come on.

164
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:41,036
Come on!

165
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:49,209
Cheers.

166
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:53,210
It's swollen.

167
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,780
Hey, excuse me.

168
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:50,921
Please, the song A Man Called A Fool.

169
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:51,921
Okay.

170
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,956
Thank you.

171
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,177
You the fool man.

172
00:10:58,341 --> 00:10:59,181
I'm a fool?

173
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:04,299
What a fool!

174
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:25,185
I was annoyed by constant
phone calls these days,

175
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:29,347
but now I feel better.

176
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,480
It's a wonderful night.

177
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,766
You should smile more.

178
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,715
My dear Di.

179
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,880
I know today you did all things...

180
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,972
for me.

181
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,178
If you want to be a dolphin,
you should go to the sea.

182
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:32,319
What are you yelling?

183
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,133
If you have the sea in your heart,

184
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:35,699
everywhere you go is
spring flower blooming.

185
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:45,717
Don't worry.

186
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:50,701
I have already had the sea...

187
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:54,743
and my world...

188
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,210
is full of spring blossoms.

189
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,173
Be careful.

190
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:23,639
Bye, sis Jinbei.

191
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,585
Bye bye.

192
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:25,466
Thank you.

193
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:27,080
Take care on the way.

194
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,640
Be careful!

195
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:29,550
Take care!

196
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:30,541
Bye bye.

197
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,633
Most of them are here to see me off.

198
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:40,426
So it means that I am
more important in villagers' heart...

199
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,373
than you are, am I right?

200
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:43,520
Dear Dr. Zhou.

201
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,715
You are great!

202
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:48,413
Honey.

203
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,359
You gave some compliments!

204
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,025
It's the first time you flatter me!

205
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,564
Well, I did do a good job!

206
00:13:57,022 --> 00:14:01,785
I solved someone's relationship problem
and I'm hard-working and caring.

207
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:05,094
You see, there is no such fiancee as me!

208
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:09,146
Take it easy.

209
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,433
They were asleep, exhausted and drained.

210
00:14:14,372 --> 00:14:16,548
But after this experience,
I realize that...

211
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,689
it's really a hard thing to be doctors.

212
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,435
Also, I learned a lot.

213
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:26,685
I saw your persistence
and children's bravery.

214
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:28,115
I was touched.

215
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,820
Really touched.

216
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:02,588
Alprazolam tablet?

217
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,360
What is it?

218
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:11,810
Is Jiawei ill?

219
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,731
Brother, I want to ask you
about one medicine.

220
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:32,647
What is Alprazolam for?

221
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:36,223
A kind of prescription medicine
aka the sleeping pill in plain language.

222
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:37,723
It has anti-anxiety effects.

223
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:39,414
But it can't be overused
due to its side effect.

224
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:41,345
Why do you ask?

225
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,950
Wake up.

226
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,389
We're arriving!

227
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:25,563
You have to take me home later.

228
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,340
Don't blame me!

229
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:34,806
You ignored me before,

230
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:36,897
so I took all things home in a pet.

231
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:41,554
Do you feel regretful?

232
00:16:42,496 --> 00:16:43,921
I know that!

233
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,514
But I am ready to forgive you.

234
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,553
I think it's a good idea
for me to move back,

235
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,779
so our cohabiting relationship is over...

236
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,960
and then the danger of Su Jinbei is over.

237
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,703
My idol has been working hard.

238
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,744
Since he began his career,

239
00:17:21,785 --> 00:17:23,760
he shouldered everything...

240
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:28,055
and said nothing even under great pressure
or even with tremendous fatigue.

241
00:17:29,062 --> 00:17:31,362
He always try to show the best of himself.

242
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,985
Sir, let's have a break.

243
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:03,454
The enemy has no skills, come on.

244
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:05,473
Hurry up!

245
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:18,382
What's going on?
Do you feel uncomfortable?

246
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:20,173
I didn't have a good rest.
I can't sleep at night.

247
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:22,049
What's wrong?

248
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,395
I can't forget something.

249
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,725
I really miss the days
in after-school classes.

250
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:29,500
I could sleep tight when
the teacher began his class.

251
00:18:33,135 --> 00:18:33,989
That's right.

252
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,355
Teachers in after-school
classes can really lull us to sleep.

253
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:42,714
There is an after-school class nearby.

254
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,955
Everything's done?

255
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:00,026
Yep.

256
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,133
Clothes should be placed in order.

257
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,499
And you'd better sort them by colors.

258
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:11,585
I am too tired to put away the clothes
after a coach ride.

259
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:45,519
I've ever expounded the subject,

260
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,285
but some students still made
the same mistake in this examination.

261
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:50,844
There is not so many students sleeping.

262
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:51,725
Let's have a look.

263
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:53,548
Cheer up! Look.

264
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:55,800
Though you are in
the after-school classes.

265
00:19:56,185 --> 00:19:58,198
I still hope that you can buck up.

266
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,079
Listen to me carefully.

267
00:19:59,755 --> 00:20:00,595
Okay, let's move on.

268
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,619
Last time, we stopped at

269
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,860
the basic relationship
between logic and philosophy.

270
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,744
And we had a discussion
on the features of philosophy...

271
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:08,860
and its essence.

272
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:13,170
Hello, can I borrow your book?

273
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:18,586
Dear classmates.

274
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:22,341
Today we're going to learn
symbolic logic...

275
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:24,302
and it falls into several parts.

276
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,210
First,

277
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:30,475
the traditional logic is
expressed by natural language...

278
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:34,373
while the modern logic
uses symbols as its major carrier.

279
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:37,564
So we call the modern logic
symbolic logic.

280
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:41,231
It is not only a trans-major module,

281
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:43,672
but also an interdisciplinary module.

282
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:45,498
Why?

283
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:49,863
Logic is a tool.

284
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:54,480
We have to use our limited knowledge
and through deduction...

285
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,535
Do you know why I wear a veil?

286
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,910
Not interested.

287
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:04,074
I want to be the No.1 in the world.

288
00:21:05,907 --> 00:21:07,757
Over my dead body.

289
00:21:09,562 --> 00:21:10,402
Come on!

290
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:13,835
Seventeen Subduing Dragon Legs.

291
00:21:14,468 --> 00:21:15,768
Invincible Wind and Fire Palms.

292
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:18,720
Six Meridian Punch.

293
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:20,736
Thousand Birds Triggering Thunder.

294
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:25,974
I can bear that.

295
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:27,853
Take this, Law of Great Numbers.

296
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,805
What?

297
00:21:31,212 --> 00:21:32,052
Are you scared?

298
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:33,720
Then comes the Pythagorean
Theorem, trigonometric function,

299
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,293
Cosine 30 degrees,
the Square and Cubic of 3,

300
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,619
odd number, even number
positive number, infinitely great...

301
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,910
Help!

302
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:00,793
Tissue paper is used up.

303
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:02,980
Can you fetch some for me?

304
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:03,861
Over there.

305
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,235
Go get them by yourself.

306
00:22:11,888 --> 00:22:12,728
Okay.

307
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:38,310
It's too high. I'm afraid.

308
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:43,020
I'm going to faint.

309
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,880
Oh no, I'm dizzy.

310
00:22:49,189 --> 00:22:50,029
Come on.

311
00:22:57,036 --> 00:22:58,460
You are a good home economist.

312
00:22:58,501 --> 00:23:00,676
A kiss for you.

313
00:23:13,395 --> 00:23:14,470
Gao Zitong.

314
00:23:14,954 --> 00:23:16,129
Your friend is her fan?

315
00:23:16,557 --> 00:23:17,967
How are you both
getting on with each other?

316
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:18,970
Not bad.

317
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:20,036
She is nice.

318
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:22,532
If your friend want to have her autograph,

319
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:23,413
I can help!

320
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:38,304
Ms. Gao.

321
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:41,498
I know who you are...

322
00:23:42,628 --> 00:23:44,278
and you know why I'm here.

323
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:48,125
Really?

324
00:23:49,852 --> 00:23:52,227
I don't think so.

325
00:23:54,827 --> 00:23:57,402
You still haven't see through
Su Jinbei's true features?

326
00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:01,224
She is cheated in your relationship.

327
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,710
Besides, she flirts with others
taking advantage of her job.

328
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:06,584
You don't mind?

329
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:08,463
It's none of your business, right?

330
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,960
I know you are saying Xu Jiawei...

331
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:13,799
and I also know the reason
why you are against my fiancee.

332
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:17,860
But I want to advise you
to stop your tricks.

333
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,460
You juggle in the dark
and then you will push him away.

334
00:24:25,695 --> 00:24:28,895
You are just afraid of me digging deeply
and thus rooting out unexpected truth.

335
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:33,083
You are afraid that I will
uncover the true face of Su Jinbei?

336
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:36,127
Or you are just afraid
of confronting the truth?

337
00:24:36,566 --> 00:24:37,991
So you just deceive yourself.

338
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:40,780
My ability is far beyond
Ms. Gao's imagination,

339
00:24:43,914 --> 00:24:47,739
so I don't allow anyone to harm my lady.

340
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:51,510
So I warn you to stop your tricks,

341
00:24:53,186 --> 00:24:54,886
otherwise you will
eat your own bitter fruit.

342
00:25:03,655 --> 00:25:05,230
What a tone!

343
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,205
Have you gone loafing around outside?

344
00:25:22,497 --> 00:25:23,597
No, I haven't.

345
00:25:23,943 --> 00:25:27,993
Just now my friend gave me
a music with good hypnotic effect.

346
00:25:28,285 --> 00:25:30,610
I fell asleep when I was listening to it.

347
00:25:33,385 --> 00:25:34,442
Go on bragging!

348
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:35,758
You don't believe my words?

349
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,016
Okay, you can listen to it yourself.

350
00:25:38,057 --> 00:25:39,157
If you don't feel sleepy, I lose.

351
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:01,444
What are you doing?

352
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,850
Are you home yet?

353
00:26:12,435 --> 00:26:13,560
What are you doing?

354
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,031
You left just now,

355
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:22,635
but I don't know why
I have started to miss you already.

356
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:26,040
You are so childish.

357
00:26:26,678 --> 00:26:27,944
If you keep being so naive...

358
00:26:27,985 --> 00:26:30,590
I'm afraid that you'll be betrayed
by others knowing nothing.

359
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,855
I wouldn't be fooled!

360
00:26:36,055 --> 00:26:38,530
I have a smart and
reliable honey in my daily life.

361
00:26:38,838 --> 00:26:41,138
And in work, I have a competent agent.

362
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:43,192
I have nothing to worry about.

363
00:26:46,242 --> 00:26:48,142
I'm with you, good night.

364
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:53,699
Good night!

365
00:27:20,183 --> 00:27:21,033
My dear Didi,

366
00:27:21,696 --> 00:27:26,185
your fairy lady Su Jinbei is back.

367
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:29,989
Have a nice work day tomorrow.

368
00:27:38,885 --> 00:27:39,760
Have a rest.

369
00:27:55,603 --> 00:27:56,443
Jiawei.

370
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:57,883
Thank you.

371
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:09,890
I knew that you wouldn't listen to it.

372
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:11,521
You are afraid of losing.

373
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,345
I am not afraid of losing.

374
00:28:16,756 --> 00:28:20,306
Well, in three minutes,
if you don't fall asleep, I lose, okay?

375
00:28:36,402 --> 00:28:39,177
The traditional logic is
expressed by natural language,

376
00:28:39,816 --> 00:28:43,085
while the modern logic
uses symbols as its major carrier.

377
00:28:43,573 --> 00:28:46,273
So we call the modern logic
symbolic logic.

378
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:50,366
Logic.
It is not only a trans-major module,

379
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:53,119
but also an interdisciplinary module.
Why?

380
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,214
Logic is a tool.

381
00:28:56,255 --> 00:29:00,230
We have to use our limited knowledge
and through deduction...

382
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,535
Okay, sleep in peace.

383
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,359
Sleep tight.

384
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,860
Let go of all pressure and unhappiness.

385
00:29:42,661 --> 00:29:43,636
Jiawei, you wake up.

386
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,750
Where are the others.

387
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:49,906
They've gone.

388
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:10,808
Here it is, Jiawei.

389
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,320
Let me walk you home.

390
00:30:14,184 --> 00:30:15,934
Don't bother! Just a short walk.

391
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,844
Well, Jiawei, bye bye.
Thank you.

392
00:30:38,885 --> 00:30:39,773
That's okay.

393
00:30:39,814 --> 00:30:40,864
And take care.

394
00:30:41,304 --> 00:30:42,144
Bye.

395
00:30:42,185 --> 00:30:43,025
Bye.

396
00:30:57,036 --> 00:30:57,876
Bro.

397
00:30:58,622 --> 00:30:59,922
How about having dinner together today?

398
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:02,797
The usual place with Jinbei and Yingying.

399
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:04,777
Okay, I'll ask their opinions.

400
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,870
Okay.

401
00:31:06,522 --> 00:31:07,760
-Bye.
-Bye.

402
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:16,303
Sorry.

403
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,935
Sorry, the subscriber
you dial is busy now.

404
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,475
Please redial later.

405
00:31:32,488 --> 00:31:34,320
-Sis, you need some water?
-Thank you.

406
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:36,000
-Tissue?
-No, thanks.

407
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:36,881
Okay.

408
00:31:44,378 --> 00:31:45,218
Are you free this noon?

409
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:47,396
My older brother is here
and he wants to treat us.

410
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:52,639
I will never decline
my honey's invitation.

411
00:31:56,355 --> 00:31:58,015
Hello, sir.
Do you have a reservation?

412
00:31:58,056 --> 00:31:59,760
-Zhou.
-This way, Mr. Zhou.

413
00:32:09,576 --> 00:32:10,416
Bro.

414
00:32:11,214 --> 00:32:12,054
Welcome.

415
00:32:12,924 --> 00:32:13,764
Bro.

416
00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:21,961
Bro.

417
00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:23,385
Why do you come here?

418
00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:25,674
I have both business and
personal affairs to deal with.

419
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:31,185
Actually, I was sent by our grandma
to see you and Jinbei.

420
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,040
This pair of earring studs
go with you perfectly.

421
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:38,180
Thank you.

422
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,200
It is a gift from Shiyun.

423
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,410
He finally gave it to you.

424
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:45,489
Bro, you know the story.

425
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:49,248
What is it?

426
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:53,060
Bro.
Sorry to be late, bro and sis.

427
00:32:57,961 --> 00:32:59,760
Sis, your earring studs...

428
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,412
My earring studs...

429
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:05,014
How is it going?

430
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:06,131
Why everybody knows them?

431
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:10,335
Brother, you didn't tell sis
that it belongs to our mom?

432
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,120
Really?

433
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,764
Of course, I don't have to lie to you.

434
00:33:15,222 --> 00:33:18,510
No wonder that
brother saw them when he walked in.

435
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:21,835
Well, the jade earring studs
are Zhou family's heirloom.

436
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:23,566
And it can be only
passed to daughter-in-law.

437
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:26,647
I see, my second brother
must see you as his Miss Right.

438
00:33:31,081 --> 00:33:31,921
Honey.

439
00:33:32,658 --> 00:33:35,008
Why didn't you tell me
such important thing?

440
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:36,253
Enjoy your meal!

441
00:33:36,745 --> 00:33:37,585
Enjoy your meal!

442
00:34:28,553 --> 00:34:29,503
I want to taste that.

443
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:31,183
Here you are.

444
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:40,573
Hello, Jiawei.

445
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:42,939
Hello, have you eaten yet?

446
00:34:44,136 --> 00:34:45,013
Yes

447
00:34:45,054 --> 00:34:46,754
I'll be right back if
there is an emergency.

448
00:34:47,096 --> 00:34:48,746
Take it easy.

449
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:50,969
Okay.

450
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,591
Well, there is something
urgent in our company,

451
00:34:59,632 --> 00:35:00,674
so I got to go.

452
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:02,115
You haven't eaten much yet.

453
00:35:02,673 --> 00:35:04,198
I have to go back for emergency.

454
00:35:06,255 --> 00:35:07,095
Bye.

455
00:35:11,889 --> 00:35:12,729
Jinbei.

456
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:14,532
You didn't have much.

457
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:16,069
These dishes don't suit your taste,
do they?

458
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,085
Yes, they do.
They are delicious.

459
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:19,985
Okay, get some more if you like them.

460
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:21,612
Come on.

461
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:24,520
I can just eat half full
cause I am a public figure.

462
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,621
If I eat too much,

463
00:35:25,662 --> 00:35:27,063
I will put on weight and will be detested.

464
00:35:27,832 --> 00:35:30,735
It's not a wise idea to keep in shape
by dieting.

465
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:34,314
If you don't eat food,

466
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,354
the metabolic reduction
will lead to getting fat.

467
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,745
Really?

468
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,005
I'm a doctor.

469
00:35:46,515 --> 00:35:47,355
Jiawei.

470
00:35:48,616 --> 00:35:49,456
You're here.

471
00:35:50,194 --> 00:35:51,594
Come on, I'll take you to a place.

472
00:35:51,635 --> 00:35:52,485
What place is it?

473
00:35:52,947 --> 00:35:53,787
You'll know that.

474
00:36:08,868 --> 00:36:09,872
Go in and have a look.

475
00:36:09,913 --> 00:36:11,088
Is there anything you like?

476
00:36:12,411 --> 00:36:15,461
Jiawei, you're going to give me a present?

477
00:36:15,803 --> 00:36:17,303
You've been my assistant for a while.

478
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:20,016
Though you are a green
hand in this industry,

479
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,736
but you are thoughtful and hard-working.

480
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:24,358
I can see that,

481
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:25,874
so I'd like to thank you.

482
00:36:27,191 --> 00:36:28,616
It's my duty.

483
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:30,933
I'm serious.

484
00:36:30,974 --> 00:36:32,349
I really want to thank you.

485
00:36:40,394 --> 00:36:41,234
Okay, thanks.

486
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,420
Do you want to have a balloon, beauty?

487
00:36:45,816 --> 00:36:46,679
Jiawei.

488
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,895
Well, a balloon is nice...

489
00:36:48,936 --> 00:36:50,200
if you'd like to give me a present.

490
00:36:51,402 --> 00:36:52,452
You want to have a balloon?

491
00:36:53,788 --> 00:36:54,628
Okay, I'll take it all.

492
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:55,721
One is enough.

493
00:36:58,171 --> 00:36:59,146
Which one do you prefer?

494
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:04,311
Help me to choose one.

495
00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:07,269
I have no idea.

496
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,410
How about...

497
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:11,417
this one?

498
00:37:12,256 --> 00:37:13,156
This one?

499
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,900
Thank you.

500
00:37:18,385 --> 00:37:19,225
Do you like it?

501
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,370
I like it very much, thank you.

502
00:37:21,597 --> 00:37:22,624
What a fool.

503
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:24,065
You are so happy for a balloon.
