3
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,139
Bro.

4
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:42,346
Brother.

5
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:44,011
God.

6
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:47,264
You always repeat this
sentence when you're begging.

7
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,155
Save me.

8
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,555
Why don't you say it?

9
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:54,191
I did.

10
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:55,938
They don't believe me.

11
00:01:58,507 --> 00:01:59,600
I'll say it for you.

12
00:02:01,674 --> 00:02:02,549
Okay, I admit.

13
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:04,876
I'm a little selfish.

14
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,835
I hope that temporarily, temporarily...

15
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:10,019
this can be a secret.

16
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:12,010
Why is that?

17
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:13,779
Isn't this a good thing?

18
00:02:14,463 --> 00:02:16,240
Yes.

19
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,485
But there are two sides to every coin.

20
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,620
Think about that.

21
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:21,138
If I didn't have this disease.

22
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,240
I would never have
such a good birthday party.

23
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:28,414
Everyone is very nice to me
especially Wu Di.

24
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:33,160
You know
how Wu Di treated me before.

25
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:36,880
Since she knew about my disease,

26
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:39,035
her attitude changed completely.

27
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,685
I've never been treated like this before.

28
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:44,939
She was so, so gentle.

29
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,810
If she knew...

30
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,080
everything would be the same.

31
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:57,423
I have to admit that
I'm a bastard by doing this.

32
00:02:57,758 --> 00:02:58,598
But...

33
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:02,362
I want this feeling to last longer.

34
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:04,011
Even if just for one day.

35
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:06,739
How long can you hide that?

36
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,350
I...

37
00:03:10,553 --> 00:03:12,920
At least after this birthday party.

38
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,060
I swear to you
I will confess to her soon.

39
00:03:24,643 --> 00:03:25,778
What are you doing?

40
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:26,895
You've been there for a long time.

41
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:28,235
We are waiting for you to cut the cake.

42
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:29,960
-Hurry up!
-Okay, come on.

43
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,326
Hurry up.

44
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,685
Please.

45
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:37,269
Happy birthday to you.

46
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,200
Happy birthday to you.

47
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:44,081
Happy birthday to you.

48
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:47,880
Happy birthday to you.

49
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:50,840
Make a wish, make a wish!

50
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,000
Make a wish.

51
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:52,881
Make a wish!

52
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:55,223
Okay.

53
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:02,090
Cut the cake.

54
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:02,971
Okay.

55
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,464
So romantic.

56
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:14,480
I'm enough of this.

57
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:15,605
I'm already full.

58
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:19,383
So small!

59
00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:21,260
-Bigger.
-Why can you have it? Song.

60
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:23,069
Can you eat it? Song.

61
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,060
Why are you crying?

62
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:25,329
Do you all have it?

63
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,880
For 500 years
he pestered me for so long.

64
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:28,280
I know I shouldn't cry,

65
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:30,600
but I can't stop it.

66
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:33,221
-Eat the candles.
-Eat the candles.

67
00:04:33,262 --> 00:04:34,120
You eat it.

68
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:35,001
Follow me.

69
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:36,094
Come on

70
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:37,960
I want that.
That small piece.

71
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:38,960
Give it to me.

72
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:41,160
Song can't eat it.

73
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:43,314
What are you taking me out for?

74
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:45,920
What's funny?

75
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,200
You wasted your tears.

76
00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:51,514
Xiao Yuansong is your best buddy.

77
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,120
I'm reasonable to cry.

78
00:04:58,234 --> 00:05:00,240
What the hell are you laughing at?

79
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,163
What do you mean?

80
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:03,575
Say it!

81
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:06,280
Xiao's not sick at all.

82
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:08,760
What?

83
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:11,244
He made a mistake of his own urine sample.

84
00:05:11,285 --> 00:05:12,360
He's not the one that's sick.

85
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,526
We knew the result today.

86
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:16,439
It's good, then Wu Di.

87
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,760
He doesn't want to tell Wu Di.

88
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:19,457
Why?

89
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:21,600
He's afraid that Wu Di would be
strict to him again.

90
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,526
What kind of reason is that?

91
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,467
Forget it.

92
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,979
Wu Di is my bestie.

93
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,495
I have to tell her.

94
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,972
I think it's their business.

95
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:34,360
Let them deal with it.

96
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:37,304
Alright.

97
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:38,511
You're right.

98
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:42,122
We shouldn't meddle with this.

99
00:05:46,873 --> 00:05:48,323
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.

100
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:49,291
It's fine.

101
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:51,169
Sir, please leave a number

102
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,694
I'll come to find you after I deliver this
and send your clothes to the Laundry.

103
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:57,240
It's fine.
We'll take care of his clothes.

104
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:58,296
Thank you

105
00:05:58,651 --> 00:05:59,651
I am really sorry.

106
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:00,929
Fine.

107
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:04,386
-Are you okay?
-I'll find a restroom to clean it up.

108
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:06,225
Okay.

109
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:20,213
Beibei, is it Beibei?

110
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:21,584
I'm your fan.

111
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,825
Will you pose with me for a picture?

112
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:25,121
-Thank you, Beibei.
-Beibei.

113
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:26,795
-Could you give me your autograph?
-Thank you.

114
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:28,035
I really like you.

115
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:28,919
Beibei.

116
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,645
You're so beautiful.
I really like you.

117
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:31,743
Can I get a picture with you?

118
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:33,484
I'm sorry, I'm very busy today.

119
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:34,365
Sorry.

120
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:35,352
Beibei.

121
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:36,733
-Don't go, Beibei.
-Beibei.

122
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,900
Beibei.

123
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:39,360
Don't go, Beibei.

124
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:40,801
-Don't go, Beibei.
-Beibei.

125
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:41,787
Beibei.

126
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:43,302
Can I have your autograph?

127
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:45,194
Beibei.

128
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:46,565
I won't hurt you.

129
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:47,445
Beibei.

130
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:49,610
Don't go, Beibei.

131
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:52,140
Don't go, Beibei.

132
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:55,115
-Beibei.
-We are your fans.

133
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:57,470
Wait for us, we are coming.

134
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,600
Here, Beibei.

135
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,150
Beibei.

136
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:02,382
Beibei, just a photo.

137
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:25,885
Where is she?

138
00:07:25,926 --> 00:07:27,626
She runs so fast.

139
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:28,601
-Where is she?
-Over there.

140
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:29,520
-Really?
-Over there.

141
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,431
No, there.

142
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:31,312
Go! Go! Go!

143
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:32,475
Gone?

144
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:34,123
Let's go.

145
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,560
It scares the shit out of me.

146
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,340
How dangerous...

147
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:22,666
My heart's beating really fast.

148
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:29,324
Honey, your heartbeat is fast as well.

149
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:36,640
I'm lucky to have you.

150
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:00,937
Let me do it.

151
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:02,894
No, just take some rest.

152
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:04,185
I brought many cooked food.

153
00:09:04,372 --> 00:09:05,697
We can eat soon.

154
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,050
Watch TV.

155
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:14,969
What is this?

156
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,235
Medicine pack, for foot bath.

157
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,300
This is comfy, right?

158
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:31,929
Let me help you.

159
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:34,010
No, thanks, you go to rest.

160
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:35,412
Come inside.

161
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:43,470
-Let me help you.
-No, you go to rest.

162
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,435
I can do it.

163
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,160
-Really?
-Go.

164
00:09:54,404 --> 00:09:55,379
I'll do it later.

165
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:56,781
You go rest.

166
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:05,825
Fine.

167
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:11,885
It's alright. I got it.

168
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:16,598
Sit down!

169
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:20,013
Come here.

170
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,600
What's this?

171
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:44,411
Last audition for the detective series.

172
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:47,760
The leading actress is almost decided.

173
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,395
It's just waiting for the contract.

174
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,512
The preparation has started.

175
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:53,720
You just read the scripts.

176
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:55,737
What did the director say?

177
00:10:55,778 --> 00:10:59,560
Very satisfied
especially the indoor chase.

178
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:00,840
You acted good.

179
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,800
Of course.

180
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,789
I have my private teacher.

181
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:05,176
My honey.

182
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,840
He taught me hand in hand.

183
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:21,600
What's the matter, you look not so good?

184
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,345
Are you tired?

185
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:29,800
I can't let myself stop.

186
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,640
Every time I stop.

187
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,135
I would think of Xiao Yuansong.

188
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:38,960
Didn't he tell you?

189
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:41,303
What?

190
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:42,840
He's not sick.

191
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:45,267
Not sick?

192
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,190
Yes, Shiyun took him to recheck.

193
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:48,920
That was a mistake.
He's not sick.

194
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:53,762
Not sick?

195
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:09,517
Xiao Yuansong.

196
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:11,800
You'll see.

197
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,455
I will teach you a lesson.

198
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:22,080
Dear,

199
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,640
do you think your legs
are numb and swollen.

200
00:12:28,473 --> 00:12:31,320
Yes, a little.

201
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:32,712
Come here.

202
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:33,872
It's okay, let me do it.

203
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:34,838
No, I'll help you.

204
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:40,800
Dear,

205
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:42,118
what's wrong?

206
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:46,708
Don't feel well?

207
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:49,198
I searched online.

208
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,040
It says that hot water
can help the circulate of blood...

209
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,440
and relieve the numbness of limbs.

210
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,600
Numb.

211
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,000
Numb.

212
00:13:06,012 --> 00:13:08,687
You don't plan to tell Xiao Yuansong?

213
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:10,087
It's none of my business.

214
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,645
I'll remind you.

215
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:14,324
With my understanding of Wu Di,

216
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,320
your buddy will suffer a lot.

217
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:18,080
He deserves it.

218
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,690
New play.

219
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:30,435
The Pursuer is a detective mystery play.

220
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:35,320
I will play a smart
and cold female detective.

221
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:38,480
Do you think it sounds cool?

222
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:44,580
Come here.

223
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,960
Open your mouth.

224
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:49,480
It's a reward for my honey.

225
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:53,560
Do you know that in audition...

226
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:58,351
my action play
was praised by the director.

227
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:00,280
If this play succeeds,

228
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,708
it will be a change-of-type for Su Jinbei.

229
00:14:02,985 --> 00:14:03,825
Am I good?

230
00:14:05,162 --> 00:14:06,002
I want reward.

231
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:07,365
What reward?

232
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:12,156
I opened my heart...

233
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:14,960
and fell for you.

234
00:14:16,258 --> 00:14:22,240
I want you repay me with more.

235
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:26,771
Are you sure?

236
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,520
No problem.

237
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:39,800
Close your eyes.

238
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:42,663
Close your eyes.

239
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,720
Wait me a moment.

240
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:13,710
What are these?

241
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,280
Repay you.

242
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,280
No.

243
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:45,022
Mr. Xu, I just called.

244
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:45,903
She's coming.

245
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,440
Sorry I'm late.

246
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:54,720
Let's get ready.

247
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,485
We will record together?

248
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:00,480
Yes, this song is easy
for you to cooperate.

249
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:05,000
Sorry, I don't feel good today.

250
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,720
I might affect the others.

251
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,519
For a better quality,

252
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,495
we better record separately.

253
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:14,210
Never mind, let's have a try.

254
00:17:14,522 --> 00:17:15,920
I know myself pretty well,

255
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:17,600
there's no point in wasting time.

256
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:21,536
Well, Zitong.

257
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:24,000
There's only one
recording studio left today.

258
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:26,600
When is the next activity.

259
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:30,323
3:00.

260
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:33,040
I don't want to create troubles.

261
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:38,371
If Jiawei has other arrangements later,

262
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:39,294
we can discuss this.

263
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:41,120
We can discuss.

264
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:48,680
Do you have other works?

265
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:50,225
Em...

266
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,550
Yes or No?

267
00:17:53,235 --> 00:17:54,075
No.

268
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,520
Then let's go.

269
00:17:57,997 --> 00:17:58,844
Mr. Xu.

270
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:00,600
Let Zitong record first
I'll take you to the green room.

271
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,900
Okay.

272
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:14,173
Zitong.

273
00:18:14,214 --> 00:18:16,320
-This is...
-Hurry up!

274
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:30,385
Jiawei.

275
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:32,895
She showed off in front of you like this,
aren't you mad?

276
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:34,116
What's the point of being mad?

277
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:35,091
It will not solve the problem.

278
00:18:35,435 --> 00:18:36,885
I don't want to bother the staff.

279
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:44,669
It's because of you that I lost again.

280
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:45,954
You kept affecting me here.

281
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,860
You are not skilled.

282
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,520
Well, are you good at this?

283
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:04,635
Let me show you.

284
00:19:06,997 --> 00:19:08,647
Follow me, quick.

285
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:10,229
Roger.

286
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:12,420
Prepare to destroy the tower.

287
00:19:16,678 --> 00:19:18,603
Have you seen the live video of Wuque?

288
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,320
Your tactics are very much like his.

289
00:19:26,102 --> 00:19:26,942
Yes.

290
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:31,120
The skills are almost the same.

291
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:34,920
Follow me, quick.

292
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,185
Dear,

293
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:55,711
I've got something good today.

294
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,040
My friend taught me a folk treatment
for your disease.

295
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:01,487
Dear,

296
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,120
you know I'm a doctor.

297
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:05,877
I don't believe in these.

298
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:07,594
I know,

299
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:09,440
but it's different now.

300
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,265
You don't want to stay in
the hospital for treatment.

301
00:20:12,306 --> 00:20:16,440
We have to try these.

302
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:19,892
We can't give up even a slim hope.

303
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:24,920
How should I use it?

304
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:26,480
Just eat it.

305
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:30,160
I'll feed you.

306
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:13,520
Thanks, Zitong.

307
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,410
I saw Jiawei rest in this car before.

308
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:21,880
Now our treatment
is not worse than his.

309
00:21:35,222 --> 00:21:36,062
Zitong.

310
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,885
I knew a new play.

311
00:21:38,926 --> 00:21:40,080
It's preparing.

312
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:42,269
It's hot online.

313
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,480
People look forward to it.

314
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:47,480
They seem to want Su Jinbei in the play.

315
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,000
What's the name?

316
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,280
The Pursuer.

317
00:21:53,085 --> 00:21:54,440
The leading actress is Su Jinbei.

318
00:21:54,782 --> 00:21:55,640
Is it decided?

319
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,231
It's still waiting to sign the contract,

320
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:58,722
but it should be her.

321
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,800
Should be?

322
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,516
Give me the phone.

323
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,129
Guard outside.

324
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:12,411
Don't let anyone in.

325
00:22:13,023 --> 00:22:13,863
Okay.

326
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:24,875
Hello?

327
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:27,983
Is it reporter Zhang from Colorful Weekly?

328
00:22:29,761 --> 00:22:35,760
I have an exclusive news
about the new boyfriend of Su Jinbei.

329
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:36,825
Zhou Shiyun?

330
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,330
I've washed my feet,
I don't want a foot bath.

331
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:46,378
I'm not asking you to take a foot bath.

332
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:47,713
I thought about it.

333
00:22:47,754 --> 00:22:49,729
The old treatment was not good.

334
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,080
So today, I visited a TCM expert...

335
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:55,760
and learned about acupuncture.

336
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,744
It's simple.

337
00:22:57,785 --> 00:22:59,328
We can do it at home.

338
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:00,329
Let's have a try.

339
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,210
I'd rather not.

340
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:03,000
Don't worry.

341
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:07,840
He marked the place for
the needles for me.

342
00:23:10,408 --> 00:23:11,408
You'll be fine.

343
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:16,379
Is it...

344
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,320
Darling, it's getting late.

345
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,760
Don't you have to get up early
for the meeting tomorrow.

346
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:24,360
Let's just sleep.

347
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,835
The meeting is not as important as you.

348
00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:32,440
We can be late for this.

349
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,310
Come on.

350
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:36,200
I'll have a look first.

351
00:23:38,705 --> 00:23:41,780
It's here.

352
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:47,153
You give me a break.

353
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:48,330
Why are you running?

354
00:23:48,371 --> 00:23:50,246
I haven't stuck needles yet.

355
00:23:50,452 --> 00:23:52,075
I couldn't run if you stuck needles on me.

356
00:23:52,116 --> 00:23:52,956
Why are you running?

357
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:54,960
I'm wrong

358
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,360
I'll speak the truth.

359
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,550
Tell me.

360
00:24:04,624 --> 00:24:05,824
I'm not sick.

361
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,650
No,

362
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:10,010
I thought I was sick,

363
00:24:10,484 --> 00:24:13,160
but then I realized that I was not
and I didn't tell you.

364
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:18,960
I planned to tell you at first
at my birthday party,

365
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,310
but you know how touching it was...

366
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,508
and you treated me so well lately,

367
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:33,370
so I didn't dare to tell you.

368
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,485
I know I'm a bastard.

369
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,720
I wanted to tell you later,

370
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:42,280
but I don't know why I was afraid
that you would get mad...

371
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:43,239
and I didn't.

372
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,035
Sorry.

373
00:24:57,382 --> 00:24:58,222
Didi.

374
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,398
You bastard!

375
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:04,819
How can you torture me like this?

376
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:07,520
How dare you!

377
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:16,223
Sorry.

378
00:25:18,462 --> 00:25:20,537
I'm glad that you're fine.

379
00:25:36,873 --> 00:25:38,078
Support.

380
00:25:56,553 --> 00:25:58,200
What are you doing?

381
00:25:58,985 --> 00:26:00,440
Come on.
Are you asleep?

382
00:26:11,193 --> 00:26:15,768
Have you decided the recording time?

383
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:20,885
No, I'll decide tomorrow.

384
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:30,834
It's so late, haven't rest?

385
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:39,120
I'm playing games
and failed several rounds in a row.

386
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:40,835
I feel bad.

387
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:48,404
Do you want me to lead you.

388
00:26:48,685 --> 00:26:50,360
You've seen how good I am.

389
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,350
Come on.

390
00:28:16,525 --> 00:28:17,680
Breakfast will be there soon.

391
00:28:37,497 --> 00:28:38,822
Did you see the news?

392
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,560
-What?
-The news, Su Jinbei.

393
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:45,208
Isn't that...

394
00:28:45,384 --> 00:28:46,319
So the leading actor!

395
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,200
That's it!

396
00:28:48,157 --> 00:28:49,968
-Why isn't she here yet?
-Totally.

397
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:52,040
I've waited all day!

398
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:52,960
What's wrong?

399
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:54,011
It said that she's at home.

400
00:28:54,052 --> 00:28:54,927
Is she out?

401
00:28:55,632 --> 00:28:56,532
No, I don't know.

402
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:57,675
Hey.

403
00:28:57,785 --> 00:29:00,040
Where are you, honey?
Something happened.

404
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:00,921
Wait a moment.

405
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:02,440
Wait a second, wait.

406
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,146
-We can't go back.
-What's wrong?

407
00:29:18,187 --> 00:29:19,320
Our relationship is exposed.

408
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,040
They even dug out your information.

409
00:29:25,202 --> 00:29:27,480
Honey, I'm sorry.

410
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,610
Your company is exposed as well.

411
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,720
They might come for you.

412
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,040
It's fine.

413
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:35,385
You've never experienced this.

414
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,442
I'm afraid you would be frightened.

415
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,770
I won't.

416
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,060
Just ignore them.

417
00:29:40,231 --> 00:29:41,480
It's not that simple.

418
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:43,080
They will keep pestering you.

419
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:50,124
I didn't expect the first time of
the views exceeding ten thousand...

420
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,240
was by bad comments.

421
00:30:03,912 --> 00:30:05,037
Mr. Yue.

422
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:07,560
Yes, I saw the news.

423
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:09,547
Yes, we are dealing with it.

424
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,055
The shooting will be delayed.

425
00:30:12,096 --> 00:30:13,000
You...

426
00:30:13,572 --> 00:30:14,412
Hey.

427
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:15,378
Hey.

428
00:30:15,913 --> 00:30:18,263
There's no need to write
a lawyer's letter, right?

429
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:20,914
Let's meet, and...

430
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:22,005
Hey.

431
00:30:22,677 --> 00:30:23,840
Listen to me.

432
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:31,360
Didi.
Didi, look.

433
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:33,522
The Weibo of The pursuer.

434
00:30:33,922 --> 00:30:36,360
They are voting for
the leading actress now.

435
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:40,040
I remembered
the play decided on Su Jinbei.

436
00:30:40,897 --> 00:30:42,847
Gao Zitong's so hot right now.

437
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:44,840
It will affect Su Jinbei.

438
00:30:49,036 --> 00:30:50,161
I'm glad that you're fine.

439
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,827
How can I be blocked by them?

440
00:30:51,868 --> 00:30:54,618
I'm the experienced drama queen Su Jinbei.

441
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:55,800
I can't be caught.

442
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,840
Eat your breakfast.

443
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,920
I tell you.

444
00:31:02,355 --> 00:31:03,745
Public sentiment is like the wind.

445
00:31:03,786 --> 00:31:04,786
It will blow off in a few days.

446
00:31:04,925 --> 00:31:07,050
I've told Didi to find the solution.

447
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:08,503
In a few days,

448
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,720
it will be as usual.

449
00:31:13,952 --> 00:31:15,480
It looks delicious.

450
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:18,939
Delicious.

451
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:45,656
Actually.

452
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:48,860
I'm mad at myself.

453
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,732
No matter what happened,

454
00:31:51,603 --> 00:31:52,878
I wouldn't panic before.

455
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,685
Because I'm always keeping an eye.

456
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:57,230
I know it.

457
00:31:57,529 --> 00:31:58,760
But this time,

458
00:32:00,157 --> 00:32:01,982
it's much serious than we think.

459
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:06,378
Didi, during this period,

460
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:10,485
I've been wasting your effort
and dragging you behind.

461
00:32:11,335 --> 00:32:14,320
But the Wu Di I know...

462
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,560
is fearless and unstoppable.

463
00:32:19,012 --> 00:32:22,080
Nothing in this world can stop you.

464
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:26,560
There is.

465
00:32:32,674 --> 00:32:35,320
I'm afraid of nothing
except life and death.

466
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:36,825
I have to work.

467
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:38,923
Bye.

468
00:32:40,147 --> 00:32:40,987
Come on!

469
00:32:53,898 --> 00:32:55,823
The appointment of Mr. Yue is full.

470
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:04,320
Okay, it's my appointment now.

471
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,080
For you two,

472
00:33:14,335 --> 00:33:16,760
my Didi has paid a lot of efforts.

473
00:33:17,761 --> 00:33:18,880
It's really a hard work.

474
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,460
Should I figure out other ways.

475
00:33:25,181 --> 00:33:26,881
I have a thousand solutions.

476
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:27,822
Would you take it.

477
00:33:28,285 --> 00:33:29,125
Director.

478
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,947
It's about Zhou Shiyun and me.

479
00:33:31,988 --> 00:33:32,938
Two families!

480
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:33,919
What can you do?

481
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,040
Just say it.

482
00:33:35,753 --> 00:33:37,778
I have a thousand solutions to punish you.

483
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:38,659
Would you take it?

484
00:33:39,546 --> 00:33:40,446
When is it now?

485
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,435
Lunch break.

486
00:33:42,476 --> 00:33:44,760
You don't stay at your office and rest.

487
00:33:44,801 --> 00:33:47,910
You come here to chat, chat, chat.

488
00:33:48,035 --> 00:33:48,885
There is no escape for you.

489
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,076
It's not fair.

490
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,635
Dr. Zhou, Dr. Zhou.

491
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,640
Is Su Jinbei your girlfriend?

492
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:56,681
When did you start?

493
00:33:56,722 --> 00:33:57,715
When?

494
00:33:57,756 --> 00:33:59,920
-Dr. Zhou.
-When?

495
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,165
What are you doing?

496
00:34:02,189 --> 00:34:03,114
I tell you.

497
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:04,551
Pestering a doctor...

498
00:34:04,592 --> 00:34:08,117
and stopping him from saving lives
will have consequences.

499
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,160
Security.

500
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,510
Drive them away.

501
00:34:12,585 --> 00:34:13,760
Please go back

502
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:14,641
Dr. Zhou.

503
00:34:14,682 --> 00:34:15,707
Dr. Zhou, Dr. Zhou.

504
00:34:16,332 --> 00:34:17,172
Dr. Zhou.

505
00:34:18,137 --> 00:34:19,472
Sorry, please don't come again.

506
00:34:19,513 --> 00:34:21,163
Don't touch me, I can walk.

507
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,240
I don't believe you won't come out today.

508
00:34:38,636 --> 00:34:39,476
Mr. Yue.

509
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:44,919
What are the odds!

510
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,240
We meet again.

511
00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:47,618
Miss Wu.

512
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:51,720
This time, we should do our job
and go through the legal procedure.

513
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:54,560
There's no need to.

514
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,010
Is it so serious?

515
00:34:58,051 --> 00:34:59,201
It's a misunderstanding!

516
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,920
It'll be cleared up in no time.

517
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:02,011
It's not that simple.

518
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:05,240
The news is specific.

519
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:07,719
Will Su Jinbei come to clear it up.

520
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,385
Yes, of course.

521
00:35:10,471 --> 00:35:13,106
She will clear it up to you in person.

522
00:35:13,147 --> 00:35:15,172
Okay, bring her here first.

523
00:35:15,835 --> 00:35:17,480
Can I go in now? Miss Wu.

524
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,035
Sorry, please.

525
00:35:29,863 --> 00:35:30,835
Shiyun.

526
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,720
These people will never give up easily.

527
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,720
You should hide.

528
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,330
I'll give you a few days off.

529
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:40,160
You just come back when it's over.

530
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:44,800
Look at you.

531
00:35:45,597 --> 00:35:48,393
I know you feel sorry for the hospital,

532
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:50,373
but I just let you rest.

533
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,880
You still have to...

534
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:58,085
keep on with the project at home.

535
00:35:59,321 --> 00:36:00,671
I'll make it clear beforehand.

536
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,440
I need results.

537
00:36:03,635 --> 00:36:05,385
If it fell short of my expectation,

538
00:36:05,426 --> 00:36:06,920
I wouldn't take it.

539
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:09,585
Are you clear?

540
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:11,400
Yes sir.

541
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:12,281
Go ahead.

542
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,500
Be careful.

543
00:36:18,835 --> 00:36:19,675
Okay.

544
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,032
My queen, I'm begging you.

545
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,391
When you see Mr. Yue,

546
00:36:36,432 --> 00:36:38,040
please be nice.

547
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:41,480
You just tell him
that the news online is fake.

548
00:36:44,882 --> 00:36:46,207
It's for the play.

549
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:47,673
Just deal with it.

550
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:50,859
I will try my best.

551
00:36:52,435 --> 00:36:55,020
Our Beibei is an actress.

552
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,185
You can do it.

553
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,981
Don't worry.

554
00:36:58,785 --> 00:37:00,060
Remember my words.

555
00:37:00,572 --> 00:37:01,412
Don't make any mistakes.

556
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,185
I see.

557
00:37:06,145 --> 00:37:07,745
Okay, tell me, how to solve it?

558
00:37:08,697 --> 00:37:11,082
Mr. Yue, how could you also
believe those contradictions.

559
00:37:11,123 --> 00:37:12,000
They are all false.

560
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,366
Please don't take it to heart.

561
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:14,720
I didn't.

562
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:17,960
You broke your promise.

563
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,829
You said you would
register on our website,

564
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:25,000
but news came out
that you had a boyfriend.

565
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:30,210
Your fame is doubted
and our website would be affected as well.

566
00:37:32,403 --> 00:37:33,243
Have a look.

567
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,178
They are all criticizing our website.

568
00:37:37,514 --> 00:37:39,990
They say that the information
on our website is fake...

569
00:37:40,597 --> 00:37:42,847
and the spokesman is a liar.

570
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:43,851
Who's a liar?

571
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:49,019
In our mind,

572
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,440
you are brave and smart.

573
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:53,908
How can you believe the gossips online?

574
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:54,807
That's right.

575
00:37:54,848 --> 00:37:55,688
Okay, okay.

576
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,840
We can discuss it.

577
00:37:58,778 --> 00:38:00,160
You don't have to praise me like this.

578
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:02,810
Whatever the truth is,

579
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,760
out website was affected.

580
00:38:07,623 --> 00:38:09,320
I'll pay your loss.
