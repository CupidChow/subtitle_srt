=Episode 21=

3
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:39,625
Jiawei and I all came back
from abroad training.

4
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,816
We need a lot of money

5
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,575
to plan our future.

6
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,940
Ridiculous?

7
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,300
You've take up all his heart

8
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,300
and I'm still planning our future

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,650
as a one-sided wish.

10
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,566
I think every tear for him

11
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,672
is mocking me.

12
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:04,200
Even the air I'm breathing
is mocking me.

13
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,275
Why did I treat you like that?

14
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,150
Because you are rich in love.

15
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:15,375
Everyone loves you

16
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,447
and I own nothing.

17
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:19,041
I don't want to take these alone.

18
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,125
I want you to join me.

19
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,850
Is this reason good enough for you?

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,840
Zitong.

21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,400
You don't have to do that.

22
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:32,150
I've done so many
bad things to you.

23
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,991
You don't have to pretend that

24
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:35,050
you're not mad at me.

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm lying,

26
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,700
if I say I'm not mad at you,

27
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:43,325
you wouldn't believe it.

28
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,925
Neither would I.

29
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:47,375
But what I'm mad at most

30
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,025
is not the fact that you did these,

31
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,550
but because of you...

32
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:54,616
I didn't only treat you as a friend

33
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,275
I see you as my sister,

34
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:57,925
a good partner,

35
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:01,375
and a respectful opponent.

36
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,831
Zitong, love is a magical thing.

37
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,350
I'm not rich in love

38
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,525
as you said.

39
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:17,325
I think...

40
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,275
Love is decided by fate

41
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,975
If he doesn't love you,

42
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,800
you have to love yourself,

43
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,700
and be more confident.

44
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,300
Because if someday,

45
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:29,950
there's a tiny bit of

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,625
regret in his heart,

47
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:34,375
you win.

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,675
Su Jinbei.

49
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:41,150
Not everyone is like you.

50
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:42,265
Yes, everyone is different,

51
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,050
but you are beautiful, smart
and hard-working.

52
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,125
I trust you.

53
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:50,150
Why don't you trust yourself?

54
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,325
Because I have no chance now.

55
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,950
Then please give me a chance

56
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,175
to get through this with you.

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,825
You'll be fine.

58
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,425
Jinbei.

59
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,375
Sorry.

60
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,816
I'll come down.

61
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,740
No.

62
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,725
It's easy to talk like that.

63
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:29,975
I know that you are
venting your anger for me.

64
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,316
I really appreciate it.

65
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,516
But the whole thing is just

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,975
a misunderstanding.

67
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,791
It's all right. It's all over now.

68
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,316
We should make a good acting later.

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Let them know that
we are good actresses

70
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,575
And it was so,

71
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,675
I didn't expect there were so many regrets

72
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,525
behind the conspiracy.

73
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:55,225
It's regretful of Gao Zitong.

74
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,325
This ends here.

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,206
What's the matter?

76
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,291
I don't know I should say you're kind,

77
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,500
or stupid

78
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,791
No matter how many times you're hurt,

79
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,400
you can't learn how bad
human nature can be.

80
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:18,516
It's not that I didn't learn.

81
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,900
I don't want to...

82
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:21,091
I mean,

83
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:23,575
How many times will the heart beat
in a lifetime?

84
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:25,600
Why should I keep so many bad things?

85
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,850
I should keep the precious,

86
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,216
and throw away the bad ones.

87
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,125
She's happy and I'm happy.

88
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:37,025
You are really born a soap opera queen.

89
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,390
I've changed.

90
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,925
Your Beibei can handle any type of plays.

91
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:52,800
My honey won an award!

92
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:53,991
Really?

93
00:05:54,075 --> 00:05:55,111
We must celebrate it.

94
00:05:55,195 --> 00:05:56,808
Let's have a hot pot tomorrow!

95
00:05:56,892 --> 00:05:59,141
No. No. Let's go home.

96
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,666
Wang said we have
to keep it low key,

97
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:01,721
low key.

98
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,250
Good.

99
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:14,229
Jiawei,

100
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,475
This is a functional sport beverage.

101
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:19,675
You can drink it 10-20 minutes
before doing sports,

102
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,391
or five minutes after.

103
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,166
Don't drink too much,

104
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,450
or your body can't take it.

105
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,666
This is lactose-free milk.

106
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,500
You can drink it.

107
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,525
Have it before going to sleep.

108
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,850
Remember to heat it in the microwave first.

109
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,600
This is malt fermented beer.

110
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,775
You can drink some if you can't sleep.

111
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,525
Just a little, not too much.

112
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,875
These are all my favorites.

113
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:09,400
Why I didn't notice it before?

114
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,725
Are you Asura?

115
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:41,715
What's up?

116
00:07:42,975 --> 00:07:43,950
I'm looking for someone

117
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,350
I need her specific location.

118
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,540
Can you do it?

119
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,050
Positioning, piece of cake.

120
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,500
Give me her account.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,900
As long as she's online,

122
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,700
It'll show her Internet address
right here

123
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:54,700
and decide her location

124
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:56,650
What if she's not online?

125
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,341
Bro, if she's not online,

126
00:07:58,425 --> 00:07:59,366
I can't find any information,

127
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,266
even if

128
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,190
I'm a grand master.

129
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,290
Just go back first.

130
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:15,100
I'll inform you if I have information.

131
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,825
Contact me on time.

132
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,325
I'll keep my phone on 24/7.

133
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:57,600
Do you love her?

134
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,616
Your question

135
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,866
is beyond an assistance's responsibility.

136
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,790
But I want to know.

137
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,191
Bro, if she's not online,

138
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:09,266
I can't find any information.

139
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,241
even if

140
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:11,165
I'm a grand master.

141
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:22,134
I can't just count on Asura.

142
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:24,325
I have to find a way.

143
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:55,307
Wuque.

144
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,488
Hello,

145
00:09:57,575 --> 00:09:59,400
I don't know if you can see this video,

146
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,525
but I want to tell you
that I've been looking for you.

147
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:06,025
During the past days,

148
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:08,550
you have been a very important
friend of mine.

149
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:11,850
You are there for me in your own way,

150
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:13,850
and helped me a lot.

151
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:15,875
Because so many have happened.

152
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,750
I ignored your existence.

153
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,400
I hope...

154
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:21,300
you can give me a chance
to make up for these.

155
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,450
Come back to me.

156
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,458
I want to say thank you in person, OK?

157
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,047
Wuque.

158
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:46,298
Hello,

159
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,466
See,

160
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,075
Jiawei updated his videos on Shuabao.

161
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,466
I saw it.

162
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,390
So touching

163
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,250
Who do you think the Wuque is...

164
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,950
Whatever.

165
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,066
She could make Jiawei find her like this.

166
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,417
During the past days,

167
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:04,725
you've been a very
important friend of mine.

168
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,550
You are there for me in your own way,

169
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,141
and helped me a lot.

170
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:12,378
You didn't take care of yourself.

171
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,741
You've lost some weight.

172
00:11:13,825 --> 00:11:14,941
I hope...

173
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,675
you can give me a chance
to make up for these.

174
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,575
Come back to me.

175
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,869
I want to say thank you in person, OK?

176
00:11:48,617 --> 00:11:51,525
Jiawei, you're welcome.

177
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:54,672
I just want you to be happy.

178
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:01,715
Hey.

179
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:04,200
Got it, I'll give you the address

180
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,240
Okay.

181
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:12,917
What are you hiding from?

182
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,016
Behind

183
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,966
This guy...

184
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,800
Do you have medicine? Give me some

185
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:18,815
Give you one.

186
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:19,739
Hurry up!

187
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,766
Go!

188
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,531
Are you serious?

189
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,200
What a bad teammate.

190
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:25,750
Okay, come on?

191
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:27,341
You just commit suicide every day.

192
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:28,341
Good.

193
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:29,066
Come on.

194
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,466
Please lead me, brother.

195
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,550
Come on, sit.

196
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,175
So stupid!

197
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,075
Behind.

198
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,816
I can't see.

199
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,941
What are you doing? Save me!

200
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:40,591
My god.

201
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:41,641
Are you playing with eyes closed

202
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:42,565
I'm on your side.

203
00:12:45,475 --> 00:12:46,700
OK, OK.

204
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,475
Is it Xu Jiawei?

205
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,416
Jiawei.

206
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,400
It's him!

207
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,225
It's so exciting!

208
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,066
So handsome.

209
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,990
Take a picture.

210
00:13:05,653 --> 00:13:06,630
Wow!

211
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:07,291
Hot pot!

212
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,716
Cheers!

213
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,216
Come on.

214
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:09,691
Come on.

215
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:10,416
Come on.

216
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,241
Come on.

217
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:14,175
Let's congratulate professor Zhou Shiyun,

218
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:15,941
for having two good things in one day.

219
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:17,875
He just got back work and won

220
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,450
the Young Medical Elite Award!

221
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:20,778
Wow!

222
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,516
You don't work on medicine,

223
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,925
you may not know
how important this award is,

224
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:27,391
and what does it mean.

225
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:29,225
He will get the research funding he reported.

226
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,950
The country will nurture him,

227
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,175
as an elite of this field.

228
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,160
My honey is the best!

229
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:36,941
And,

230
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,900
Tell you another amazing information.

231
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,316
No one in our hospital,

232
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,825
has won this award under thirty.

233
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,116
Zhou is the first one,

234
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,040
The first one!

235
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,516
Come on, cheers.

236
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,241
Come on.

237
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:50,165
Thanks.

238
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,350
Look at you, so happy.

239
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,400
It seems that you won the award.

240
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:01,500
We are the same.

241
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,641
There's no difference.

242
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:03,565
Right, Zhou?

243
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,600
Zhou won an award just like I won.

244
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,125
Right?

245
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,440
No.

246
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,925
Don't humiliate me in public.

247
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,317
Work it for yourself.

248
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,041
Don't steal it from him.

249
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,916
OK, I won't do that.

250
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You are talking nonsense.

251
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,175
Eat your tripe.

252
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:23,765
By the way, Beibei.

253
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:26,191
An international blockbuster

254
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:27,575
is auditioning the leading act ress.

255
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,225
It's a good chance,

256
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:32,975
but the director is famous
for his bad temper.

257
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,140
He's strict.

258
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,800
I don't think you'd be interested in.

259
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,500
I am!

260
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:40,468
Are you sure?

261
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,891
Yes. I am sure.

262
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:43,366
You have to think it twice.

263
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,541
This project is called
Future Female Warrior.

264
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,500
There will be a lot of movement scenes.

265
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,948
It will be hard.

266
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:51,280
I can take it.

267
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,257
Oh?

268
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,816
My Beibei is the best.

269
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,000
I will sign up for you.

270
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:56,726
Uhm.

271
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:58,491
You know the projects of this director

272
00:14:58,575 --> 00:15:00,066
is always award winning.

273
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,250
A lot of people want to work with him.

274
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,525
If you want to be her actress,

275
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:08,300
you have to put in hard work.

276
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,916
He has high requirements

277
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,875
Don't scare me

278
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:18,925
I will be very serious

279
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,466
for this project

280
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,275
I'll quit hot pots from now on.

281
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,400
I respect you.

282
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,816
Keep your word.

283
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,125
And alcohol, I quit.

284
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,025
Okay, we can drink together.

285
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,091
Yes.

286
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:34,015
Come on, Dr. Zhou.

287
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,091
Come on.

288
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:36,015
Come on

289
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:37,015
Come on!

290
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:49,075
Why are you so hard-working suddenly?

291
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:50,825
And want to try difficult projects?

292
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,125
I'm always hard-working.

293
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:58,491
Okay, I admit that...

294
00:15:58,575 --> 00:16:00,725
I was a little

295
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,275
loaf on the job

296
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,666
But, it's different now.

297
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,941
The words from Zitong

298
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:08,150
touched me.

299
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,350
When I entered this field,

300
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,921
I had dreamed to be a top actress.

301
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:16,765
But...

302
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,691
I don't know why,

303
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:22,916
I started to be easy on myself.

304
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,516
Now, I didn't get any
important awards.

305
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,100
This is so embarrassing

306
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:30,000
You want an award?

307
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:31,575
Of course!

308
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,975
My honey won a big award in medicine.

309
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,940
Then,

310
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,066
I have to win a big award in filming.

311
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,591
That's called perfect match

312
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:41,025
for each other.

313
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,175
I'll make everyone jealous then.

314
00:17:00,996 --> 00:17:01,559
Zitong,

315
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,675
This is the latest schedule
the coach just gave me.

316
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,066
Please have the coach arrange my classes

317
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,250
on the highest standard.

318
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,591
With this training tenacity.

319
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:17,900
I'm afraid you can't take it

320
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:19,800
Take it easy. I'm fine.

321
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:22,300
A big production like
the Future Female Warrior

322
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,125
will must have fierce competition

323
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,925
If everyone wants the same thing

324
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,950
and you must have it,

325
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:33,225
you have to put in more efforts.

326
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:34,315
Understand?

327
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,675
Now I have no choice.

328
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:41,203
You are so hard-working,

329
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,975
and you will have it.

330
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:46,291
By the way, when I handed
in the Application Form today.

331
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,175
I saw Su Jinbei applied as well

332
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:51,700
It's Miss Jinbei.

333
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:52,950
She's senior

334
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,150
Make sure to be deferential.

335
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,225
Okay, I go and get busy.

336
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,490
Time for breakfast.

337
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:12,772
Wow!

338
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,675
Too much good food!

339
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,975
Honey, I'm sorry.

340
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,850
I didn't tell you.

341
00:18:23,975 --> 00:18:25,950
I didn't only quit hot pot

342
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,575
I also quit food.

343
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,041
To keep a perfect figure,

344
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,475
I can just eat this.

345
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:36,325
What's this?

346
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,600
Substitute meal.

347
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:40,900
High fiber, low calorie,
and easy to satiate.

348
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,425
I can just eat this for three meals.

349
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,540
Come on.

350
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:57,725
It smells good.

351
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:02,350
Let's eat.

352
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,791
No, too much calories.

353
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:05,750
I can only smell

354
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,500
Is it terrible?

355
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,566
It's a little tasteless,

356
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,341
but it can help lose weight

357
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:17,706
Endure!

358
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,237
A slice of potatoes.

359
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:22,991
There's a lot of ways to achieve

360
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,475
low calorie and high fibre.

361
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:26,200
It is not necessarily to eat this.

362
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,240
Wait...

363
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:43,713
Honey,

364
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:47,011
you made all these nutritious foods

365
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,425
for me?

366
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:57,766
But,

367
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,050
the Pumpkin Porridge looks sweet,

368
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,175
does it contain high calories?

369
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,891
It's sweet because there's a lot of

370
00:20:06,975 --> 00:20:08,225
vitamins and pectin

371
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,200
Pectin has a good adsorption effect and

372
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:12,100
can help the body detoxify,

373
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,041
and protect gastric mucosa
to help digestion.

374
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,850
Low in calories and low in carbohydrates.

375
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,525
It's good for people
who want to lose weight

376
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:35,775
Honey, It's seven o'clock

377
00:20:35,975 --> 00:20:37,700
You should go to the hospital.

378
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,690
I'll go now.

379
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:47,975
Honey.

380
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:50,525
Thank you for your healthy breakfast.

381
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,950
It's delicious.

382
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:58,165
I'll go now.

383
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,765
Go.

384
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,585
Bacon, egg and pumpkin.

385
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:30,366
Low calorie in the doctor's eyes,

386
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,625
but not with actor's.

387
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:34,825
Sorry, honey.

388
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:37,650
I have to present the best of myself.

389
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:50,782
Zitong.

390
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,191
Jinbei.

391
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:52,841
You come for the interview as well?

392
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:53,291
Right.

393
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,215
Take a seat.

394
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,400
Well, I see that we are competitors now.

395
00:21:58,325 --> 00:21:59,916
The international crew
is really different from ours.

396
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,975
It's completely different
from our auditions.

397
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,625
The waiting area is different.

398
00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:04,941
Maybe even if we are chosen,

399
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,475
there will be a lot of training.

400
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:09,391
Jinbei, we are not only friends,

401
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:10,575
and also competitors.

402
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,050
No matter who came
for the interview first,

403
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,375
don't spoil the questions.

404
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,141
We play fair.

405
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:16,791
Come on.

406
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:17,715
OK.

407
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:19,200
Come on, Jinbei.

408
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:21,241
I won't let you win.

409
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:22,300
Back at you.

410
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,790
You have to know that,

411
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,666
wedding rings

412
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,725
represent not only the love of two people,

413
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,250
but also the eternity of marriage.

414
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,275
So this wedding ring,

415
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,500
must be chosen carefully.

416
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,175
This is pretty.

417
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:53,716
Give me this.

418
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,366
OK.

419
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,441
Make it according to the size
that I gave you.

420
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:56,365
Okay, sir.

421
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,200
You have your ideas.

422
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,575
Why did you bring me here?

423
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,850
What's the point?

424
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:03,266
Credit card.

425
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,190
Okay.

426
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,091
You have no sense of beauty.

427
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:07,975
You can buy it yourself, if you like it.

428
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,550
You will use it.

429
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,875
I'm not in a hurry.

430
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:16,666
Here's the ring, Sir.

431
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,391
Thanks.

432
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:17,941
Your credit card.

433
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:18,865
Okay.

434
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:19,890
Let's go.

435
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:21,675
See you next time.

436
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,550
Really?

437
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm chosen!

438
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:33,500
But I have to take
the training for two months

439
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:35,491
Are you exaggerating?

440
00:23:35,575 --> 00:23:38,216
The director of this project
is very strict.

441
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,575
You know that.

442
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:42,841
The training doesn't mean you got
the leading actress role.

443
00:23:42,925 --> 00:23:44,891
Nobody knows who will be
the leading actress.

444
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:45,815
Right?

445
00:23:46,275 --> 00:23:47,041
So,

446
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,416
I'm just reminding you.

447
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,841
If you can't take it,

448
00:23:49,925 --> 00:23:50,950
we can quit now.

449
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,991
Don't quit while on the process.

450
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:53,766
Nonsense.

451
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:54,850
I won't quit.

452
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,366
OK, then pack your things,

453
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,650
and prepare to go.

454
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,441
I know, bye.

455
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:01,365
Bye.

456
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,475
Two months!

457
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:09,100
Isn't it too long?

458
00:24:17,175 --> 00:24:18,225
Hey, honey.

459
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,525
Please come to my place now.

460
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,840
What's the matter?

461
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,525
I have something important to tell you!

462
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,375
That's the important thing?

463
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,716
This training is different
from joining the shooting.

464
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,866
It's very hard and intense.

465
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,566
It means we won't have time
to see each other for two months.

466
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,525
It's 60 day and nights.

467
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:45,100
60 day and nights.

468
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,875
If you calculate by minute and second,

469
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,491
it will be...

470
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:49,950
Three times six is eighteen.

471
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,541
Two four six seven eight.

472
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,350
86,400 minutes.

473
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:56,575
5,184,000 seconds.

474
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:59,100
If I can miss you one time in one second.

475
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,341
We will have

476
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:02,050
more than 5.1 million blanks.

477
00:25:04,825 --> 00:25:06,650
It's too scary.

478
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,850
Honey,

479
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,575
I'd love it if life can be like a play.

480
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,500
Isn't it the soap opera.

481
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,850
No matter what they are,

482
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,700
whether they work together,

483
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:27,691
or where the girl is,

484
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:29,316
the boy will appear anytime.

485
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,975
If I am a screenwriter,

486
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:33,725
I will make us together everyday.

487
00:25:34,175 --> 00:25:36,000
and we won't separate for one second.

488
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,800
Congratulations,

489
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:46,891
you entered the closed training sector.

490
00:25:46,975 --> 00:25:48,641
There will be systematic training,

491
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:51,466
by professional coaches,

492
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,625
on your all-round skills.

493
00:25:53,975 --> 00:25:56,000
There's going to be a lot of training.

494
00:25:56,225 --> 00:25:57,666
It's related to your future.

495
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,841
It will be hard.

496
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,441
Are you afraid?

497
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,365
Like I will.

498
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,500
Fine. We'll start right now.

499
00:26:03,725 --> 00:26:04,650
Follow me.

500
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:05,916
Go.

501
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,666
Go.

502
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,100
Be careful.

503
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,290
OK.

504
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,391
Come on!

505
00:26:10,475 --> 00:26:11,315
Squat.

506
00:26:11,425 --> 00:26:12,041
Hold on.

507
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:13,216
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

508
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,425
Hurry up! Hurry up!

509
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,490
Maintain a constant speed.

510
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,500
Knees up.

511
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:17,625
Each gesture should meet the standard.

512
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,100
Last 30 seconds.

513
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,366
Control your speed.

514
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,391
But be careful not to get hurt.

515
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:22,325
Not bad.

516
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:24,775
Can we have another round?

517
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Keep moving, don't deform keep up.

518
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,700
Don't slow down on your hands.

519
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,825
Not bad.

520
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,850
Shoot five times

521
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,300
in a day.

522
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,875
It's almost

523
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:43,900
seventeen or eighteen hours.

524
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:45,075
Didi.

525
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,950
Tell you a thing

526
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:51,200
A colleague in the hospital asked me to be his best man.

527
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:52,900
Once every half a month.

528
00:26:54,175 --> 00:26:55,350
Half a month...

529
00:26:55,725 --> 00:26:58,291
It's said that if you've been a best man for three times,

530
00:26:58,375 --> 00:26:59,550
you won't get married.

531
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,916
It will end in March.

532
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,840
Yes.

533
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:06,566
Should I go?

534
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,241
In this case.

535
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:09,165
Yes.

536
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:10,741
Go.

537
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:11,665
Yes

538
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,975
She...

539
00:27:15,225 --> 00:27:16,625
I'll think about it.

540
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,840
OK.

541
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,800
What kind of monster training it is?

542
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,150
The international crew is reliable.

543
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:37,841
It's said that they hired

544
00:27:37,925 --> 00:27:39,500
a doctor for us,

545
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:42,175
to avoid getting hurt.

546
00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:44,591
Come on, get up and rub it for me.

547
00:27:44,675 --> 00:27:45,575
It sores.

548
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,350
I...I'm dying!

549
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:48,975
Hurry!

550
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:55,065
My god.

551
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,125
Is he the doctor or the leading actor?

552
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,425
So handsome.

553
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,140
Jinbei.

554
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,400
I'm so tired.

555
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:05,265
Jinbei.

556
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,416
You can take him if you think he's handsome.

557
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,525
I'm having a headache.

558
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,675
Honey.

559
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:28,625
Whoever you saw,

560
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,600
it's not me.

561
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,775
I think it's you.

562
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,850
Why didn't you tell me.

563
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,625
I just got the message.

564
00:28:37,975 --> 00:28:38,641
Your director

565
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:39,875
contacted our hospital,

566
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,425
and our director appointed me here.

567
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,550
That's good news!

568
00:28:46,675 --> 00:28:49,141
But now is not the time.

569
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:50,950
You saw my most foolish behavior.

570
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,375
Will you stop loving me?

571
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,800
I did see your most foolish behavior,

572
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,400
but I won't stop loving you.

573
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,066
Better news if you want to know?

574
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,700
Yes, say it.

575
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,075
It is so close to my house,

576
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,000
you can stay at mine during this period.

577
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,050
The torture of missing you for 5,184,000 seconds

578
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,240
no longer exists.

579
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,241
Are you a Wishing Pond?

580
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:17,066
Why can you realize everything for me.

581
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,041
Someone said.

582
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,825
I'm her Doraemon.

583
00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:24,700
Both.

584
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:31,600
You go training, I'll go.

585
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,840
Bye.

586
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:34,165
Bye.

587
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,200
Do as I told you.

588
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:52,550
OK, talk to you later.

589
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,740
Shiyun.

590
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:55,765
Ethan.

591
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,016
Long time no see!

592
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,966
Long time no see!

593
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,241
I didn't expect that the doctor

594
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:01,066
is you.

595
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:01,916
I didn't expect.

596
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,816
in a different field,

597
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,241
you are as extraordinary.

598
00:30:04,325 --> 00:30:04,891
let's get together sometime.

599
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:05,815
Of course.

600
00:30:07,475 --> 00:30:09,975
I've never been this tired in my life.

601
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,950
But I didn't lag behind.

602
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:14,500
All my physical fitness index,

603
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:16,825
come out on top.

604
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,900
Do you think your little fairy made a progress?

605
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:22,325
So much progress.

606
00:30:22,675 --> 00:30:24,375
You gave me a whole new impression.

607
00:30:24,675 --> 00:30:26,441
I thought,

608
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,200
it's a one-time thing.

609
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:30,500
I didn't respect that you really treat it seriously.

610
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,341
Of course.

611
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:34,600
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

612
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:37,525
No, I promised Zitong.

613
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,475
We're not depending on anyone.

614
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,325
We will get the result on our own.

615
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:42,415
With our ability.

616
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,025
You promised her?

617
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,666
If she sold you,

618
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,250
you would help her?

619
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:50,815
I tell you.

620
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,425
I've heard,

621
00:30:53,075 --> 00:30:56,475
that Gao Zitong is already playing tricks.

622
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:58,291
Bullshit!

623
00:30:58,375 --> 00:30:59,550
It's not possible.

624
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,925
You are too simple.

625
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:06,575
The medicine is ready.

626
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:08,775
Dr. Zhou is here.

627
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:09,841
Well,

628
00:31:09,925 --> 00:31:12,275
I'll go.

629
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,340
Bye.

630
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:13,966
Bye.

631
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,275
Remember what l told you?

632
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,940
Bye.

633
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,390
Bye.

634
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:24,975
Help me with this wound.

635
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,550
What's with the face?

636
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,700
I'm wounded in action.

637
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:37,250
It's for work.

638
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,750
Smile.

639
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:44,025
Go ask for leave.

640
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,425
It's just a little bruise.

641
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:48,325
It's not worth it.

642
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,216
I'll just apply some medicine.

643
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,140
I don't need to rest.

644
00:31:53,275 --> 00:31:54,350
Your wound

645
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,600
won't heal without a few days.

646
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,125
I can't...

647
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,100
My training was originally based on the elimination system.

648
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,350
If I'm gone for several days,

649
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,850
I'd rather just quit.

650
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,250
OK, just quit.

651
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,540
Alright.

652
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:13,965
OK.

653
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,566
I know you're worried about me.

654
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,250
You're afraid I can't take it.

655
00:32:17,425 --> 00:32:18,991
But since I'm here,

656
00:32:19,075 --> 00:32:20,850
I can't quit.

657
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:23,925
But your competitor.

658
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,350
is playing tricks.

659
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,725
Do you think you can win?

660
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:32,425
What?

661
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,025
Don't listen to Wu Di.

662
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,766
I'm with Zitong everyday.

663
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,025
I know her.

664
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,225
You have my words.

665
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:42,416
She's not playing tricks,

666
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,340
definitely.

667
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:50,750
Alright.

668
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,975
This time I'll take my trophy

669
00:32:54,475 --> 00:32:56,250
with my abilities.

670
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,625
Wait to be proud of me.

671
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,141
Not bad, right?

672
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:12,065
Not bad.

673
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:14,275
Zitong, you're late.

674
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,415
Come on!

675
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,650
To Alex, our casting director.

676
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,350
What are you doing? Drink.

677
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:29,525
Don't you attach great importance to the Future Woman Warrior.

678
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,041
In the future,

679
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,675
you'll need Alex's help.

680
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:36,815
Cheers.

681
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,500
Zitong is the best actress of our company.

682
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:47,125
She acts well, and has a good personality.

683
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,175
Isn't she suitable

684
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:50,400
to the movie?

685
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:54,025
The training is not finished yet.

686
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,941
I can't say.

687
00:33:57,025 --> 00:33:57,766
So far,

688
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,225
Miss Gao is doing well

689
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,975
and that Su Jinbei.

690
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,925
She's good as well.

691
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,450
I realized that the audience recognize her.

692
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:11,991
In the training,

693
00:34:12,075 --> 00:34:14,575
just try hard, Miss Gao.

694
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,575
I think there is a good chance for you.

695
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,416
It's good.

696
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,525
Come on! Cheers.

697
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:22,815
Cheers.

698
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,590
Come on.

699
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,975
Speed up.

700
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:40,241
Mind the gesture.

701
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:41,700
Squat, quickly.

702
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,291
Correct posture.

703
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,891
Speed up.

704
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:46,266
Breathe properly.

705
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,466
Punch hard.

706
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,591
Dodge, one, two.

707
00:34:48,675 --> 00:34:49,666
Dodge, good.

708
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,900
One, two.

709
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,841
Keep the speed.

710
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,550
Good...Good.

711
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,650
Left, right, dodge.

712
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:57,890
Good...Good.

713
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:59,575
Go left, right.

714
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,191
Good.

715
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:02,375
Good...Good.

716
00:35:03,775 --> 00:35:04,616
Yeah, right, right, left.

717
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,540
Right.

718
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:07,890
Good.

719
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:08,791
Once more.

720
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,225
Mind the punching speed.

721
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,225
Okay, let's move on.

722
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,890
Nice.

723
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,240
Ten,

724
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:18,415
Nine,

725
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,516
Eight,

726
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,440
Keep going.

727
00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:22,300
It's good. Good.

728
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:26,766
They are good.

729
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,350
Let's get started.

730
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,066
OK.

731
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:29,990
OK.

732
00:35:31,475 --> 00:35:33,341
All right, let's take a break!

733
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:34,600
Fall in.

734
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:38,375
Up until today,

735
00:35:38,525 --> 00:35:40,975
all the training end.

736
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,700
The director and producer

737
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,791
will give an consideration.

738
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,100
on your recent performance

739
00:35:47,925 --> 00:35:50,866
So please be here

740
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,975
at the same time tomorrow

741
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,891
I'll announce

742
00:35:53,975 --> 00:35:55,650
the final selected list.

743
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,875
Okay, you can go back early to rest!

744
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,300
Thank you very much.

745
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:03,391
Thank you.

746
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:04,315
Thanks, Coach.

747
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,050
These candidates are all great.

748
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,340
Yes.

749
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:14,791
It sores.

750
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:15,775
My waist.

751
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,166
Why isn't the doctor here?

752
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:19,716
Come on.

753
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,841
I want him to rub it for me.

754
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:21,900
Thank you, Zitong.

755
00:36:22,225 --> 00:36:23,641
Thank you!

756
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:25,575
Jinbei, you work so hard.

757
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,441
What else can I do?

758
00:36:27,525 --> 00:36:28,725
I can't be compared to you without hard work.

759
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,650
You are much better than me.

760
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,040
You didn't see?

761
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:33,375
The coach did this to you.

762
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,966
This? He did this to everyone

763
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:36,890
Go.

764
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,140
Go.

765
00:36:41,775 --> 00:36:44,100
I think that Wu Di's ex boyfriend's penitence

766
00:36:44,725 --> 00:36:46,475
had a deep influence on her,

767
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,350
and she couldn't recover from it till now.

768
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,341
I want her to relieve

769
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:52,400
and marry me with no doubts.

770
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,100
Do you think I should act?

771
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:05,000
Do you think I should act?

772
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,725
I'm asking you.

773
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,425
Why did you repeat my words?

774
00:37:09,925 --> 00:37:10,950
I want your answer.

775
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,491
I don't know the answer.

776
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:13,450
How can I give you an answer?

777
00:37:16,975 --> 00:37:18,875
Forget it, let's play.

778
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,900
You are dumb today.

779
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,800
Ethan, hello.

780
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,766
Are you free recently?

781
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:55,875
I'd like to invite you to dinner

782
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,025
If I didn't give up on medicine and became an actress.

783
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,150
The most important doctor of Chongguang Hospital,

784
00:38:07,325 --> 00:38:08,165
will be me.

785
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,350
Then I have to thank you,

786
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,991
for giving up this reputation.

787
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:11,915
Don't, please.

788
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:13,950
Stop talking about me.

789
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:15,015
How about you?

790
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:22,100
Professor Zhou.

791
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:26,025
Don't say that you invited me to dinner

792
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,550
because you miss me.

793
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,140
I...

794
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,675
Call from the crew, I have to take this.

795
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:37,715
Hey.

796
00:38:37,975 --> 00:38:39,300
Hi, Alex.

797
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,641
We're not depending on anyone.

798
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:46,800
This time I'll take my trophy

799
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:48,825
with my abilities.

800
00:38:49,525 --> 00:38:51,200
Wait to be proud of me.

801
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,200
What do you want?

802
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,175
Nothing, I just missed you.

803
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,116
Really?

804
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,040
Really.

805
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:08,315
OK.

806
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,091
The shooting crew wants me for an emergency.

807
00:39:10,175 --> 00:39:11,175
I have to go back.

808
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,700
See you.

809
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:14,841
OK.

810
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:15,765
Bye.
