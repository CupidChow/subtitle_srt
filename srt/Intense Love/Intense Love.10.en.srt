00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:36,104
=Episode 10=

3
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,433
No.

4
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:44,050
He will come back at any time.

5
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,175
I have to make a good preparation.

6
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,850
It's of no use.

7
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,475
How do you know that?

8
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:31,675
He is as cold as an iceberg.

9
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,325
Feelingless.

10
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,700
Well then I'm a big fire...

11
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,050
melting him.

12
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:43,100
I'm afraid that you will have
to scorched yourself before he melts.

13
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:46,000
At that time,
I am tender with a crispy crust...

14
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,250
beautiful enough to feast his eyes.

15
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,725
I'm so pissed off.

16
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,525
Thank you for bringing me such a play,

17
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,750
which shows that you care about me.

18
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:30,150
Don't worry.
I'll keep on trying.

19
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:41,091
Miss. Do you have a house for rent?

20
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:47,566
There are always unwanted calls
from house agents day and night.

21
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,400
Quite similar with Xiao.

22
00:05:09,862 --> 00:05:10,962
Hello?

23
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:12,850
I have a house for sale.

24
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:17,917
Note down my husband's phone number.

25
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,433
Hello.

26
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,550
AiJia agent?

27
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:30,775
I'm not ready to sell any house.

28
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,275
You have the wrong number.

29
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:41,945
Hello?

30
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,225
You again?

31
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:47,750
I have told you
that I'm not ready to sell my house.

32
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,625
It is quite baffling.
Are house agents out of minds?

33
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,258
Hey.

34
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:01,925
Again?

35
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:12,983
Su...

36
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,875
You finally come back.

37
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,625
I'll see whether you will pretend
to be aloof or not.

38
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,300
Why are you standing still?

39
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,625
Action!

40
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:16,025
Good.

41
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,200
You can't help it!

42
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:56,975
Dr. Zhou.

43
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,125
Be yourself!

44
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:03,275
How dare you to say
that you aren't tempted!

45
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:09,200
It's getting late.

46
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,183
Go to bed earlier.

47
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,342
The secretion of Dopamine and adrenaline
influences automatic nervous system,

48
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,225
thus causing rapid heartbeat.

49
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:49,200
Jiawei.

50
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,725
I thought that you had forgotten it.

51
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,933
Jiawei.

52
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,650
Actually.

53
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,600
Wang and Xiaotao won't come.

54
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,941
That's why, I asked you out.

55
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:07,858
I see.

56
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:09,658
Jiawei.

57
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:11,398
I'd like you to blow out candles.

58
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,333
Fine.

59
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,983
Zitong.

60
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:19,200
Happy birthday!

61
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:22,200
I sincerely hope that...

62
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,475
you can find your beloved.

63
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:32,608
Cut the cake.

64
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:39,025
Is this your birthday blessing to me?

65
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:42,275
Well, who am I in your eyes?

66
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,000
I just see you as one of...

67
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:46,925
my friends...

68
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:48,708
or as a sister.

69
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,383
If my behavior in the past misled you.

70
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,733
Then.

71
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,534
I'd like to make an apology for that.

72
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,733
Still.

73
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:00,950
I don't want to lose a friend...

74
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,875
who have known me for years.

75
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,725
You are my good friend.

76
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,533
Got it?

77
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:11,025
I hope you can get what I mean.

78
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:20,550
Sorry, sorry.

79
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:22,258
Oh wait...

80
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,350
Do you remember why I asked you out?

81
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,733
Just stay...

82
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:34,475
for the training of the show, alright?

83
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,600
For the sake of work.

84
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:39,450
The company has advised me...

85
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:41,623
that I don't have to participate
to the rest of the shows.

86
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,541
Why?

87
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,850
I have other schedules.

88
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,125
Well, wish you a smooth recording program.

89
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,733
Happy birthday!

90
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,426
A single man and a single woman
shared a room.

91
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,550
But the man wore Joseph's coat
without any action.

92
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:16,025
What does it mean?

93
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,183
Yeah.

94
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:21,600
Everything is ready.

95
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,100
How come I did nothing?

96
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:33,200
He is attracted to me.

97
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,375
Why didn't he show anything?

98
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,275
Even you ignore me!

99
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:58,100
This is our family heirloom
for the daughter-in-laws of Zhou family.

100
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:00,866
It had come down to your mother.

101
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,200
Your mother was supposed
to pass it to Miss Su.

102
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,250
Now you just find an opportunity
to give it to Miss Su.

103
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,925
Can you stop calling me?

104
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,025
Did he leave again?

105
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:08,000
So early, I think he's still at home.

106
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,750
What a pity! I was up all night.

107
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:50,075
Oh my gosh.

108
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:52,751
He is wearing a serious look.
He is acting genteelly.

109
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,066
There is no such person as him
who's able to cut vegetables...

110
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,825
in such graceful manner.

111
00:15:56,975 --> 00:15:59,550
He is my dream lover.

112
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,583
Oh, no.

113
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,533
Stop being a nympho.

114
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:04,725
Remember who you are!
What am I doing?

115
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:44,541
You.

116
00:16:45,975 --> 00:16:47,600
You want to rest on the couch?

117
00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:53,450
No, thanks.

118
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:58,475
I can help you.

119
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:02,525
But you can do nothing but...

120
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,125
just sit here.

121
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:08,308
No.

122
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,150
I just haven't started yet.

123
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:12,825
I can help you with those coffee beans.

124
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:14,875
Then you go to handle the toast.

125
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,075
I never thought I was short.

126
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,316
It's the first time that I feel
dwarfed by someone else.

127
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,200
I must...

128
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,550
I'll answer the door.

129
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,533
Bro.

130
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,425
Yingying? I sent you back!

131
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,466
She ran away halfway
and then caught by me.

132
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,616
What do you mean?

133
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,825
I just want to be independent.

134
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,541
So I come to the company
to look for internship.

135
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,075
Oh, stop it!

136
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:30,708
Thank you, my brother.

137
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,808
Brother. Suying.

138
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,200
Welcome.

139
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,125
You are here ah, sis.
I'm coming for...

140
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:45,800
Stop playing tricks.

141
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,325
No.

142
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,348
You must be unfamiliar
with this place at your first visit, sis.

143
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:50,983
So let me show you around.

144
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,991
Please make yourself at home
Please make yourself at home.

145
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:54,975
If you have questions.

146
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,466
If you don't know where
those seasoning are?

147
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,191
Or how to use microwave, washing
machine or floor mopping robot?

148
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:00,436
I'm open to your questions.
I promise I'll teach you in a minute.

149
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,275
You bad girl treat me as your nanny.

150
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,400
Well, I haven't been here for a long time.

151
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:09,300
And I almost forget
how this place looks like.

152
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,125
Usher me in!

153
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:15,666
This is your second brother's room.

154
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,275
It is inconvenient for girls to get in.

155
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,333
I'm his sister.
So it doesn't matter.

156
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,125
Although you are his sister.

157
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,075
Male and female have differences.

158
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,725
I'm banned to get in.

159
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:28,600
There must be something fishy.

160
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:40,275
It's normal.

161
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,625
No long hairs.

162
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:45,416
If any.

163
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,725
That ocd patient must have cleaned it up.

164
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,250
She won't go too far, really?

165
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:52,700
So what?

166
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:54,225
Bite me?

167
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,733
Shiyun.

168
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,800
I see that Miss Su
doesn't wear the earrings.

169
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:10,550
After all, it is antique.

170
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:12,525
It doesn't go with young girls.

171
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,325
I haven't given it to her yet.

172
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,475
You have lived under the same roof.

173
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,083
Shiyun.

174
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:22,850
It's not the style of Zhou Family.

175
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,125
Brother.

176
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,325
I haven't find a proper time yet.

177
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,400
Alright, find one as soon as possible.

178
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:34,508
And give it to her.

179
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:38,008
Haven't eaten yet?

180
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,475
I'm making breakfast.

181
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,875
Did a world war happen there just now?

182
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,450
What are you thinking of?

183
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,225
A fierce fight?

184
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,375
I'll tidy it up.

185
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:19,025
I'm full.

186
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,225
So am I.

187
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,600
Brother, leave it alone.

188
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,800
Go to work!

189
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,700
I'll help sister to wash the dishes.

190
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:31,125
Say that again?

191
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:32,708
Fine.

192
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:35,108
Yingying.

193
00:22:35,275 --> 00:22:36,150
Well, we got to go.

194
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:38,150
Why?

195
00:22:38,575 --> 00:22:40,100
I just live in my second brother's house.

196
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,900
Also, I want to have more time...

197
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,375
to share feelings with my sister.

198
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,383
That's right.

199
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,525
If Suying wants to stay.

200
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:55,808
Then let her be.

201
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:56,808
Yes.

202
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:59,300
Yingying. Don't be childish.

203
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:01,426
It is not convenient for her to live here.

204
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,925
Hum?

205
00:23:05,275 --> 00:23:06,550
Really?

206
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,066
It is ofcourse convenient.
Convenient.

207
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,200
Really.

208
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:12,258
Extremely.

209
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:13,408
Yes.

210
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,000
Yes.

211
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,391
You two.

212
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:29,541
Take it easy.

213
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,750
I will live with sis in harmony and peace.

214
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,200
It'd better be.

215
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,333
Stop gabbling.

216
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:39,341
Suying likes playing little tricks.

217
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:41,200
I see that Miss Su is very good-tempered.

218
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,625
There will be no problem.

219
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:44,983
Let's go.

220
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,016
-Morning, Dr. Zhou.
-Morning, Dr. Zhou.

221
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,933
Morning.

222
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,950
You are in a bad mood.

223
00:23:56,475 --> 00:23:57,825
Don't mention it.

224
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,541
I don't know what's going on.

225
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:00,800
Since last night,

226
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,116
many house agents
bombarded me with phone calls.

227
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,150
Nuts.

228
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:05,875
Why did you power it off?

229
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,325
I don't dare to do that...

230
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,991
for fear that the director
would call me with emergency.

231
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,275
If he had find my phone switched off,

232
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:14,175
he would criticize me three days
and nights like Tang Monk.

233
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,533
That's it.

234
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,525
I can't figure it out.

235
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:20,616
I had never told a house agent that
I planned to sell my apartment.

236
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,525
Neither did I register
my information online.

237
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:24,475
How come they could find me?

238
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,800
Did you pissed anyone off?

239
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,750
That's right.
There must be someone tricking me.

240
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:32,308
Zhou.

241
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,725
Help me.

242
00:24:34,225 --> 00:24:35,550
Find out my enemies.

243
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:38,725
Does director count or not?

244
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:41,608
Exactly.

245
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,525
But he is not so boring.

246
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:48,975
This enemy must be someone
I have provoked recently.

247
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:51,075
And, he harbors great hatred towards me.

248
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,450
Just do your work.

249
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:55,658
But.

250
00:24:55,825 --> 00:24:56,750
Don't follow me.

251
00:24:57,575 --> 00:24:58,925
Are you following me?

252
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,350
I can't stand you anymore.

253
00:25:01,775 --> 00:25:03,616
Tell me what do you like about me.

254
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,100
Can't I change it?

255
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,000
Gosh.

256
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:09,000
I know who it is?

257
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,850
Oh, a woman
can do anything if she goes mad.

258
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,750
Don't worry.
I will live with sis in harmony and peace.

259
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,616
Hey, brother.

260
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,409
You just separated from sis for a while,
and your calling again.

261
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:42,550
You are so lovey-dovey.

262
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,342
Why are you picking up
the phone? Where is Jinbei?

263
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:47,391
Sis is too busy to answer the phone.

264
00:25:47,475 --> 00:25:48,308
Put it in speaker.

265
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:50,761
Hello, Dr. Zhou.

266
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm busy now.

267
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,725
How about my looking for you later?

268
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,183
Hurry up.

269
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:07,400
You see.

270
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,141
I want to make him soup.

271
00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:11,175
Is this a good idea?

272
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,475
Of course it is.

273
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,350
A vivid picture is crossing my mind.

274
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:19,713
Sis, bring your hand-made chicken soup
to him in the hospital.

275
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:23,725
Then he will have the soup
in front of his colleagues.

276
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:26,475
Then he must be really happy.

277
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,008
What are you doing?

278
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,866
I just poured some mineral water into it.

279
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,275
It is perfect.

280
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:48,750
I came up with the idea myself.

281
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,950
I don't think she can fool me.

282
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:52,608
Yingying.

283
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:55,500
Is the formula okay?

284
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:56,625
No problem.

285
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,925
We browsed it online together.

286
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:03,066
-OK, OK.
-Well, I trust you.

287
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,141
Of course.

288
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:05,058
Ignite it.

289
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:14,975
That's it.

290
00:27:19,775 --> 00:27:21,400
Amazing.

291
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,125
Make a bowl of it.

292
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,208
-Have a try.
-You have a try.

293
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:41,308
What do you think?

294
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,900
-Nice.
-I bet it is.

295
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:45,150
I call you a car, sis.

296
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,131
Hi.

297
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:57,675
You arrived?

298
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,450
Well, I'll be right there.

299
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:03,908
Come on, sis.

300
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:05,925
Wait a moment.

301
00:28:06,425 --> 00:28:07,875
I'm going to get my clothes changed.

302
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,983
OK

303
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:38,991
Let's go.

304
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:41,116
It's your sweet moment.

305
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,575
I won't go.

306
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:45,491
Alright. I will reward you.

307
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:47,476
-Bye.
-Bye, sis.

308
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:49,000
Safe trip.

309
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:50,125
Good luck.

310
00:28:58,975 --> 00:29:00,400
Sorry.

311
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,150
Luck won't befall you.

312
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,008
What's wrong?

313
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,350
Is your leg fractured?

314
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:27,141
I'm still a little way from you.
The car didn't crash into you.

315
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:29,125
Oops, don't drag me.

316
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:31,350
Let me go.

317
00:29:31,475 --> 00:29:33,000
Let go of my legs.

318
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,216
You.

319
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,175
Aunt.

320
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,875
The car didn't crash into you.
Stop acting.

321
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,900
Hey, lady.
You should bear me out.

322
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:40,858
I didn't hit her.

323
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:43,325
If you keep doing this.
We'll call the police.

324
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:44,616
Don't go too far.

325
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,725
Come on, take it.

326
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:47,125
Why did you give her money?

327
00:29:47,425 --> 00:29:49,675
Lady, forget it.
It's better to save trouble.

328
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:51,208
Let's go.

329
00:30:06,575 --> 00:30:08,100
Boss, done.

330
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,300
It's wonderful!

331
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,533
Come in.

332
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:17,425
Surprise!

333
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,200
Why are you here?

334
00:30:19,575 --> 00:30:20,800
I know you are working hard.

335
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:22,550
So I cooked chicken soup for you.

336
00:30:23,475 --> 00:30:25,550
-Please.
-You needn't have bothered to do that.

337
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,375
So eat it or not?

338
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,733
Yes.

339
00:30:32,675 --> 00:30:33,650
It is still hot.

340
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,783
Zhou.

341
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:42,450
Wow here comes the superstar.

342
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:46,275
Chicken soup?

343
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,025
You have put too much salt in it.

344
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,900
Come on, ready to go topping the tower!

345
00:31:02,775 --> 00:31:03,675
Perfect!

346
00:31:05,225 --> 00:31:06,825
I have something urgent, I got to go.

347
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,325
My dear is back!

348
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,200
Well, how did my second bother
think of your chicken soup?

349
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,725
Don't mention it.

350
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,600
Too much salt. Too salty.

351
00:31:19,685 --> 00:31:21,491
Your brother threw it up
the moment he had a sip of it.

352
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:23,908
He accused me of
playing games with him.

353
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,225
He has gone too far.

354
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:29,175
You cooked it for him.

355
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,701
How come he didn't know chalk from cheese.

356
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,250
Oh, that is.

357
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,400
But.

358
00:31:35,775 --> 00:31:37,000
It is so strange.

359
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,850
How come the soup became too salty?

360
00:31:39,975 --> 00:31:42,800
I had tasted it before leaving.

361
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,200
Why?

362
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,350
I have no idea.

363
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,750
Really?

364
00:31:52,425 --> 00:31:54,675
Well, just make a guess.

365
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,925
Did someone do something bad to it?

366
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,975
Are you kidding?

367
00:32:03,175 --> 00:32:04,800
Who is most suspicious?

368
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,525
There was no good timing at all.

369
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,058
Right?

370
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:09,242
Stop playing dumb with me!

371
00:32:09,575 --> 00:32:10,700
I am an actress.

372
00:32:11,075 --> 00:32:11,908
Your acting is poor.

373
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,800
What... what do you mean?

374
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:18,291
I know everything.

375
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:21,291
The car driver, the blackmailing woman
were arranged by you.

376
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,809
The soup was ruined
after I got off the car.

377
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:27,216
I don't know what are you talking about?

378
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,667
Give me your phone.
I'll check the taxi-hailing record.

379
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,725
No record at all?

380
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,225
You did it on purpose.

381
00:32:46,575 --> 00:32:48,375
I know you dislike me.

382
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,725
But you can play tricks on me
not your brother.

383
00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:55,700
How come I did that?

384
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,391
I didn't say anything bad
about you to your brother.

385
00:32:59,475 --> 00:33:01,625
I just told him that
I'm not good at cooking.

386
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:03,325
He didn't blame me.

387
00:33:09,475 --> 00:33:10,925
We are family.

388
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,175
So could you please stop
making troubles in the future.

389
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,208
Deal?

390
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,875
Alright.

391
00:33:18,975 --> 00:33:20,050
Well, enjoy yourself.

392
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:22,800
I'll go upstairs waiting till your
brother come back and cook then.

393
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,850
This isn't over.

394
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,475
You wish!

395
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,150
You're back!

396
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:54,925
Is your heart beating fast?

397
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,350
Wait and see, you will be melted
by me sooner or later.

398
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:13,425
Really?

399
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:32,625
Your every move can't escape my eyes.

400
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,800
Baby.

401
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:39,825
What?

402
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:16,250
It's a dark night.

403
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,700
The stars are dim.

404
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:21,208
Brother.

405
00:35:21,475 --> 00:35:23,341
I just found a good movie.

406
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:25,425
You want to join me?

407
00:36:07,225 --> 00:36:08,225
Go to bed.

408
00:36:15,975 --> 00:36:16,808
Good night.

409
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,275
I want to sleep.

410
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,066
Wu Di. Open the door.

411
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,800
I bought some night snacks.
Want to join me?

412
00:37:46,653 --> 00:37:47,486
Wu Di.

413
00:37:47,903 --> 00:37:49,353
I heard you came back.

414
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:52,378
Finish them quickly and go to bed early.
Tomorrow is a workday.

415
00:37:53,353 --> 00:37:54,186
Wu Di.

416
00:37:56,053 --> 00:37:57,678
Since you know that.

417
00:37:57,928 --> 00:37:59,403
So will you stop it?

418
00:37:59,953 --> 00:38:01,661
-I just want...
-Shut up.

419
00:38:01,853 --> 00:38:03,853
We will never be a couple!

420
00:38:05,353 --> 00:38:07,028
I see, how about the night snacks?

421
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:08,986
You keep it.

422
00:38:19,228 --> 00:38:20,528
That's not the same!

423
00:38:21,178 --> 00:38:24,878
Then you can enjoy the romance
with that Julie or Jolie.

424
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:30,187
Since I can't afford to annoy you.

425
00:38:30,953 --> 00:38:32,203
I have been trying to ward off you.

426
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:06,203
Baby, are you asleep?

427
00:39:12,803 --> 00:39:14,828
Baby, are you asleep?

428
00:39:18,228 --> 00:39:19,061
Not yet.

429
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:24,753
Do you miss me?

430
00:39:31,053 --> 00:39:31,886
Yes!

431
00:39:34,428 --> 00:39:37,103
Yes but you'd better go to bed.

432
00:39:41,853 --> 00:39:43,628
How about going out to date?

433
00:39:45,178 --> 00:39:46,228
Date?

434
00:39:48,378 --> 00:39:49,478
Go to the attic upstairs.
