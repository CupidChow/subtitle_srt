3
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:15,680
Honey, I...

4
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:25,752
I come here because
I want to explain to you.

5
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:30,511
You don't have to do so.

6
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,021
I wouldn't have said that thing...

7
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:36,287
if I had known who you are
when I was in the hospital.

8
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,734
Also, you didn't show up
in our engagement party.

9
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:40,725
I was so furious so I said that.

10
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:43,555
I have already forgotten
what I exactly said.

11
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:44,492
It's true!

12
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,175
I swear!

13
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,880
Never mind. I see.

14
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,800
Well, how come you walked away without me?

15
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,800
I really had to deal with
something in hospital.

16
00:05:57,662 --> 00:05:58,502
I don't buy it.

17
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:03,650
Okay.
Actually, what has happened recently...

18
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:06,550
really bothered me.

19
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:08,451
What?

20
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,280
Well, we do quite different jobs,

21
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:13,526
so I don't know if
we will be happy together.

22
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:15,950
How could you say so?

23
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:19,533
I'm just thinking that
when you are in need,

24
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:21,040
I may not be by your side.

25
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:24,800
And I seems to make troubles
to your job.

26
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:30,409
Well, honey, I got your point.

27
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,170
Don't worry.

28
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,330
I will always support your career,

29
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:35,807
because I know,

30
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,037
besides me,

31
00:06:37,078 --> 00:06:38,853
there are still many people
who need your help.

32
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,760
Well, I and my job are to blame for...

33
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,200
recent events
or other things bothering your life.

34
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,200
But things like these may
happen again in the future.

35
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:52,024
Honey.

36
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,080
Are you afraid?

37
00:06:58,895 --> 00:06:59,735
No, I'm not afraid.

38
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:02,000
The moment I saw you,

39
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:03,336
I was afraid of nothing.

40
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:07,395
Oh, honey, you are so sweet.

41
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:12,721
I left suddenly that day.

42
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,954
I'm sorry.

43
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:16,760
I've forgiven you.

44
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,504
But my parents...

45
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,709
Later,

46
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,250
I'll apologize to uncle and aunt.

47
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:27,881
By the way, who sent you that video?

48
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,038
I have no idea.

49
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,004
I'm still investigating.

50
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,720
Maybe it is a hoax.

51
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:36,440
I'll take care of it.

52
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:38,203
Forget it.

53
00:07:39,327 --> 00:07:41,477
Let it go! Okay?

54
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:42,358
Okay.

55
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:45,160
Come on. Let's go for breakfast.

56
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:47,520
Let me put on another pair of shoes.

57
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:53,291
These are so dirty?

58
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:56,144
I've only worn these a few times.

59
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:10,881
They are not so good.

60
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,665
Why?

61
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:24,861
Well, this pair is okay.

62
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,190
Okay.

63
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,460
Honey.

64
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:37,361
Are you okay with the food here?

65
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,576
You have to cook for yourself?

66
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:40,730
No, Tingting will prepare meals.

67
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:41,611
Who is it?

68
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,864
She is the only college student here.

69
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:46,489
You are saying nice words about her.

70
00:08:58,325 --> 00:08:59,568
Pay attention to your wound
and keep it dry.

71
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:02,361
-Okay.
-Have a good rest.

72
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,426
Don't move around.

73
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,364
Be careful!

74
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:10,343
Take it easy.

75
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,360
Be careful, support him with hands!

76
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:23,043
What are these?

77
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,835
Tents for supplies.

78
00:09:30,597 --> 00:09:32,031
Professor Zhou is back
with his girlfriend.

79
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,375
We are going to have
breakfast with a super star?

80
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,134
I desperately want to
take a picture with her!

81
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:39,015
Hello, Ms. Su.

82
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,060
You've been working very hard,
come on and have a breakfast.

83
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:42,200
Okay, come on.

84
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,215
Sit down here.

85
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:56,021
Are you cold?

86
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:56,902
I'm okay.

87
00:09:58,575 --> 00:09:59,550
-Come here.
-Here it is.

88
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:00,541
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

89
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:01,682
I want to sit here.

90
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:02,991
Xiaoyue, come here.

91
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,400
-Professor Zhou have an extra boiled egg.
-Humph...

92
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:16,476
Professor has been working so hard,

93
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:18,040
so he deserves the extra egg.

94
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:19,126
That's it!

95
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:20,232
You eat it.

96
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,423
I don't want to eat it.

97
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:22,604
I'm not hungry.

98
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:25,249
Professor, I'm hungry!

99
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,150
Come on!

100
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,691
Professor, you really
make a pet of your girlfriend.

101
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:30,700
-No wonder that you can get Ms. Su.
-Yeah.

102
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,601
We've never thought that Professor Zhou
could be so gentle and considerate.

103
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:35,328
Xiaoyao, you see.

104
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:36,539
Our teacher is an expert.

105
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:38,800
Watch and learn that's it.

106
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,271
Xiaoyue, I'm not hungry either.

107
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:42,496
Or you can have my breakfast.

108
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:43,451
Who wants?

109
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:46,520
Just have your breakfast.

110
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:47,578
You have a lot work to do.

111
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:52,752
Would it be all right?

112
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:54,487
What do you mean?

113
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,740
It's a special breakfast for you.

114
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,760
Is that okay if I eat it?

115
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:59,400
Don't talk nonsense!

116
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:01,959
Okay, I'll eat it.

117
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,840
Eat it up.

118
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:06,937
You'd better slow down!
Be careful not to choke!

119
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:09,453
Do your own business.

120
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:12,083
The steamed buns are too dry.
It almost choked me!

121
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:12,964
Yes, yes.

122
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:15,973
Xiaoyue, have some more.

123
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:19,127
Just have your breakfast!

124
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:49,840
Clench it tightly.

125
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:54,521
It's much useful than aromatherapy.

126
00:12:57,102 --> 00:12:58,127
That's not the same!

127
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,639
So when you asked him what he's up to,

128
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,705
he said it was work?

129
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,990
Yeah.

130
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,040
Congratulations.

131
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:14,190
Let me know if you have any thoughts.

132
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:15,071
Just leave it to me.

133
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:16,900
Don't worry.

134
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,684
Won't that be too much bother?

135
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:19,565
It's not a big deal.

136
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,884
Didi, Didi, give me a chance to explain.

137
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:28,119
What?

138
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:29,555
You just got Dr. Xiao and I wrong.

139
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:31,120
It's not what you think.

140
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:32,561
It's so obvious.

141
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,561
I don't have to think about it.

142
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:35,805
What do you mean?

143
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:38,171
Well, calm down!

144
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:40,523
It is all my fault.

145
00:13:40,564 --> 00:13:41,404
My fault.

146
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:44,543
Didi.

147
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:47,030
There is nothing to do with Julie.

148
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:49,554
You are talking for her!

149
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:52,915
Xiao Yuansong!

150
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:56,461
I never got you wrong!

151
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,685
Didi, you really took it wrong.

152
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:07,200
Ms. Wu, your birthday is coming.

153
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:17,207
Dr. Xiao just wants to give you
a surprise for the last time,

154
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:18,148
so he came to me.

155
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:21,427
Because he said
he messed your date up last time.

156
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,121
In order to make up for that,

157
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,737
he planned to give you a nice birthday.

158
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:32,441
Hold on! What does that mean?

159
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:33,481
For the last time?

160
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,967
How long are you going to
hide it from her?

161
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,040
Do you still think misunderstandings
are more than enough?

162
00:14:41,728 --> 00:14:42,662
What are you hiding from me?

163
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:47,782
Tell me.

164
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:54,000
Dr. Xiao is diagnosed with fatal illness.

165
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:12,436
Why don't you tell me the truth?

166
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:16,023
Because I don't want to upset you.

167
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,560
I just want...

168
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,772
to spend my last days with you happily.

169
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:26,318
Stop saying that.

170
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,040
You are a doctor,

171
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:38,560
you can get yourself cured, am I right?

172
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:42,257
We shouldn't give up.

173
00:15:46,142 --> 00:15:47,400
Say something!

174
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:53,844
There is a slim chance.

175
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:56,607
Also...

176
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,930
it's painful to receive dialysis.

177
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,660
I don't want to torture myself.

178
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:19,263
So.

179
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:22,000
You want to see me...

180
00:16:23,372 --> 00:16:25,347
die in pain,

181
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:32,585
or see me just lie in bed with my life...

182
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:35,160
fading away...

183
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:37,897
and draining away...

184
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:41,238
without any esteem...

185
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:44,880
and hope.

186
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,080
I just at my last grasp.

187
00:16:58,205 --> 00:16:59,255
Shut up!

188
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,480
I don't have much time left.

189
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:14,785
Don't waste time on any sorrow, okay?

190
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:25,294
I said...

191
00:17:29,034 --> 00:17:32,760
I just want to spend my last days
with you gaily.

192
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:38,904
Do you have any wish to be fulfilled?

193
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,578
I'm with you!

194
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:44,998
Really?

195
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:46,057
Of course.

196
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,991
Any wish?

197
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:05,199
Can you see it clearly, sir?

198
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,161
Could you give me a massage
a little longer, Mengmeng?

199
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:08,042
Here I am.

200
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,617
You just take it according
to the instructions.

201
00:18:10,391 --> 00:18:11,682
And look it's back,

202
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,558
here are some notes.

203
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,465
Put it over there.

204
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:15,769
Yeah.

205
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,758
Okay, wait a moment, let me check it.

206
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,713
Okay.

207
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:18,929
Everything is okay here.

208
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:22,669
Shiyun.

209
00:18:24,628 --> 00:18:27,228
Is Su Jinbei your girlfriend?

210
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:29,563
She is my fiancee.

211
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:35,003
So.

212
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:38,117
She must care about you, doesn't she?

213
00:18:38,906 --> 00:18:39,746
She?

214
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,410
Yeah.

215
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:47,744
I think she must really care about you.

216
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:50,823
As a superstar,
she traveled long distance...

217
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,410
and even risked her life
coming to the small village.

218
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:56,040
She did that just for you.

219
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,640
I won't put her at risk any more?

220
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:04,695
Well, what if there is someone
like her caring about you...

221
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:06,086
and willingly risking her life?

222
00:19:22,302 --> 00:19:23,144
Sis Jinbei.

223
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:24,710
How did you and Dr. Zhou
get to know each other?

224
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:27,044
Well, we met in the hospital.

225
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:28,880
He was reserved at that time.

226
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:30,200
Hey, Tingting.

227
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,481
But, Sis Jinbei,

228
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:34,716
I've never seen that panicky
look in Dr. Zhou's face.

229
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,445
It just like that the sky is falling.

230
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:38,944
Yeah.
Dr. Zhou is always composed.

231
00:19:38,985 --> 00:19:39,870
It's over-exaggerated.

232
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,016
It's definitely true.

233
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:45,535
I think Dr. Zhou is going to kill a person
if something bad happens to you.

234
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:47,044
Who's going to kill a person?

235
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,481
Dr. Zhou, we're back.

236
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,563
I'm chatting with Sis Jinbei, Dr. Zhou.

237
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:53,229
So you think I should commend you...

238
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,580
and write positive comments
into your internship report?

239
00:19:54,621 --> 00:19:55,724
Sorry, Dr. Zhou.

240
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:57,000
We'll go for work.

241
00:19:57,424 --> 00:19:58,264
Let's go.

242
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:17,597
Sorry.

243
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:19,561
Zitong is going to use the green room.

244
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:20,768
Just go elsewhere to have you meal.

245
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:22,997
I...

246
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:45,513
The show is over finally.

247
00:20:45,835 --> 00:20:47,020
You've working so hard, Sis Zitong.

248
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,086
Have a look at this.

249
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,049
No pain, no gain.

250
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:52,931
Now we've gotten our rewards.

251
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,635
I've never thought that we can
got the top brand endorsement.

252
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,650
What happened?

253
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,485
Gao Zitong is inside.

254
00:21:05,551 --> 00:21:06,551
Well, let's go out for dinner.

255
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:10,009
Can we make it? We
have work to do tonight.

256
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:11,927
Just go and back as soon as possible.

257
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,428
We can go back.

258
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:30,756
You finished your work?

259
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:32,117
Okay.

260
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:35,260
My honey and I can be together,
just two of us!

261
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,644
Are you feel cold with your hands?

262
00:21:37,372 --> 00:21:38,220
I'm okay.

263
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,109
Roll down your sleeves.

264
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:39,990
Dr. Zhou.

265
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:41,869
Dr. Zhou.

266
00:21:42,697 --> 00:21:44,047
Is Tingting here?

267
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:45,795
Tingting is gone.

268
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:48,136
Yeah, she came out at
noon and hasn't been back yet.

269
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:49,870
Uncle Liu, calm down.

270
00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:51,575
Let's think about where Tingting would go.

271
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:53,378
That's right, Uncle Liu.
Calm down.

272
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:55,235
We'll help you to find her.
Tingting will be okay.

273
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,441
I have searched every place she could go,

274
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:58,931
but there is no sign of her.

275
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,034
Where is she?

276
00:22:01,457 --> 00:22:02,297
No, no.

277
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:07,858
Did you see Tingting at noon?

278
00:22:08,085 --> 00:22:09,660
And did you feel
something strange with her?

279
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,460
Shiyun.
Where are you going, Shiyun?

280
00:22:13,977 --> 00:22:14,911
I'm going down the mountain.

281
00:22:15,156 --> 00:22:16,606
Pick up your friend?

282
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,521
-Yeah.
-A very important friend?

283
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:23,403
Very important.

284
00:22:24,107 --> 00:22:25,966
What if there is someone
like her caring about you...

285
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:27,232
and willingly risking her life?

286
00:22:30,972 --> 00:22:32,222
She talked about you with me.

287
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,320
Me?

288
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,235
What did she say?

289
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,079
She said,

290
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:40,064
she can see that you really care about me.

291
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:45,268
Then she asked
what if there is someone like you...

292
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:48,669
caring about me
and willingly risked her life for me.

293
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:51,042
Well, what did you say?

294
00:22:52,175 --> 00:22:55,910
I said that you are always on my mind
and nobody can replace you.

295
00:22:58,023 --> 00:22:59,039
You really said so?

296
00:23:01,321 --> 00:23:05,671
Honey, I'm really happy for that.

297
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:07,188
But...

298
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:12,885
your words may upset that little girl.

299
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:17,320
I can tell that she has
a special feeling towards you.

300
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:18,923
How can we live without her?

301
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:19,840
I'm so afraid.

302
00:23:20,685 --> 00:23:22,235
Does she hurt herself?

303
00:23:23,662 --> 00:23:25,680
Oh no, we'd better find her.

304
00:23:27,993 --> 00:23:30,515
Guys, let's find Tingting separately.

305
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:32,185
-Okay.
-Okay.

306
00:23:32,235 --> 00:23:33,269
Take the flashlights, let's go.

307
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:34,441
-Okay.
-Go! Go! Go!

308
00:23:34,482 --> 00:23:35,329
Follow me, Beibei.

309
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,210
Okay.

310
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:41,823
Tingting.

311
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:42,704
Tingting.

312
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:44,309
Tingting.

313
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:46,284
Tingting.

314
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:50,546
Tingting.

315
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:51,598
Tingting.

316
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,613
Tingting.

317
00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:54,285
-Tingting.
-Tingting.

318
00:23:55,035 --> 00:23:56,635
-Tingting.
-Tingting.

319
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,202
Do you see her over there?

320
00:23:58,243 --> 00:23:59,083
No.

321
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:02,200
You guys go and find her over there.
Okay.

322
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,470
Let's look this way.

323
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:04,655
-Alright.
-Hurry up.

324
00:24:04,696 --> 00:24:06,319
-Tingting.
-Tingting.

325
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:07,947
-Tingting.
-Tingting.

326
00:24:08,335 --> 00:24:09,653
Tingting.

327
00:24:09,967 --> 00:24:11,418
Tingting.

328
00:24:11,957 --> 00:24:13,160
Tingting.

329
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:18,045
Tingting.

330
00:24:19,735 --> 00:24:20,960
Tingting.

331
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,265
There is no sign of her.

332
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:25,319
Is she here?

333
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:27,153
May be not here.

334
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:29,427
Let's find elsewhere.

335
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,792
Go.

336
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:37,556
Be careful!

337
00:24:38,672 --> 00:24:39,512
Tingting.

338
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:40,635
Tingting.

339
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:45,484
Tingting.

340
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:48,281
Tingting.

341
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:51,314
Tingting.

342
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:52,827
Tingting.

343
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:56,246
Be careful.

344
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:57,837
Tingting.

345
00:24:58,028 --> 00:24:58,868
Tingting.

346
00:25:00,956 --> 00:25:02,400
I think I should not come.

347
00:25:03,505 --> 00:25:04,354
Don't say that.

348
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:05,310
If I didn't come here,

349
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:08,210
she wouldn't see me with you
and she wouldn't be angry.

350
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:10,271
But honey,

351
00:25:10,312 --> 00:25:11,871
you've just came here for two days.

352
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:12,765
How come she...

353
00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:14,106
We've known each other for three years.

354
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:15,814
For three years?

355
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:19,614
She has had a secret crush on you
for three years?

356
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:23,552
Well, that makes sense.

357
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:27,440
Of course she can't accept the truth that
her beloved has a fiancee.

358
00:25:29,146 --> 00:25:30,313
She will know that sooner or later.

359
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:33,546
Tingting.

360
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,600
Don't panic. It's just a squirrel.

361
00:25:42,303 --> 00:25:44,040
Ah, a squirrel.

362
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:46,227
I thought that might be a weasel.

363
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:49,129
Chill out!

364
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:51,048
I'll protect you.

365
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,360
Tingting.

366
00:25:57,628 --> 00:25:58,468
Tingting.

367
00:26:03,207 --> 00:26:04,143
How about your feet?

368
00:26:04,184 --> 00:26:05,064
I... I'm okay.

369
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,119
I'm just not used to flats
because I always wear high-heeled shoes.

370
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,940
Here you are.

371
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:16,005
Take it.

372
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,610
Come on. Let me carry you.

373
00:26:21,304 --> 00:26:22,144
I...

374
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:29,599
You take the flashlight.

375
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,465
Tingting.

376
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:35,852
Tingting.

377
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:36,970
Tingting.

378
00:26:40,777 --> 00:26:41,881
Listen, the telephone is ringing.

379
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:42,761
Here.

380
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:45,026
Tingting is back home.

381
00:26:47,097 --> 00:26:48,047
Tingting is back home.

382
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:49,213
It's wonderful!

383
00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:51,950
It's wonderful!

384
00:26:53,514 --> 00:26:54,439
Well, let's go back.

385
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,287
Let's go.

386
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:03,891
Honey.

387
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:06,521
Since things have settled perfectly,

388
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:09,885
can you tell me the story
about you and Tingting.

389
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:13,019
Well, I came here for
gratuitous treatment three years ago...

390
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,160
and heard about her story.

391
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:17,987
She just got her offer of university then,

392
00:27:18,028 --> 00:27:19,728
but her family can't
support her education,

393
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,347
so I gave her financial support.

394
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,344
So you are her benefactor...

395
00:27:26,385 --> 00:27:29,369
and... you are...

396
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,800
a handsome man with successful career.

397
00:27:31,157 --> 00:27:33,320
If I were her
I would also fall in love with you.

398
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,960
She likes me, but I don't like her.

399
00:27:36,814 --> 00:27:41,810
Could you tell me
why did you choose to finance her?

400
00:27:42,785 --> 00:27:46,485
I just didn't want to see a young girl
lose her only chance to change her life.

401
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:49,187
That's it.

402
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:52,306
It's not easy for her to become...

403
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:53,466
the only college student in
such a mountainous area.

404
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:55,325
Are you...

405
00:27:57,283 --> 00:27:58,360
jealous?

406
00:27:59,995 --> 00:28:01,360
No.

407
00:28:01,631 --> 00:28:02,689
You are so nice to me,

408
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,855
so I won't envy a little girl.

409
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,340
Let's go.

410
00:28:15,645 --> 00:28:16,820
I'm just AJ.

411
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:19,826
Okay, that's all for now.

412
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,174
Nice job.

413
00:28:21,461 --> 00:28:22,961
Go to have a rest, Jiawei.

414
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:24,593
Thank you very much.

415
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:34,612
Jiawei.

416
00:28:41,756 --> 00:28:42,669
Have a drink.

417
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,550
Thank you.

418
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:16,073
What are the odds!

419
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,344
I find you here when
I just popped up in the game.

420
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:20,423
There is a tacit agreement.

421
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:23,475
Let's play a round of game.

422
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:24,356
Okay.

423
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,320
The cellphone signal is bad.

424
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,960
What the hell?

425
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:55,234
Are you playing games?

426
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:57,381
No.

427
00:29:58,419 --> 00:29:59,600
Why are you hiding your cellphone if not?

428
00:30:01,073 --> 00:30:02,048
I...

429
00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:05,920
You are forbidden to play
games during work time.

430
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,344
So you may steal a horse
while I may not look over the hedge.

431
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,092
Why did you drop off?

432
00:30:48,535 --> 00:30:51,160
I was scolded by my cruel boss.

433
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:56,600
You should fire such cruel boss.

434
00:30:59,498 --> 00:31:00,560
Not that serious.

435
00:31:01,213 --> 00:31:03,240
Sometimes he is gentle.

436
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,200
Okay, spare his life.

437
00:31:08,925 --> 00:31:09,825
Well, let's get it started.

438
00:31:11,158 --> 00:31:11,998
Okay.

439
00:31:22,108 --> 00:31:23,008
Hurry up.

440
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:27,438
We won.

441
00:31:39,923 --> 00:31:41,798
Xiaozhou, let's have some night snack.

442
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:45,891
You've changed since you won a game.

443
00:31:47,928 --> 00:31:48,828
What are you talking about?

444
00:31:50,957 --> 00:31:51,807
Alright.

445
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,619
Come on, have some ginger soup.

446
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,500
Don't catch a cold.

447
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,410
Thank you, honey.

448
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:11,280
It will become chronic sprain
if you get hurt again,

449
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:13,708
so try to stop wearing high-heel shoes.

450
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:15,120
Oh, hell no.

451
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:16,661
It's my hobby to collect high heels.

452
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:17,893
And...

453
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,620
I look gorgeous when I wear high heels.

454
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:23,719
I see, try to reduce the frequency, okay?

455
00:32:29,624 --> 00:32:30,560
You keep it.

456
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:32,111
It's cold in mountainous area.

457
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:33,320
And tuck yourself in.

458
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
Where are you going to sleep?

459
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,410
I just sleep with Xiaoyao
and others for one night.

460
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:45,759
Beibei.

461
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:47,884
I have something for you.

462
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,060
What?

463
00:33:04,575 --> 00:33:05,415
Here you are.

464
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:06,423
What is it?

465
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:08,105
Open and see.

466
00:33:09,327 --> 00:33:10,202
Okay.

467
00:33:14,964 --> 00:33:16,989
Wow, it's a pair of jade earring studs.

468
00:33:17,385 --> 00:33:18,225
Do you like it?

469
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:19,894
Of course.

470
00:33:20,036 --> 00:33:21,203
Well, let me help you to put it on.

471
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,170
Okay.

472
00:33:41,808 --> 00:33:42,933
Does it hurt?

473
00:33:43,797 --> 00:33:44,637
No.

474
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:57,400
How does it look?

475
00:33:57,803 --> 00:33:58,920
Pretty good.

476
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:03,184
Honey.

477
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,155
Why do you give me a present suddenly?

478
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,785
I have long wanted to give them to you.

479
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,690
Why now?

480
00:34:11,351 --> 00:34:13,200
I didn't find the best time,

481
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:15,416
so I just dragged my feet.

482
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,314
Till yesterday night,

483
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:24,560
I was so afraid that
I would have no such chance.

484
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,480
Sorry to worry you.

485
00:34:30,355 --> 00:34:31,360
Fine.

486
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:34,509
Promise me.

487
00:34:35,445 --> 00:34:36,845
Don't scare me like that again.

488
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:38,479
Okay, I promise.

489
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:35,669
You should work hard
when you are on duty, honey.

490
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,685
Don't miss me too much.

491
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:38,311
Okay.

492
00:35:40,477 --> 00:35:41,852
Are you serious?

493
00:35:41,893 --> 00:35:42,733
No.

494
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:44,733
Will you miss me?

495
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:46,955
-I...
-Yes or No?

496
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:47,971
Yes!

497
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:55,279
That's it?

498
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,785
Or what else?

499
00:36:14,035 --> 00:36:15,310
Here is a rice grain.

500
00:36:16,572 --> 00:36:17,997
You trick me!

501
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:19,341
You heartless little rascal.

502
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:20,602
Beware of your leg.

503
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:22,050
No.

504
00:36:22,903 --> 00:36:23,920
Don't go!

505
00:36:24,075 --> 00:36:25,610
-Carry me!
-Mind your leg!

506
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,321
I'll hop along and catch you.

507
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:30,360
-Okay, okay.
-Stay and carry me.

508
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,560
Come on.

509
00:36:31,601 --> 00:36:32,441
Go away.

510
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:33,687
Come on and catch me!

511
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:35,419
You're tricking me!

512
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,160
Well, okay...
I have got to go.

513
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:39,695
-Tingting.
-Tingting.

514
00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:40,575
I...

515
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,316
Sorry.

516
00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:43,197
I...

517
00:36:43,338 --> 00:36:46,251
I'm here to say... to say...

518
00:36:47,231 --> 00:36:48,681
Sorry to trouble you
for my naive behavior.

519
00:36:49,194 --> 00:36:51,720
Sorry to make you worried about me.

520
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:53,543
Never mind.

521
00:36:53,817 --> 00:36:54,800
I'm glad that you're fine.

522
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:58,342
And if we didn't walk out,

523
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,040
we would never find
the beauty of nature here.

524
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:05,599
He's going to go for work,

525
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,970
leaving me here on my own,

526
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:09,311
so could you stay here to talk with me.

527
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:10,673
Let's go.
