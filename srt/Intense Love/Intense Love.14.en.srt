00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:36,160
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,512
I'm telling you...

4
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:38,691
You mom's generous.

5
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:39,572
Come here.

6
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:42,978
Mom.

7
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,047
Now that we're eating outside.

8
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:47,040
Let's put fresh stuff into the fridge.

9
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:47,921
Okay.

10
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:55,419
Take it.

11
00:01:57,627 --> 00:01:58,940
Put the cabbage on the upper layer.

12
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:02,764
And this.

13
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,542
I have a shocking
material of your fiancee.

14
00:02:12,493 --> 00:02:13,333
Okay.

15
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:30,120
Have a look of your fiancee's true color.

16
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,972
Just chase him and then dump him.

17
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:59,185
Revenge him for absence
from the engagement party.

18
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,740
Yeah.

19
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:02,893
He even brought you
home for ancestor worship.

20
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:05,301
Wouldn't it be nice to stop?

21
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:08,720
It's not the right time.

22
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:11,428
But when?

23
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:13,598
Do you mean it is a joke
to went home with him?

24
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,479
Of course.

25
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,928
Maybe
he'll accompany me to go home someday.

26
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,240
You told me to focus on acting.

27
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,015
I'm just going to practice on him.

28
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,587
-I could have assumed that the marriage
-did not exist at all.

29
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:29,183
You know exactly who I am.

30
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,568
But you're not good for me
when I was attacked.

31
00:03:31,657 --> 00:03:33,389
You threatened to break
off our engagement.

32
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:34,991
Dr. Zhou.

33
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,224
Your attitude towards the engagement.

34
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,416
I think I understand quite well.

35
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:42,120
That gentleman is my new driver.

36
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:44,503
I forgot to tell him I have a live today.

37
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:46,623
I'm so sorry.
Alright, let's go on.

38
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,260
It's hard for an ordinary person
to date a star.

39
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,880
What you'll go through
is far more than what you imagine.

40
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:56,498
Above all.

41
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:57,765
Nothing will happen in the end.

42
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:16,853
Zhou.

43
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:17,734
There's...

44
00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:20,000
There's emergency at the hospital.

45
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:22,119
Can you help me?

46
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,480
By the way...

47
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:28,571
I forgot you went to visit
Su Jinbei's parents today.

48
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:29,978
Alright.

49
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,240
Let me ask someone else.

50
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:44,326
Hey brother.

51
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,542
Right.

52
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:47,486
It's Junhao Restaurant.

53
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,691
-Here you are, dad.
-Lily Hall.

54
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:54,405
Yes.
You bring your wife and Huahua together.

55
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:56,134
At 6:00 in the evening.

56
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:57,020
6:00.

57
00:04:57,387 --> 00:04:58,600
See you there.

58
00:04:59,061 --> 00:04:59,901
Let me tell you.

59
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:01,562
Honey.

60
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,421
I'm worried about you.

61
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:04,692
Because this evening,

62
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:07,198
there's going to be a heated discussion.

63
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,360
My relatives are really enthusiastic.

64
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:13,891
Uncle and aunt, I'm so sorry.

65
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:16,002
There's an emergency at the hospital.
I have to go.

66
00:05:18,032 --> 00:05:18,878
No.

67
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:19,759
Uhm.

68
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,746
-Beibei.
-Shiyun.

69
00:05:23,226 --> 00:05:24,066
Su.

70
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,442
What did you talk about before?

71
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,334
Nothing.

72
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,520
That's weird.

73
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,700
Shiyun didn't look alright when he left.

74
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:38,690
Were you getting on his nerves?

75
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:40,847
I don't think there's anything wrong.

76
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:43,440
He just said emergency, major surgery.

77
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:46,520
Should him feel happy
for things like that?

78
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:51,416
Beibei, don't put too
much thought on that.

79
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:53,630
It's beyond his will.

80
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:57,560
I'll go upstairs.

81
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:02,383
Something's wrong.

82
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,282
You're talkative.

83
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,163
No.

84
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,701
-Well...
-Leave them alone.

85
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:16,810
Brother, you're back.

86
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:53,312
Beibei.

87
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:55,187
Come out and get something to eat.

88
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:57,235
Not now, I'll eat later.

89
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:18,716
No news till now.

90
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,710
There must be something wrong.

91
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:24,395
You're the smartest.

92
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:30,280
Speak less and eat more.

93
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:45,282
Honey, are you busy?

94
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:03,080
Hey.

95
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:05,668
You voice doesn't sound right.

96
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:09,480
Anything wrong?

97
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:13,103
Beibei.

98
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:16,440
What on earth has happened?

99
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:18,768
Nothing.

100
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:20,812
Why do you call me.

101
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:23,426
Just to remind you of the
spokesperson press conference...

102
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:26,457
of the Love For Life website tomorrow.

103
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:27,521
Don't forget it.

104
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,406
I see.

105
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,652
Are you alright?

106
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,290
I'll tell you face-to-face, bye.

107
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:43,127
Zhou Shiyun, what's wrong with you?

108
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:49,133
What happened?

109
00:08:49,507 --> 00:08:50,626
What're you mumbling.

110
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:56,040
Did you clean the bathroom after shower?

111
00:08:58,357 --> 00:08:59,197
Yes, I did.

112
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,240
I don't believe you.

113
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:33,844
What's up?

114
00:09:34,484 --> 00:09:35,562
What's the matter?

115
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:39,468
But...

116
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:41,790
Something is not right.

117
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,080
What's wrong?

118
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,320
Today, you are unusual.

119
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:53,240
Today, I...

120
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:55,560
am very normal.

121
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,575
And now you...

122
00:09:59,044 --> 00:09:59,884
I...

123
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:01,281
What's wrong with me now?

124
00:10:01,587 --> 00:10:05,486
You're sitting right on the couch.

125
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:08,140
As you say, I should be like...

126
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:11,563
this?

127
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:13,234
I think...

128
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:16,311
you may make yourself too twisted.

129
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:19,189
You see.

130
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:21,160
It's all your request.

131
00:10:21,201 --> 00:10:23,211
It was wrong of me to do at your request.

132
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,325
What am I supposed to do?

133
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:29,760
Such a stubborn person.

134
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:33,168
He can't turn over a new leaf so easily.

135
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,320
That's counter-intuitive.

136
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:41,080
Dear Di.

137
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,458
You have to learn to use
the vision of development...

138
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:45,431
to see things.

139
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:47,232
Dear Xiao.

140
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:51,800
You finally admit you're a problem.

141
00:10:54,174 --> 00:10:56,803
I didn't understand
your intentions before,

142
00:10:57,309 --> 00:10:58,591
but now I finally get it.

143
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:00,829
Maybe that's how life should be.

144
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:05,320
Neat, orderly and rigorous.

145
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,840
I'm almost touched by you.

146
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:13,880
If you just didn't use
the head towel to wipe your feet.

147
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:18,616
Look.

148
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:22,999
That means I'm not doing enough.

149
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:24,995
Don't worry.

150
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:26,945
I will turn over a new leaf
as soon as possible.

151
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:30,496
Give you a brand new Xiao Yuansong.

152
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:32,016
As soon as possible?

153
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,369
How fast.

154
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,562
The sooner, the better.

155
00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:49,049
Hello, Zitong.

156
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,530
Where is Xu Jiawei?

157
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:52,794
He is with the recording teacher.

158
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:54,891
He has something to discuss
with the recording teacher.

159
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,920
You are the new assistant
recommended by Su Jinbei?

160
00:11:58,771 --> 00:11:59,799
My first day at work.

161
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:01,919
I see it.

162
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,480
Not even a cup of coffee for your boss.

163
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:09,265
Is there a coffee shop downstairs?

164
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:10,295
I'm going to buy it now.

165
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:11,809
Do you know what he drinks?

166
00:12:14,372 --> 00:12:15,222
Cappuccino.

167
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:17,276
No, He drinks iced Americano.

168
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:20,027
Don't just believe the online information.

169
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:21,970
By the way,

170
00:12:22,011 --> 00:12:23,840
bring me another one, please.

171
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:28,835
Alright.

172
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:35,603
Zitong.

173
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:37,876
Please have a look.

174
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:38,984
Let me check with you...

175
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,374
the schedule tomorrow
and the day after tomorrow.

176
00:12:42,452 --> 00:12:44,129
Tomorrow afternoon.

177
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:46,120
Time hit here and cannot be set.

178
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:47,560
-And make sure the recess.
-Zitong.

179
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:51,078
Iced.

180
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:52,427
Who told you I want the iced?

181
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,200
You said Jiawei wants a
cup of iced American coffee...

182
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:57,239
and you have one, too

183
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:58,921
I thought you want this.

184
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:01,124
But you didn't tell me?

185
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,109
You're not going to ask unless I tell you?

186
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,520
Change a cup of hot
I can't drink the iced coffee.

187
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:11,112
Give me.

188
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:13,832
Er...

189
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:15,085
And this.

190
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:17,520
Can we cancel this first?

191
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:19,339
It's actually similar to
this one in the morning.

192
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,920
-Zitong.
-Mr. Shui said to let you decide.

193
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:23,265
Thank you.

194
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,082
It's bitter.

195
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:29,944
I can't drink this,
change to a cup of latte.

196
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:32,160
Let me buy it.

197
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:33,765
You do it.

198
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:35,808
Then the recording teaching is coming.

199
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,498
Does he know what to prepare?

200
00:13:50,184 --> 00:13:51,033
Sorry, sorry.

201
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:52,120
How could you be so careless?

202
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:55,220
Jiawei, I'm sorry.

203
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,280
You keep talking.

204
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:57,161
What are you doing?

205
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:58,121
This...

206
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,218
I'll change the coffee for Zitong.

207
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:02,360
Why do you change the coffee for Zitong?

208
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,195
I bought her iced coffee.

209
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,640
She wants it hot again.

210
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:09,760
I gave her hot one,
but she felt too bitter.

211
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:13,908
Give it to me.

212
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:15,950
Why don't I ask this one whether
it can change the time?

213
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:16,831
What do you think?

214
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:17,969
Xiaotao.

215
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:19,251
Ask your boss.

216
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:20,840
Sweet or bitter?

217
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:21,721
Iced or hot?

218
00:14:21,947 --> 00:14:22,787
Get her another one.

219
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:25,142
Xu Jiawei.

220
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,975
Zhou Suying is my assistant.

221
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:31,232
She has no obligation
to change your coffee.

222
00:14:31,273 --> 00:14:33,099
Let's get started when we're ready.

223
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:34,983
Go.

224
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:10,245
The number you've dialed cannot
be connected for the moment.

225
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:12,840
Please redial later.

226
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:19,511
I can't even count the number of calls.

227
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,259
He won't reply to your message.

228
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,320
Don't be silly.

229
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:41,924
He left suddenly.

230
00:15:42,095 --> 00:15:43,663
He was unheard of all day and all night.

231
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:47,000
He doesn't have you in his heart.

232
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:51,546
-I tell you...
-Beibei, the reporters are here.

233
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:52,760
The press conference will begin soon.

234
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,950
Ready?

235
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:54,894
Let's go.

236
00:15:56,717 --> 00:15:57,566
I see.

237
00:15:59,874 --> 00:16:00,714
Beibei.

238
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:02,467
Let me remind you something.

239
00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:08,441
If a reporter asks
questions about your relationship,

240
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:10,931
you mustn't reveal anything.

241
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:12,458
Remember.

242
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:14,404
You are single.

243
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:15,993
What can be revealed?

244
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:17,320
I'm single now.

245
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:21,744
What are you doing?

246
00:16:23,346 --> 00:16:26,277
Thanks to our dancers'
great performance.

247
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:29,840
So soon we're going to have
the most watched moment.

248
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:34,480
We are going to announce the spokesperson
for Love For Life website.

249
00:16:34,935 --> 00:16:38,587
So let us
with the loudest applause and shouts...

250
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:42,154
welcome our image spokesperson Su Jinbei.

251
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:44,081
Miss Jinbei.

252
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:45,081
Miss Jinbei, please look over here.

253
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:45,961
Miss Jinbei.

254
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:47,641
Excuse me, Miss Jinbei.

255
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:48,880
How did you come up with this idea...

256
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:50,364
to be the spokesperson
of match-making website?

257
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:54,120
Because it's a great website
I have many friends.

258
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:56,699
Especially some very good men and women.

259
00:16:56,963 --> 00:16:58,680
They all signed up on
Love For Life website.

260
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,801
And two of my friends
got married recently.

261
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:03,172
How do you think they met each other?

262
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:05,265
They get marred through
Love For Life website.

263
00:17:05,468 --> 00:17:06,382
Miss Jinbei, here.

264
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:07,320
Here, look this way.

265
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:10,310
Would you like to sign up on this website?

266
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:12,413
Of course. I will sign up on it.

267
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:14,995
Do you believe
the love built through a dating network?

268
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,109
I don't think the ways matter.

269
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,125
By whatever means...

270
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,776
as long as they make a
sincere effort each other,

271
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:24,156
they are sure to get a solid love.

272
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:26,760
As a star outside of your busy job,

273
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:28,312
do you have any progress in your love?

274
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:30,563
Have you found your Mr. Right,

275
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:33,200
or the one who will be your boyfriend?

276
00:17:37,162 --> 00:17:38,017
What's the matter?

277
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:38,970
Why don't you say something?

278
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:39,925
What's the matter?

279
00:17:43,499 --> 00:17:44,977
I am...

280
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:48,680
still single.

281
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:03,179
Mr. Zhou.

282
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,206
The medical team to the mountains
is leaving in the afternoon.

283
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,120
Director Wu can't go there now.

284
00:18:09,611 --> 00:18:10,705
He wants me to ask you.

285
00:18:10,746 --> 00:18:11,880
-Can you take his place?
-Yes.

286
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:13,841
I can.

287
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:17,556
Jiawei.

288
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:23,104
Jiawei.

289
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:29,409
Lose again.

290
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,800
You...

291
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,280
Jiawei, your name is Jiang Xiaoyu?

292
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:48,504
What did say?

293
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:49,881
Did you ask me for recording?

294
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:50,908
No, I didn't.

295
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,360
I made you a cup of honey grapefruit tea
to wet your whistle.

296
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,670
Thank you.

297
00:18:57,681 --> 00:18:59,281
I want thank you.

298
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:01,131
Today is my first day at work.

299
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:02,180
I know nothing.

300
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,512
I just made a mess.

301
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,298
Thanks to you.

302
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:07,161
It's okay. She's not taking it personally.

303
00:19:07,202 --> 00:19:08,205
Just don't take it to heart.

304
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:12,160
All right, I'm going to take another one.

305
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:13,200
Just tell me when it's getting started.

306
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:14,335
Alright.

307
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:41,480
Mr. Zhou, I go back to pack.

308
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:42,462
We'll meet at the station.

309
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:04,235
Zhou Shiyun.

310
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,543
Zhou Shiyun.

311
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:06,908
Zhou Shiyun.

312
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:12,483
You're back, sister.

313
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:15,689
Where's your brother?

314
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:18,344
He just came back.

315
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,681
Then he went out again.

316
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:20,705
Where did he go?

317
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:24,660
It seems like the mountain
medical team or something.

318
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:25,697
The mountains.

319
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,870
What else did he say?

320
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:27,853
Nothing else.

321
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,400
Nothing else?

322
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,480
Sister, what's wrong with you two?

323
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:35,690
My brother came back
yesterday and didn't look right.

324
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,180
Now.

325
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,520
These two are weird.

326
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:54,480
Where are you going?

327
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:55,361
Go home?

328
00:20:57,962 --> 00:20:58,802
Well...

329
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:07,035
He just left your house?

330
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:09,040
Then he went into the mountain.

331
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:12,160
You can't get in touch with him anymore.

332
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:15,320
Stop drinking.

333
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,140
Didi.

334
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,236
This is Zhou Shiyun.

335
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:24,512
I don't understand.

336
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:27,120
That's not like him.

337
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:30,880
I'm his fiancee and
I can't even figure it out.

338
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:33,280
If you, if you figure it out,

339
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:34,520
you're his wife.

340
00:21:35,486 --> 00:21:36,923
Well, I won't.

341
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:40,570
You like Xiao Yuansong.

342
00:21:41,975 --> 00:21:45,130
They're really good buddies.

343
00:21:45,843 --> 00:21:48,799
Xiao Yuansong's recent
behavior has also been unusual.

344
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,532
Why?

345
00:21:52,537 --> 00:21:54,960
He was at home more than Zhou Shiyun.

346
00:21:55,845 --> 00:21:57,553
Don't tell me about Zhou Shiyun.

347
00:21:57,594 --> 00:21:58,719
Okay, okay,
I'm not going to talk about him.

348
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,620
No more.

349
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:04,280
The main thing is that
I think he's been sneaking around lately.

350
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,887
Look at me evasively.

351
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:10,992
He used to take a phone
call and want to speak up.

352
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,459
Now he takes the phone in the room
or in the toilet.

353
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,360
Don't dare answer the phone in my face.

354
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:22,160
Was that when you asked him...

355
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:25,318
he said it was work?

356
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,199
Yes.

357
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,112
Congratulations.

358
00:22:44,222 --> 00:22:45,551
Don't drink my beer.

359
00:22:47,548 --> 00:22:49,204
Just a moment.
I'll put my phone on the screen.

360
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:54,890
Here comes the master.

361
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:56,400
It's Mr. Wuque.

362
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,965
Master, teach them a lesson.

363
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,240
I'm here.

364
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:03,119
Because I'm busy with my work these days.

365
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,212
So I don't play much games.

366
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:06,422
Master. Now it's going viral that
you're being poached for a high salary.

367
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:08,160
-Are you moving to another platform?
-We can do it.

368
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:09,235
There's a boat. Go straight on.

369
00:23:11,898 --> 00:23:13,465
There is poaching.

370
00:23:13,506 --> 00:23:16,184
But job-hopping is off the table.

371
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:18,481
At last I saw the Master again.

372
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:19,361
Please teach us.

373
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,241
Someone came to ask for tips.

374
00:23:23,281 --> 00:23:25,157
I'll give you a lecture.

375
00:23:35,085 --> 00:23:36,539
That's all for today.

376
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,631
Let's have a good rest early.

377
00:23:37,672 --> 00:23:38,512
Bye.

378
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:51,126
What is this?

379
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:58,058
I have a mission this time.

380
00:23:59,294 --> 00:24:00,622
What did we say before?

381
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:02,688
Just chase him and then dump him.

382
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:06,240
Revenge him for absence
from the engagement party.

383
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:07,585
Yeah.

384
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:09,470
He even brought you
home for ancestor worship.

385
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:13,684
Brother, you're back.

386
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:34,783
Maybe someday
I'll let him come home with me.

387
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:39,126
You told me to focus on acting.

388
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:41,221
I'm just going to practice on him.

389
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:00,567
Hey.

390
00:25:00,802 --> 00:25:02,480
Sister, you finally answered the phone.

391
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,041
Why?

392
00:25:04,422 --> 00:25:06,280
I think I know why
my brother is acting strangely.

393
00:25:07,543 --> 00:25:08,383
What?

394
00:25:08,595 --> 00:25:09,765
I sent you a video.

395
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:10,750
See it yourself.

396
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,840
Do you mean it is a joke
to went home with him?

397
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,190
Maybe he'll accompany
me to go home someday.

398
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:20,334
You told me to focus on acting.

399
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,710
I'm just going to practice on him.

400
00:25:23,017 --> 00:25:25,120
I'm screwed.
I can't explain it.

401
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:31,895
Are you crazy?

402
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:33,280
I must go to him at once.

403
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:35,155
Could you help me to get
the address from Xiao Yuansong.

404
00:25:35,376 --> 00:25:36,224
How long will you be gone?

405
00:25:36,265 --> 00:25:37,105
I don't know.

406
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:38,482
What about the work?

407
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:39,545
Help me push it off.

408
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,398
You're trying to kill me.

409
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,160
I can't care that much now.

410
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:44,308
Would you just do me a favor?

411
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,279
Alright.

412
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:03,729
Alright.

413
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:05,160
Okay, bye.

414
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,570
I...

415
00:26:09,323 --> 00:26:10,191
It's my colleague.

416
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:12,800
He got kicked by his girlfriend.

417
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,036
He's so sad, so I enlightened him.

418
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:19,984
What's up?

419
00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:25,160
Do you have the address of
Zhou Shiyun in mountainous area?

420
00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:30,860
It's no use.

421
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:32,160
He won't talk to you.

422
00:26:33,277 --> 00:26:34,215
It won't.

423
00:26:34,457 --> 00:26:36,078
He has me in his heart.
He cares about me.

424
00:26:36,866 --> 00:26:39,280
Is he so cold-blooded
that he cares about you?

425
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:41,680
Didn't you watch the video?

426
00:26:41,754 --> 00:26:43,801
Because of my joke he was angry like that.

427
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:45,080
Doesn't he care about me?

428
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:49,680
You are irredeemable.

429
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,039
Yes.

430
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:08,680
Don't go. You'll get hurt.

431
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:11,689
Out of my way.

432
00:27:15,172 --> 00:27:16,020
That's how he's going
to take this medicine.

433
00:27:16,061 --> 00:27:17,332
It says two at a time.

434
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:18,714
This is four at a time.

435
00:27:18,755 --> 00:27:19,920
I've listed it for you.

436
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:21,328
Just take the medicine according to this.

437
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:38,200
It might hurt a little.

438
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:39,741
Just hold on.

439
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:41,843
It's okay!

440
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:44,044
Bind it up.

441
00:27:44,415 --> 00:27:45,255
Alright.

442
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,595
Follow up. Please feel free to call me,
if you have any questions.

443
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:48,476
Okay.

444
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:51,123
Come back in three days, please.

445
00:27:51,164 --> 00:27:52,279
If it doesn't work...

446
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,344
I got it back, Mr. Zhou.

447
00:27:53,384 --> 00:27:54,224
Let me have a look.

448
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:56,572
Okay, get that stuff over there.

449
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:58,485
You take it according
to the specification.

450
00:27:58,526 --> 00:27:59,386
It's all there.

451
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,338
You bring me that dish.

452
00:28:09,052 --> 00:28:09,930
There should be no problem.

453
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:10,828
-Keep it up...
-Okay.

454
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:16,637
It's not what you think.

455
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:18,644
I'll go to you and explain to you.

456
00:28:19,952 --> 00:28:21,520
What are you going to do?
Not now.

457
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,220
Don't worry.

458
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:33,256
Sorry,

459
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,209
the number you've dialed cannot
be connected for the moment.

460
00:28:36,612 --> 00:28:37,600
Please redial later.

461
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:40,154
Sorry, the number you've dialed...

462
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,480
It may rain at any moment.

463
00:28:46,922 --> 00:28:48,388
It's too dangerous to go into
the mountainous area in the rain.

464
00:29:06,234 --> 00:29:07,074
Oh, no...

465
00:29:07,115 --> 00:29:08,917
My sister had just gone
when there was a storm.

466
00:29:25,214 --> 00:29:26,095
Sorry,

467
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:29,040
the number you've dialed cannot
be connected for the moment.

468
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:30,720
Please redial later.

469
00:29:34,463 --> 00:29:35,904
We're done. Let's go.

470
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:41,633
What's wrong with you?

471
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:42,571
Out of mind.

472
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:48,898
Family stuff.

473
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:51,596
Go first.

474
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:08,355
Sorry,

475
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,719
the number you've dialed cannot
be connected for the moment.

476
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,707
Please redial later.

477
00:30:12,748 --> 00:30:15,516
Sorry, the number you've dialed...

478
00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:18,627
Sorry,

479
00:30:18,939 --> 00:30:21,528
the number you've dialed cannot
be connected for the moment.

480
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:23,503
Please redial later. Sorry...

481
00:30:23,544 --> 00:30:24,384
Mr. Zhou.

482
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:25,265
What about it?

483
00:30:26,522 --> 00:30:27,920
Nobody came to the hostel today.

484
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,391
The rain is so heavy.

485
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,723
The rain is not about to stop.

486
00:30:37,764 --> 00:30:40,000
Yeah, it's raining too hard.

487
00:30:42,996 --> 00:30:44,210
-Mr. Liu
-Dr. Zhou.

488
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:45,760
Mr. Liu. What's up?

489
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:47,095
The landslide hit someone.

490
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,111
Get he in there quick.

491
00:30:48,152 --> 00:30:48,992
Alright.

492
00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:50,520
Slowly.

493
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:51,623
Here, be careful.

494
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:52,738
Watch out.

495
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:53,875
Be careful.

496
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:54,756
Slow down.

497
00:30:54,797 --> 00:30:55,637
Slow down.

498
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,640
Alright.

499
00:30:58,202 --> 00:30:59,388
It hurts so bad.

500
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,448
Take care.

501
00:31:03,677 --> 00:31:04,528
Dr. Zhou.

502
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,640
There are a few more wounded over there
I have to go back.

503
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:08,444
Keep Tingting here.
Let's see if we can help.

504
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:10,161
All right, Mr. Liu, be careful.

505
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,240
-Liu, I'll go with you.
-Okay.

506
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:12,121
Cut the trousers open.

507
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:14,840
Hold on... hold on.

508
00:31:14,881 --> 00:31:15,746
Hold on.

509
00:31:16,435 --> 00:31:17,600
-Ready to disinfect.
-Just a minute.

510
00:31:19,238 --> 00:31:21,216
-Hold on. Hold on.
-Hold on.

511
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:23,360
-Just hold on.
-I'm almost done.

512
00:31:25,043 --> 00:31:25,982
Hold on.

513
00:31:26,662 --> 00:31:27,560
Well.

514
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:31,320
Hold on.

515
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:32,806
Gauze.

516
00:31:34,763 --> 00:31:35,603
Alright.

517
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,910
Tape.

518
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:38,138
Uncle.

519
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:41,845
My leg.

520
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:47,829
Hold on.

521
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,710
Be careful. Quickly.

522
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:51,656
Give me gauze.

523
00:31:55,899 --> 00:31:56,739
Hold on.

524
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:02,936
Hold on.

525
00:32:04,362 --> 00:32:05,202
Take care.

526
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:06,322
Slowly.

527
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:07,918
Doctor. Be gentle.

528
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,165
It's killing me.

529
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,824
-Well...
-Just hold on.

530
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,040
Almost done.

531
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:14,556
-Take it.
-Life the leg.

532
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:17,471
Slow down and be careful.

533
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:18,694
Be careful.

534
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:25,835
Doctor and nurse.

535
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:26,716
Put it here.

536
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,078
Tingting, come over
here and help me press.

537
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:33,958
Okay.

538
00:32:42,314 --> 00:32:43,769
Change the medicine on his leg again.

539
00:32:44,358 --> 00:32:45,458
The gauze should be changed, too.

540
00:32:46,206 --> 00:32:47,046
I will help you.

541
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:56,273
Dr. Zhou.

542
00:32:56,746 --> 00:32:58,190
Take a look at this patient.

543
00:33:06,754 --> 00:33:07,594
It's fine.

544
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,840
Mr. Liu.

545
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:16,640
Can we still walk on
the mountain road outside?

546
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,456
Heavy rains caused landslides.

547
00:33:21,497 --> 00:33:23,680
The road was blocked.

548
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:27,200
Is there any other way to go?

549
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:30,416
There is a trail.

550
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,935
But it's a long way round
and it's dangerous.

551
00:33:35,976 --> 00:33:37,301
People seldom walk that road.

552
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:38,551
Is that road blocked?

553
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,388
I don't know about that.

554
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,738
What's the matter, Dr. Zhou.

555
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:42,741
Are you going out?

556
00:33:44,498 --> 00:33:45,423
A friend is coming.

557
00:33:46,498 --> 00:33:47,440
She could be on the way.

558
00:33:49,182 --> 00:33:50,480
That's too dangerous.

559
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:53,880
That road is dangerous in good weather.

560
00:33:54,272 --> 00:33:56,297
This situation may bring bad luck.

561
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,940
Come here.

562
00:34:15,675 --> 00:34:16,515
Sorry,

563
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,471
the number you've dialed cannot
be connected for the moment.

564
00:34:20,065 --> 00:34:21,295
Please redial later.

565
00:34:21,336 --> 00:34:22,176
Sorry...

566
00:34:34,454 --> 00:34:35,364
Hold on.

567
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,400
Shiyun, where are you going?

568
00:34:43,441 --> 00:34:44,416
I'm going down the mountain.

569
00:34:44,714 --> 00:34:46,719
It's late and the rain is so heavy.

570
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,246
It's not safe on the road.

571
00:34:48,492 --> 00:34:50,080
I'll be back soon.
Call me if you need anything.

572
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,665
Pick up your friend?

573
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,763
Yes.

574
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:54,920
A very important friend?

575
00:34:57,832 --> 00:34:58,672
Very important.

576
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,278
Dr. Zhou, Dr. Zhou.

577
00:35:01,826 --> 00:35:03,449
Bed three is showing signs of infection.

578
00:35:59,342 --> 00:36:00,182
Mr. Liu.

579
00:36:00,377 --> 00:36:02,546
Dr. Zhou, I went to the hostel.

580
00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:05,125
They said there was no one there at all.

581
00:36:05,283 --> 00:36:06,194
There was nobody all night.

582
00:36:08,652 --> 00:36:09,492
Mr. Liu.

583
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:11,653
Can you take me down for a ride?

584
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:14,388
But you don't know where she is now.

585
00:36:14,962 --> 00:36:15,827
Even if you know,

586
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:18,030
you saw it last night.

587
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:19,106
The road closed.

588
00:36:19,147 --> 00:36:20,700
You can't drive.

589
00:36:21,234 --> 00:36:22,408
Mr. Liu, I...

590
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:24,680
I have to...

591
00:36:25,735 --> 00:36:26,640
Please.

592
00:36:31,131 --> 00:36:33,800
Fine.
You are the benefactor of our family.

593
00:36:34,187 --> 00:36:35,339
I'll take you there.

594
00:36:35,835 --> 00:36:36,675
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

595
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:37,805
Just a moment, please.

596
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:39,418
Zhang.

597
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:41,665
Mr. Zhou.

598
00:36:42,455 --> 00:36:43,951
-Come. Hurry.
-Mr. Zhou.

599
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:45,578
The patient is in stable condition now.

600
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:46,665
I have something urgent to go down.

601
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:47,546
You stay here.

602
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:49,187
Pay attention to the third bed.

603
00:36:49,228 --> 00:36:50,582
-Any problem?
-No problem.

604
00:36:50,623 --> 00:36:51,464
Okay.

605
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:52,656
Mr. Liu, let's go.

606
00:36:52,697 --> 00:36:53,537
Let's go.

607
00:36:56,857 --> 00:36:57,892
There are wounded again.
