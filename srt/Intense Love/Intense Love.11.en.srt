00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:36,184
=Episode 11=

3
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:36,265
Come here.

4
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:39,792
Slow down.

5
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,320
Honey.

6
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:52,440
If only we could become birds
and be able to fly like them.

7
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,349
Where would you like to go?

8
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:00,301
Wherever you are.

9
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:22,092
Who's that?

10
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:23,154
It's me.

11
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:26,120
Honey.

12
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:31,603
I made breakfast for you.

13
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:34,440
Thank you.

14
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,593
You serve for me.

15
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:59,176
I become extremely
suspicious because of Yingying.

16
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:00,057
I'll talk to her later.

17
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:01,759
Well.

18
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,079
She's like a child.

19
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,000
Just kidding.

20
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:09,200
But if we want to be alone in the future
then we can't stay at home.

21
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,440
Oh, honey.

22
00:04:11,923 --> 00:04:14,745
We haven't had a formal date yet.

23
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:15,626
Right?

24
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:20,004
No.
Then you must ask me out on a formal date.

25
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:20,885
Okay?

26
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:22,840
A formal date?

27
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:28,638
Yes, that will be our first date.

28
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,120
You have to think about it.

29
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:34,844
Alright.

30
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:43,485
Morning, Dr. Zhou.

31
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,719
Morning.

32
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,800
Let me ask you something, Xiao.

33
00:04:56,768 --> 00:04:57,608
Okay.

34
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:02,040
What kind of date can make a girl happy?

35
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:06,314
In the past, if you asked me so...

36
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:09,920
I could give you a lot of good advice.

37
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:14,680
But as in my own situation
all my moves failed.

38
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:18,113
I can just tell you.

39
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:19,680
That's all I can tell you.

40
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,711
So it's serious between you two?

41
00:05:31,137 --> 00:05:31,977
Yeah.

42
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:34,680
How do you think
he's going to plan this date?

43
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:37,184
I don't think that would be too dramatic.

44
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:38,960
That is not his style.

45
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:45,477
But it will not be too shabby.

46
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:47,823
This is our first date.

47
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:49,237
Didi, right?

48
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:54,640
Dates that failed the first time
are very normal.

49
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,480
Yeah.

50
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:02,440
After all, he's style is usually
simplicity and coldness.

51
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:05,440
Will he just book a
restaurant conveniently...

52
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,040
to have dinner with me?

53
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,485
If so,

54
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:14,400
it will leave me scarred in my memory.

55
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:20,240
Now my heart is filled with the shadow.

56
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,540
What?

57
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:26,459
Alright. I am busy now.

58
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,114
-Well, enjoy yourself.
-No.

59
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,384
-See you later
-I didn't even tell you...

60
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:30,264
Good girl.

61
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:31,315
Go.

62
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:48,265
Miss Wu.

63
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,120
Mr. Lee is very pleased with your house
and he really wants to buy it.

64
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:56,560
But as for the price
can you make it lower?

65
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:00,251
How much would you like?

66
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,488
RMB 20,000 yuan.

67
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,325
Well, let's do it.

68
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:08,137
Miss Wu, that's very kind of you.

69
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:09,794
Well, let's sign the contract.

70
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:11,760
Here are two pieces.

71
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:12,641
Alright.

72
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,520
Wu Di, open the door.

73
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:20,455
Come on, I know you're here.

74
00:07:20,496 --> 00:07:21,400
Who's that?

75
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:23,800
Wu Di.

76
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,140
It's me.

77
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,320
I came to apologize to you.

78
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:31,160
I see I shouldn't have
stuck around you like this.

79
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:34,263
Miss Wu.
Or we come another day.

80
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:35,685
No no no.

81
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:36,575
Just now.

82
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:39,520
You know what, Wu Di.

83
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,725
Listen to me, Wu Di.

84
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:45,412
It's me.

85
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,375
Wu Di, listen to me.

86
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,634
Miss Wu.

87
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:51,475
I'll ask you to fill in
the following formalities.

88
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,310
-Thank you.
-It's fine.

89
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,190
(Application)

90
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:56,450
Slowly. Watch out.

91
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,001
Why are there two men in your room?

92
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:06,040
Who are you?

93
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:08,983
None of your business.

94
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,921
Well, let's forget them.

95
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:12,760
Didi, I just want to say...

96
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,389
I really like you.

97
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,384
I like you very very much.

98
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:18,650
I really really like you.

99
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:21,171
I can't believe the drunkard's words.

100
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,158
No, Wu Di.

101
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:28,487
Listen to me, Wu Di.

102
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,175
I really like you, really.

103
00:08:32,952 --> 00:08:34,908
Listen to me, Wu Di.

104
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:36,556
I like you very much.

105
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:37,437
Wu Di.

106
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:56,254
Why am I here?

107
00:08:57,845 --> 00:08:58,695
Oh my God.

108
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,800
What have I done?

109
00:09:04,332 --> 00:09:05,172
I...

110
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:14,217
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:55,982
Things were so chaotic that day.

112
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:57,698
I didn't read many of the terms clearly.

113
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:00,031
But you have signed it.

114
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:01,672
We can re-sign it.

115
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:04,560
That might not work.

116
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,039
Then I'll break the contract.

117
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:07,984
Yes, you can.

118
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,612
But according to the contract,

119
00:10:09,653 --> 00:10:12,920
you have to pay five times the deposit.

120
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:15,308
You...it's the contractual fraud.

121
00:10:17,306 --> 00:10:18,431
You can't say that.

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,275
It's your own signature.

123
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,465
No one push you.

124
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:24,153
Well, I'll see you in court.

125
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:46,905
I want to break up with my boyfriend.

126
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,646
You've been good all the time.

127
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,540
Why?

128
00:10:50,037 --> 00:10:52,447
The date between he and I...

129
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:54,455
was learned from an official
account called romantic dating.

130
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,895
He has no sincerity.

131
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,300
Indeed.

132
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,494
Didi.

133
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:13,160
What do you think
I should wear to the date?

134
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:14,988
Whatever, that's okay.

135
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:16,560
I don't have enough clothes.

136
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:19,340
How about going shopping with me.

137
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:20,551
No

138
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:21,928
I have some business to do.

139
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:26,184
Dear Di, just go with me.

140
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:28,961
It's been a long time
since we went shopping together.

141
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:30,160
What you want?

142
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:32,920
Did he tell you where and how to date?

143
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,158
No.

144
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,644
No?

145
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:37,985
Then how do you know
what kind of dress to wear.

146
00:11:38,722 --> 00:11:40,372
I can prepare some.

147
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:42,233
Take your time preparing that.

148
00:11:42,337 --> 00:11:43,184
I'm really busy.

149
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:44,065
All right bye.

150
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:45,739
Hey.

151
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,620
Hey.

152
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,320
That's not cool.

153
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:55,800
I have to dress up
to date with my honey.

154
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:05,239
Is everything okay, Mr. Gao?

155
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:07,172
Something is wrong.

156
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:08,989
There are problems in
the terms of payment...

157
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,000
percentage of final payment
and transfer of names.

158
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:14,440
Then can I sue them for contract fraud?

159
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,861
Litigation is the last resort...

160
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:20,120
I suggest you should
communicate and coordinate first.

161
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,520
Let me give them a call first.

162
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,190
Alright.

163
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:34,613
Hello.

164
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:35,738
Hello.

165
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:36,619
Hello.

166
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,500
Who are you?

167
00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:40,760
Hello I'm the attorney for Miss Wu
Mr. Gao.

168
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:43,014
I'd like to talk to you
about the contract.

169
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:45,130
No it's all done.

170
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:46,880
It's all done?

171
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:51,342
Slow down.

172
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:29,720
That means.

173
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,120
Xiao Yuansong sold the house
to Lee at a low price.

174
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,880
So he agreed to terminate
the contract with me.

175
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,680
Mr. Xiao must have lost
a lot of money this time.

176
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:55,325
You... just move this over there.

177
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,390
Yes.

178
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:57,271
Take care.

179
00:13:57,906 --> 00:13:58,960
You want see Mr. Xiao?

180
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:00,880
He had already left.

181
00:14:04,154 --> 00:14:05,120
Be careful.

182
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,800
It's a technique of dislocation.

183
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:26,225
Actually you didn't kiss each other.

184
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:33,400
I really like you.

185
00:14:33,643 --> 00:14:35,280
I like you very much.

186
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:36,480
I like you very much.

187
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,880
I can't believe a drunkard's words.

188
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:41,840
No, Wu Di.

189
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:53,703
Why are you moving
with so little luggage?

190
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,743
I just want to get out of here.

191
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:57,059
The sad place.

192
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:59,760
So the furniture the appliances
are still there.

193
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:03,434
What to do with this?

194
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:04,550
Can you repair it master?

195
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:07,713
No.

196
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:09,525
There are still five miles to go.

197
00:15:09,787 --> 00:15:10,920
You can unload them.

198
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:13,167
No master. Well...

199
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,761
We're in the middle of nowhere.

200
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:16,361
You asked me to unload the luggage.

201
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:18,400
-Then what should I do?
-Well I can't help you.

202
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,000
This is too much for me.

203
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:22,387
Just help me.

204
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:28,160
I have no choice.

205
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:32,434
Hello.

206
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:34,042
Is this a moving company?

207
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,520
I have some luggage to carry here.

208
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,360
Just a few pieces.

209
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:40,976
Maybe five or six here.

210
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,150
This is...

211
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:46,727
Where am I?

212
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:58,931
What are you doing?

213
00:15:58,972 --> 00:15:59,942
Stop Xiao Yuansong.

214
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:00,920
We're done here.

215
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,550
No, I have my own life.

216
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:04,641
Go do your bit.

217
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:05,960
But.

218
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:07,120
Leave me alone.

219
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:10,240
I can't stand you any more.

220
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,121
Tell me what do you like about me.

221
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:13,937
Can't I change it?

222
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:16,320
Don't waste your time.

223
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:02,571
Go.

224
00:17:03,675 --> 00:17:04,640
Come home with me.

225
00:17:29,638 --> 00:17:31,038
It's raining like crazy.

226
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:34,101
There's no way out of here,

227
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:38,800
even no way to go on a date.

228
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,200
Honey, look at the energetic little bird.

229
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,760
It has recovered, right?

230
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:54,478
Then we should let it go.

231
00:17:56,454 --> 00:17:57,579
It reminds me.

232
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:02,440
We can go to the lake on
the weekend and let it free then...

233
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:08,280
at weekend.

234
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,680
I want to see the bird.

235
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,360
Why are you wearing
high-heeled shoes to lakeside?

236
00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:32,960
This is our first dating.

237
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:34,151
So I'd like to look well.

238
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:19,911
Let's fly the bird.

239
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:25,400
Hey, you're free!

240
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,550
That's all?

241
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:00,991
Leave nothing to us.

242
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,150
Honey.

243
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:04,918
In your opinion,

244
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,080
will you be tired of me?

245
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:11,927
And you'll want to be free one day
and fly away.

246
00:20:14,968 --> 00:20:18,475
It flew away in a hurry
because it missed home so much.

247
00:20:18,804 --> 00:20:20,379
And you are my wife-to-be.

248
00:20:20,729 --> 00:20:22,320
My home locates wherever you are.

249
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:39,696
You guys are so mean.

250
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:44,320
I can't believe you let a
bird fly without calling me.

251
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,450
You take it.

252
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,115
I'll play.

253
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:16,862
I want to take a picture.

254
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:18,865
Look at me, look at me.

255
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,920
Bro, I want to eat.

256
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:29,990
Here you are.

257
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:34,815
Slow down.

258
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:39,356
Bro, I want to ride.

259
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,940
Let's go.

260
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:48,639
Let's go.

261
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:52,665
And me.

262
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:56,153
Come back.

263
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:10,829
Almost here.

264
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:13,221
Don't wake her up.

265
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,543
Let her get some sleep.

266
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:15,534
She is worn out today.

267
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,160
It's finally quiet.

268
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,570
I'm hungry.

269
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:00,413
I'll make the midnight snack.

270
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:01,950
And I...

271
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,575
Just get some sleep.

272
00:23:17,025 --> 00:23:17,925
Hold on a second.

273
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:01,427
Time for meal.

274
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:15,654
You've made so much delicious food.

275
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:18,485
I didn't know you were such a good cook.

276
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,790
Delicious!

277
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:26,109
Well, I'll get started.

278
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,990
Enjoy yourself.

279
00:24:32,118 --> 00:24:33,343
Why is the power out?

280
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:35,261
Wait a minute.

281
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,400
Well, I'll get started.

282
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,120
Dr. Zhou, are you hungry?

283
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:50,911
Do you want some midnight snack?

284
00:26:09,825 --> 00:26:10,675
Thank you.

285
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:12,956
I don't have this habit.

286
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,125
What's funny?

287
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:27,120
I still remember that
night at the hospital.

288
00:26:29,478 --> 00:26:33,080
You still remember back that far?

289
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,250
That means you were
pretty impressed that night.

290
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,040
Watch out.

291
00:26:59,357 --> 00:27:00,197
Come on.

292
00:27:05,062 --> 00:27:06,537
So many stars!

293
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,152
The neon light is so bright,

294
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:12,018
that we can hardly see
stars at ordinary times.

295
00:27:12,246 --> 00:27:15,071
I didn't realize there's such a
beautiful night sky in our city.

296
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:18,337
Look at the shooting star!

297
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:19,636
Quick, quick, make a wish.

298
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:22,282
Quick.

299
00:27:22,394 --> 00:27:24,880
That's just a plane.

300
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,240
I don't care. Just make a wish.
Quick.

301
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:28,121
Hurry up.

302
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:39,400
I hope my honey could love me forever.

303
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:41,081
We will never be apart.

304
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,160
Where would you like to go if you can fly?

305
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,145
Wherever you are.

306
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,840
Remember to eat breakfast on the table.

307
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,240
The power is back on.

308
00:32:07,002 --> 00:32:07,845
You...

309
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:10,720
It's getting late,
you'd better take a rest.

310
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,590
Good night.

311
00:32:15,275 --> 00:32:16,115
Good night.

312
00:32:20,985 --> 00:32:21,920
Honey.

313
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,080
Give me your cell phone.

314
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:29,920
I changed your nickname into Honey.

315
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:30,861
You must do the same thing.

316
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:36,465
Fine.

317
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:44,120
Good night, honey.

318
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,410
Good night.

319
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:48,719
Bei.

320
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:53,841
Beibei.

321
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:01,360
Beibei is okay.

322
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,198
There has been great progress.

323
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,410
A fan meeting in the afternoon?

324
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:15,823
Sorry.

325
00:33:15,864 --> 00:33:17,214
I don't think I have time.

326
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:30,720
You kept close with my brother Jiawei...

327
00:33:31,114 --> 00:33:32,899
and now you pretend to come
home with my second brother.

328
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,890
What do you want?

329
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,945
You are a fan of Xu Jiawei.

330
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:41,714
I'm just free now.

331
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,385
But one of my friends is coming with me.

332
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:44,265
Shall we?

333
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:46,825
Well, see you then.

334
00:33:50,165 --> 00:33:51,005
Sister,

335
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:54,760
are you on a date with a lad?

336
00:33:55,262 --> 00:33:56,102
Yeah,

337
00:33:56,231 --> 00:33:59,840
a lad who's very handsome.

338
00:34:00,852 --> 00:34:03,102
You must know Xu Jiawei.

339
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,765
You, you...

340
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,294
But I'm trying to help you.

341
00:34:07,448 --> 00:34:09,680
In the afternoon, I will
take you to his fan meeting.

342
00:34:09,895 --> 00:34:10,735
Do you want to go?

343
00:34:11,021 --> 00:34:11,996
Really?

344
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:14,748
Really?

345
00:34:15,611 --> 00:34:16,560
Really!

346
00:34:32,848 --> 00:34:33,984
You must take more pictures.

347
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:35,095
Come on, come on, give this to me.

348
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,576
Hello.
Hello, everyone.

349
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:37,576
Let me get that for you.

350
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,640
I'll take you directly to the backstage.
Let's go.

351
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:40,918
Really?

352
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,040
Jiawei, remember to give me a hint
before you sing the second song.

353
00:34:46,604 --> 00:34:47,444
No problem.

354
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,475
When it comes to the second song
we must be quiet to focus on.

355
00:34:51,794 --> 00:34:54,480
Don't get too excited later
or even too nervous to speak.

356
00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:56,321
I am too excited to speak now.

357
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,340
Jiawei.

358
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,050
Jinbei, you're here.

359
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Let me introduce to you.

360
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:08,320
This is my sister Suying.

361
00:35:09,082 --> 00:35:10,289
Hey, Suying.

362
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,320
Hello, Jiawei.

363
00:35:12,096 --> 00:35:12,936
Hello.

364
00:35:13,368 --> 00:35:14,859
Why are you alone today?

365
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,740
Where's your assistant?

366
00:35:16,796 --> 00:35:19,401
Xiaowai was taking
some time off from work.

367
00:35:19,441 --> 00:35:21,691
He may resign soon.

368
00:35:22,978 --> 00:35:23,881
Jinbei.

369
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,409
Can you recommend one for me
if you have an appropriate person?

370
00:35:26,868 --> 00:35:28,040
Well, I'll keep an eye.

371
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:30,840
Jiawei, get ready.

372
00:35:31,526 --> 00:35:32,366
Alright.

373
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:34,096
Then I'll go and get ready.

374
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,200
My sister is a fan of yours.

375
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,640
Put on a good show.

376
00:35:38,668 --> 00:35:39,508
Come on!

377
00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:41,028
Come on!

378
00:35:42,511 --> 00:35:43,351
Let's go.

379
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:44,501
Go.

380
00:35:52,705 --> 00:35:53,640
Go.

381
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,950
-Let's drink some of coffee?
-No, thanks.

382
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,825
I was in a meeting. What are you doing?

383
00:36:15,593 --> 00:36:18,480
At a fan meeting with Suying.

384
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:24,160
Let's have dinner together later.

385
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:27,958
Alright.

386
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:31,894
Where shall I pick you up?

387
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:38,874
No, thanks.

388
00:36:38,915 --> 00:36:40,915
You book it and I'll go myself.

389
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,560
Who are you texting for?

390
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:47,055
Your brother.

391
00:36:47,524 --> 00:36:48,900
Your brother.
Your brother.

392
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:50,120
Your brother.

393
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,615
-Hey.
-Hey.

394
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:14,088
What's going on over there?

395
00:37:14,128 --> 00:37:15,153
Have you seen Jiawei?

396
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:18,294
It's time to get in there.

397
00:37:19,102 --> 00:37:19,942
Yingying.

398
00:37:23,304 --> 00:37:24,459
Of course.

399
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,250
And Su Jinbei said to him that
I am her sister.

400
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,080
So Su Jinbei is not bad for you.

401
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:31,080
You're going to make up with her.

402
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,750
I've already done this.

403
00:37:34,949 --> 00:37:36,720
That was to relax her vigilance.

404
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:39,000
I'll play a good trick on her later.
