3
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,183
Hello, Bro.

4
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:49,258
Are you off work?

5
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,016
I just got home.

6
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,933
Tomorrow.

7
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,000
You two will come back, right?

8
00:01:57,225 --> 00:01:59,050
I will have Aunt Song clean up your room.

9
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:00,775
OK.

10
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,133
Please...

11
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:04,800
I'll see you tomorrow.

12
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:06,024
See you.

13
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:18,125
Are you coming tomorrow or not?

14
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:17,950
Su Jinbei.

15
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:19,350
You must think it over.

16
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,071
If you take the initiative, you will lose.

17
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,375
Text him, text him.

18
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,625
Text him, text him.

19
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,600
Lower your voice.

20
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,250
Will you go or not?

21
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,850
I haven't decided yet.

22
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,075
If you can't decide
just pick flowers to help you decide.

23
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,025
Go.

24
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,650
Don't go.

25
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,450
Go.

26
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:36,175
Don't go.

27
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,133
Go.

28
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:40,058
Don't go.

29
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,741
Go. Don't go.

30
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:43,350
Go, don't go, go, don't go, go, don't go.

31
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:45,925
Don't go, go, go, go, go,
don't go, don't go, don't go.

32
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,075
It's too late.

33
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,650
It's too late.

34
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,047
It's too late.

35
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:04,150
It's almost twelve o 'clock.

36
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,875
What happened to the screen?

37
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,400
It still works.

38
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,600
I can go.

39
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,550
It must run out of power.

40
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,933
What's wrong?

41
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,925
Is it broken?

42
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:35,116
Come on.

43
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,182
It's too late.

44
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,975
Oh no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

45
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:40,901
Where's my superman outfit.

46
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,833
This one.

47
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:18,000
Zhou Shiyun.

48
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,725
Zhou Shiyun.

49
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,075
Zhou Shiyun.

50
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,975
He didn't wait for me.

51
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:43,000
My queen.
Can you control yourself for a little bit?

52
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,466
I can't. I didn't expect that Zhou Shiyun
wont wait for me.

53
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,201
He really left at twelve.

54
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,550
No man is reliable.
I have to take care of myself.

55
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,700
Anything can be an excuse
for you to go on a shopping spree.

56
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:57,375
I helped you fix you phone.

57
00:08:57,675 --> 00:09:00,416
Why don't you just call him
and ask about it.

58
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,825
Why should I do that? He left.

59
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,633
Your meal.

60
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,425
Enough, stop eating.

61
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,000
Let go, let go, let go.

62
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,500
This is good, I love it.

63
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:24,050
You really want to break your
forty-three kilogram record...

64
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,175
just for a man?

65
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,100
Forty-three, fifty-three, sixty-three.

66
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:34,850
Even if I am fat like a ball
I am a beautiful lady.

67
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,600
Beautiful...

68
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:41,600
just not beautiful enough
to attract Dr. Zhou.

69
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,725
Why did he leave?

70
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:46,341
Why can't he just wait for a while.

71
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,675
It's normal to wait for a woman
to get dressed and do makeup.

72
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,066
Besides,
I didn't say I wouldn't go.

73
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,550
You didn't say you would go either.

74
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,450
I don't care.

75
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:58,141
Eat slowly.

76
00:09:58,225 --> 00:09:59,058
Have some water.

77
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:01,600
Wait for a while and I will go.

78
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,075
What kind of fiance!

79
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,541
Didi, listen to me.

80
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,400
No man is reliable.

81
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,100
Only the high-calorie food
can make me happy.

82
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,375
Stop! Stop!

83
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:13,450
Fine, I will eat with you.
Don't eat so much.

84
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,500
Zhou Shiyun.

85
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:48,266
Why are you here?

86
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,450
Didn't you leave?

87
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:50,708
I'm waiting for you.

88
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,733
Waiting for me?

89
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,591
I came after getting your message.

90
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:54,725
However.

91
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,733
You were not home.

92
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,435
And I can't get through your phone.

93
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,600
That text was sent.

94
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:02,266
So you've been waiting
here the whole afternoon?

95
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,900
Of course.

96
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:10,025
You're a sweetheart!

97
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:12,325
What are you talking about?

98
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,275
Nothing.

99
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,275
I'll give you half an hour to pack up.

100
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,425
Is it enough?

101
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:20,650
It won't take that long.

102
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,133
So fast!

103
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,250
Dr. Zhou has been waiting downstairs.

104
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,875
We are leaving now.

105
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,250
Be careful at others house.

106
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,450
I can't help you if you do anything wrong.

107
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,250
Yes madam.

108
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,650
Love you.

109
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:37,925
Buckle up.

110
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,800
You help me.

111
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,350
Do it yourself.

112
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,450
I am on your car.

113
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,450
You should guarantee my safety.

114
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:49,658
You help me.

115
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:30,223
You're awake.

116
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:31,791
We've already arrived?

117
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:35,665
But I'll take you to a place first.

118
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:45,131
Isn't this the famous store online?

119
00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:46,615
How did you know I want to come here?

120
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,040
I don't.

121
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,840
Grandma loves the sweet osmanthus
crispy here.

122
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:52,940
Oh, well.

123
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,940
I forgot to bring a present for grandma.

124
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:56,923
I know.

125
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,140
You know?

126
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:00,415
You are so thoughtful.

127
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:04,440
Did you bring me here
to buy a present for grandma?

128
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,473
Let's go.

129
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:07,998
Hello.

130
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:09,265
Welcome!

131
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:11,640
-One box of sweet osmanthus cake.
-Okay. Just a minute.

132
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:15,481
Is it rose sugar?

133
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:17,665
Yes. Rose sugar is rationed.

134
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,040
There's only one box left.

135
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:20,308
So hot.

136
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,601
I'm so lucky.

137
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,540
We got the last box.

138
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,044
Take it?

139
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,065
Welcome, see you next time.

140
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,465
I'm really lucky.

141
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,765
Walk on this side.

142
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,723
OK.

143
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:01,165
Sugar-coated haws!

144
00:17:02,165 --> 00:17:04,140
Sugar-coated haws.

145
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,873
That.

146
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,423
Let's go and see.

147
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,540
Go! Go! Go!

148
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:14,745
So cute!

149
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,818
Dr. Zhou, what do you think?

150
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,765
This...

151
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:22,615
I'll take silence as your agreement.

152
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:23,806
Pack them up.

153
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,723
OK.

154
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,006
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

155
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,340
Welcome, see you next time.

156
00:17:32,315 --> 00:17:33,148
What's up.

157
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,590
What's up?

158
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,890
This is for you.

159
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,541
-Here you are.
-You can keep that.

160
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,390
You refused me.

161
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:43,748
-I...
-You just said you like it.

162
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,390
When did I say that?

163
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:47,356
You didn't say anything, so you like it.

164
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,081
-I didn't say...
-No.

165
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:50,106
I give it to you.

166
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,023
Hold this...

167
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,481
hold it.

168
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:53,398
This is for you...

169
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,273
hold it.

170
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:56,831
Take it!

171
00:17:56,915 --> 00:17:57,840
Fine, I'll take it.

172
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,624
-It really...
-Let's go right now.

173
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,106
See, you like it.

174
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,140
You don't admit it.

175
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
We're here.

176
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,956
Shiyun. Miss Su.

177
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,031
Hard on the road?
Come on, hand this to me.

178
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:21,948
Please come in.

179
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:23,798
Go.

180
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,423
You.

181
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,865
What's wrong?

182
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,073
Hello.

183
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,515
Can I borrow an egg?

184
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,623
Egg?

185
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,623
You know.

186
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:49,190
People like me
have to eat a fried egg every morning.

187
00:18:49,765 --> 00:18:51,440
But I forgot to buy yesterday.

188
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,240
So I wonder,

189
00:18:54,115 --> 00:18:55,215
if I can borrow one from you.

190
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,623
Here you are.

191
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,273
Thank you.

192
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,690
You're welcome.

193
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,590
I heard that Jinbei and Shiyun
went back to their hometown together.

194
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:15,606
Yeah.

195
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,523
What's wrong?

196
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,323
It's fine.

197
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:21,115
I just envy them.

198
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,473
Envy?

199
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,740
You want to go home with Dr. Zhou?

200
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,740
I'm leaving if there
is nothing to trouble you.

201
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:48,190
Shiyun, Jinbei.

202
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,415
Welcome.

203
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,873
Brother.

204
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,156
Hello, Mr. Zhou.
Nice to meet you.

205
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,106
Nice to meet you.

206
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,165
You can call me brother like Shiyun.

207
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,123
OK.

208
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,073
Brother.

209
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:01,923
Are you Ok?

210
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:04,923
Yes, just a little tired.
I'm used to it.

211
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,065
You guys.
It's been hard all the way?

212
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:08,640
No, it's fine.

213
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:10,390
Have a good rest later.

214
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:12,156
But grandma knew that you are back.

215
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,890
She wants to meet you first.

216
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:15,640
We'll go see her now.

217
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,315
Grandma is copying scriptures in the back.
Go ahead.

218
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,423
OK.

219
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,473
Come here.

220
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,789
What happened to your brother?

221
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,340
Why is he on a wheelchair.

222
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,861
He's weak.

223
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:35,919
But he doesn't sit on it often.

224
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,365
Is your grandma easy to go with?

225
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,223
Are you afraid?

226
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:45,890
No.

227
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,940
I just want to be prepared.

228
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,765
Even if she is not so easy-going...

229
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,724
You're the granddaughter-in-law
she identified.

230
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,490
Do you think she will be hard on you?

231
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:55,615
That's true.

232
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,540
Give it to grandma yourself.

233
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,390
You are so thoughtful.

234
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:03,119
Go.

235
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,640
Brother.

236
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,706
You're finally back.
I haven't seen you for a long time.

237
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,715
Did you forget me?

238
00:21:19,915 --> 00:21:20,940
How can it be.

239
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:26,148
Grandma.

240
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,365
Grandma.

241
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:32,290
Jinbei is here.

242
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:35,190
Sorry I came to see you until now.

243
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,631
How are you recently?

244
00:21:36,715 --> 00:21:37,548
I am fine.

245
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:38,715
But you,

246
00:21:38,968 --> 00:21:41,140
I heard that you were in the hospital.

247
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:42,481
Are you fine now?

248
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:43,540
I'm fine.

249
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,690
Sorry to make you worried.

250
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,815
Have Shiyun take good care of you?

251
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,965
This is a little present
from Shiyun and me.

252
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,740
You went to the ancient town?

253
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:58,906
We heard that you like
the sweet osmanthus crispy there.

254
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,865
So we went.

255
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,390
I do love it.

256
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,765
It's baked this morning.

257
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,948
It's so tasty.

258
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,823
My second brother.

259
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,040
Is this rose sugar for me?

260
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,940
This.

261
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,065
It's for her.

262
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,740
Where's mine?

263
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,490
When we went there
there's only one left, so...

264
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,915
So you gave it to her?

265
00:22:26,315 --> 00:22:28,215
You knew I love it.

266
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:29,398
How could you?

267
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,148
Yingying.

268
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,323
It's rude.

269
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,965
Jinbei is our guest.

270
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,081
Shiyun.

271
00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:39,915
How long have you been away?

272
00:22:40,432 --> 00:22:41,281
Half a year.

273
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:42,390
Half a year?

274
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,265
I thought it's been a few years.

275
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:48,240
It's indeed half a year.

276
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,315
Grandma, are you losing your memory?

277
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,940
Did you have a physical
examination this year.

278
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,140
Don't worry.

279
00:22:57,565 --> 00:22:59,640
I'm well.

280
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:01,565
I'm relieved.

281
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,706
You must be very tired.

282
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,065
Go get some rest.

283
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,523
OK.

284
00:23:07,165 --> 00:23:09,040
Then we'll leave first.

285
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,590
Grandma.

286
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:16,815
Look at them.

287
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,140
Who is the little sister.

288
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:23,406
My sister.

289
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,323
Zhou Suying.

290
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,765
You never talk about her.

291
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,940
So you have a brother and a sister.

292
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:32,065
Yingying was rude to you just now.

293
00:23:32,315 --> 00:23:33,415
Please don't take it to heart.

294
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:37,540
How could I?
I thought she's cute.

295
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,965
Shiyun, Miss Su.
I have cleaned up your room.

296
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,340
We...

297
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,040
We share a room?

298
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,556
No.

299
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,040
Miss Su, your room is opposite to Shiyun.

300
00:23:50,565 --> 00:23:52,640
Then don't say it like that.

301
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,315
We'll misunderstand.

302
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,406
Yes.

303
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,965
You think too much.

304
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:00,410
What do you mean?

305
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,740
What does that mean?

306
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,590
Does he mean that
he's not interested in me?

307
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,940
Shiyun shouldn't mean that.

308
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:07,765
I think it is.

309
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,490
Miss Su, this way.

310
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,965
I think I should give the sugar
to the little sister.

311
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,040
But It's from Zhou Shiyun.

312
00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:37,015
The little sister has a lot
of opportunities to have it.

313
00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:38,640
Then I'll just taste it.

314
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:40,465
Just one.

315
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,215
So tasty.

316
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,823
Come on.

317
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,306
Just in time.
This is so tasty.

318
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,223
Try it.

319
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,415
I... I don't eat sweet food.

320
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,590
Just try it.

321
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:14,348
Try it.

322
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:15,756
How is it?

323
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,415
Is it good?

324
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,140
Why are you here?

325
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,540
I'm going to visit an old doctor later.

326
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:27,056
I'll be back before lunch.

327
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,565
You stay here
and don't make troubles.

328
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,815
Do you think I am a person that can
do nothing except making troubles?

329
00:25:34,444 --> 00:25:36,018
It's best that you are not
that kind of person.

330
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,215
Call me if you need anything.

331
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,365
Brother.

332
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,140
You are going somewhere?

333
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,265
You want to join the Heartbeats?

334
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,137
Come on, it's impossible.

335
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:05,331
Why?

336
00:26:05,415 --> 00:26:06,290
Why?

337
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:08,815
With everything that happened recently,

338
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:10,440
can't you explain why?

339
00:26:11,565 --> 00:26:13,731
There's so many listers in the company.

340
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:16,940
Why should I choose you
instead of them?

341
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:19,405
Brother Shui.

342
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:24,265
You should know
that someone's framing me.

343
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,281
Su Jinbei even cleared this out for me.

344
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:30,715
I believe this will be over soon.

345
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,415
Please.

346
00:26:37,615 --> 00:26:38,448
Brother Shui.

347
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:41,831
If I can join this variety show
I will perform well...

348
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:43,065
and win back my reputation.

349
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,756
Don't think about this now.

350
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,390
The company has basically decided to have
Cheng Feier and Xu Jiawei join this show.

351
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,290
You know Jiawei.

352
00:26:53,765 --> 00:26:56,823
The reputation of Cheng Feier
is equal to Jiawei.

353
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,140
This is best for the company.

354
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,932
It's Feier.

355
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,623
Shui.

356
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,140
You know.

357
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:12,215
She hasn't had a new show coming out
for almost two years.

358
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:14,940
She's just depending
on her old reputation.

359
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:18,340
She couldn't keep this going.

360
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:23,740
The company should give the newcomers
more opportunity.

361
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,106
You see.

362
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,415
The Misty Rain I played
is about to be released.

363
00:27:27,565 --> 00:27:29,115
Maybe the ratings will be good.

364
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,815
Then just wait until Misty Rain
have good results.

365
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,475
You are still young.

366
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:35,915
You'll have many opportunities
in the future.

367
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,881
All right.

368
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:39,815
I have a meeting to attend to.

369
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:52,148
Who is it?

370
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,406
You. You...

371
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,540
What are you doing?

372
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,840
Returning your favor.

373
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,415
You haven't had lunch yet?

374
00:28:06,165 --> 00:28:08,315
In order to return the favor
of an egg from Miss Wu Di,

375
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:10,490
I decide to treat you a hot pot.

376
00:28:10,915 --> 00:28:12,815
At my home?

377
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,431
Don't worry.

378
00:28:14,515 --> 00:28:15,706
You don't have to do anything.

379
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,715
Just help yourself.

380
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:17,806
No.

381
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:18,723
That.

382
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,990
It's just an egg.

383
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,090
It's more than that.

384
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,190
Drop of water
should be paid back with spring.

385
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,590
If you keep doing this.

386
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,990
How can I borrow things from you later.

387
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,273
-So heavy.
-No.

388
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:32,398
You.

389
00:28:48,515 --> 00:28:51,016
Yingying.
Jinbei is your future sister-in-law.

390
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:52,440
You should be polite.

391
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:57,340
It's not me, grandma.

392
00:28:57,765 --> 00:28:59,215
Didn't you notice,

393
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,515
that my second brother
doesn't care about me anymore?

394
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:03,548
This silly child.

395
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,306
Your brother treats Jinbei
and you differently.

396
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,175
There's nothing to compare.

397
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,434
I know.

398
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,490
But Su Jinbei is an actress.

399
00:29:15,765 --> 00:29:17,365
I'm afraid this woman is not that simple.

400
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,540
I'm worried that my brother
will be deceived by her.

401
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,815
You underestimated your brother.

402
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,098
-Yes.
-Madam.

403
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,030
What?

404
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:31,481
Aunt Song accidentally
cut her finger in the kitchen.

405
00:29:31,565 --> 00:29:32,540
Is it bad?

406
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,940
The wound has been bandaged up.

407
00:29:34,165 --> 00:29:34,998
But,

408
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:37,536
she might not be able to cook lunch.

409
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,573
It doesn't matter.

410
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:43,002
Call FuRongLou Restaurant
and place an order.

411
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:44,549
Yes.

412
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:45,952
Wait, Uncle Zhou.

413
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:51,624
Grandma I haven't eaten
the meal made by my brother.

414
00:29:51,774 --> 00:29:53,799
He rarely comes back.

415
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:55,424
Let's ask him to cook a meal.

416
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:58,690
You mean let Shiyun cook?

417
00:29:58,774 --> 00:30:01,249
Yeah, grandma likes
the food cooked by him, right?

418
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:04,999
His cooking is better
than FuRongLou Restaurant.

419
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:06,724
Just thinking about it...

420
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:09,849
I'm going to drool.

421
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:11,107
All right.

422
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:13,299
You naughty girl.

423
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:14,974
I'll listen to you.

424
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:16,849
Then I'll tell him now.

425
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:17,832
Go ahead.

426
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:30,682
Yingying.

427
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:34,524
Sister Yingying.

428
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,599
Jinbei, I'm sorry.

429
00:30:37,924 --> 00:30:40,699
Aunt Song, who is responsible
for our meals is hurt.

430
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:42,374
She can't cook lunch now.

431
00:30:42,724 --> 00:30:47,574
This is your first visit to our house
I shouldn't bother you.

432
00:30:48,074 --> 00:30:48,990
It's OK.

433
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:51,699
Tell me what you need.

434
00:30:52,449 --> 00:30:54,699
Can you help me cook?

435
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:57,949
Help you cook?

436
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,899
It's OK?

437
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:02,924
Ah, OK.

438
00:31:03,449 --> 00:31:04,624
But,

439
00:31:04,874 --> 00:31:06,549
I can't cook.

440
00:31:06,774 --> 00:31:08,690
I can only help.

441
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:10,357
It's OK. Follow me.

442
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,232
I think the seasoning is not enough
I'll go buy some.

443
00:31:28,924 --> 00:31:30,824
Wait a moment.
What about me?

444
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:32,249
It's urgent.

445
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:34,290
Just try your best.

446
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:35,207
I...

447
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:37,824
Aunt Song should have
washed the vegetables.

448
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:40,649
You just take care of the rest.

449
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,574
But I can't cook.

450
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,424
What should I do?

451
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:52,949
Grabbing my rose sugar
and my brother.

452
00:31:54,924 --> 00:31:57,282
Now brother is not here.

453
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,924
Let me see what you can do.

454
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:04,224
What should I do next?

455
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,524
Let me play first.

456
00:32:09,074 --> 00:32:11,374
I'll try the new voice changer.

457
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,232
Hello everyone! I am Prince Wuque.
Can you hear me?

458
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:24,699
Which character do you want me to play?

459
00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:29,540
Forget it.

460
00:32:29,624 --> 00:32:31,192
Don't trouble him.

461
00:32:31,374 --> 00:32:33,149
He must be busy.

462
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:39,890
There's no meat.

463
00:32:39,974 --> 00:32:42,299
It's not good for my meal.

464
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:47,699
There should be something in the fridge.

465
00:32:52,574 --> 00:32:53,965
So many meat dishes.

466
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:55,949
All half-cooked.

467
00:32:56,124 --> 00:32:58,149
God helped me.

468
00:32:58,924 --> 00:33:01,549
Little piglet.

469
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:15,058
But...

470
00:33:15,374 --> 00:33:17,699
It needs to be cooked further.

471
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,274
Hello, do you have any instructions?

472
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:31,840
Didi. It's urgent.

473
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:34,707
Help me find some Chinese food recipe
and read it to me.

474
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:35,774
I'll follow.

475
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:38,099
What the hell!

476
00:33:38,274 --> 00:33:40,224
Hurry!
I can't explain, hurry up.

477
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:42,715
What? What kind of recipe do you want?

478
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,624
I have something half-cooked here.

479
00:33:44,843 --> 00:33:47,218
Just tell me how to cook them.

480
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:48,231
I see.

481
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:53,700
There's one recipe about how to cook
brown sauce braised pork...

482
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:55,690
Brown sauce braised pork.

483
00:33:55,774 --> 00:33:56,849
Yes, yes.

484
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:59,324
Two carrots, cut into hob pieces,

485
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:03,490
And then?

486
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,249
Then cut and let the shredded onion
and ginger for standby.

487
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:09,199
Open the fire.

488
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,340
Oh, my gosh.

489
00:34:13,424 --> 00:34:15,824
I forgot you can't even open fire.

490
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:17,049
It looks open.

491
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,974
Pour oil into the pot.

492
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:21,315
What's wrong?

493
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:23,974
Nothing, nothing.
I was frightened.

494
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,165
Su Jinbei, don't cut the China
without the diamond.

495
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:31,699
You are not better at acting
but you gained much confidence.

496
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:33,040
Holy shit!

497
00:34:33,124 --> 00:34:35,174
Cooking is killing me.

498
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:36,824
Ready for lunch.

499
00:34:40,674 --> 00:34:42,549
Why is there man's voice?

500
00:34:42,774 --> 00:34:43,799
Ah...

501
00:34:43,974 --> 00:34:45,024
Just a plumber.

502
00:34:45,224 --> 00:34:46,057
What?

503
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,599
A plumber?

504
00:34:48,874 --> 00:34:50,899
A plumber even cooks for you?

505
00:34:51,574 --> 00:34:52,490
Su Jinbei.

506
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:55,074
Will you cook or not?
Otherwise I'll hang up.

507
00:34:55,324 --> 00:34:56,240
Yes yes.

508
00:34:56,324 --> 00:34:58,049
There's many vegetables here.

509
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:30,499
It's done.

510
00:35:31,574 --> 00:35:33,124
I'm dead tired.

511
00:35:36,874 --> 00:35:38,024
What's that smell?

512
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,349
I'll go take a shower.

513
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:48,682
Miss Su.

514
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:49,965
Lunch is ready.

515
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:51,299
Ask everyone to eat.

516
00:35:51,674 --> 00:35:52,507
OK.

517
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:07,850
I didn't expect that I, Su Jinbei
will cook someday.

518
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:11,906
-It's yummy! You are really talented.
-Watch out.

519
00:36:12,874 --> 00:36:14,674
Grandma. You're persistent.

520
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:16,884
You did not eat meat one month ahead
for ancestor worship.

521
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:18,524
I can't do that.

522
00:36:19,174 --> 00:36:20,474
You damn girl!

523
00:36:22,324 --> 00:36:23,157
Look.

524
00:36:23,374 --> 00:36:24,274
It...

525
00:36:25,974 --> 00:36:29,624
Grandma.
I'm not good at cooking, sorry.

526
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:31,024
Jinbei.

527
00:36:31,174 --> 00:36:32,699
Did you use the food in the fridge?

528
00:36:35,324 --> 00:36:36,474
The meat.

529
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:41,574
I think there's only vegetables,

530
00:36:41,874 --> 00:36:45,215
so I took some meat from the fridge
and cooked the meal.

531
00:36:46,474 --> 00:36:47,499
What's wrong?

532
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,024
Any problem?

533
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:53,299
Grandma will not eat meat
before ancestor worship.

534
00:36:53,474 --> 00:36:55,962
What do you mean by cooking so many meat.

535
00:36:56,374 --> 00:37:00,225
Grandma, sorry.
I didn't know, so.

536
00:37:04,535 --> 00:37:06,299
I did it wrong.

537
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:10,407
It's fine.

538
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:13,664
Grandma.

539
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:15,911
-Jinbei is here for the first time.
-I didn't know, It's OK.

540
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,749
It's normal that she didn't know.

541
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:20,399
She can ask.

542
00:37:20,774 --> 00:37:22,449
How can she use the sacrifice at will.

543
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,174
Your were at the kitchen.

544
00:37:24,524 --> 00:37:25,924
Why don't you tell her.

545
00:37:27,724 --> 00:37:28,799
I...

546
00:37:29,324 --> 00:37:31,649
I forgot.

547
00:37:32,174 --> 00:37:33,799
But she destroyed the sacrifice.

548
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:36,249
What should we use
for the ancestor worship tomorrow?
