=Episode 12=

3
00:01:37,603 --> 00:01:38,553
Don't worry, Mr. Yue.

4
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:42,159
With Jinbei as the spokesperson,

5
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,900
your company image will be improved
in a short time.

6
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:45,933
Alright.

7
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,210
Okay.

8
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:49,360
Let's meet at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

9
00:01:50,294 --> 00:01:52,719
So let's sign the contract then.

10
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:54,678
Okay, see you tomorrow.

11
00:01:55,404 --> 00:01:56,244
Bye bye.

12
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,626
Wow, Wu Di.

13
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:03,426
We were born at the same day.

14
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:05,875
What? You always loves bragging.

15
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:08,120
Really.

16
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,000
Look.

17
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:19,418
Is that true?

18
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,120
Yeah, it is.

19
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,140
What a coincidence!

20
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:26,653
What a coincidence, right?

21
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:28,427
Then.

22
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:29,960
We can celebrate
our birthdays together every year.

23
00:02:38,176 --> 00:02:39,069
-Hello.
-Hi.

24
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,471
What's going on over there?

25
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,560
Have you seen Jiawei?

26
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:44,560
It's time to get in.

27
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,381
Yingying.

28
00:02:50,147 --> 00:02:51,163
Of course.

29
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,720
And Su Jinbei said to him that
I am her sister.

30
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:56,188
So Su Jinbei is not bad for you.

31
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,451
You're going to make up with her.

32
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,270
I've already done this.

33
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,092
That was to relax her vigilance.

34
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,632
I'll play a good trick on her later.

35
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,348
You're finally speaking your mind.

36
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:10,267
You little girl, just wait and see
I'll take you down today.

37
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:11,800
Well, yes.

38
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:14,400
Not until she breaks up with my brother.

39
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:16,170
I'll fight to death against her.

40
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:17,951
Well, come on.

41
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:19,820
Well, alright.

42
00:03:19,903 --> 00:03:21,697
Well, let's leave it at that.

43
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:30,607
Jiawei.

44
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:33,139
As for this new song
you're about to launch.

45
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,200
Does it have any special meaning?

46
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:38,200
I want to give this song
to someone special.

47
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:43,738
You've met Xu Jiawei.

48
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:46,440
Let's go home
I haven't listen to his song.

49
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,703
I'm not feeling well now.

50
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:53,584
I don't want to see it.

51
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,709
No.
I'll stay here waiting his song.

52
00:03:59,103 --> 00:03:59,943
Okay.

53
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:01,666
You just stay here.

54
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:05,407
And then after the security guard comes
you'll be arrested as a suspect.

55
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:06,388
Will you?

56
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:08,773
Oh Wait...

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,450
Since you brought me here
then let me see the show.

58
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,800
Or...

59
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,552
Why you don't go back and have a rest.

60
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:19,462
Give me the ticket.

61
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:20,440
I'll see it myself.

62
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:23,300
Ticket.

63
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:26,650
Where did I put it?

64
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,080
I can't remember.

65
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:30,211
You lost the ticket.

66
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:34,441
It doesn't seem so important anyway.

67
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:40,440
Su Jinbei, are you kidding me?

68
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:41,440
Yes, I am.

69
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:43,702
So, you can tease me,

70
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:44,800
why can't I tease you?

71
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,293
You eavesdropped on me? You...

72
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:51,200
I just happened to hear it.

73
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:53,232
Stop saying such eavesdropping words.

74
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:56,240
You must have been eavesdropping on me
and your brother for many times.

75
00:04:57,287 --> 00:04:58,127
By the way.

76
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:02,094
Xu Jiawei may
have a good impression on you.

77
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,920
What if he knows you are capricious.

78
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:06,600
What would he think?

79
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:10,880
Su Jinbei, you're just mean.

80
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,040
Am I mean?

81
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:14,480
Miss Zhou.

82
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:17,280
Young girl, you won't
have such a bad memory.

83
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:19,120
Think about that for a second.

84
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:22,440
Since we've met
have I ever did something bad for you?

85
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,761
Because of your brother
I don't want to argue with you.

86
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,384
Sometimes it feels like
turning a blind eye is the best choice.

87
00:05:28,424 --> 00:05:29,935
But think about it, little sister.

88
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,520
I, Su Jinbei, worked in the show-biz
for so many years.

89
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,160
If I don't have any
ability to defend myself,

90
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,080
could I be as successful as I am today.

91
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:40,501
I really didn't want to worry about you.

92
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:42,696
But have you thought about it.

93
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:45,120
If I do fight back,

94
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,440
can you handle it?

95
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:51,400
Are you really going to
keep doing this to me?

96
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:54,585
You...

97
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,905
How dare you tell Jiawei, I will...

98
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:57,802
So what?

99
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,040
I'll tell my brother.

100
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:02,721
Okay.
Your brother?

101
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,120
Are you going to tell your brother
what you said on the phone...

102
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:07,999
Or...

103
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,360
What did you do?

104
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:20,550
Weren't you aggressive just now?

105
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:21,520
What's wrong with you?

106
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,812
Do you have a sensitive heart?

107
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:24,754
Please don't cry.

108
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:26,078
I was just trying to scare you.

109
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,006
Don't cry.
Would you please stop? Just stop crying.

110
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:29,930
Stop crying! Okay?

111
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:32,426
Okay?

112
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:38,040
I've played tricks on you so many times.

113
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:40,494
Don't you hate me?

114
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,120
How could you just want to scare me?

115
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:46,956
I just...
I was just trying to scare you.

116
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:49,221
You show up wherever your
brother and I appear every day.

117
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:50,240
I'm sick of it.

118
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:54,600
Then what do you want?

119
00:06:58,429 --> 00:06:59,751
What do I want?

120
00:07:00,947 --> 00:07:06,370
Did Xu just say
he needs a new assistant.

121
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:12,720
You're going to make me his assistant.

122
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:16,844
You are my sister.

123
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:19,616
If I talk to him,

124
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:21,720
maybe he will not turn me down.

125
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,440
Are you willing to do this?

126
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,160
Perhaps it's okay to do this.

127
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:30,588
But...

128
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:34,889
You have to promise me first.

129
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,879
What is it?

130
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:42,640
That is...

131
00:07:43,454 --> 00:07:44,880
you must work hard.

132
00:07:45,196 --> 00:07:48,022
I don't want to be accused of
using my connections...

133
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:49,884
get Xu Jiawei into trouble.

134
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:53,640
That's all.

135
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:55,583
That's all.

136
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,841
Hey, honey.

137
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,583
I've booked a restaurant.

138
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:06,537
I'll send you the address.

139
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,040
You can come straight to the private room.

140
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,960
No, I'll go there myself.

141
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:13,560
And Yingying?

142
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,819
She's waiting for the concert.

143
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:19,040
She wouldn't go with us.

144
00:08:19,352 --> 00:08:20,636
See you later, bye.

145
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,960
Alright, see you later.

146
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,160
I'm afraid I have to take my leave.

147
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:35,662
Wonderful.

148
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:38,000
You won't go there?

149
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,960
Your brother is more important.

150
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:43,746
Bye.

151
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:50,726
Something is wrong with the equipment.

152
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:51,994
We may have to delay the opening.

153
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:53,389
How bad is it?

154
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:54,400
We'll fix it as soon as possible.

155
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,560
Okay, thank you.

156
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:01,720
Let's go back to the green room.

157
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:03,080
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

158
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:10,396
Jiawei.

159
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:11,550
Why are you alone here?

160
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:12,909
Where's Jinbei?

161
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,401
She...

162
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:16,446
She left because she has something to do.

163
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:18,085
Left?

164
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:21,600
Then, when will she come back?

165
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,680
I'm afraid she...

166
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:28,720
It's okay. I see.

167
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:30,589
Then you just go and find a seat.

168
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,530
The show is about to begin.

169
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:32,528
Alright.

170
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:35,151
Come on!

171
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:36,032
Go ahead.

172
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:40,024
Good.

173
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:43,160
Try it later.

174
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:48,840
The last song...

175
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,597
will be canceled.

176
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:52,520
Cancel?

177
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,310
Well...

178
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,613
Honey.

179
00:09:58,653 --> 00:09:59,493
You're here.

180
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:00,600
You should be so anxious, right?

181
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:06,261
Hungry?

182
00:10:06,446 --> 00:10:07,434
What do you like to eat?

183
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:09,280
Why don't you choose some? I'm okay.

184
00:10:09,668 --> 00:10:10,508
Alright.

185
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:13,085
Honey, do you often come here?

186
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,982
No, it's a membership-oriented restaurant

187
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:16,000
so it's usually quiet here.

188
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,343
I was almost recognized just now.

189
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,187
-You alright?
-It's fine.

190
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:23,716
I know the man
who was in the hall just now.

191
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,337
It's the investment boss.

192
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:27,550
who became interested in the
film-television industry these two years.

193
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,616
So I have dealt with him.

194
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:35,183
It's you, Miss Su.

195
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:37,082
Hello.

196
00:10:37,123 --> 00:10:38,764
Xiaoliu told me he saw you just now.

197
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:39,880
I can't believe.

198
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,200
Really?

199
00:10:41,978 --> 00:10:44,080
I always want to work
with you since last year.

200
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,201
But you've been busy all this time.

201
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:48,308
It's not easy to meet you.

202
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:51,240
Let's take a picture.

203
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:52,935
Alright.

204
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:54,640
Dude, take a picture for us.

205
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:00,543
Here, Xiaoliu.

206
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:06,477
Okay.

207
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:12,890
Good.

208
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:17,040
Miss Su, I give a dinner party today.

209
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,868
Why don't you join us for a drink
and roll logs for me?

210
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:23,640
Er...

211
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:25,575
Are you through?

212
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,084
-Hey, buddy.
-Take off your hand.

213
00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:33,316
Hey, you...

214
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:34,197
Waiter.

215
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,134
Mr. Zhou, can I help you?

216
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:39,320
This is a private conversation.

217
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:41,960
Someone has broken into my private room.

218
00:11:42,604 --> 00:11:43,574
How to deal with it?

219
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,450
Mr. Wang, your table is in the lobby.

220
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:46,519
Please go back.

221
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:47,972
So what?

222
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:49,154
Looking down me?

223
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:51,960
You said there wasn't a private room,

224
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:53,822
so we could just stay in the lobby.

225
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:54,922
Sorry.

226
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:56,499
Mr. Zhou is our top VIP.

227
00:11:56,712 --> 00:11:58,253
We have to take care
of his top VIP experience.

228
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,708
Please go back.

229
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:02,320
You want to go out of business?

230
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:06,437
Forget it. I know their rules.

231
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:07,443
Let's go.

232
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,585
Miss Su, see you later.

233
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:12,466
Bye.

234
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:18,202
I’m sorry, Mr. Zhou.

235
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:26,749
That's over, bro?

236
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,216
You, are you stupid?

237
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
You haven't made any progress yet.

238
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,068
Do you know why I
treated them to this meal?

239
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:35,813
The members here are all important people.

240
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:38,840
A senior member
would be a top VIP here.

241
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,480
I was scared to death.

242
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:48,141
What?

243
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,647
I thought you were going to fight.

244
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,456
But, honey...

245
00:12:52,497 --> 00:12:54,944
I can never expect that
you would have such a reaction.

246
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:56,600
He wanted my fiancee to drink with him.

247
00:12:57,182 --> 00:12:58,386
Shouldn't I react like that?

248
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,236
I'm so sorry.

249
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:02,021
Because I'm a star,

250
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:04,280
there will always be such
unnecessary distraction.

251
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:11,851
Well, take it easy.

252
00:13:12,181 --> 00:13:13,039
Cheer up.

253
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,680
Don't let this bother you, okay?

254
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,783
Do you know.

255
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:21,972
You were so handsome just now
like a strong boyfriend.

256
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:25,322
Order now.

257
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,183
You're hungry, aren't you?

258
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,064
I'm hungry.

259
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:31,087
What's this?

260
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:10,320
Brother and sister, I'm back.

261
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,607
No.

262
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:16,440
How was the concert?

263
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,209
Wonderful.

264
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:22,297
Jiawei sang so well.

265
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:24,120
And the atmosphere was pretty good.

266
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:28,844
But he just seemed to
wander off a few times.

267
00:14:29,423 --> 00:14:30,483
I'm wondering why.

268
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:34,012
You went to Xu Jiawei's...

269
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:37,920
show tonight?

270
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:39,146
Yeah.

271
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,743
Sister, I tell you.

272
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:42,743
His new song.

273
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,643
Oh, my baby.

274
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:45,845
It's getting late.

275
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:48,240
Let's all get some sleep.

276
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:52,840
Go.

277
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:54,655
Go sleep.

278
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:02,183
Miss Su.

279
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:03,837
Please check the contract again.

280
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:05,351
Alright.

281
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,166
During the contract period,

282
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,200
I must remain single.

283
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:24,400
No gossip, no public romance.

284
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:30,742
You sign it first.

285
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:32,907
Why?

286
00:15:33,912 --> 00:15:34,840
What's wrong?

287
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:36,621
No problem, no problem.

288
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:01,983
I'm engaged.

289
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:03,651
How could I sign a contract like that.

290
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:07,080
The company wants you to
get the spokesperson contract.

291
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:11,067
I know you don't like it.

292
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:13,235
But I have tried my best...

293
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:15,245
to help you talk about
rights and interests.

294
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:20,499
The company can give you better resources.

295
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,871
But sometimes...

296
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:24,195
you have to give the company
what it wants, right?

297
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,019
The contract is only for one year.

298
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,560
You just keep secret for a year
that you have a fiance.

299
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,960
I will arrange you to take
promotional photos these two days.

300
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,800
Please don't ruin it for me.

301
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:37,880
I see.

302
00:16:56,704 --> 00:16:58,302
You were full of energy yesterday.

303
00:16:58,619 --> 00:16:59,875
What's wrong with you today?

304
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:03,520
It's a long story.

305
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:08,400
Oh, baby, I'm back.

306
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:10,182
Stop that, I'm working.

307
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,200
Cried out the youth.

308
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:18,200
I'll be pissed off.

309
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,100
Zhou.

310
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,367
If two are too close,

311
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:36,440
will they have some conflicts?

312
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:53,280
-I'll go over there.
-Alright.

313
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,140
Get me some ice cream?

314
00:17:56,272 --> 00:17:57,160
Don't flatter yourself.

315
00:17:57,795 --> 00:17:59,022
It's for myself.

316
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:02,361
A vanilla ice cream.

317
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:03,314
Okay. Just a minute.

318
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:11,760
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

319
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:15,801
You don't even eat ice cream.

320
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:17,787
If you want to buy it for me, just say so.

321
00:18:17,828 --> 00:18:18,668
Give it to me.

322
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,040
It's really for yourself.

323
00:18:22,594 --> 00:18:24,163
I wonder whether it tastes good.

324
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,103
Somebody gets a twinkle in her eye.

325
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,001
Shall we eat together?

326
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,354
Of course.

327
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:50,326
Hey.

328
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:52,200
Jiawei, the site is done.

329
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:53,541
Really?

330
00:18:54,037 --> 00:18:54,879
Thank you.

331
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,760
It's fine.

332
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,782
By the way, order me a bunch of flowers.

333
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,404
Rose will be okay.

334
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:17,676
Hey.

335
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:20,541
Zitong, something went wrong.

336
00:19:20,753 --> 00:19:21,683
Why?

337
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:24,834
Our rehearsal site was booked by Jiawei.

338
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:26,677
How could this be?

339
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:28,375
How could our company have
such a conflicting arrangement?

340
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,240
It seems that Jiawei booked
it on an individual basis.

341
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:32,736
The company probably didn't know.

342
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,735
So Jiawei will have an event that day.

343
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,720
Never mind. Let's reschedule.

344
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,870
Will that be nice?

345
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:45,556
If Jiawei does have an event that day,

346
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:47,154
it's not a good idea
to select the same day.

347
00:19:47,195 --> 00:19:48,720
I mean, he's more popular now than I am.

348
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:50,486
Be it so.

349
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,360
What's this?

350
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:13,480
That's what you told me
the horror movie that would make me cry.

351
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,000
It's not too scary.

352
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:16,320
You underestimate me.

353
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:53,080
Has the ghost gone?

354
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,660
Gone.

355
00:21:07,912 --> 00:21:09,960
Is... is the man still alive?

356
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,730
You scared me to death.

357
00:21:54,951 --> 00:21:56,207
Well, let's stop it there.

358
00:21:57,636 --> 00:22:00,160
Your camera work is amazing, Miss Su.

359
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,521
Let's take a break.

360
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:02,808
We'll do the second one later.

361
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:04,290
-Alright.
-Thank you. Thank you.

362
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,499
Sister, your call.

363
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,120
What's the problem, Jiawei?

364
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,840
Are you busy?

365
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:13,839
Well, you can go on.

366
00:22:14,974 --> 00:22:16,817
I want to talk to you
about something tonight.

367
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:17,946
Are you free?

368
00:22:18,157 --> 00:22:19,156
What's up?

369
00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:21,320
We'll talk about it later, okay?

370
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,040
Well, that's fine.
I've got something to ask you anyway.

371
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,317
See you later.

372
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:28,344
Bye.

373
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:36,041
Jiawei.

374
00:22:36,948 --> 00:22:38,260
Jinbei, you're here.

375
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,560
How do you get to the theater?

376
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:40,640
There's a show tonight.

377
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:42,718
Let's go in and have a look.

378
00:22:44,422 --> 00:22:46,689
By the way, the last time you said
you were looking for an assistant.

379
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,758
Is that serious?

380
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,183
Of course.

381
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,729
Let me recommend someone to you.

382
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:54,080
You've met her before.

383
00:22:54,517 --> 00:22:55,647
That's my sister Suying.

384
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:57,792
She's a great girl and she's smart.

385
00:22:58,013 --> 00:22:59,554
Maybe you can give her a chance.

386
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,420
Alright.

387
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,669
Since you said that,

388
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,559
that'll be good.

389
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,699
Why nobody's here?

390
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,640
Jinbei, wait a minute.

391
00:23:31,255 --> 00:23:32,106
Zitong.

392
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:32,987
Xiaowai.

393
00:23:33,444 --> 00:23:34,640
What's today's activity of Jiawei?

394
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,749
Well, Zitong.

395
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,442
Now is not a great time.

396
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,860
I'll just go in and see Jiawei.

397
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,934
It won't cause you any trouble.

398
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:44,437
Zitong.

399
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:49,614
I was going to use this site today.

400
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:52,502
I heard Jiawei is here
so I just gave up the site.

401
00:23:52,543 --> 00:23:53,742
Let me take a look.

402
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,674
Just let her in.

403
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:18,560
Jinbei.

404
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,720
I want to sing a new song today.

405
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:24,334
I'd like you to listen to it for me.

406
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,273
Alright.

407
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:07,996
Jinbei.

408
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:11,760
I wrote it especially for you.

409
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:13,731
On the day of the fan meeting,

410
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:15,480
I meant to sing it to you.

411
00:26:20,903 --> 00:26:22,444
But if you can't hear it,

412
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,160
it has no meaning at all.

413
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:30,631
Jiawei.

414
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:33,381
You don't have to take me
for such an important person.

415
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:38,545
But, you, Jinbei for me
is the most important person.

416
00:26:39,424 --> 00:26:40,274
Jiawei, I...

417
00:26:40,314 --> 00:26:41,154
Please let me finish.

418
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:42,975
I see.

419
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:48,000
All this time, you've just treated me like
an innocent boy.

420
00:26:48,948 --> 00:26:50,418
Even when we recorded a reality TV show,

421
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:51,457
you had to take care of me.

422
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:55,953
But since I was 16
and went abroad for training till now.

423
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:57,680
You know, in this show-biz...

424
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,654
you're the only one
who care for me like this.

425
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:02,942
So...

426
00:27:04,068 --> 00:27:07,853
I don't want to be the one
who was always protected by you.

427
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,164
I want to be the one...

428
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,898
who can always protect
and take care of you, Jinbei.

429
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:16,178
So, Jinbei.

430
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:18,826
Will you give me the chance?

431
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,320
Listen to me, Jiawei.

432
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,973
Even if you want to
protect me and care for me,

433
00:27:27,424 --> 00:27:30,625
it's not the same thing as a relationship
between a man and a woman.

434
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,080
I've always regard you as
a cute brother of mine and...

435
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:35,714
a hardworking junior fellow.

436
00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:40,902
I'll help you whenever you're in need
which is all that I should and I will do.

437
00:27:41,122 --> 00:27:42,035
That's all.

438
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:43,872
Just like you,

439
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:46,110
you must treat me as a reliable sister.

440
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,944
That's very kind of you
to invite me and listen to your new song.

441
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,447
I trust you.

442
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:51,920
I think you're very talented.

443
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:53,653
I'll always stand by you.

444
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:55,841
Then I'll go.

445
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,280
Jinbei, just wait.

446
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:02,289
I know you can't believe
my feelings for you.

447
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:04,503
But can you give me some time?

448
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:05,960
Let me prove myself.

449
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:07,981
I'm afraid not.

450
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,440
But why?

451
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,800
I have a fiance.

452
00:28:17,712 --> 00:28:20,080
A... fiance?

453
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,120
Yes, that's...

454
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:28,574
Dr. Zhou?

455
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:31,169
Yes.

456
00:28:34,093 --> 00:28:35,320
Why you like him?

457
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,840
I like him...

458
00:28:43,047 --> 00:28:46,843
maybe because of the light
of his profession...

459
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,103
and handsome appearance.

460
00:28:50,156 --> 00:28:54,126
Or, maybe carelessly
he is extremely considerate towards me.

461
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:59,240
Or maybe
whenever I need protection,

462
00:29:00,054 --> 00:29:01,179
he always has the force of a boyfriend.

463
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,682
Maybe he treats the world
as cold as marble,

464
00:29:07,624 --> 00:29:10,680
but only gives his tenderness to me.

465
00:29:13,674 --> 00:29:16,899
I like everything about him.

466
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:25,526
Thank you...

467
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,735
for telling me so.

468
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:35,819
Well, after hearing these
maybe you don't like me as much anymore.

469
00:29:37,206 --> 00:29:38,547
Trust me, Jiawei.

470
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:42,320
One day, you're going to meet someone
who makes you love everything about her.

471
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,120
I got to go.

472
00:30:28,002 --> 00:30:28,842
Jiawei.

473
00:30:30,468 --> 00:30:31,400
Why are you here?

474
00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:42,240
Did you hear everything?

475
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:49,200
So it's really about her.

476
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,960
Because of her?

477
00:30:54,994 --> 00:30:57,200
You gave me the cold shoulder.

478
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,280
It's all about her, right?

479
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:03,317
Zitong.

480
00:31:03,744 --> 00:31:05,000
I've just told you.

481
00:31:05,688 --> 00:31:08,800
Jinbei has nothing
to do with our relationship.

482
00:31:09,629 --> 00:31:10,480
Jiawei.

483
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,960
No. It's just you deserve better.

484
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,440
You don't have to tell me.

485
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:17,721
Don't you get it...

486
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:20,480
that her heart does not belong to you.

487
00:31:21,204 --> 00:31:22,960
She loves someone else.

488
00:31:24,326 --> 00:31:26,840
But you are in my heart.

489
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:29,627
Jiawei.

490
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,520
Why won't you pay much attention to me?

491
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:35,431
Zitong.

492
00:31:37,388 --> 00:31:38,301
You and I...

493
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:41,280
It's never going to happen.

494
00:32:36,946 --> 00:32:38,772
What did we say before?

495
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:41,216
It's not the right time.

496
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:43,560
You told me to focus on acting.

497
00:32:45,784 --> 00:32:46,811
Su Jinbei.

498
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,986
You gave me a hard time.

499
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,200
So will I.

500
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:54,524
We have a task this time.

501
00:32:55,634 --> 00:32:57,432
What did we say before?

502
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:00,188
Just chase him then dump him.

503
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:03,200
Revenge him for absence
from the engagement party.

504
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,870
Yeah.

505
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:07,723
He even brought you home
for ancestor worship.

506
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:10,301
Wouldn't it be nice to stop?

507
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,840
Not yet.

508
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:15,760
But when?

509
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:18,080
Do you mean it is a joke
to went home with him?

510
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,321
Of course.

511
00:33:19,361 --> 00:33:22,271
Maybe he'll accompany me
to go home someday.

512
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:26,572
You told me to focus on acting.

513
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:27,754
I'm just going to practice on him.

514
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:31,851
Are you serious?

515
00:33:33,475 --> 00:33:34,959
I'm kidding.

516
00:33:35,144 --> 00:33:37,741
Ancestor worship is such a big thing
I can't be messing around.

517
00:33:38,243 --> 00:33:41,040
Well, I just...

518
00:33:41,494 --> 00:33:44,148
You are serious.

519
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:45,560
I've got it.

520
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:50,247
Fine, I'll let you alone.

521
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,600
But remember,
don't let it interfere with your work.

522
00:33:53,939 --> 00:33:55,452
Yes, my dear Di.

523
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,640
Enjoy your job.

524
00:33:58,386 --> 00:33:59,271
Yes sir.

525
00:34:09,126 --> 00:34:10,610
Xu Jiawei made a love confession.

526
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:15,200
He invited me to go to the theater
and listened to his new song.

527
00:34:15,832 --> 00:34:18,317
Then he told me
that song is written especially for me.

528
00:34:18,652 --> 00:34:19,492
And then?

529
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:21,120
Of course, I refused.

530
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:24,320
You just said no face to face?

531
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:26,317
Of course

532
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,412
I'm going to get him out of this mind.

533
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:30,240
Well done.

534
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:35,774
But this is probably his first time
to meet with a refusal.

535
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:41,120
But I do have my honey.

536
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:44,108
Again?

537
00:34:44,993 --> 00:34:46,960
Remember, tomorrow morning,

538
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,445
there's a live stream of skincare.

539
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,570
Go to bed early.

540
00:34:51,043 --> 00:34:51,883
I see.

541
00:34:52,082 --> 00:34:52,922
Bye.

542
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,195
Hello everyone! I am Jinbei.

543
00:35:08,529 --> 00:35:11,307
Today, I put together a list
of questions from my fans.

544
00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:15,343
One of the questions is that
how to reduce swelling quickly.

545
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:17,798
Today, I'm going to introduce it to you.
This one.

546
00:35:17,925 --> 00:35:22,320
You can use it from the chin to the ears.

547
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:24,531
It helps us eliminate edema effectively.

548
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:27,088
Dear.
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

549
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:29,869
The live broadcast began.

550
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,140
Hurry up! It's on.

551
00:35:31,181 --> 00:35:32,235
Well, let me have a look.

552
00:35:32,276 --> 00:35:33,116
Hurry up.

553
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,075
Pretty.

554
00:35:36,116 --> 00:35:38,199
Of course! She's my daughter.

555
00:35:38,298 --> 00:35:39,144
She looks like me.

556
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:40,361
Well, well, well, yes.

557
00:35:40,401 --> 00:35:41,372
Her dad's cute, too.

558
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:43,040
Maybe she looks like me more.

559
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:44,960
A lot of people are watching.

560
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:45,919
Really?

561
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,992
Those are all compliments.

562
00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:48,289
She has so many fans.

563
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:53,640
Actually, they don't know
she has a beautiful mummy.

564
00:35:54,624 --> 00:35:56,622
If you like me, give me gifts.

565
00:35:58,974 --> 00:36:01,514
Thank you all, thank you a lot.

566
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,000
Speaking of hand care.

567
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:06,610
Let me share with you my methods.

568
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:09,508
This is the hand essence I usually use.

569
00:36:09,549 --> 00:36:11,564
It makes my hands more beautiful.

570
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:13,486
It's actually easy to make.

571
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:14,617
First, we have to prepare this.

572
00:36:14,657 --> 00:36:15,770
All kinds of presents.

573
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,680
Exactly.

574
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:19,880
This pearl powder.

575
00:36:21,694 --> 00:36:24,600
Why there's a man.

576
00:36:25,873 --> 00:36:26,920
Su Jinbei.

577
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:30,600
Usually, we not only
take care of our hands...

578
00:36:30,641 --> 00:36:31,481
but also...

579
00:36:33,328 --> 00:36:34,168
also...

580
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,868
What are you talking about?

581
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:41,561
What's wrong?

582
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:45,319
What should I do?

583
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:46,510
Tell the truth?

584
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,001
No... No... No...

585
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,281
I just signed the contract yesterday.

586
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:50,719
Wu Di will kill me.

587
00:36:59,277 --> 00:37:00,320
You've seen it.

588
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:01,747
Don't take it wrong.

589
00:37:01,983 --> 00:37:04,223
That gentleman is my new driver.

590
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,572
I forgot to tell him I have a live today.

591
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:07,583
I'm sorry.

592
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:09,841
Alright, let's go on, okay?

593
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,384
I just mentioned.

594
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:13,842
He?

595
00:37:14,186 --> 00:37:16,783
He's gone because he's so shy.

596
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:18,340
What I just mentioned?

597
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:19,877
Right.
Reduce swelling quickly.

598
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:24,060
My suggestion is not to drink water
after 9:00 at night.

599
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,401
Okay, that's all for today.

600
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:27,591
See you next time.

601
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:29,372
Bye bye.

602
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,801
It's finally finished.

603
00:37:39,483 --> 00:37:40,323
Honey.

604
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,921
Where are you going.

605
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:42,801
To the hospital.

606
00:37:43,963 --> 00:37:44,803
To...

607
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:52,280
It's weekend.

608
00:38:01,957 --> 00:38:03,013
Good morning, Dr. Zhou.

609
00:38:06,728 --> 00:38:09,720
He's scary today.

610
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,116
I can feel the danger
even from far away.

611
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,842
Isn't it Dr. Xiao's shift today?

612
00:38:40,105 --> 00:38:41,280
Why are you here?

613
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:42,880
Isn't my shift today?

614
00:38:44,426 --> 00:38:45,368
You can go home now.

615
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,120
No.

616
00:38:47,246 --> 00:38:48,359
Why are you here?

617
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:49,667
You should be happy for your holiday.

618
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Cut the crap.

619
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:57,206
It looks like
you're either on your period...

620
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,400
or kicked out by your fiancee.

621
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:03,800
-Are you going to leave or not?
-Of course, yes.

622
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm so happy to take a day off.

623
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,779
Uhm.

624
00:39:12,305 --> 00:39:13,280
Are you alright?

625
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,458
I'm leaving now.
