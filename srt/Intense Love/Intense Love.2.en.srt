=Episode 2=

3
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:01,939
Dr. Zhou. Dr. Zhou.

4
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,261
Dr. Zhou.

5
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,744
Why is nobody here?

6
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,431
Get the hell out of here.
You're here is bad for appearances

7
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,514
What? I even didn't say that.
How can you said that?

8
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:56,826
Zhou Shiyun?

9
00:02:57,353 --> 00:02:58,988
Watch out, man!

10
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:07,227
Jiawei.

11
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,573
Su Jinbei and you have been photographed.

12
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,977
I was trying to keep the news down.

13
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:14,549
But Su Jinbei is popular.

14
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:16,469
I think it's sad that missed the chance

15
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:19,228
Maybe you can make a CP.

16
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:20,556
What do you think?

17
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:24,075
In this way, many fans of Su Jinbei
will be your fans too.

18
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:29,229
I'll be popular,

19
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,255
but she'll be attacked by my fans.

20
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,672
I think she won't agree with that.

21
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:37,013
You haven't asked her, how can
you know she won't agree with that?

22
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:39,324
No.

23
00:03:39,573 --> 00:03:40,675
I said no.

24
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:46,682
It's company's decision.

25
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,276
Even if you don't agree with that,
you need to cooperate.

26
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,089
So why did you ask me?

27
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,534
Don't ask. It's your decision, anyway.

28
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:53,968
Jiawei.

29
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:55,484
You should understand.

30
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,696
Out there, you're not your own boss.

31
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:04,489
Anything but this, I don't want
to do as the company says.

32
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:06,871
If I cause the loss,

33
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,138
I'll pay.

34
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:09,055
You'll pay?

35
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:10,461
How?

36
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:12,451
Think about the training costs.

37
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:15,153
You're working for the company
to pay off your debts.

38
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:16,732
Jiawei.

39
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:18,601
Don't be childish and capricious.

40
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:24,288
I've put the word out.
I'm just informing you.

41
00:04:35,093 --> 00:04:36,017
Bro.

42
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:37,226
Why are you here?

43
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,374
Are you alright?

44
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,060
Take care of yourself.

45
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,715
I'm worried if it's too much for you.

46
00:04:47,258 --> 00:04:48,778
My business is well.

47
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:50,840
But I still have to...

48
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:54,430
care about other things.

49
00:05:16,076 --> 00:05:17,249
Have a drink.

50
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:19,844
Go on.

51
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:24,998
Life is a chess game.

52
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:27,440
Every step is important.

53
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,687
If you have planned well,

54
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:40,957
just do it.

55
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:44,761
But the game is changing.

56
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:47,618
No matter how it changes,

57
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,479
it always has a rule.

58
00:06:00,613 --> 00:06:01,467
Shiyun.

59
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:04,182
You don't like running a business
since your childhood.

60
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:05,554
Being a doctor,

61
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:07,189
you save people's life.

62
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:08,647
It's one act of kindness.

63
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:10,957
I just support you.

64
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:14,298
But I'm not well.

65
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:19,914
To keep our family
and our legacy safe is your duty.

66
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:22,413
This is not something
you cannot walk away from.

67
00:06:30,578 --> 00:06:32,142
There was an important operation that day,

68
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,625
so I didn't go.

69
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:37,224
Forget it.

70
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:42,663
But you should know your marriage
has been settled by two families,

71
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:44,974
and it's our mother's dying wish.

72
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:46,928
So,

73
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:50,838
I've promised for you,
everything's the same,

74
00:06:51,513 --> 00:06:52,828
okay?

75
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:58,302
I've heard that Miss Su
was in a car accident.

76
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,973
She is in your hospital.

77
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,255
Checkmate.

78
00:07:12,342 --> 00:07:14,475
You always know everything.

79
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:25,402
Since you are her attending physician,

80
00:07:25,998 --> 00:07:27,164
you can take the occasion...

81
00:07:28,302 --> 00:07:29,973
to get to know each other.

82
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,618
By the way,

83
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:36,122
we'll honor our ancestors next month,
take her with you.

84
00:07:44,972 --> 00:07:45,896
What's wrong?

85
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:47,674
What's wrong with you?

86
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:49,545
Look at me.

87
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:50,625
Look at me.

88
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:52,220
I could not possibly be seen
in such a rag.

89
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,818
I need my superman outfit!
Superman outfit!

90
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:59,439
In order to get that
you should use our emergency code?

91
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:01,145
It's some kind of emergency...

92
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,589
Do you know what is emergency?

93
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:05,553
It's recorded in the memorandum.

94
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,391
Pregnancy. Disfigurement.

95
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:11,026
Planet destroying!

96
00:08:12,235 --> 00:08:15,114
Which one does it belongs to?

97
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:19,664
Dear Didi.

98
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:22,365
Plus, it's kind of a spur
of the moment decision.

99
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:24,903
Oh, cut the shit.

100
00:08:27,804 --> 00:08:29,190
So...

101
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:31,820
So superman outfit for what?

102
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:33,193
I'm planning revenge on someone.

103
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:34,118
Who?

104
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:35,148
Him?

105
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:36,463
Zhou Shiyun?

106
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:38,360
My fiance.

107
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:39,478
You...

108
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:43,336
You mean Dr. Zhou is your fiance?

109
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:46,515
By the way,

110
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,983
after the car accident
I didn't get a chance to ask you...

111
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,436
about your engagement.

112
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:56,381
My mom and her good friend
have made a child betrothal.

113
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,746
Why don't you tell me
about this important thing?

114
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:02,637
Because I've never taken it seriously.

115
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:05,481
You are too heartless.

116
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,715
And now?

117
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:11,132
Why do you want to make a move
against Dr. Zhou?

118
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:15,220
You made it
seem like he's also a victim.

119
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:18,690
Because I've been stood up.

120
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:22,400
Baby, I just want to tell you...

121
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,386
Shiyun worked overtime that day.

122
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:28,927
You know that doctor will be prompt
and will work late when it requires.

123
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:29,864
Right?

124
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:32,020
I'm Su Jinbei.

125
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,307
Only I can stand someone up.
No one can stand me up.

126
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:35,907
I'm so freaking mad.

127
00:09:41,203 --> 00:09:42,518
All right.

128
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:45,910
Have some water.

129
00:09:48,312 --> 00:09:50,907
So what's your plan?

130
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:54,283
Have you heard about gentle knife?

131
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:56,201
Death will be caused by every single stab

132
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,544
I'll make him
get lost in my beauty and tenderness,

133
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:03,205
and bow before me.

134
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,587
And then?

135
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,688
Then...

136
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:08,146
After he's totally convinced,

137
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:10,513
I'm leaving.

138
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:13,264
Lashing the waves...

139
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:19,627
You cannot stop a running water.

140
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,475
Whose side are you with?

141
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:23,501
With you of course.

142
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:24,867
But Beibei.

143
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:27,065
You are Su Jinbei.

144
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:30,503
The soap opera queen
that's loved by anyone at first sight.

145
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:35,266
No matter who is involved in this,
it should be his pleasure.

146
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:37,221
Since he doesn't care about this.

147
00:10:37,577 --> 00:10:38,821
Just refuse the wedding.

148
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,159
I can't.

149
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:42,055
How can I be defeated
by a small doctor.

150
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:44,792
If I can't solve this
I don't know what else can I do.

151
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:46,343
My queen!

152
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:48,192
You are about to start shooting soon.

153
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:49,933
You don't have time
for a love game like this.

154
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:50,956
Just give up.

155
00:10:52,576 --> 00:10:54,462
Because of this...

156
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,121
I can't let him go.

157
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:00,578
See...

158
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:03,204
I don't have the mood to read the script,

159
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,794
and if I don't read the script,
I can't act.

160
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:10,278
If I can't act
the audience will blame me.

161
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:14,921
Then I won't have any other shooting.

162
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:16,214
Without shooting.

163
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,196
Okay.

164
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,511
Alright.

165
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,443
I don't know who you are working for now.

166
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:24,305
I'll give you three days
to take care of your Doctor Zhou,

167
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:25,633
and then you have to stop this.

168
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:27,090
Only three days.

169
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:28,581
And after that, you have to listen to me.

170
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:31,320
I know you are the best.

171
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:35,210
Director. This is my new subject.

172
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:45,751
Seriously?

173
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:47,528
I just came up with this subject.

174
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:49,293
And you took it.

175
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:51,225
Are you an ascarid living inside my brain?

176
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,013
Ascarids live in the small intestine
not in the brain.

177
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:56,130
It's just a metaphor.

178
00:11:57,232 --> 00:12:00,893
The theme is novel and promising.

179
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:04,128
Since you came up of this as well,

180
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,718
as the most experienced expert
and an elder member of the hospital.

181
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:11,856
I won't rob the subject
from young people like you.

182
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:12,994
Well.

183
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,386
I will give this subject for you.

184
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:20,585
Anything you need
you can talk to me.

185
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:23,464
I will have the whole hospital
support you.

186
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,328
-What about it?
-Good.

187
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:30,395
This guy.

188
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:32,990
You don't even have
some kind words to say!

189
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:38,250
My superman outfit.

190
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:45,750
I will appear in front of him
all the time...

191
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:49,945
to spread my charm casually,

192
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:53,108
and stimulate the dopamine secretion
in his brain.

193
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:59,968
So that I can live in his heart forever.

194
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,406
Indeed.

195
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:07,484
Didi.

196
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:09,778
Which type of girl does he like?

197
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:11,954
Provocative?

198
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:14,186
You are playing with me.

199
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:15,466
I won't fall for you.

200
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:19,198
Since he is a doctor,

201
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:21,793
he should be aesthetically clean.

202
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,747
Then he might like...

203
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:28,084
a pure girl.

204
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:28,936
You should take some rest,
why are you riding a bike?

205
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:30,571
Dr. Zhou.

206
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,589
I...

207
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:33,628
Because I'm doing
rehabilitation exercises now,

208
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,392
but I haven't rode a bike for so long.

209
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:36,614
I'm a little unstable.

210
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:38,391
Can you hold me?

211
00:14:42,585 --> 00:14:43,418
Dr. Zhou.

212
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,598
Let's go there.

213
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:45,515
I...

214
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,677
do not fit the pure style.

215
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:52,573
Then I'll try to be graceful.

216
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:57,550
Dear,

217
00:14:57,834 --> 00:15:01,352
When Mr. Billy moves here as our neighbor,
you should go visit him.

218
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,486
No, save it.

219
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:05,961
You should think about our daughter.

220
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:09,386
No matter who she marries
I hope she could live happily.

221
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:12,074
William and...

222
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:13,154
How is your feet today?

223
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:14,918
-Much better.
-OK.

224
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:16,744
You should go visit him.

225
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,272
Next.

226
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:19,765
They can't...

227
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,009
They...

228
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:31,068
Hey, girl, keep reading.

229
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:35,405
Turn over the page.

230
00:15:58,686 --> 00:15:59,519
Alright.

231
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:03,556
I can only use my secret weapon.

232
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:32,205
Dr. Zhou, are you hungry?

233
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:34,124
Do you want some midnight snack?

234
00:17:25,508 --> 00:17:26,341
Thank you.

235
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,064
I don't have this habit.

236
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,273
You don't want anything.
Zhou Shiyun, I'm pissed off.

237
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:47,312
How can you do this to me.

238
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,425
Friendly Tips.

239
00:17:49,674 --> 00:17:51,588
You have two days.

240
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:55,665
I think,

241
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:58,500
You can't deal with that Dr. Zhou.

242
00:17:58,922 --> 00:18:03,472
When you are not so into him
just give up now.

243
00:18:03,745 --> 00:18:05,212
No, I don't want to.

244
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:12,437
Hope Miss Di can succeed in this.

245
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:13,988
Love you.

246
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:18,289
I'm so unlucky to meet with you.

247
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:33,940
You...

248
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:36,563
What else do you want?

249
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:42,604
Your food.

250
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:44,021
Go ahead.

251
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:45,252
What?

252
00:18:45,587 --> 00:18:46,781
What?

253
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:48,720
Apologize.

254
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:51,778
You didn't come to apologize?

255
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:57,869
I was too emotional that day.

256
00:18:58,217 --> 00:18:59,137
I'm sorry.

257
00:19:03,463 --> 00:19:04,308
That's ok.

258
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:08,932
A generous man like me
will not blame a woman.

259
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:13,848
But I didn't come here for that.

260
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,241
Then what?

261
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:22,581
Dr. Xiao you are a friend
of Dr. Zhou, right?

262
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,614
Have you dealt with him?

263
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,038
I did not dealt with him
but fought with him.

264
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,935
Anyway they are friends.

265
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:32,740
Do you know

266
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:35,534
Know your enemy and know yourself

267
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,961
I know so little about Zhou Shiyun.

268
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:40,133
It is bad for my revenge.

269
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,799
So.

270
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:42,868
What are you going to do?

271
00:19:44,385 --> 00:19:45,280
So.

272
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:52,042
Can you go find that Dr. Xiao
and ask him about Zhou Shiyun?

273
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,991
I'll go and find him?

274
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:56,617
You know I had trouble with him.

275
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:58,680
How can he help me?

276
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:01,912
You are the best manager in the world,

277
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:02,907
Wu Di.

278
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:05,579
Is there any thing that Miss Wu Di
can't solve?

279
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,807
You can do this.

280
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:09,196
Just help me.

281
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:12,826
I will tell you with my responsibility

282
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:15,685
Impossible!

283
00:20:18,022 --> 00:20:19,912
I'll speak frankly.

284
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:22,845
I came to ask you about Zhou Shiyun.

285
00:20:24,113 --> 00:20:25,530
I knew it.

286
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:27,038
She can't be so good.

287
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:28,514
You want me to betray my friend?

288
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:29,831
Impossible!

289
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:31,684
OK.

290
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:33,934
Then I will also speak frankly.

291
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,590
I am the kind of person
that speaks the truth after I'm drunk.

292
00:20:36,743 --> 00:20:38,483
If you can get me drunk,

293
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,621
I might tell you everything.

294
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:43,108
Alright.
Let's cut the bullshit.

295
00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:44,487
Come on.

296
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:48,950
I'll make you drunk like hell.

297
00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:51,330
It's my opportunity to revenge.

298
00:20:57,502 --> 00:20:58,447
Oh, my gosh.

299
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,715
You're so tough.

300
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,795
Slow down.

301
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:10,157
So heavy!

302
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,347
Speak the truth after you're drunk?

303
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:27,684
You just fell down
without saying anything.

304
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:29,076
No.

305
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,819
Aren't you so proud of yourself?

306
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:39,046
Keep going.

307
00:21:39,593 --> 00:21:40,612
Cheers.

308
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:42,467
Liar. Liar.

309
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,192
Liar. Liar.

310
00:21:47,176 --> 00:21:48,493
What's up?

311
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,454
Perfect!

312
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,377
Hi, Dr. Zhou.

313
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:03,674
What is it?

314
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:08,628
-I'll take a call.
-I'll take a call.

315
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:11,058
-See you.
-See you.

316
00:23:17,448 --> 00:23:18,316
Hello?

317
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:20,042
Wu Di, what did you do?

318
00:23:20,655 --> 00:23:22,047
Why are you answering the phone so late?

319
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:23,004
Mr. Wang.

320
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:24,956
Sorry, sorry.

321
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:25,938
Well.

322
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,159
What's wrong with you?

323
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:28,735
Don't you know that yet?

324
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:31,162
You can't even control
your own lister.

325
00:23:31,246 --> 00:23:32,265
It's screwed!

326
00:23:32,563 --> 00:23:33,422
I'm screwed!

327
00:23:34,478 --> 00:23:36,516
Anything happened?

328
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:37,958
It can't be.

329
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:40,370
What? Xu...

330
00:23:41,613 --> 00:23:43,552
Xu Jiawei? CP?

331
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:44,882
No, No.

332
00:23:44,994 --> 00:23:46,377
It can't be true.

333
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:48,092
It's an accident.

334
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,009
Yes.

335
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:51,187
An accident.

336
00:23:53,944 --> 00:23:55,013
Be calm, will you?

337
00:23:56,232 --> 00:23:57,947
It's not necessarily the case.

338
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:02,174
Miss Wu.

339
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:04,511
But...

340
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,350
Miss Wu...

341
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,638
We are all grown-ups now.

342
00:24:08,986 --> 00:24:10,499
If anything happened.

343
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:13,038
I'll take the responsibility.

344
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:17,911
OK.

345
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,893
That's it.

346
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:25,907
You...

347
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:27,831
That's over?

348
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:29,198
Or?

349
00:24:29,944 --> 00:24:32,753
Don't you have anything to say?

350
00:24:33,226 --> 00:24:34,096
What?

351
00:24:35,836 --> 00:24:37,269
Nothing happened last night.

352
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:39,075
In the future,
let's not see each other again.

353
00:24:52,568 --> 00:24:53,562
Wu Di.

354
00:24:53,711 --> 00:24:55,626
What exactly are you doing?

355
00:25:06,117 --> 00:25:07,137
Jiawei.

356
00:25:13,203 --> 00:25:14,036
Jiawei.

357
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,062
There's something I want to ask you.

358
00:25:17,877 --> 00:25:18,722
Say it.

359
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:21,954
The gossip about you and Su Jinbei.

360
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:23,545
Is it true?

361
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:29,462
Don't get me wrong.

362
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,352
I'm just worried about you.

363
00:25:31,606 --> 00:25:32,700
It's an accident.

364
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,379
There is nothing between me and Su Jinbei.

365
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,874
Jiawei.

366
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:43,285
Are you ignoring me...

367
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:46,194
because of Su Jinbei?

368
00:25:47,238 --> 00:25:48,071
Zitong.

369
00:25:48,183 --> 00:25:49,998
I didn't ignore you on purpose.

370
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:54,846
But because
we all need to live our own lives.

371
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,045
Su Jinbei, are you an idiot?

372
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:06,655
I left you for a little while
and you did this.

373
00:26:07,426 --> 00:26:08,883
Don't blame me.

374
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,409
I didn't mean to.

375
00:26:11,254 --> 00:26:12,547
Xu Jiawei asked me to save him.

376
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,660
I can't refuse.

377
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:19,508
He's in your car
and you hid it from me.

378
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:22,765
The boss is so angry now.

379
00:26:23,312 --> 00:26:25,152
Just explain for me.

380
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:27,912
I helped Xu Jiawei that day.

381
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:29,385
You are right.

382
00:26:29,851 --> 00:26:32,312
You are the caring angle Su Jinbei.

383
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:34,789
Helping him
had nothing good for you.

384
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:38,568
And now everyone on the Internet
is scolding you,

385
00:26:38,652 --> 00:26:41,113
but Xu Jiawei earned a lot of fans.

386
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:43,316
I've told you many times.

387
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,478
The gossip of artists will always hurt
the career of the actress.

388
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:50,610
You should learn to protect yourself.

389
00:26:51,132 --> 00:26:52,823
Why are actresses always hurt.

390
00:26:52,972 --> 00:26:54,215
It's not fair.

391
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:55,433
Why?

392
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:57,124
Have you heard of girlfriend fans?

393
00:26:57,795 --> 00:27:00,107
Then how about boyfriend fans?

394
00:27:04,508 --> 00:27:05,378
Give me that.

395
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,629
I have to find a way to deal
with the news.

396
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:12,678
By the way.
Where were you last night?

397
00:27:12,762 --> 00:27:13,955
I can't find you.

398
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:20,071
Last night,
I asked about your little doctor for you.

399
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,601
How was it？

400
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,585
What about it?
Is there some progress？

401
00:27:31,855 --> 00:27:33,969
No, nothing.

402
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,328
Nothing?

403
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:36,969
Dr. Xiao told you nothing？

404
00:27:37,053 --> 00:27:38,296
What did you do last night?

405
00:27:39,763 --> 00:27:42,050
What can we do?

406
00:27:42,348 --> 00:27:46,674
We just had dinner and talked.

407
00:27:48,514 --> 00:27:51,771
We just met we can't get too deep.

408
00:27:52,218 --> 00:27:56,013
I can't reveal my intentions, right?

409
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:57,753
Then do you know anything?

410
00:27:57,837 --> 00:27:59,652
What kind of girl does Zhou Shiyun like?

411
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,834
What kind?

412
00:28:04,301 --> 00:28:05,743
He likes...

413
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:08,851
to be jealous.

414
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:10,790
To be jealous.

415
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:18,547
He's a man sometimes he can be
more jealous than woman.

416
00:28:20,088 --> 00:28:21,853
To be jealous.

417
00:28:22,773 --> 00:28:24,961
I have to go back
and deal with your problem.

418
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,867
Why are you so weird?

419
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:34,707
Like you've done something bad.

420
00:28:37,889 --> 00:28:40,002
Jealous.

421
00:29:14,435 --> 00:29:15,728
I'll go in by myself.

422
00:29:15,902 --> 00:29:16,735
Wait for me outside.

423
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,040
I got it.

424
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:19,818
Xiaowai.

425
00:29:20,203 --> 00:29:21,720
I still think it's not good.

426
00:29:22,217 --> 00:29:23,401
Let's not.

427
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:25,524
Don't worry! Brother.
I've arranged everything.

428
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:28,954
As long as you act closely with Su Jinbei,
I will shoot it.

429
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:30,645
That's ok.

430
00:29:36,438 --> 00:29:38,675
Anything else, brother?

431
00:29:52,971 --> 00:29:54,288
Hello, please register here.

432
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:14,700
Dr. Zhou.

433
00:30:14,973 --> 00:30:17,484
What are you doing here?

434
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:19,961
Sorry, there were reporters outside.

435
00:30:20,046 --> 00:30:21,065
So I...

436
00:30:21,437 --> 00:30:23,675
-Yes.
-Yes.

437
00:30:24,644 --> 00:30:25,828
There were really...

438
00:30:25,912 --> 00:30:27,130
I trust you.

439
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:29,368
I...

440
00:30:32,674 --> 00:30:34,017
A huge spider.

441
00:30:52,912 --> 00:30:53,931
Dr. Zhou.

442
00:30:54,925 --> 00:30:57,660
Are you afraid of it?

443
00:30:59,227 --> 00:31:01,389
-Take that away.
-You are really afraid of it.

444
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:03,378
Have a look!

445
00:31:06,337 --> 00:31:07,456
Take...

446
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,812
No, take it away.

447
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:12,304
No.

448
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:15,933
Have a look!

449
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:19,862
Sorry.

450
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:23,258
Dr. Zhou.

451
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:26,043
Do you think
the spider has such a perfect figure,

452
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:28,240
its legs are so slim.

453
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,679
I know you are afraid of spiders now
but I will keep the secret for you.

454
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:36,882
Don't push it.

455
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:38,573
Have a look.

456
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:39,567
Toss it.

457
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:41,591
Your secret is safe with me.

458
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:43,421
Sorry, Dr. Zhou.

459
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:44,515
Excuse me.

460
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,613
We're in a hurry to get the equipment.

461
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:04,799
Jiawei.

462
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:06,551
Why you were here?

463
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:07,757
Jinbei.

464
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:08,976
I came to see you.

465
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:10,430
I'm afraid you are lonely.

466
00:32:10,753 --> 00:32:12,195
How can I be lonely.

467
00:32:12,394 --> 00:32:13,329
I'm so busy.

468
00:32:13,413 --> 00:32:14,246
Thank you.

469
00:32:14,457 --> 00:32:15,766
You'd better go.

470
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,392
You might get spotted by the media
and create a news again.

471
00:32:19,082 --> 00:32:22,898
It's not necessarily a bad thing, right?

472
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:25,919
A lot of couple fans now support us.

473
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:27,025
A lot.

474
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:28,348
If you don't believe me...

475
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:29,946
Look.

476
00:32:34,197 --> 00:32:39,592
Xu Jiawei saved old actress Su Jinbei.

477
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:41,730
I'm only twenty-six.

478
00:32:41,954 --> 00:32:43,943
Why am I old?

479
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:49,860
Gossip queen Su Jinbei
made another move to famous young actress.

480
00:32:51,327 --> 00:32:52,495
Made another move...

481
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:54,957
Seriously?

482
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:00,476
Don't focus on the negative ones.

483
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:02,017
A lot of people support us.

484
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:03,000
For example…

485
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:04,429
Look at this.

486
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:07,860
The sweet love between Su and Xu.

487
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:10,187
Sweet love?

488
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:12,285
The media is so boring.

489
00:33:14,274 --> 00:33:18,053
They might think that we match.

490
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:19,246
Jinbei.

491
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:22,173
Don't you think it's good?

492
00:33:22,423 --> 00:33:23,368
No.

493
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:28,358
I'm sorry.

494
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:32,199
I see that this bothered you.

495
00:33:33,393 --> 00:33:34,387
Nothing.

496
00:33:34,636 --> 00:33:36,500
I have so many gossips these years,
I'm used to it.

497
00:33:36,774 --> 00:33:38,340
But you,
you are still in your rising stage.

498
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:40,155
It should affect you pretty well.

499
00:33:43,213 --> 00:33:44,046
Jinbei.

500
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:46,892
There's just something
I need to tell you.

501
00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:50,388
Actually, today my company arranged me
to meet...

502
00:33:50,472 --> 00:33:51,305
Miss Su.

503
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:00,218
You can leave the hospital.

504
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:02,257
I can leave the hospital?

505
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:05,355
Dr. Zhou.

506
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:08,513
But I feel miserable
especially my head.

507
00:34:08,597 --> 00:34:09,432
I'm dizzy.

508
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:11,754
-Dizzy.
-You are fine now.

509
00:34:12,848 --> 00:34:14,315
Just remember to come back for re-check,

510
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:16,925
and have meals on time.

511
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:22,370
Do you know anything?

512
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:24,607
What kind of girl does Zhou Shiyun like?

513
00:34:24,757 --> 00:34:26,671
He likes to be jealous.

514
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:28,635
To be jealous?

515
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:33,806
Jiawei.

516
00:34:34,602 --> 00:34:36,317
I hurt my right arm.

517
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,998
I can't take the chopstick.

518
00:34:38,082 --> 00:34:38,915
Then,

519
00:34:39,176 --> 00:34:40,468
Do you need my help?

520
00:34:41,465 --> 00:34:42,559
Alright.

521
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:50,339
Miss Su.

522
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,353
Your right arm is fine.

523
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:54,043
You can eat normally.

524
00:34:56,157 --> 00:34:57,176
It shouldn't be.

525
00:34:57,574 --> 00:35:00,061
I was scratched
by something just now.

526
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:01,045
It hurts.

527
00:35:01,129 --> 00:35:03,913
I think I have to stay in the hospital.

528
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:07,518
More.

529
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:11,148
I know you are afraid of spiders now.
But I will keep the secret for you.

530
00:35:12,217 --> 00:35:13,699
Don't push it.

531
00:35:13,783 --> 00:35:15,027
Take a look.

532
00:35:24,897 --> 00:35:27,283
I don't know if Wu Di's suggestion works.

533
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:30,938
No, thanks. It's not that bad.

534
00:35:31,137 --> 00:35:31,970
I can do it myself.

535
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:40,475
I'm almost well.

536
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,349
You can stop visiting me.

537
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,487
Jinbei.

538
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:47,197
Do you not want to see me, Jinbei?

539
00:35:47,471 --> 00:35:48,304
No... No...

540
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:50,977
But I'm afraid I will affect you.

541
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:54,171
Alright.

542
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:56,023
Have a good rest.

543
00:35:56,247 --> 00:35:57,316
I got to go.

544
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:03,966
Bye.

545
00:36:06,341 --> 00:36:07,907
-Bye.
-Bye.

546
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,929
You're on duty this week.

547
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,694
Can I refuse?

548
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,230
It seems I have to...

549
00:36:18,921 --> 00:36:19,890
Have you had eaten yet?

550
00:36:20,014 --> 00:36:21,133
I'll eat when I get back.

551
00:36:21,307 --> 00:36:22,317
Go now.

552
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:23,461
Have a good meal.

553
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:24,788
-Bye.
-Bye.

554
00:36:25,012 --> 00:36:25,981
The old habit has returned.

555
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:29,611
I'm caring for you.

556
00:36:32,545 --> 00:36:33,663
Vegetarian diet today?

557
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:39,396
I heard that Xu Jiawei
came to visit Su Jinbei.

558
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,400
Is that true?

559
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:44,254
What happened between them?

560
00:36:44,428 --> 00:36:45,995
Is there really a third party?

561
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:48,232
Shut up and eat.

562
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,533
Shut up!
How can I eat when my mouth is shut.

563
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:56,785
I heard they were close
just in front of you.

564
00:36:56,909 --> 00:36:59,594
As a fiance you are so dispensable.

565
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:00,700
Besides,

566
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:04,616
what is the relationship between
your fiance and that young actor.

567
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:08,544
You want to know?

568
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:10,185
Ask her.

569
00:37:14,063 --> 00:37:15,704
Are you really mad?

570
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:24,928
I made Zhou Shiyun jealous today.

571
00:37:27,888 --> 00:37:30,447
Really? Shanxi mature vinegar?

572
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,033
Dr. Zhou.

573
00:37:35,146 --> 00:37:35,979
Sorry!

574
00:37:48,397 --> 00:37:50,088
Yes!

575
00:38:02,817 --> 00:38:05,278
Your relationship
was settled by your family long time ago,

576
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,133
and it's our mother's dying wish.

577
00:38:07,217 --> 00:38:09,803
We'll honor our ancestors next month,
take her with you.

578
00:38:10,325 --> 00:38:12,652
I heard they were close
just in front of you.

579
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,919
As a fiance you are so dispensable.

580
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:22,706
Is it true?

581
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,282
The service group saw it in person.

582
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:26,600
Such a narrow sundry room.

583
00:38:26,684 --> 00:38:28,026
Think about it.

584
00:38:28,648 --> 00:38:29,481
Oh, my gosh.

585
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:32,999
There's a person in this world
that can make Dr. Zhou fall in love.

586
00:38:33,148 --> 00:38:34,465
I dare not imagine.

587
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:38,617
Look. The girlfriend fans
of Xu Jiawei are so mean.

588
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,700
Their scold of Su Jinbei
even went on the news.

589
00:38:43,913 --> 00:38:46,001
It's too mean.

590
00:38:46,275 --> 00:38:48,810
They were protecting their own actor.
It's normal.

591
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,098
Are you working or not?

592
00:39:23,169 --> 00:39:24,188
Call security.

593
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:25,705
Call security.

594
00:39:28,614 --> 00:39:29,447
Coming right up!

595
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,451
-Who is it?
-Su Jinbei.
