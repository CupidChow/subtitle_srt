=Episode 9=

3
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,850
That's what happened.

4
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,732
The comments were not very friendly.

5
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,359
Paopao loves to be beautiful.
It's a little overwhelming emotionally.

6
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:49,467
One moment.

7
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:51,040
Where are you going?

8
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:53,184
I have a magic thing.

9
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:05,592
Here you are.

10
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:06,617
Let's go.

11
00:02:08,884 --> 00:02:10,342
-Quickly.
-Okay.

12
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:25,409
Sister Jinbei.

13
00:02:25,784 --> 00:02:26,857
You are sister Jinbei.

14
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,513
I hear you enjoy watching my TV series.

15
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:36,084
I like the princess Lianxi
you played best.

16
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,028
You were riding a horse
on the prairie outside the fortress.

17
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,181
You're really beautiful.

18
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:42,548
Do you want to be a princess Lianxi?

19
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,417
Yes!

20
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:46,634
But.

21
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:48,384
How?

22
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:55,334
I'll handle it.

23
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,085
Paopao, you are a beautiful girl.

24
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:06,359
Hey. Let's see if you like it.

25
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:10,349
Do you like it?

26
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:13,827
Look! I'm a princess Lianxi now, too.

27
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:15,421
Yes, princess.

28
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:18,534
Would you like to record
a short video to commemorate it?

29
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:20,784
Thank you.

30
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,242
OK.

31
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:40,092
Look here. Have a look.

32
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:41,217
Do you like it?

33
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:44,434
Look at you.

34
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:53,709
You're so cute. Well.

35
00:03:57,484 --> 00:04:00,109
Will you take an injection today?

36
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:01,734
How can you not take an injection?

37
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:03,784
Dr. Zhou is good at medicine.

38
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:06,775
He will cure you in no time.
Then you can have long hair.

39
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,875
Then, pretty girl,
you can go to school happily.

40
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:09,792
Deal?

41
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:12,400
Then I don't want the nurse
to give me an injection.

42
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:14,534
Can I ask Dr. Zhou
to give me an injection?

43
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:17,284
No problem.
Dr. Zhou can do anything.

44
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,884
He must be good with injection.

45
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,292
OK.

46
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:25,742
Paopao.

47
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:37,581
Sister Jinbei, I'm afraid.

48
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,748
Take it easy. I'm here.

49
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:41,042
Take it easy.

50
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:43,167
It's okay.

51
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:12,184
It's the time to rest.

52
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:15,379
Paopao.

53
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:16,297
Sister.

54
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:17,722
Sister Jinbei.

55
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:20,984
Alright, I promise.

56
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:23,861
If you listen to Dr. Zhou
I will come here often.

57
00:05:23,946 --> 00:05:25,568
I'll tell you some funny things
about the play.

58
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:26,485
Deal?

59
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:30,243
Get to sleep. Good night.

60
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:46,982
Paopao is really cute.

61
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:50,034
You have to cure her.
Let her get well soon.

62
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:51,892
Thank you today.

63
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:54,784
You're welcome.
It's my pleasure.

64
00:05:58,859 --> 00:05:59,692
What's up?

65
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:01,242
Nothing.

66
00:06:01,884 --> 00:06:04,800
It just feels weird.

67
00:06:04,884 --> 00:06:06,764
It was as if someone were following me.

68
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,009
Not important.
I think I'm overthinking it.

69
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,259
Let me give you a ride at this time.

70
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,025
No, thanks.
I drove here and I will drive back.

71
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:18,942
I'm leaving.

72
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:20,342
Bye.

73
00:06:20,884 --> 00:06:21,717
Bye.

74
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:56,667
What a coincidence!

75
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:58,884
So you like massage, too?

76
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:04,576
What's up?

77
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,304
You're so nervous.

78
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:09,509
Miss Wu, let's get started.

79
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:12,450
I will pay for that.
The appointment has cancelled.

80
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,217
-You know each other?
-She's my wife.

81
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:17,650
Really?

82
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:18,567
Pretty soon.

83
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:23,759
It's a bad day.

84
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:25,859
Why is he everywhere?

85
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,225
Hello. Give me a hot spring egg.

86
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:38,142
Alright.

87
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:39,217
Thank you.

88
00:07:44,484 --> 00:07:46,084
A box of three, for you.

89
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:48,942
You.

90
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:52,300
No, thanks.

91
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:55,120
Beibei has a gold card from a sponsor.

92
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:56,709
I can buy whatever I want.

93
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:58,900
So what? It's not yours.

94
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:02,759
But I buy the three eggs
only for my dear Didi.

95
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:04,859
No kidding.

96
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,434
I negotiate the sponsorship.

97
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:11,590
I thought you were getting a massage.

98
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:12,759
Why are you here?

99
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:15,834
Are you following me?

100
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:18,534
How dare I? I just...

101
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:22,159
I just happen to like
hot spring eggs, too.

102
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,059
It's delicious and nutritious.

103
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:28,459
A massage after the sauna
and then eat a hot spring egg.

104
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:29,559
Comfortable.

105
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:32,784
Go over there and talk.

106
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:44,792
Sit down!

107
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,192
-Xiao Yuansong.
-Yes.

108
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:55,817
Read it.

109
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:00,800
You can go for a massage after the sauna.

110
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:02,838
You can eat after the massage.

111
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:07,909
You caught me.

112
00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:10,234
Is it nice to peek
at other people's comments?

113
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:12,434
That's because I miss you.
But I can't see you.

114
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,384
I've been racking my brain
then I just thought of it.

115
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:17,942
Xiao Yuansong.

116
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:20,534
I can't stand you any more.

117
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:24,109
Tell me what do you like about me.
Can't I change it?

118
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:27,509
I think everything about you is great.

119
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:30,373
Just tell me.
What can I do to get you off?

120
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,359
I am a person.

121
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:34,734
You are also a person.

122
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,509
It's not against the law
for me to badger you.

123
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:40,684
How about if I am not a person?

124
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,284
Not a person? What do you mean?

125
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:26,859
Zhou Shiyun.

126
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:36,384
Why are you here?

127
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:37,866
I'm...

128
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,859
Are you here because
you're worried about me?

129
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:41,871
I'm glad you're here.

130
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:44,440
Otherwise I don't know what to do.

131
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:47,492
Well.

132
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:51,334
How long are you going to hold?

133
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:56,042
Neck...

134
00:10:56,968 --> 00:10:57,801
is sour.

135
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,398
I'll check on the situation.

136
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:35,917
Take it easy.

137
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:48,067
It's ok.

138
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,859
I think it's been really weird lately.

139
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,409
It seems that someone is following me.

140
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:55,959
I didn't give it much thought.

141
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:03,761
Follow me!

142
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,392
What?

143
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:06,934
Where are we going?

144
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:28,934
You pretended you didn't want to.
But you just hang it up.

145
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,234
You hung it up.

146
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,134
You like it but not admitting it.

147
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:48,109
Where is he taking me?

148
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:51,009
It's evening and we're going to a place.

149
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:54,234
Will it be the hotel?

150
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,484
No... No...

151
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,092
What's wrong?

152
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:26,859
Nothing.

153
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:39,917
Dr. Zhou.

154
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,134
This is your home.

155
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:42,092
You wear this pair.

156
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:45,731
Even though we're engaged,
we're not married yet.

157
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:47,609
Wasn't it good of you to bring me here?

158
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:49,284
Do you have a better choice?

159
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:50,734
That's true.

160
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:53,709
I'm cold, scared and homeless.

161
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:57,375
I officially declare
I came here as a stopgap.

162
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:59,200
We're essentially roommates.

163
00:13:59,284 --> 00:14:00,684
So don't give it a second thought.

164
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:02,959
You're overthinking it.

165
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,592
I...

166
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,509
This is the bathroom.

167
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:15,759
Spotlessly clean.

168
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:18,934
This is the study.

169
00:14:20,784 --> 00:14:22,459
Your house is too tidy.

170
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:26,250
Almost everywhere
is all amazingly clean.

171
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:27,659
It's a little bit messy here.

172
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,109
This castle is so exquisite.

173
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,275
It should take a lot of time to build.

174
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:33,192
Three months.

175
00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:35,309
So beautiful.

176
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:41,859
It's really clean.

177
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:45,374
The lock on your door is good.

178
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:49,921
I'm afraid that someone come
and borrow something from me at midnight.

179
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,336
It seems like your colleagues can do it.

180
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,934
Wow, he's so sweet.

181
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:25,742
Zhou Shiyun.

182
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:27,742
What's up?

183
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:32,784
Can you lend me a nightgown?

184
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:44,334
Pick it by yourself.

185
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:55,634
I think the one you're wearing is great.

186
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:58,684
Or you can take it off and give it to me.

187
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,859
I'm joking.

188
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:10,159
Just wear this one.

189
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:11,692
I wore that.

190
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,200
It doesn't matter.

191
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:15,309
I like to sleep in an oversized shirt.

192
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:16,267
Good night.

193
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:37,773
This is his home.

194
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:39,184
This is his bed.

195
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:41,684
I had a lot of problems today.

196
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:44,459
But here I just feel warm.

197
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:48,109
Is this the sense of security?

198
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:06,815
Zhou Shiyun.

199
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:18,984
Are you ok?

200
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,225
Well.
I just heard something weird.

201
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:43,450
Clicking.

202
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:45,384
I think someone is in your house.

203
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,209
No, it's safe here.

204
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:49,367
Listen.

205
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:53,565
You come with me.

206
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:42,657
Take it easy.

207
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:44,142
Follow me.

208
00:19:55,484 --> 00:19:56,317
Come here.

209
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,056
The bird.

210
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:14,084
What a cute bird.

211
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:15,359
Where did it come from?

212
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:17,859
That day it was hurt
and landed on the balcony.

213
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,109
I cured it.

214
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,459
Leave it here to recuperate.

215
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:26,600
Because it's hungry.

216
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,809
It's flopping.

217
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:39,125
We'll let it eat.
Leave it alone.

218
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:40,042
Fine.

219
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:54,117
I...

220
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:58,742
Good night.

221
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:01,842
Good night.

222
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:07,209
Hey.

223
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:09,975
Still sleeping, my beautiful girl.

224
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:12,165
The sun is up, time to get up.

225
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:16,084
It's still early, one more moment.

226
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,302
I'd love to but we have to work.

227
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:20,310
There was something wrong
with the picture taken yesterday.

228
00:22:20,395 --> 00:22:22,109
They said they wanted to take a few more.

229
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:24,595
Really?

230
00:22:24,934 --> 00:22:26,500
I'll be at your downstairs
in five seconds.

231
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:27,859
Open the door for me at once.

232
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,109
It's annoying.

233
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,309
I'll get up.

234
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:43,859
Open the door.

235
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:01,034
Morning.

236
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:02,142
Morning.

237
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:05,610
Why do I seem to hear a man's voice?

238
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,509
Who are you talking to?

239
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:10,117
Hey.

240
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,809
I'm not at home.

241
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:14,459
You were not at home?

242
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:15,617
So where are you?

243
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,100
Never mind.

244
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:18,379
You go over and I'll find you.

245
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:19,476
Bye.

246
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,392
Beibei.

247
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:25,311
What the hell?

248
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:42,142
Beibei.

249
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,309
You are so gorgeous.

250
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,592
Love you.

251
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,534
Zhou Shiyun.

252
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:54,892
Zhou Shiyun.

253
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,484
Dr. Zhou.

254
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:07,359
Stop! He had already left.

255
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:20,684
Nutritious breakfast
on the right side of the refrigerator.

256
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,168
Just heat it up in the microwave.

257
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:35,834
You know what a slap in the face is.

258
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,034
I'm going to have breakfast.

259
00:24:43,484 --> 00:24:44,317
What?

260
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:46,384
You stayed at his house last night.

261
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:48,009
Lower your voice.

262
00:24:49,084 --> 00:24:49,917
No.

263
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:51,350
Have you been photographed
by the paparazzi?

264
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:52,709
If it spreads the word, you're done.

265
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:54,017
I can handle it.

266
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:55,684
Don't worry.

267
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:59,784
But yesterday was so much fun.

268
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,809
Do you know? I heard a very
strange noise in the middle of the night.

269
00:25:03,384 --> 00:25:04,684
And then it freaked me out.

270
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:06,009
I ran to his room.

271
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:09,543
He took me to a very small room.

272
00:25:09,627 --> 00:25:10,550
Guess what.

273
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,559
What happened?

274
00:25:12,484 --> 00:25:14,425
He keeps a little bird.

275
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:16,234
A wounded bird.

276
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:18,109
He's so cute.

277
00:25:18,462 --> 00:25:19,300
And then?

278
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:20,750
Then we feed the bird together.

279
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:21,667
And then?

280
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:23,500
Then we went to bed.

281
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:25,459
Sleep?
You two slept together?

282
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:27,809
What are you talking about?

283
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:29,684
I, I...

284
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:33,825
Of course we slept in separate rooms.

285
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,709
You have a dirty mind.

286
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,384
Well.

287
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:41,659
Nothing happened to you guys in the end?

288
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:43,259
Of course.

289
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,071
I keep my body like a jade.

290
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:47,184
He is a modest gentleman.

291
00:25:47,784 --> 00:25:48,884
He's calm.

292
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:51,859
He's calm.

293
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,534
No man would be indifferent
to the woman he likes.

294
00:25:57,454 --> 00:25:58,300
What do you mean?

295
00:25:58,384 --> 00:26:00,509
Miss Jinbei.
Can you wear make-up now?

296
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:02,259
Yes.

297
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:05,309
Fine.
You take a good picture. I'm leaving.

298
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:15,534
I told you he had no feelings for you.

299
00:26:15,884 --> 00:26:17,484
Really? I...

300
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:19,484
Miss Jinbei, what did you say?

301
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:22,509
Nothing.

302
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:31,342
OK.

303
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:32,367
Another position.

304
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:34,217
Be cool.

305
00:26:41,108 --> 00:26:44,659
No man would be indifferent
to the woman he likes.

306
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,409
Miss Jinbei, please look at the lens.

307
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:53,659
A little bit more intuitive.

308
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,584
Focus a little bit more.

309
00:26:55,834 --> 00:26:56,667
Thank you.

310
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:07,942
Good night.

311
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:13,034
I will be far better
if you can focus more.

312
00:27:20,284 --> 00:27:22,389
Well how about taking a break.

313
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:25,867
Thank you.

314
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:30,605
-I can't continue.
-They aren't in mood.

315
00:27:30,689 --> 00:27:31,522
Give it to me.

316
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,342
Jinbei.

317
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:01,042
Sorry.

318
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:02,306
They aren't professional.

319
00:28:02,534 --> 00:28:03,401
They just talked nonsense.

320
00:28:04,386 --> 00:28:05,225
Jiawei.

321
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,142
Hey.

322
00:28:11,484 --> 00:28:12,509
Let me ask you a question.

323
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:16,883
Well, when a single man and a single woman
shared a room.

324
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:20,600
But the man wore Joseph's coat
without any action.

325
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:22,084
What does that mean?

326
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:26,197
Actually.

327
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:27,959
It depends.

328
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:31,067
And it is hard to jump into conclusions.

329
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,493
Well, let's put it this way.

330
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:35,675
The two guys
were in a very private place.

331
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:39,655
Only two of them
and everything is ready.

332
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:41,064
But...

333
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:43,509
The man remained unmoved.

334
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:46,692
So how to explain his behavior
and reaction from man's perspective.

335
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:49,767
Well, for me...

336
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:55,334
the man may be has little interest in...

337
00:28:58,684 --> 00:28:59,959
the woman.

338
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:03,434
Huh, for sure? I...

339
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,584
Well, can we get started?

340
00:29:08,984 --> 00:29:10,492
-Let's go.
-OK.

341
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:15,667
Come on.

342
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:20,509
It turns out
that I am not attractive enough.

343
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,759
Sorry.

344
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:29,659
I didn't have a good rest last night.
Give me one more second.

345
00:29:30,084 --> 00:29:30,917
Fine.

346
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:33,750
Alright.

347
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:34,709
Go on.

348
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:36,567
-Fine.
-OK.

349
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:39,117
Fine.

350
00:29:39,334 --> 00:29:40,867
Wow. Keep focused.

351
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:14,899
Why are you here?

352
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:16,042
Zhou Shiyun.

353
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,759
Nice dress!

354
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,409
Well,

355
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,166
how about lending me that clothes?

356
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:36,710
I'm joking.

357
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:40,309
What a cute bird.
Where did it come from?

358
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:00,375
Okay, thanks to both of you.
Let's call it a day.

359
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:01,650
-Fine.
-Thank you.

360
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,567
Thank you all.

361
00:31:03,934 --> 00:31:06,284
-Jinbei.
-Come on, tidying things up.

362
00:31:06,484 --> 00:31:08,586
Are you free?
I want to treat...

363
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,950
Sorry, I have an emergency tonight.

364
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:10,986
How about another day?

365
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,903
I got to go.

366
00:31:13,284 --> 00:31:14,117
Fine.

367
00:31:16,884 --> 00:31:17,717
Bye.

368
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,209
Hey, Didi, where are you?

369
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:23,148
Help me to come up with an idea
I'm eager to take him.

370
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:24,734
I'm outside, what's wrong?

371
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,284
Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?

372
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:31,500
I told you that I'm really in hurry.

373
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,184
I'll come to you later, bye.

374
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,667
Listen to me... Hey.

375
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:36,792
Hey?

376
00:31:39,784 --> 00:31:41,034
You are not a stand-up guy!

377
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,100
What do you think? Do you have a thorough
grasp of plot and character setting?

378
00:31:45,184 --> 00:31:47,850
Rest assured, sis Di. I have received
professional training at Drama academy.

379
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:48,784
With technical education.

380
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:51,793
You know that
there is absolutely no problem.

381
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:52,975
Well.

382
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:54,450
Here is half of your down payment.

383
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:56,209
And you will get full of it
after job is done.

384
00:31:56,609 --> 00:31:57,442
Got it.

385
00:31:57,634 --> 00:31:58,467
Thanks.

386
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:02,859
Here he comes.

387
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,192
What are you doing here?

388
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:18,509
Who are you?

389
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:21,642
What a coincidence!

390
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:23,509
Let me introduce to you.

391
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:25,634
This is my boyfriend, Victor.

392
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:27,308
He just came back from France.

393
00:32:27,393 --> 00:32:29,439
Now he is working as a senior executive
of a foreign company.

394
00:32:29,524 --> 00:32:30,357
Victor.

395
00:32:30,484 --> 00:32:33,034
This is my neighbor, Xiao Yuansong.

396
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:35,309
Nice to meet you, Mr. Xiao.

397
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:39,409
Just tell me.
What can I do to get you off?

398
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:40,804
I am a person.

399
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:43,059
You are also a person.

400
00:32:43,534 --> 00:32:45,534
It's not against the law
for me to badger you.

401
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,609
How about if I am not a person?

402
00:32:51,434 --> 00:32:52,267
Hello.

403
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:55,009
Well, I see that we are competitors now.

404
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:57,359
Fair competition then.

405
00:32:58,084 --> 00:32:59,375
Fair competition?

406
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:00,950
What? What are you talking about?

407
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:02,675
Xiao Yuansong, are you out of your mind?

408
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,225
I have already been in a relationship.

409
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:05,142
We just kissed.

410
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,159
Did you see that?

411
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:09,187
Yes, I did.

412
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:12,725
Just some tricks.

413
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:14,559
Seemingly, you have kissed.

414
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:16,459
But actually you didn't.

415
00:33:17,284 --> 00:33:18,800
Wu Di, you are a professional agent.

416
00:33:18,884 --> 00:33:20,060
And it is a nice trick.

417
00:33:20,144 --> 00:33:22,484
What?

418
00:33:25,634 --> 00:33:27,459
Which university did you graduate from?

419
00:33:32,116 --> 00:33:33,909
I mean... Which university
did you graduate from?

420
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:37,034
I just back from France last year.

421
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:38,276
What a coincidence.

422
00:33:40,934 --> 00:33:41,767
Wu Di.

423
00:33:42,184 --> 00:33:44,509
Thank you for bringing me such a play,

424
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:47,059
which shows that you care about me.

425
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:48,167
Don't worry.

426
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,484
I'll keep on trying.

427
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:51,492
Bye bye.

428
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,076
Since the play is done.

429
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,440
When can you check
the final payment?

430
00:34:01,524 --> 00:34:03,575
You suck!

431
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,960
How dare you pretend to be an overseas
returnee ignorant of French.

432
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:07,509
Zhou Shiyun.

433
00:35:08,725 --> 00:35:13,709
I'll let you be enchanted by me.
