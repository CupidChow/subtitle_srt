2
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:36,183
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,313
Come in.

4
00:01:58,706 --> 00:02:01,419
Dr. Zhou.
Preoperative test for Bed 7 in Ward 5.

5
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:02,959
Got it.

6
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:28,691
Good morning, Dr. Xiao.

7
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,325
Good morning, Dr. Xiao.

8
00:02:32,415 --> 00:02:34,150
What happened?

9
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,127
It's unusual.

10
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:09,656
This.

11
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:13,833
Is it serious?

12
00:03:14,757 --> 00:03:15,654
It's ok.

13
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,993
Hey.

14
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:53,815
What're you doing?

15
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:57,442
Answering a boring one's call.

16
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:00,131
By the way.

17
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:01,776
The recording for Heartbeats is tomorrow.

18
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,923
Is everything OK
for the site and rundown?

19
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:06,440
No. Absolutely no.

20
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,363
What's wrong?

21
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:11,495
I can't spend time with my Dr. Zhou.

22
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:13,975
Didi, listen to me.
I've achieved breakthrough,

23
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:15,743
when I went to his home last time.

24
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,618
You should see his look towards me
during the ancestor worship ceremony.

25
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:21,825
Besides.

26
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:26,681
All his family members like me so much
except for a difficult little girl.

27
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:29,731
But don't worry.
Everything is under my control.

28
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:31,728
-When...
-Su Jinbei!

29
00:04:32,578 --> 00:04:34,671
You're a female star.

30
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:37,140
Be professional!

31
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,063
All you're talking about is Dr. Zhou.

32
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,976
And you want to decline the program
that I got for you after great effort.

33
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,176
That's your attitude toward work?

34
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,151
What's wrong with you?

35
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:49,513
Everything!

36
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,173
I remind you again.

37
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:53,815
Zhou Shiyun has a friend
named Xiao Yuansong,

38
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:56,598
who's a playboy, a philanderer.

39
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:57,916
Zhou won't be better!

40
00:04:58,163 --> 00:04:59,430
He'll become the same sooner or later.

41
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:01,661
Wait a minute, Didi.

42
00:05:02,297 --> 00:05:04,036
Something's wrong.

43
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:06,524
Is there...

44
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:09,581
any story between you and Xiao Yuansong?

45
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:11,962
I get it.

46
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:15,802
When I called you recently.
There's always a man's voice.

47
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:17,227
It's Xiao Yuansong, right?

48
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,053
How far have you gone?

49
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:20,825
Tell me quickly.

50
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,041
It's over.

51
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:27,713
It's over?

52
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:31,559
What have you been through?

53
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,663
So you…

54
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:38,558
Beibei.

55
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:40,125
It's all over.

56
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:41,748
Just pretend you know nothing, OK?

57
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,461
Trust me, I'll keep the secret.

58
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:50,758
Although I'm not familiar
with Xiao Yuansong.

59
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:52,105
But, Didi.

60
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:54,113
Now that you're worried.

61
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,639
Please think twice, even thrice.

62
00:05:57,131 --> 00:06:00,531
I don't want you
to be hurt anymore.

63
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:03,359
Beibei.

64
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:06,398
I'm lucky to have you.

65
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,838
Otherwise, I don't know what I…

66
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:14,842
Your doorbell's ringing.

67
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:15,907
Hang on.

68
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:19,680
Coming.

69
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:25,388
Wow it's Dr. Zhou.

70
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,883
Dr. Zhou visits you?

71
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:28,860
Are there paparazzi?

72
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:30,401
Didi.

73
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:32,624
Take care.
I got to hang up now, bye.

74
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:38,246
Did you miss me already?

75
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:41,861
Special products from my hometown.
I forgot to give you last time.

76
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:46,811
How sweet of you
to bring them to me specially.

77
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:49,283
My grandma asked me to give them to you.

78
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:51,599
I get it.

79
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:55,221
It's your grandma's idea.
Nothing to do with you.

80
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,457
They're all my favorites.

81
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,744
Say thank you to grandma for me.

82
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:21,970
Did grandma asked you
to come in...

83
00:07:22,104 --> 00:07:24,681
and have a cup of coffee?

84
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:27,101
She didn't.

85
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:28,982
But I can't take it for granted.

86
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,285
Now that I've got the gift from you.

87
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:32,693
Isn't it impolite
if I don't invite you in?

88
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:34,568
Yes.

89
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:37,466
Then.

90
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:40,039
Will you?

91
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:41,798
No, thanks.

92
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,972
I have to go to work tomorrow.

93
00:07:44,894 --> 00:07:45,727
Fine.

94
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:48,058
You busy bee.
Bye bye then.

95
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,626
You make an excuse to visit me
but reject my invitation.

96
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:00,103
What's wrong with you!

97
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:08,573
I'm...

98
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:12,564
a little thirsty.

99
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:15,689
Come in.

100
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:22,725
I have all kinds of drinks.

101
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,845
Dry beer, white beer,
red wine, white wine,

102
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,618
and sparkling water and soft drinks.

103
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:28,205
By the way.

104
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:30,401
Do you know the story
between Wu Di and Xiao Yuansong?

105
00:08:30,486 --> 00:08:31,794
What happened between them?

106
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:39,541
If this test succeeded,

107
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,944
it'll benefit our hospital greatly
in future development.

108
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:44,174
So...

109
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:45,827
Xiao Yuansong.

110
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:47,525
What's wrong with you these two days?

111
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:50,006
Just haunting the hospital
like a ghost.

112
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:52,184
Listen.

113
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:57,294
Your attitude has greatly damaged
the image of our hospital.

114
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,293
Xiao Yuansong.

115
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:03,558
Director.

116
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:07,947
Xiao Yuansong.

117
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:28,482
Look at you.

118
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:29,546
Time to go.

119
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,512
Let's do some exercise.

120
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:32,253
What to do?

121
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:33,317
Basketball.

122
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:34,681
No.

123
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,434
Whatever.

124
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:39,102
If you don't care about Wu Di.

125
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:45,296
What? Wu Di?

126
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:49,344
Wait for me.

127
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,021
Inconstant?

128
00:09:52,453 --> 00:09:53,816
Fickle?

129
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,788
Philanderer?

130
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,914
Womanizer?

131
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:05,060
You see.

132
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:10,206
How could she describe me
with such terrible words.

133
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:11,375
She's right.

134
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:12,870
Of course not.

135
00:10:13,073 --> 00:10:14,355
Totally wrong.

136
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:16,940
It's ok if other people misunderstand me.
But you can't.

137
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:18,185
Am I a playboy?

138
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,208
Well. I have to admit that...

139
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,684
sometimes I may chat
a lot with the nurses.

140
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,203
But that's for easy working.

141
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:28,825
Nothing serious.

142
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:30,414
Besides.

143
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:35,271
I don't want people to know
that I'm just a love fool.

144
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:37,238
That's right.
It doesn't show my nature.

145
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:40,524
You don't have to tell me.

146
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:45,922
About the story of Wu Di.

147
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:47,769
Is it true that Su Jinbei told you so?

148
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:48,879
That's right.

149
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:53,927
I'm surprised that
she had such an unbearable history.

150
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:56,115
That guy is a damn bastard.

151
00:10:56,595 --> 00:10:57,428
Well.

152
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,118
This time I've violated her taboo
like touching a tiger's butt.

153
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:03,951
You deserve it.

154
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,360
I'm wronged.

155
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:08,041
Julie and I...

156
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:11,995
I admit that I talked too much with her.

157
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:14,686
But there's nothing between us.

158
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,985
That dinner was prepared for Wu Di
with all of my heart.

159
00:11:21,024 --> 00:11:22,109
Xiao Yuansong, tell me.

160
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,244
Do you want to have a serious relationship
with Wu Di?

161
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:26,424
Of course.

162
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:28,025
Look at me now.

163
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:30,261
Does Wu Di know that?

164
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,555
Have you showed that to her?

165
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:40,237
Good for you, buddy!

166
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:42,008
I'm enlightened.

167
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:44,806
I thought you're too aloof to master it.

168
00:11:44,947 --> 00:11:46,757
The engagement has really changed you.

169
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,158
Your lover will never leave you.

170
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,166
Thanks!

171
00:11:58,459 --> 00:11:59,726
Can I move it?

172
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,470
-Yes.
-Put it here.

173
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:04,129
Here's Jiawei.

174
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,652
Jiawei, have you read the game flow?

175
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:06,864
-It's interesting.
-That's right.

176
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:07,781
Jinbei.

177
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:10,165
-What a coincidence.
-You're early.

178
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:11,814
Jiawei.

179
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:12,731
Jinbei.

180
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:18,140
Jinbei.

181
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:20,591
Jinbei. You look good.

182
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:21,926
How do you keep fit?

183
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:22,843
Thank you.

184
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,823
What's your secret?

185
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:26,463
Sorry. What for?

186
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:30,502
I know it clearly that it's all
your credit for me to get involved.

187
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:33,327
I'm not such a big man.

188
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:35,771
Full credit should go to Mr. Shui.

189
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:39,589
You're still that guy
who pretended to not care...

190
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:42,610
but did all things for me secretly.

191
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:44,243
Thank you, Jiawei.

192
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,853
Get ready.

193
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,398
You're so hardworking.

194
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:48,555
Not at all.

195
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,385
Excuse me everyone.
Let's go for the recording.

196
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,522
-Fine.
-Fine.

197
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,439
Let's go.

198
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,458
See you later.

199
00:13:02,426 --> 00:13:03,259
Hey.

200
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:04,326
Have it started?

201
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:06,798
You're so good at timing.

202
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,987
Just about to go.

203
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,178
Grandma asked me to tell you.

204
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:11,865
Be careful.

205
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:14,340
Grandma said so?

206
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:16,536
What about you?

207
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:18,847
Be careful.

208
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:24,266
Fine. I'll take both grandma's
and your concern in mind.

209
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,184
Fine.

210
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:28,392
Hey? Hey?

211
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,897
So concise.

212
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:33,356
Jinbei, ready to go.

213
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:34,442
OK, let's go.

214
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:36,646
Go for it.

215
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:38,381
Our challenge today is...

216
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:42,337
Our guests in each group
will wear special costumes,

217
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,529
and stick to the wall.

218
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,140
The group with the lowest score
will face our sweet punishment.

219
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,301
Jinbe, we're pretty connected.

220
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:57,372
Audience watching the live on Shuabao...

221
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:59,430
can get gold coins
while watching the video.

222
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:01,540
You can exchange money with the coins.

223
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,356
So far the group with the lowest score
is Su Jinbei and Xu Jiawei.

224
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,817
Then you'll enjoy
our sweet punishment.

225
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:15,263
What is it?

226
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:17,823
Here it is.

227
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,822
You have to finish this shaved ice
within 30 seconds together.

228
00:14:21,906 --> 00:14:22,790
30 seconds?

229
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:24,088
Ready?

230
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:25,609
Now.

231
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,055
Come on!

232
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:30,390
Come on!

233
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:31,307
Come on!

234
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:34,577
Jiawei takes the whole bowl.

235
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:37,583
Does he think he can finish this alone?

236
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:39,918
Or he's taking care of Jinbei?

237
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:41,455
Jiawei's so nice.

238
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:44,982
I'm almost flipped.

239
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,539
Come on.

240
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:48,403
Come on.

241
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:49,688
Come on!

242
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:52,875
Are you waiting for an important message?

243
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:54,984
The guy you love?

244
00:14:55,582 --> 00:14:56,930
Kind of.

245
00:14:57,268 --> 00:15:00,852
Is he the hero in your recent rumor?

246
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:03,526
I'm dating a lot of guys in those rumors.
Who do you mean?

247
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:05,548
Xu Jiawei.

248
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:07,375
Xu Jiawei?

249
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:10,287
He's just a little kid.
I see him as my little brother.

250
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:12,119
It's impossible.

251
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:17,573
Come on, it's almost done.

252
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:18,841
-Come on!
-Jinbei.

253
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:19,889
Just like you.

254
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:21,597
I also have a crush.

255
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:26,332
I often hold my phone
and check for his message.

256
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:30,154
I'm waiting for him all the time.

257
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:32,867
Did she mean…

258
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:34,982
Xu Jiawei?

259
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:42,040
After the three rounds of games
and internal vote.

260
00:15:42,183 --> 00:15:43,997
Now we have our queen for today.

261
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:45,506
Congratulations!

262
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:47,287
Su Jinbei!

263
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:49,805
-Good for you, Jinbei.
-Congratulations.

264
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,224
Thank you.
Thank you all.

265
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:54,650
Jinbei can draw
for your next partner first.

266
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:57,975
The name cards are already in this box.

267
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:59,177
Please, Jinbei.

268
00:16:05,012 --> 00:16:08,977
Our audience watching the live
on Shuabao APP...

269
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,113
can keep voting and leave messages.

270
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,702
Your votes will influence
the sweet punishment for next time.

271
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,253
Welcome to Heartbeats
which is exclusively sponsored by...

272
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,730
the short video app Shuabao.

273
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:29,983
This is a programme
for love interactions.

274
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:32,208
Have you watched the programme?
Which couple do you like?

275
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:34,420
Of course Su&Xu.

276
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:37,108
Su Jinbei and Xu Jiawei?

277
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:38,172
Me too.

278
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,831
It's on.

279
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,459
To finish the games.

280
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:43,023
There're three rounds in total.

281
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:47,225
Every time, the last group
will be punished.

282
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:49,892
For better understanding.

283
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:51,508
Be abstinent for watching TV.

284
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:53,411
You should take more rest.

285
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,935
Top 1 today
will receive a mysterious gift.

286
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,475
No one's answering?

287
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,778
What's the matter?

288
00:17:37,946 --> 00:17:38,779
Wu Di.

289
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:57,240
What's up?
He's even here.

290
00:17:57,752 --> 00:17:59,024
I don't think Wu Di knows it.

291
00:17:59,757 --> 00:18:00,590
Di.

292
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:03,847
What's wrong?

293
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:05,218
What's going on?

294
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:06,920
Go check downstairs.

295
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:13,403
So romantic!

296
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:15,265
He is showing love downstairs.

297
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:28,215
Di.

298
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:33,553
So many different ways.

299
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,887
That's pretty sweet.

300
00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:39,573
She's angry.

301
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:41,685
-Stop it!
-She's angry.

302
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:42,602
She's upset.

303
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:45,342
-It's clearly a love confession.
-How many people will know it?

304
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:48,552
I'm going to send it to my boyfriend.

305
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:51,016
-Take a picture for me.
-Photo it.

306
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:52,532
What do you think?

307
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,046
-Nice?
-Very nice!

308
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:55,484
Beautiful.

309
00:18:57,706 --> 00:18:58,539
Excuse me.

310
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:00,381
Who's she?

311
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:01,897
Be quiet.

312
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:21,480
Where are you going?

313
00:19:22,231 --> 00:19:23,848
What? It's time to go.

314
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:25,787
Why are you in such a hurry?

315
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,574
I'm going to make preparations
for my next plan.

316
00:19:28,658 --> 00:19:31,747
I'll show Wu Di my love to her.

317
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:32,807
Bye.

318
00:19:37,162 --> 00:19:41,082
Show her the love.

319
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,860
-Look.
-Wu Di.

320
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:48,458
-It's him.
-Again?

321
00:19:48,964 --> 00:19:49,797
Right.

322
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:53,058
-He's so persistent.
-Is he the guy here before?

323
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:57,735
What are you doing this for?

324
00:19:58,866 --> 00:19:59,702
This...

325
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,500
This is literally what it means.

326
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:08,219
Whatever.

327
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:10,099
Don't waste your time.

328
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:11,348
Refused again.

329
00:20:14,595 --> 00:20:16,306
-That's so hurtful.
-Too straightforward.

330
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:17,716
Awkward!

331
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:22,831
I can leave the hospital soon.

332
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:24,692
-Really?
-Dr. Xiao.

333
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:27,440
-Finally.
-Failed again?

334
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:31,085
It's just temporary.

335
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:33,674
Temporary failure.

336
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:38,032
I can't get you kids understood.

337
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:39,372
I...

338
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,205
No.
I can't talk to you from now on.

339
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,614
After all, I'm not what I used to be.

340
00:20:45,892 --> 00:20:47,412
Standing in front of you...

341
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:49,680
is an honest gentleman.

342
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:52,283
I can't accost girls casually.

343
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,729
You should be on your round.

344
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:58,136
I'm...

345
00:20:58,452 --> 00:21:00,513
I'm teaching them
the truth of being a man.

346
00:21:01,191 --> 00:21:02,175
The old habit again.

347
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,058
Just do your work.

348
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:05,915
Fine.

349
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:08,241
-Bed 16.
-OK.

350
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:09,825
Did you watch that show yesterday?

351
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,990
It's so sweet between
Su Jinbei and Xu Jiawei.

352
00:21:12,344 --> 00:21:14,676
Yes, I did.
Especially the part for shaved ice.

353
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:15,751
Super sweet.

354
00:21:15,981 --> 00:21:18,557
-That's right.
-And Jinbei was so funny yesterday.

355
00:21:18,716 --> 00:21:19,549
That's right.

356
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,165
Come on.

357
00:21:57,305 --> 00:21:58,138
Come on!

358
00:21:58,223 --> 00:21:59,088
Awesome.

359
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:00,715
Come on! Come on!

360
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,514
-Jiawei's amazing.
-Come on, Jiawei.

361
00:22:02,716 --> 00:22:03,549
Come on!

362
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:05,251
Come on!

363
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:07,152
Jiawei's so nice.

364
00:22:07,236 --> 00:22:08,744
He ate the whole bowl of ice.

365
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,558
Every girl will feel flipped.

366
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:22,497
Experts say...

367
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:27,448
It's of great harm to women
to eat cold stuff in winter.

368
00:22:29,356 --> 00:22:30,343
Seriously?

369
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,270
Zhou Shiyun posted a moment.

370
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,795
Beibei, it may require…

371
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,643
What's wrong?

372
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:41,702
Gosh.

373
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:42,894
Oh my gosh.

374
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:45,359
Is he mad at me?

375
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,992
Are you listening?
What happened?

376
00:22:49,514 --> 00:22:50,926
Just look at your phone.

377
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:57,485
-What do you mean?
-Look who posted it.

378
00:22:58,096 --> 00:22:58,990
Zhou Shiyun.

379
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,952
He's a doctor.
It's normal.

380
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:04,597
That's his first moment.
The first one.

381
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:06,675
So what?

382
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:09,071
Think about his subtext.

383
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,307
Get it? So silly.

384
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,023
Hey.

385
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:26,491
Dr. Zhou.

386
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:27,664
Are you busy?

387
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:29,493
What's the matter?

388
00:23:31,183 --> 00:23:32,769
I'd like to ask you a question.

389
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,199
If I've had cold food in winter
what should I do?

390
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:40,502
Drink more hot water.

391
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:44,963
Dr. Zhou.

392
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:46,055
Let me tell you.

393
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,431
In the show I may have to do something
that I'm not willing to.

394
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:53,579
Like eating something or with someone.

395
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:57,355
As an artist I can't refuse it.

396
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,334
But you know.

397
00:23:58,418 --> 00:24:02,070
If I cooperate and do it
to make the show better...

398
00:24:02,422 --> 00:24:05,844
it only means
I'm very professional.

399
00:24:06,543 --> 00:24:08,892
Nothing else.

400
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:10,291
What do you mean?

401
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,431
I mean.

402
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:15,257
If you've watched or heard...

403
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:17,568
some episodes from others,

404
00:24:17,782 --> 00:24:19,262
don't take it seriously.

405
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,762
What episodes?

406
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:23,792
I'm too busy to watch the show.

407
00:24:23,986 --> 00:24:25,619
Miss Su, it's your turn.

408
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:28,074
Fine.

409
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,380
OK.

410
00:24:29,464 --> 00:24:30,700
Talk to you later.

411
00:24:30,784 --> 00:24:33,330
Got to hang up.
I know you've understood.

412
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:34,984
-Bye.
-Bye.

413
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:45,389
Fine

414
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:46,468
10 seconds left.

415
00:24:47,113 --> 00:24:48,649
-Ten, nine.
-Come on.

416
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:49,636
-Come on.
-Eight.

417
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,291
-Come on.
-Seven.

418
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:18,653
What're you doing?

419
00:25:18,956 --> 00:25:20,345
Searching for information.

420
00:25:21,537 --> 00:25:24,128
Locking the door for that?

421
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,150
Hand it over.

422
00:25:27,347 --> 00:25:28,228
What?

423
00:25:28,354 --> 00:25:29,187
Your phone.

424
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:30,824
What?

425
00:25:32,011 --> 00:25:33,160
I doubt...

426
00:25:34,136 --> 00:25:35,702
you're kidnapped by your phone.

427
00:25:36,424 --> 00:25:37,482
Idiot.

428
00:25:41,193 --> 00:25:42,026
Tell me...

429
00:25:42,738 --> 00:25:45,311
why did you post a moment suddenly?

430
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:48,148
Why did you ignore my message?

431
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:51,774
Tell me. Who was on the phone?

432
00:25:52,746 --> 00:25:54,083
Say it or not!
Say it or not!

433
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:56,205
Whose moment is it?

434
00:25:56,315 --> 00:25:57,388
It's Professor Zhou.

435
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,911
Oh my gosh!
I'll make a wish to this post.

436
00:25:59,995 --> 00:26:01,910
It's even rarer than a meteor.

437
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:05,388
The moment of Professor Zhou
is not blank anymore.

438
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:08,863
Come on.

439
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:09,990
Come on!

440
00:26:10,547 --> 00:26:12,781
Jiawei takes the whole bowl.

441
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:15,373
Su Jinbei!

442
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:17,944
Or he's taking care of Jinbei?

443
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,723
Jiawei's so nice.

444
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,394
I'm almost flipped.

445
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:24,911
Come on.

446
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:27,782
Su Jinbei!

447
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:29,725
I'm really pissed at you.

448
00:26:30,628 --> 00:26:32,323
That's intolerant.

449
00:26:37,737 --> 00:26:38,581
Buddies.

450
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:41,898
It's time for our Jiawei fans club
to take actions.

451
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:44,693
-Got it.
-Got it.

452
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:47,183
Su Jinbei!

453
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:48,583
Wait and see.

454
00:27:37,371 --> 00:27:38,674
Dr. Zhou.

455
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,279
Shiyun.

456
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,614
Why are you here?

457
00:27:49,526 --> 00:27:51,358
I'm here cuz I miss you.

458
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:55,786
By the way
I also bring you cute desserts.

459
00:28:00,385 --> 00:28:01,748
My recording site is nearby.

460
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:04,430
Look at me.
I don't dress like this usually.

461
00:28:04,514 --> 00:28:05,833
Isn't it special?

462
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:07,756
No.

463
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:10,673
Just say yes.

464
00:28:10,942 --> 00:28:13,395
I managed to visit you in busy time.

465
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:15,194
That's enough.

466
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:16,374
I have an operation.

467
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,734
Is he really mad at me?

468
00:28:39,492 --> 00:28:40,490
Glowworm.

469
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:42,022
-I'm Dafei.
-Hello.

470
00:28:42,106 --> 00:28:42,939
Hello.

471
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:45,211
We just act as planned.

472
00:28:45,822 --> 00:28:48,306
Once there're communications
between Su Jinbei and other guys.

473
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:51,625
I'll share it on Shuabao immediately
to show it to all fans in the world.

474
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:53,299
-What do you think?
-Then Su Jinbei...

475
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:54,827
can't accost our Jiawei again.

476
00:28:55,085 --> 00:28:56,622
-Right.
-Let me show you.

477
00:28:58,553 --> 00:28:59,813
Awesome?

478
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:01,499
So many followers.

479
00:29:01,848 --> 00:29:02,681
Good.

480
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:05,428
Let's talk during breakfast.

481
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:06,373
-Fine.
-Let's go.

482
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:07,290
Let's go.

483
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:17,407
You must be tired.

484
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:19,461
Have some desserts.

485
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:33,154
Hi.

486
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:35,004
Is the surgery over?

487
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:36,351
Yes.

488
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,826
You must be tired.

489
00:29:37,937 --> 00:29:38,987
Have you had the desserts?

490
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:41,263
I'm just about to eat.

491
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,530
It's delicious.

492
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,702
If you like it
I can buy you next time.

493
00:29:45,813 --> 00:29:47,199
Miss Su, it's your turn.

494
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:48,899
I got to go.

495
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,093
I'll call you later.

496
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:51,985
Bye.

497
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:53,631
Coming.

498
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,777
Hello.

499
00:30:08,862 --> 00:30:10,985
Hello friends on Shuabao.

500
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,162
It's me again.

501
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:15,416
I'm now at the site of Heartbeats.

502
00:30:16,268 --> 00:30:21,871
After exciting games we're taking
rest and waiting for the next round.

503
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:23,452
It's Jinbei.

504
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:26,118
Let's see what she's doing.

505
00:30:26,202 --> 00:30:27,494
You were not like this before.

506
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:29,174
Why does it last so long this time?

507
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:31,237
We have a task this time.

508
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:34,147
That's not we've agreed on before.

509
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,951
It's not the right time.

510
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,199
But what is the right time?

511
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,915
You told me to focus on acting.

512
00:30:46,682 --> 00:30:47,844
This photo.

513
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:49,931
Xiaowai saw it in the fan base.

514
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:53,365
Jiawei.

515
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:56,211
When you found me
to intercede for Gao Zitong,

516
00:30:56,378 --> 00:30:58,033
and tried to get her for the program.

517
00:30:58,117 --> 00:30:59,094
What did you say?

518
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:02,044
That's what you mean
by playing down the CP...

519
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:03,911
and creating something
of a sibling relationship.

520
00:31:04,392 --> 00:31:05,492
I hope these photos...

521
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:08,892
can work as you expected.

522
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,047
I don't want to see
any other interpretations.

523
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:28,642
How I wish the photos were real.

524
00:31:31,867 --> 00:31:32,717
Go to bed earlier.

525
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:44,789
-Ready?
-Alright.

526
00:31:44,873 --> 00:31:45,706
Ready.

527
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:46,998
Go.

528
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:54,250
Ball?

529
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:56,734
Fried Egg!

530
00:31:56,984 --> 00:31:57,817
Pass, pass, pass.

531
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,393
Make a change.

532
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:04,849
Well. Mask?

533
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:05,766
Facial mask?

534
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:06,860
No, it's facial makeup.

535
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,175
Superman.

536
00:32:08,335 --> 00:32:09,168
Ten.

537
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:10,197
Ultraman.

538
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:11,114
-Nine...
-Pass!

539
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,523
Eight.

540
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:14,573
-Seven.
-Er... Well.

541
00:32:14,783 --> 00:32:16,056
-Beauty.
-Six.

542
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,671
-Wig.
-Five.

543
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:19,422
-Heavy make-up?
-Four.

544
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:20,767
-Princess.
-Three.

545
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,200
-Dress-up dolls.
-Two.

546
00:32:22,284 --> 00:32:23,117
Pass.

547
00:32:23,256 --> 00:32:25,133
One. Time's up.

548
00:32:26,323 --> 00:32:27,647
What a pity!

549
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:31,105
So Jinbei will face the music.

550
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,324
Jiawei, it's OK.

551
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:34,168
Be careful, Jinbei.

552
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:35,482
Don't worry.

553
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:45,955
Jinbei.

554
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,088
Jinbei.

555
00:32:47,351 --> 00:32:48,478
Jinbei, are you OK?

556
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:49,876
Miss Su, are you OK?

557
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:52,299
-Jiawei.
-How can you let a girl to the hathpace?

558
00:32:52,383 --> 00:32:54,083
Because I don't want
to show off the painting skill.

559
00:32:54,215 --> 00:32:55,151
So I did it.

560
00:32:55,235 --> 00:32:57,369
I didn't expect to give
the programming division so much trouble.

561
00:32:58,465 --> 00:33:00,124
Jinbei. Are you Ok?

562
00:33:00,485 --> 00:33:01,966
-Jinbei, are you OK?
-Jinbei, are you OK?

563
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,684
-Can you walk?
-Beibei, what's wrong?

564
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:04,709
What's up?

565
00:33:04,861 --> 00:33:05,694
My feet.

566
00:33:06,366 --> 00:33:07,979
They're hardly to move.

567
00:33:14,604 --> 00:33:16,312
Let's go to the hospital.

568
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:18,932
Let's go.

569
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,038
Watch out!

570
00:33:22,256 --> 00:33:23,352
-Slowly.
-I'm...

571
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:24,269
Jinbei.

572
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:25,384
Take care.

573
00:33:28,794 --> 00:33:30,741
-Is that OK?
-Jinbei, I'll hail a taxi.

574
00:33:31,288 --> 00:33:32,121
Jinbei.

575
00:33:32,366 --> 00:33:35,391
I'm... How about letting me send you
to the hospital?

576
00:33:35,996 --> 00:33:37,637
It's fine. Don't look so blue.

577
00:33:37,986 --> 00:33:40,425
Just follow the programming division.
You should finish the program first.

578
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:41,886
Let's go.

579
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,602
-Bye
-I'll see you later.

580
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:45,338
Fine.

581
00:34:14,945 --> 00:34:16,297
Don't play dumb with me.

582
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:18,954
That's too much.

583
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:21,421
Su Jinbei pulled out
of the show because of an injury.

584
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:22,801
Now you must be satisfied.

585
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:25,008
You've got it.

586
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:27,129
I see through your little game.

587
00:34:27,354 --> 00:34:29,464
We've fought a battle of wits
and courage for so many years.

588
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:32,542
I'm not pretending.

589
00:34:32,646 --> 00:34:34,617
It really hurts.

590
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:35,864
Well.

591
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:40,289
Thanks to timely bandaging
or the broken skin will be healed up.

592
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:43,337
It's waste of bandages.

593
00:34:43,824 --> 00:34:44,986
My dear Didi.

594
00:34:46,615 --> 00:34:49,218
Finally, you're going to kill me.
You'd better go back.

595
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:51,740
Bye, dear Didi.

596
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,478
Wait till tomorrow, I'll be scolded.

597
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:23,390
Who is injured?

598
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,246
On purpose!

599
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:27,699
Such beautiful legs.

600
00:36:28,216 --> 00:36:29,670
Who else?

601
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:31,570
Dr. Zhou.

602
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:35,032
You see I was hurt so badly.

603
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:42,864
What's the matter?

604
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:45,416
You finally realize that
you should care about me.

605
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,252
I'm from a...

606
00:36:49,892 --> 00:36:50,725
from a very,

607
00:36:50,865 --> 00:36:51,698
very,

608
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:53,147
very,

609
00:36:53,772 --> 00:36:55,245
high place.

610
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:57,456
Shouldn't you be in the hospital now?

611
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:00,355
Well.

612
00:37:02,606 --> 00:37:03,647
But I'm lucky enough.

613
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,297
Not so serious.

614
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:08,436
But.

615
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:11,135
That really hurts.

616
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:12,608
Can you walk?

617
00:37:14,528 --> 00:37:16,033
Let me have a try.

618
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,234
Oh, no.

619
00:37:22,903 --> 00:37:23,997
That hurts.

620
00:37:27,353 --> 00:37:28,453
Do you have any medicine at home?

621
00:37:30,188 --> 00:37:31,886
-No.
-Stay home and wait for me.

622
00:37:41,357 --> 00:37:43,511
I didn't expect you've got a quick temper.

623
00:38:09,693 --> 00:38:10,755
-Let's go.
-Cheer up then.

624
00:38:10,877 --> 00:38:11,710
Well then.

625
00:38:12,328 --> 00:38:13,604
I'd better go, Jinbei.

626
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,827
No.
It's dangerous, let me do it.

627
00:38:16,217 --> 00:38:17,775
Then you can't do it too.

628
00:38:18,341 --> 00:38:19,181
It's OK.

629
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:21,419
You said you have a fear of heights.

630
00:38:21,503 --> 00:38:22,336
Let me do it.

631
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:23,918
I'm leaving.

632
00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:24,888
Jinbei.

633
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:28,834
Let me send you to the hospital.

634
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:31,247
It's fine. Don't look so blue.

635
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:34,147
Just follow the programming division.
You should finish the program first.

636
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,064
-Let's go.
-Bye

637
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,431
I'll see you later.

638
00:38:38,324 --> 00:38:39,157
OK.

639
00:38:57,256 --> 00:38:58,089
Coming.

640
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:02,801
Coming.

641
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,684
Coming, wait a moment!

642
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:20,006
Coming.

643
00:39:20,176 --> 00:39:22,094
Coming, coming.

644
00:39:25,387 --> 00:39:26,929
You're home alone?
