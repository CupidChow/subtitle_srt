3
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,025
Dr. Zhou, you have a call.

4
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:47,265
The crew is ready.
They are waiting for you.

5
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:54,757
This way.

6
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,190
Watch out.

7
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:02,765
Move forward.

8
00:03:06,315 --> 00:03:07,190
This way.

9
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:31,715
Ready?

10
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:41,327
I'm ready.
Let's begin now.

11
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:42,452
Tweezers.

12
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:43,827
Scissors.

13
00:03:45,544 --> 00:03:46,385
Wipe the sweat.

14
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:47,694
Gauze. Oxygen.

15
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,444
-Pay attention to dissection.
-BP 127, 87.

16
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:53,369
Heartbeat 78. Everything is all right.

17
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,235
Although they're not here,

18
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,994
their hearts must've flutter over here.

19
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:04,119
Today, young people
are busy with their business.

20
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:05,494
Right.

21
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:08,044
Perhaps we could make another appointment.

22
00:04:09,144 --> 00:04:12,069
Work won't get in the way.

23
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:15,219
Uncle, aunt,

24
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:18,375
we had an arrangement.

25
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,134
It doesn't matter
whether Shiyun comes here or not.

26
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,619
I'm here now.

27
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:23,444
I'll settle our promised arrangement.

28
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,310
That's right. That's right.

29
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:27,385
Done.

30
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:29,010
Cheers!

31
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:31,210
Congratulations!

32
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:32,844
Congratulations!

33
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:35,427
Help yourself!

34
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:37,027
Help yourself!

35
00:05:06,094 --> 00:05:08,919
You look busy after an operation.

36
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:10,459
Don't you think you're working so hard?

37
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,469
Just grab a bite.
Xiaoyun sent it to you.

38
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:14,969
I'm not hungry.

39
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:18,244
Right, our professor Zhou...

40
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:20,844
is different from us ordinary people.

41
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:24,669
Without the slightest taste of food
or water, you can live with wind and dew.

42
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:28,769
Zhou.

43
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:33,519
Don't you think
I look so much more handsome than you?

44
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:37,669
Why these nurses
send gifts to you but not me?

45
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:41,660
It couldn't have anything to do
with the fact that I am cold and elegant.

46
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:42,944
The weather is cold today.

47
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:49,319
Just out of curiosity,

48
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:55,944
these flowery girls
are waiting in line to tempt you.

49
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:57,919
I'm wondering why aren't you tempted.

50
00:05:58,017 --> 00:06:01,217
In my eyes,
all men are an aggregation of organs,

51
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:03,246
men and women, beautiful and ugly.

52
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:08,667
It's a great casualty of beauty.

53
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:11,942
If it goes on like this,
you'll never get married.

54
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:15,967
I'm engaged.

55
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,267
You're engaged?

56
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:19,250
Miss Jinbei.

57
00:06:20,442 --> 00:06:21,292
Miss Jinbei.

58
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:26,492
Can we start now?

59
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:27,716
Yes.

60
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:31,633
Have you finished?

61
00:06:31,717 --> 00:06:32,958
It's time for us.

62
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,367
Got it. Got it

63
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:37,958
Buddy, what's going on?

64
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:39,158
What they are yelling for?

65
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:41,008
It seems that another crew
has also located this place.

66
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:42,067
They're negotiating.

67
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:44,067
If you can't handle it,
Jiawei won't act anymore.

68
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:45,967
I need to talk with them.

69
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,283
We must shoot a scene first.

70
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:48,617
It screwed up our plans.

71
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:50,767
Have some water.

72
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:52,350
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

73
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:55,767
Xu Jiawei.

74
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:59,592
The agency where he belongs to
is very difficult to deal with.

75
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:08,742
You, such a stone-cold fox,
why are you engaged?

76
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:10,817
You just want to be inapproachable?

77
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:13,942
But it doesn't help to tell me that.

78
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,942
Just tell the girls outside.

79
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:17,867
It's not a lie.

80
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:19,767
The engagement party is being held now.

81
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:21,367
Perhaps,

82
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:23,292
it's about to end.

83
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:24,817
Really?

84
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:27,433
You're not even going
to the engagement party?

85
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:28,667
It's arranged by my parents.

86
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:30,067
I don't even know her.

87
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:31,417
How can I take it seriously?

88
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:32,675
Besides,

89
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:34,717
I have to work today.

90
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:40,167
Don't answer it.

91
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:44,958
Why won't you answer the phone, Beibei?

92
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:47,042
I've been calling you.

93
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:48,575
Beibei?

94
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:50,133
Are you listening?

95
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:51,050
Mom.

96
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:54,167
Did you know that we're waiting
for you now?

97
00:07:54,442 --> 00:07:57,567
Well, since you've made the decision
for me, you shall do it on your own.

98
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:02,417
What? Engagement?
What are you talking about?

99
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:11,333
My mom!

100
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:13,717
She takes the child betrothal seriously!

101
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:24,667
Me... It's me.

102
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,460
Jiawei! Jiawei!

103
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:35,942
Jiawei, wait for me!

104
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:40,875
Jinbei.

105
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,817
Aren't you driving so fast?

106
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:45,192
Safety first.

107
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:46,758
Take it easy. I've driven a race car.

108
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:47,967
Great demigod driving.

109
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:50,317
You've driven a race car!

110
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:51,692
Where?

111
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:54,042
-On the filming site.
-Eyes on the road.

112
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,542
I was in a movie called Full Throttle.

113
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:58,392
I played a speed racer.

114
00:08:58,717 --> 00:08:59,742
You've watched it, right?

115
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:03,533
Two years ago, right?

116
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:06,158
Yes, yes.
I was training abroad at that time.

117
00:09:06,242 --> 00:09:08,400
And it went well with my rice.

118
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:09,817
Fantastic.

119
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:13,467
Jinbei, I'll never forget
the last scene of you.

120
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:15,992
You braked hard through oil drums.

121
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:18,333
You stopped on one wheel
and got off.

122
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,217
You took off the helmet
and swing your hair.

123
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:22,767
There were flames behind you.

124
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:24,467
That scene is splendid.

125
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,192
And you're amazing.

126
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,683
I didn't think you've watched it.

127
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,600
Yeah.

128
00:09:35,017 --> 00:09:35,850
Jinbei.

129
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,467
I've heard that in that scene,
you didn't use a stuntman.

130
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:40,942
You've done it on your own.

131
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:44,067
Let me tell you a secret.
Just between you and me.

132
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,550
In that scene,

133
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:48,642
The only thing I did it is getting off
the car, the rest was done by stuntman.

134
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,842
What? You must be kidding, right?

135
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:56,492
Don't be such a chicken.

136
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:57,725
Jiawei.

137
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:00,067
Jinbei.

138
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,567
I want to get off.

139
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:12,850
Watch out!

140
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,792
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

141
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:38,617
-What's wrong with her?
-A car accident. She bumped her head.

142
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,492
Did you check her Coma Scale?

143
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,925
Just hold on. Relax.

144
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:57,483
Change the bed.

145
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,332
Ready to have her blood pressure checked.
Oxygen connection.

146
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:00,792
Call the department of osteology.

147
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:02,467
Watch your wound to avoid infection.

148
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,232
Family member! Is any family member here?

149
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:06,142
Can you hear me?
I need to check your hearbeat.

150
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:07,750
Dr. Zhou, it's ready.

151
00:11:11,717 --> 00:11:12,550
Oxygen is ready.

152
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:14,692
What about her BP?

153
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,042
Lower extremity joints are fine.

154
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,183
BP 110, 73.

155
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:20,100
Fine.

156
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,342
Her pupils are reactive.

157
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:28,475
She had a head injury.
Middle coma.

158
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,017
Prepped for surgery.

159
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:31,942
It's ready. Room 1.

160
00:12:00,242 --> 00:12:01,317
She looks familiar.

161
00:12:01,717 --> 00:12:02,683
Isn't she...

162
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:03,600
No.

163
00:12:07,617 --> 00:12:11,892
The craniotomy made me dizzy.
And my memory is bad.

164
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:15,842
You're awake.

165
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:18,142
Didi.

166
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:20,867
You shouldn't talk right now.
You should have a good rest.

167
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:25,567
I saw the eyes...

168
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:27,767
clear...

169
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:30,592
deep...

170
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,667
like a lake.

171
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:38,567
The wind is blowing and he's smiling,

172
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:42,592
rippling the surface.

173
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:45,992
What are you talking about?

174
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,792
I remember she wore ancient costume,
and she could fly.

175
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:51,267
No. It's none of your business.

176
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:55,142
As an old man, do you think it's suitable
to stare at a girl like that?

177
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,667
Go to sleep.

178
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:58,467
It's her.

179
00:12:59,092 --> 00:12:59,925
I'm not mistaken.

180
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:03,475
I've seen her on the TV
wearing the ancient costume.

181
00:13:14,642 --> 00:13:15,567
How do you feel? Zhou.

182
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,617
Su Jinbei, an aggregation
of exquisite organs...

183
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:20,067
did your adrenaline...

184
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:23,492
kick in?

185
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:28,817
But as a icy man with icy face,
you might not be her type.

186
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,492
Only me, a cool guy, sunny and dashing...

187
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:35,792
a guy like me can be her style.

188
00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:52,067
May I inquire about
the attending physician of Su Jinbei?

189
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,067
It's me. What's wrong?

190
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,017
I'm her celebrity agent. My name is Wu Di.

191
00:13:56,217 --> 00:13:59,342
Could you arrange
a general inpatient ward for her?

192
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:02,067
There are no spare beds.
I'm sorry.

193
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:05,667
Zhou, what are you talking about?

194
00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:11,467
Pretty agent, I'll check it out.

195
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:15,317
Just leave it to me.

196
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:17,383
Take care.

197
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:18,300
Push.

198
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,392
Take care.

199
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:23,492
-Turn it around.
-Harder.

200
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:24,725
Well.

201
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:26,931
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

202
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:37,548
Pretty agent.

203
00:14:38,242 --> 00:14:39,075
May I ask a question?

204
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:43,467
I've heard that Miss Su and the actor
Zhao Yiming is in a relationship.

205
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,117
Is it true?

206
00:14:45,492 --> 00:14:46,617
It's not true.

207
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:48,292
I knew it.

208
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:52,117
Except that he's good-looking,
he's normal.

209
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:53,989
Slim.

210
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:55,174
Not tall.

211
00:14:55,442 --> 00:14:57,267
He cannot match Su Jinbei.

212
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:58,417
Am I right?

213
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:00,250
Sorry.

214
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,892
Miss Su needs to rest now.

215
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,333
So please...

216
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,250
I see.

217
00:15:06,717 --> 00:15:08,517
I'm going to check on her later.

218
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:11,367
Bye.

219
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:32,317
What are you looking at?

220
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:40,033
Professor Zhou's never watched
the entertainment news,

221
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:42,417
why are you paying attention
to the gossip pages?

222
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:45,617
Just to kill time.

223
00:15:47,592 --> 00:15:49,792
All are Su Jinbei's pictures.

224
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:54,592
That's why you're weird today
and was on call with me.

225
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:56,917
Honestly.

226
00:15:57,892 --> 00:15:59,292
Do you have a crush on her?

227
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:01,200
Remember,

228
00:16:01,717 --> 00:16:04,492
you're engaged.

229
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:09,467
She's my fiancee.

230
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:05,017
Ouch!

231
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,217
Ouch!

232
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:12,156
Where exactly do you feel pain?

233
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:53,892
Watch out!

234
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,158
There's a car accident
on Xiaoyao Second Road this afternoon.

235
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:26,208
It's said that the driver
is the popular star Su Jinbei.

236
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:27,842
Now she's rushed to hospital.

237
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,283
The cause of the accident
is under investigation.

238
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,617
We'll keep watching.

239
00:19:48,442 --> 00:19:49,842
Didi.

240
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:51,967
You're awake.

241
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:53,832
You just got out of surgery on your head.

242
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:55,442
You need to get some sleep.

243
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:56,742
My head?

244
00:19:58,042 --> 00:19:59,417
You mean a craniotomy?

245
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,150
-Take care.
-What about my face?

246
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,742
Is it going to leave a scar?

247
00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:04,567
Give me the mirror, hurry.

248
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:05,942
Don't worry.

249
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:07,267
You've got an otolithiasis.

250
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,917
Just a minimally invasive surgery.
It won't leave a scar.

251
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:13,817
My forehead.

252
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:17,542
I am disfigured.

253
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,342
It's all right. It's just a skin trauma.

254
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:20,392
It'll be fine in two days.

255
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:22,667
It won't leave a scar, right?

256
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:23,692
No, it won't.

257
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,342
Thank god.

258
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:49,117
Didi, Didi.

259
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:51,017
I lost my first kiss.

260
00:20:52,242 --> 00:20:53,242
What the hell!

261
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:55,567
Someone kissed me last night!

262
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:57,425
Last night?

263
00:20:57,892 --> 00:21:00,017
Are you dreaming?

264
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:01,992
I have evidence.

265
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,267
But...

266
00:21:06,592 --> 00:21:07,767
surgical mask!

267
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:10,467
He must have done it!

268
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:11,542
Oh, no!

269
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:13,467
I must talk to the director.

270
00:21:27,843 --> 00:21:28,743
Pretty agent.

271
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:33,192
Did your super star Su
slept well last night?

272
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,042
I'll check...

273
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:39,042
the ward.

274
00:21:39,571 --> 00:21:40,746
I...

275
00:21:42,642 --> 00:21:44,292
leave it to me.

276
00:21:47,717 --> 00:21:49,199
I'm going to check on her later.

277
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,742
Bye.

278
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:14,192
Baby, I'm coming.

279
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:17,842
Go. Let's talk to your director.

280
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:20,867
-Go.
-For what?

281
00:22:21,057 --> 00:22:22,323
What do you think?

282
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,300
Let go.

283
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:25,942
Come in, please.

284
00:22:53,817 --> 00:22:56,117
She had a head injury, middle coma.

285
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:20,325
What should I do?

286
00:23:20,642 --> 00:23:22,692
He was my first kiss.

287
00:23:23,842 --> 00:23:24,992
The first kiss.

288
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:27,067
It doesn't count in my scenes!

289
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:28,892
That's part of my act.

290
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:30,133
But it's real.

291
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:32,067
The only real first kiss.

292
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:33,433
Alright.

293
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:35,467
I'll kill him for you.

294
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:39,942
But he doesn't look like a bad man.

295
00:23:40,492 --> 00:23:41,942
Perhaps it's an accident.

296
00:23:42,492 --> 00:23:43,542
Don't be obsessed over him!

297
00:23:46,117 --> 00:23:47,142
Calm down.

298
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:48,650
Be cool.

299
00:24:01,217 --> 00:24:02,917
Although it's an accident yesterday,

300
00:24:03,217 --> 00:24:07,942
you need to know
he's deep in love with me.

301
00:24:08,692 --> 00:24:10,917
He doesn't look at you,

302
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,267
Because he's nervous.
Can't you hear his heart pounding?

303
00:24:14,692 --> 00:24:18,017
I can only hear yours.

304
00:24:18,242 --> 00:24:21,967
If he dare to watch me,
I must feel his heart thump.

305
00:24:24,642 --> 00:24:26,267
Your vitals are good.

306
00:24:27,242 --> 00:24:29,542
What? It seems like hitting my face.

307
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:33,092
No. Perhaps he's near-sighted
so he can't see me clearly.

308
00:24:34,317 --> 00:24:35,392
Bingo! He's going to come to me!

309
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:37,145
I mean, I'm attracted to him.

310
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,530
Su Jinbei.

311
00:24:39,217 --> 00:24:40,942
You recovered well from the operation.

312
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:42,417
Raise your arm.

313
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:49,075
Make a fist.

314
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:51,867
Well, business is business.
Maybe he's playing me.

315
00:24:52,217 --> 00:24:53,050
Put it down.

316
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:55,397
Forget it. Perhaps he's coming
from three generations as dumb as rocks.

317
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:56,315
???

318
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:05,067
Remember to stay in bed.

319
00:25:08,492 --> 00:25:10,292
It's you yesterday, right?

320
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:14,317
You're under general anesthesia
after operation.

321
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:15,692
Unconscious.

322
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:17,792
It's normal for you to step out of line.

323
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:19,767
I don't blame you.

324
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,442
Who the hell did that？

325
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:26,467
And my fault?

326
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,067
Wait. Wait!

327
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:35,250
Well.

328
00:25:37,742 --> 00:25:38,642
Miss Wu.

329
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:41,467
I think it wasn't Dr. Xiao that did it.

330
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:45,510
Usually, Dr. Xiao is quite naughty.

331
00:25:46,717 --> 00:25:48,442
But you said he molested patients,

332
00:25:48,742 --> 00:25:51,292
especially for that kind of people
like Miss Su.

333
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,367
I don't believe it.

334
00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:56,858
If you allege something,
you should prove it.

335
00:25:56,942 --> 00:25:57,775
Right?

336
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:03,142
This kind of mask can be bought
everywhere.

337
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:04,408
That doesn't mean anything.

338
00:26:04,492 --> 00:26:06,067
Okay, let's get surveillance video out.

339
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:09,467
It's a large hospital
you must have security cameras.

340
00:26:09,642 --> 00:26:11,392
OK. Just do it.

341
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:15,692
Yes. I'll look into the matter!

342
00:26:17,806 --> 00:26:18,756
Sorry.

343
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:21,267
You know
I have an important operation later.

344
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:23,992
Do you think it's advisable
to go back first?

345
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:28,167
After investigation,
I'll get you a satisfactory answer.

346
00:26:33,113 --> 00:26:34,064
OK.

347
00:26:34,823 --> 00:26:36,692
Tell me the result by the end of the day.

348
00:26:37,565 --> 00:26:38,517
No problem. No problem.

349
00:26:38,717 --> 00:26:40,568
Or I'll call the cops.

350
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:43,967
Watch out, man!

351
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:49,875
Director,

352
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:52,267
thank you for clearing my name.

353
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:54,042
You know me best.

354
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:55,867
I know you best?

355
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:58,267
Womanizing.

356
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,325
I know you best?

357
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:02,467
Hovering after the nurses
working on your game face.

358
00:27:02,692 --> 00:27:03,533
I know you best?

359
00:27:03,617 --> 00:27:05,867
Looking in a mirror everyday
everyday, everyday!

360
00:27:06,217 --> 00:27:07,592
Is that funny? Is that funny?

361
00:27:08,242 --> 00:27:09,867
You're pissing me off.

362
00:27:10,617 --> 00:27:12,007
Going off on people all the time.

363
00:27:17,817 --> 00:27:18,958
You're exasperating!

364
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:19,875
Go to hell!

365
00:27:23,217 --> 00:27:25,083
What?

366
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:27,358
I've just been scolded because of you.

367
00:27:27,442 --> 00:27:29,292
Do you think
what you're doing to me is right?

368
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,683
Sorry.

369
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:34,467
I thought he came back again.

370
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:35,625
He?

371
00:27:36,492 --> 00:27:37,609
Who?

372
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:40,842
The one who had my first kiss!

373
00:27:42,117 --> 00:27:43,542
He has got some nerve coming back here!

374
00:27:45,842 --> 00:27:46,675
No.

375
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:48,742
You mean...

376
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:50,192
he's just over here?

377
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:52,333
Yes. And he's rounding seriously.

378
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:53,692
He must be pretending.

379
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,167
Or he won't wear the mask.

380
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,008
A thief has guilty conscience!

381
00:27:59,092 --> 00:28:00,517
He's scared to show his face.

382
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:04,467
So, Xiao is not...

383
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:05,692
Oh, my gosh.

384
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:08,342
I hit him around the face.

385
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:33,742
Stop!

386
00:28:35,492 --> 00:28:36,967
I'm not a monster.

387
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,133
Miss Su.

388
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,492
That thing...

389
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:22,692
If you keep running away, I'll scream.

390
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:28,867
Actually I want to say...

391
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,517
I misjudged you.

392
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:35,742
Sorry, that's it. Bye.

393
00:29:35,892 --> 00:29:37,092
Alright.

394
00:29:40,442 --> 00:29:41,392
Oh wait...

395
00:29:43,517 --> 00:29:46,342
You said
you come to apologize to me?

396
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:51,233
I, Xiao Yuansong, has a reputation,
but you ruined it.

397
00:29:51,317 --> 00:29:52,917
How dare you accuse me of that!

398
00:29:53,117 --> 00:29:54,242
Now, let's talk to the director.

399
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,200
You're going to tell us
what the hell is going on. Go.

400
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:58,125
-Let me go.
-Let me tell you.

401
00:29:58,242 --> 00:30:00,692
A starlet like Su Jinbei
cannot blame it on me.

402
00:30:00,817 --> 00:30:01,983
Let alone you. Go.

403
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,142
Let me go!

404
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,867
What's wrong?

405
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:15,442
What's happened?

406
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,442
Hello, mom.

407
00:30:30,517 --> 00:30:32,958
My daughter,
finally you pick up the phone.

408
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:34,183
What's going on?

409
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,342
What's wrong with you? Why didn't you
tell me about your accident?

410
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,517
Are you seriously injured?
Where are you now?

411
00:30:38,842 --> 00:30:39,742
Tell me!

412
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:42,142
I'll go to see you right now.

413
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:46,617
Hello? What happened to your voice?

414
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:48,867
Mom, you start monologuing.

415
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:50,641
How can anybody get a word in around here?

416
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:52,917
Because I care about you.

417
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:56,505
I just know about it
from the internet.

418
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:58,967
I'm fine. Don't worry.

419
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:00,958
It's a minimally invasive procedure
I could get discharged soon.

420
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,617
You don't need to come here. Thanks.

421
00:31:03,492 --> 00:31:05,542
Don't hang up.
Let me tell you.

422
00:31:05,817 --> 00:31:09,642
Shiyun is a good surgeon.

423
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:11,642
I can ask him to see you.

424
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:14,173
Wouldn't it be easier
to move to his hospital?

425
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:17,392
Mom, who's Shiyun?

426
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:20,467
You have a short memory.

427
00:31:20,717 --> 00:31:24,467
Zhou Shiyun is your fiance.

428
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,367
Zhou Shiyun?

429
00:31:26,642 --> 00:31:28,742
It sounds awfully familiar!

430
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:37,642
Zhou Shiyun?

431
00:31:39,017 --> 00:31:40,242
Oh, it's him.

432
00:31:40,617 --> 00:31:42,667
No wonder he had
a really strange reaction.

433
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,867
I know everything.

434
00:31:45,092 --> 00:31:47,267
Beibei.
What are you talking about?

435
00:31:47,492 --> 00:31:48,325
Hello?

436
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:52,542
He keeps his identity pretty well hidden
and wears a mask.

437
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:58,242
I would love to see
the look of you!

438
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:05,492
Dr. Zhou.

439
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:09,233
Have you checked it?

440
00:32:09,317 --> 00:32:10,150
Yes.

441
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,044
How do you feel this afternoon?

442
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:26,092
Not bad.

443
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:29,842
Sit up.

444
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:41,350
Cough.

445
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:45,275
Chest.

446
00:33:15,892 --> 00:33:17,092
Shiyun.

447
00:33:17,717 --> 00:33:20,717
The mountain is splendid
because of jade in the rocks.

448
00:33:21,242 --> 00:33:25,367
The river is lovely
because of pearls in the water.

449
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:27,342
You should know this line.

450
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,217
I just checked on Baidu. I'm so clever.

451
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:38,767
Dr. Zhou.

452
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:40,917
I can't barely hear you
since you're wearing a mask.

453
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:44,492
Could you take it off?

454
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:46,650
No.

455
00:33:53,642 --> 00:33:56,742
Well, are you a clean freak?

456
00:33:57,817 --> 00:33:59,667
I have a cold.

457
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:13,767
I have a headache.
Could you check it for me?

458
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:39,067
It's just a little scrape.

459
00:34:39,817 --> 00:34:41,267
But I can't have a scar.

460
00:34:41,517 --> 00:34:42,867
I haven't got married.

461
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:45,299
It's not going
to stop you getting married.

462
00:34:52,242 --> 00:34:53,167
Dr. Zhou.

463
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:00,492
Miss Su.

464
00:35:11,117 --> 00:35:12,542
-Dr. Zhou.
-Dr. Zhou.

465
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:34,067
Have a check on the third floor
and have a CDFI on the fourth floor.

466
00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:37,342
After you get your test results,
come to the doctor.
