1
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,225
How about your grandma.

2
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:43,250
It is not clear now.

3
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:44,725
I want to go home to see.

4
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,100
You should.

5
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,600
What about aunt Fang.

6
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,640
Don't worry.

7
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:54,950
She's much more stable than before.

8
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:56,250
Just go

9
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,650
I'll be back soon.

10
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:01,515
Director, goodbye.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,391
Although the director
approved me to leave,

12
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:16,875
I'm still a little worried.

13
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:18,216
You must

14
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,350
keep an eye for me.

15
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:21,315
Of course

16
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,475
I got your back, don't worry.

17
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,025
This is the case data of aunt Fang.

18
00:02:27,475 --> 00:02:28,450
Buddy, thanks.

19
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,250
You have to work when
you just got married.

20
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,925
Don't say that with me.

21
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:35,500
I just want to ask.

22
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,950
Su Jinbei and you.

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,125
When will you get married.

24
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:42,925
It's depends on her.

25
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,525
Grandma must be happy.

26
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,416
In my understanding of her.

27
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,750
She will be happier if
she has a grandchild.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,840
Uncle Zhou.

29
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,316
Shiyun, Miss Su.

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,216
Uncle Zhou.

31
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,350
How's it going?

32
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:12,866
Zhengxian has taken her

33
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,975
to the hospital.

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,866
Where's she.

35
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,790
This way.

36
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,450
Shiyun and Miss Su are back.

37
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,791
Grandma, we're back.

38
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,591
Grandma.

39
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,500
It's not a big deal.

40
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:33,466
Why are you back in such a hurry?

41
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,650
What medicine is it?

42
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,616
She has taken a lot of
Western Medicine recently

43
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,540
and it hurt her stomach.

44
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,442
A Chinese medicine doctor prescribes a
recipe for regulating the spleen and stomach.

45
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:42,650
I heard from Uncle Zhou.

46
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,191
How are you feeling now?

47
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:45,425
Much better.

48
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,250
I'm old. There will be diseases.

49
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,450
You are not old at all.

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,675
Right, Shiyun.

51
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,350
You are right.

52
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,640
Grandma.

53
00:03:58,025 --> 00:03:59,175
See.

54
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,275
This, this is,

55
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,750
Shiyun proposed to me.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's my duty.

57
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:12,125
He should have done that a long time ago.

58
00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:25,066
So much food.

59
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,350
She usually eat little.

60
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,575
You came back with Shiyun today.

61
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,141
So I made more food.

62
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:33,625
Yes, It's for you.

63
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,100
Have more.

64
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,675
She's controlling her weight.

65
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:40,750
She won't eat as much as you.

66
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,350
Jinbei.

67
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,925
You are already so thin, why
do you have to lose weight?

68
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,141
I...

69
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:47,065
See.

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
You are already thin
enough, don't lose weight.

71
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,416
No, grandma

72
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,666
I took part in an audition

73
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,775
for a movie.

74
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,791
That character was thin.

75
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,550
If I'm not thin, they wouldn't pick me.

76
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,616
After four or five hours,

77
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,341
I looked down through the window,

78
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:09,150
Shiyun didn't leave.

79
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,850
He waited for me all the time.

80
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,875
Then I hurried downstairs.

81
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:20,016
And he proposed to me

82
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,600
I didn't expect that my
grandson would be smart once.

83
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:28,016
Shiyun.

84
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,241
Wutong choked on a fish bone.

85
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:30,175
Do you want to see?

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,440
OK

87
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,391
I'll go as well.

88
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:33,325
Don't go.

89
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:34,925
You just have dinner with grandma.

90
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,675
Don't worry, Shiyun is here.

91
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:41,865
OK

92
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:49,515
Jinbei.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What's wrong?

94
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,175
It's ok, grandma

95
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:55,716
I ate too much.

96
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,300
Shiyun kept picking food for me

97
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,141
I'll just drink some tea.

98
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,300
Jinbei.

99
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:03,250
Are you pregnant?

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,025
No, grandma, no.

101
00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:11,475
Don't lie to me.

102
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:13,325
Shiyun and you.

103
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,640
I...

104
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,825
We...

105
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:19,025
There's nobody else here.

106
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:20,500
Tell me.

107
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,725
How long haven't you had your period.

108
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,225
Maybe one month.

109
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:31,175
One month!

110
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:35,341
It didn't come

111
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:37,059
when I took the audition
of Future Female Warrior.

112
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:39,725
It should be over a month.

113
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,850
According to my experience.

114
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:43,850
You are pregnant.

115
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,375
Grandma.

116
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,400
Oh, my gosh.

117
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,800
It can't be true.

118
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:54,950
Do you think it's amazing.

119
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,450
Grandma lived through it

120
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,400
I know you.

121
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,050
But I'm not prepared.

122
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:06,075
Keep the secret for me, grandma.

123
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,525
I want to give Shiyun a surprise

124
00:07:09,675 --> 00:07:10,525
I know.

125
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,225
But the marriage should be settled.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,075
How's Wutong.

127
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,650
It's fine now.

128
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,216
What are you chatting just now?

129
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,140
Why are you so happy?

130
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:28,400
Nothing.

131
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,940
Come on.

132
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,866
Boiled Fish with Sichuan Pickles, tasty.

133
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,075
Thanks, grandma.

134
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,250
Dizziness, fatigue, like sour food.

135
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,850
Prophase vomiting.

136
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:01,100
It all fits

137
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:02,975
and I seemed to gain weight.

138
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,400
Come in.

139
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:15,250
Honey.

140
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:18,325
Grandma asked aunt Song
to cook you bird's nest porridge.

141
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,825
Honey.

142
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,325
Feed me.

143
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,591
Are you hiding something from me.

144
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:35,075
Do you feed or not?

145
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,450
Actually,

146
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,050
I don't want it.

147
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,300
It's...

148
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,440
him

149
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:51,316
him

150
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,625
him.

151
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,540
What?

152
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,340
You.

153
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,500
I... I...

154
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,590
What?

155
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,440
What?

156
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,991
When did you know?

157
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,675
Just now.

158
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,265
You...

159
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,250
This is the gift of the gods.

160
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,150
Honey.

161
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
Honey.

162
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,975
The bird's nest is cold.

163
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:52,225
Open your mouth.

164
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:05,525
It's hot.

165
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,675
Isn't it the way to your house.

166
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,625
Live at mine first.

167
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,275
I can take care of you.

168
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,250
Honey.

169
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,425
Are you inviting me to live with you

170
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,675
I said.

171
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:30,900
I can take care of you.

172
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,550
I believe it.

173
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:49,200
What do you want for dinner?

174
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,225
I don't have appetite.

175
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,850
Eat something.

176
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:56,650
Or go out to eat.

177
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,450
I'll tidy it up.

178
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,190
You...

179
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,125
You still live in that room?

180
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,941
I have a baby now.

181
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:19,675
It's not good to sleep with you.

182
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,940
What do you think?

183
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,540
Are you tired.

184
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,266
I rarely go shopping.

185
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,650
How can I be tired so easily.

186
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,400
You don't have to run.

187
00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:52,625
Go have a look.

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,100
No.

189
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:55,900
You can't wear high heels.

190
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,725
I just look at them, I don't wear.

191
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,425
The latest one.

192
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:05,566
Honey, please let me see

193
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,275
I really won't wear.

194
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,450
Please.

195
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:17,716
Miss Su, this is the
season's limited edition.

196
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,250
We only have three pairs

197
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:20,800
and two of them are sold.

198
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,916
What size is the last pair

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,475
37

200
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:26,025
It's my size.

201
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:28,875
Honey.

202
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,075
Did you hear.

203
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,475
There's only one pair left.

204
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
What did you promise me.

205
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,375
I mean

206
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:42,625
we can buy them,

207
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,225
but I won't wear them.

208
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,466
I really like this.

209
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,390
Pack it for me.

210
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,450
Thanks.

211
00:12:51,675 --> 00:12:52,515
You are welcome.

212
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,325
I know you love me.

213
00:12:57,825 --> 00:12:59,391
Just keep your words

214
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:01,025
I will.

215
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,340
Miss Di.

216
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:07,915
Miss Di.

217
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,725
These are the plays that want you,

218
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,050
please have a look.

219
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:20,900
So many.

220
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:25,725
Give me when you finished picking.

221
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,791
These are the filtered ones

222
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,466
and this.

223
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,975
The Misty Rain Two

224
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,200
is preparing.

225
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,016
They still want you
as the leading actress.

226
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,940
Think about it.

227
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,950
What's wrong with you?

228
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,850
Well.

229
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,450
Dear Di.

230
00:13:50,475 --> 00:13:52,075
What did you do?

231
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,500
I can't act for the future year.

232
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:00,800
Why?

233
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:07,450
I'm pregnant.

234
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:10,350
Don't get too excited

235
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,875
I can explain this.

236
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,225
Well.

237
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,941
It's unexpected.

238
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:19,816
Su Jinbei.

239
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,740
Yes.

240
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,740
How long?

241
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:24,065
What how long?

242
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:25,342
How long have you been pregnant.

243
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:26,750
Have you checked.

244
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,440
No.

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,200
You didn't check it.

246
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,300
You figured it out yourself?

247
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,640
No.

248
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,925
How did you know, then?

249
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:38,315
Guess.

250
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,850
Su Jinbei.

251
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,900
You should be serious.

252
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,450
Go have a check.

253
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,375
I see.

254
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:49,950
Don't be mad.

255
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,940
Don't be mad.

256
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:07,065
What's wrong with you?

257
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,450
Honey

258
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,750
I think I should have a
check as soon as possible.

259
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,575
OK, I'll arrange it.

260
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,590
What do you think?

261
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:41,850
I'm waiting for the result.

262
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,940
What's wrong with you?

263
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,125
It's nothing

264
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:09,275
I've been soaked in this surprise lately

265
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,650
and now when I calm down

266
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,175
to think about the future.

267
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,850
Honey.

268
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,125
If I'm really pregnant,

269
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,950
what's your plan.

270
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:27,466
Well.

271
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,900
Miss Su, Dr. Zhou.

272
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:30,325
Here's the Medical Examination Results.

273
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,416
What's it?

274
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,400
Miss Su's urine test is negative.

275
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,400
Color ultrasound and blood
test showed no pregnancy.

276
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,125
Are you sure I'm not pregnant.

277
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,340
Yes.

278
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,216
No menstruation is related to high stress

279
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,200
and low nutrition.

280
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,225
Nausea should be due to a long-term diet

281
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,791
and you suddenly ate

282
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,375
too much food.

283
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:04,250
You are young, you will have a child.

284
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,125
It's OK, we're not in a hurry.

285
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,316
Thank you.

286
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,240
Welcome.

287
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,125
I said

288
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,275
if I'm really pregnant,

289
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,816
what's your plan.

290
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,300
Let's move our business forward.

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,075
Our business.

292
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:33,425
What business.

293
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,465
We can get married.

294
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,050
I don't plan to get married so early.

295
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,790
OK

296
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,250
We can wait.

297
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,240
I'll be waiting.

298
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,540
OK

299
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,990
Jiawei.

300
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,525
The thing I talked to you before.

301
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,650
What do you think?

302
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,600
Sorry, Mr. Wang

303
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,775
I want to rest lately

304
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,525
I didn't pay much attention to work.

305
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,390
It's ok.

306
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:18,600
You should relax once in a while.

307
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,125
After all, there was such a big fuss,

308
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:24,950
but I admire you.

309
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:26,941
Although you and Su Jinbei

310
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:28,125
had a gossip.

311
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:29,950
But it's over.

312
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,465
Jiawei.

313
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,925
You should know that

314
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,866
the environment of the company

315
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,425
is crucial to the
development of an artist.

316
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,416
If you can join our company,

317
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,916
we can both

318
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,500
have a better development.

319
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,975
Think about it

320
00:18:44,475 --> 00:18:45,315
I'll be waiting.

321
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,416
Ok. I'll think about it.

322
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,116
Bye.

323
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,040
Bye.

324
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:02,525
Zitong.

325
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,925
I came to say goodbye.

326
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,525
I plan to further my study abroad.

327
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:09,725
On the road of being an artist,

328
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,475
I have a lot to learn.

329
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,000
When?

330
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,590
Next week.

331
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:23,225
Come and have a sit.

332
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:25,315
No, thanks.

333
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:32,300
We both had a one-side love,

334
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:34,825
but now I realize

335
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,650
the real love

336
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,900
is making two people happy.

337
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,950
Hope you can cherish

338
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,800
the girl that can make you happy.

339
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,940
Zitong.

340
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,650
Take care of yourself.

341
00:20:04,225 --> 00:20:05,850
OK, I got it.

342
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,750
I was almost frighten to death by you!

343
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,116
Although I've already made

344
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,391
an emergency plan of your pregnancy,

345
00:20:13,475 --> 00:20:15,900
but I don't want to use it.

346
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,650
You don't be too sad.

347
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,450
You have plenty chances.

348
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,925
Bye.

349
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,040
What.

350
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:26,425
Checked, Negative.

351
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,725
Zhou should be disappointed.

352
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,440
Why?

353
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:33,716
I think.

354
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,550
Zhou wants to get married.

355
00:20:36,075 --> 00:20:38,216
But Beibei has to act more

356
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,075
Hollywood films before she retires.

357
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,850
That's true.

358
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,875
We can't let them be
ahead of us all the time.

359
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,275
What do you mean?

360
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:50,650
You know.

361
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:51,975
Zhou

362
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,125
is always ahead of me on anything.

363
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:57,325
About having a child,

364
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:00,375
we can't let them be ahead of us.

365
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,191
Let me down.

366
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:03,850
You bastard.

367
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:39,375
Our business.

368
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,925
What business.

369
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:42,865
We can get married.

370
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,275
I don't plan to get married so early.

371
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,050
Hello, Mr. Wang!

372
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,450
This is Jiawei.

373
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:02,275
Sorry.

374
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,750
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

375
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,066
Zhou.

376
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:22,990
Zhou

377
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,391
I heard that your paper was published

378
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:25,642
in the International Journal again.

379
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,316
Why don't you tell me?

380
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,650
I just knew it.

381
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,350
My god.

382
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,975
This is the top medical
journal in the world.

383
00:23:37,275 --> 00:23:38,366
I dare not imagine

384
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,125
I can publish my paper there.

385
00:23:41,725 --> 00:23:43,750
Zhou, you are a talent.

386
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,050
No, he is a genius.

387
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,200
Stop this, go for the ward check.

388
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,100
Such a good news.

389
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:53,825
Should we celebrate it?

390
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,040
I'll treat tonight.

391
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,350
Don't you have a night shift.

392
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,875
It's so weird.

393
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,875
Why did Jiawei asked me to go here.

394
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,450
Hello, where's your balloon.

395
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,675
You look familiar.

396
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:48,715
Here you are.

397
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,040
All?

398
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,141
So sweet.

399
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:53,250
Jiawei.

400
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh, my gosh.

401
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,525
So many balloons

402
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,750
I can travel to the world with them.

403
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:02,550
So romantic.

404
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:03,865
Is that

405
00:25:04,075 --> 00:25:05,016
the superstar.

406
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,250
The girl is so cute.

407
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,340
Go.

408
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,625
I have something else for you.

409
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,550
Buy me first before you
go traveling the world.

410
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,175
Are you signing yourself for me for free.

411
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,425
You've done so much for me

412
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,391
I have nothing

413
00:25:25,475 --> 00:25:26,825
to repay you

414
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,225
I have no choice but do like this.

415
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,640
Can you accept it.

416
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,050
But the term of this
contract is fifty years.

417
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,850
I can retire then.

418
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,450
Sign it if you've made
up your mind, Miss Zhou.

419
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:47,550
I can't sign it.

420
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:48,990
Why?

421
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,341
I feel I'm in a dream.

422
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,900
If I sign it,

423
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,275
I'll be awaken.

424
00:25:58,425 --> 00:26:00,275
Do you still feel like a dream.

425
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:39,850
Alright.

426
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,816
Well.

427
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,350
You and your Dr. Zhou.

428
00:26:44,475 --> 00:26:46,800
You are indeed harvesting
both in love and work.

429
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,666
Xiao

430
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,125
heard that Zhou's paper got published.

431
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,775
He was so excited.

432
00:26:52,225 --> 00:26:53,065
What does that mean?

433
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,600
It means I'm born to help my husband.

434
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,250
Look at you.

435
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,866
You mean any award of Dr. Zhou

436
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,216
is your credit.

437
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,325
Of course.

438
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,925
You can go traveling if you have time now.

439
00:27:06,075 --> 00:27:07,666
When the shooting
starts, you should be busy.

440
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,650
You judged me.

441
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:11,325
Why didn't you two spend a honeymoon.

442
00:27:12,675 --> 00:27:14,325
We can consider this.

443
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:17,666
It's time.

444
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,066
Let's go find them at the hospital.

445
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,941
Go.

446
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:21,141
Where are we going tonight.

447
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:23,991
A hot pot restaurant near the hospital.

448
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:24,541
Hot pot.

449
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:25,465
Go.

450
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,016
Have you read the doctor's orders clearly?

451
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,940
Yes.

452
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,575
Ask me if you have any questions.

453
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,716
You have to sign here.

454
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,466
OK

455
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,800
Confirm with the relatives.

456
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:50,125
Not here.

457
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,400
Hello, where's Dr. Zhou.

458
00:28:41,675 --> 00:28:43,650
Who said that doctors are
numb about life and death.

459
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,000
Don't be sad.

460
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:04,050
Death come to all men.

461
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:11,525
Although we've seen
so many lives and deaths,

462
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,850
no one can accept it

463
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,000
when the most closed one is gone.

464
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:24,865
Sorry.

465
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,125
It's not your fault.

466
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,525
Why is our time together

467
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:43,900
so short.

468
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,925
I'm busy till late night every day.

469
00:29:47,825 --> 00:29:49,975
I don't have time for you,

470
00:29:50,675 --> 00:29:54,325
but you didn't blame me

471
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,275
and even comforted me.

472
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,300
We have much time together in the future.

473
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:06,065
But...

474
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,075
Time flies!

475
00:30:19,075 --> 00:30:23,800
I regret that I didn't meet you early

476
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,325
and didn't have more time with you.

477
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:35,050
I'm so regretful.

478
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:42,725
This is from Aunt Fang for you.

479
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:44,775
For me.

480
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,500
She and the director were too busy

481
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:49,900
to have a wedding.

482
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,575
She asked us not to be like them.

483
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,775
I regret.

484
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,140
What?

485
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,375
I should go see you when you're born.

486
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,675
I've wasted more than twenty years.

487
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,575
It's not late now.

488
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,525
We still met.

489
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,275
Let's get married.

490
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,700
I don't want to waste time any more.

491
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,440
OK

492
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,050
We'll go now.

493
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:11,150
You mean...

494
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:19,515
OK

495
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:23,465
Go.

496
00:33:05,475 --> 00:33:06,441
Su Jinbei.

497
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:07,666
You have the guts to
take advantage of others.

498
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,866
But you don't dare to show your true face?

499
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,525
You know who I am.

500
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,900
But you're not good for
me when I was attacked.

501
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,350
You threatened to break
off our engagement.

502
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:18,315
Dr. Zhou.

503
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,700
Your attitude towards the engagement.

504
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,025
I think I understand quite well.

505
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,115
Don't go.

506
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:52,325
Since your legs are not so good.

507
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,475
Don't move.

508
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:57,991
I...

509
00:33:58,075 --> 00:33:59,925
Are you here because
you're worried about me?

510
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,941
Look at the shooting star!

511
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:23,200
Quick, quick, make a wish.

512
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,850
Wait a minute.

513
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:05,000
As you might guess,

514
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:08,325
we are close.

515
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,350
He is the one I love.

516
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,325
Why did you do this?

517
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:30,975
Am I this bad in your eyes.

518
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,800
It stirred up the wave.

519
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,125
Dr. Zhou

520
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,125
is handsome.

521
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,275
He fits our Beibei.

522
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:01,675
Is he as handsome as me.

523
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:03,915
You.

524
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,600
Just so-so.

525
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,650
Just so-so.

526
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,250
Zhou Shiyun looks so thin and weak.

527
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:12,500
Unlike me.

528
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,125
High and mighty.

529
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:16,650
I can give you a sense of security.

530
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:18,650
Sense of security?

531
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:20,816
Who didn't dare to ride

532
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,325
the roller coaster and the pirate ship.

533
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,616
Who could only stay on the merry-go-round.

534
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,225
It's not like that.

535
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,675
I was protecting you.

536
00:36:30,025 --> 00:36:30,865
Sit steadily.

537
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,690
Honey.

538
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:33,275
From now on,

539
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:36,125
we are really together.

540
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,100
We've been together a
long time ago in my heart.

541
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,950
When we were waiting in the line.

542
00:37:43,075 --> 00:37:44,425
Someone recognized me.

543
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,966
Everyone was surrounding us.

544
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,350
The scene was a mess

545
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:48,875
I really worried

546
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:50,816
that we couldn't get
our marriage certificate,

547
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,200
but it turned out fine.

548
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,350
Yes

549
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,066
but we were in such a hurry

550
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,216
and forgot

551
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,350
an important process.

552
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,950
You mean...

553
00:38:11,825 --> 00:38:12,675
Zhou Shiyun.

554
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:14,475
From now on.

555
00:38:15,275 --> 00:38:17,525
Whether rich or poor

556
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,875
in sickness and in health,

557
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,816
will you take

558
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,734
this woman to live together
in the estate of matrimony?

559
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:25,865
Will you love her

560
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,990
honor her

561
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:28,125
confirm her

562
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,050
and keep her in sickness and in health,

563
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,750
and forsaking all others, be true to
her as long as you both shall live?

564
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,390
I will.

565
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,050
Ask me.

566
00:38:39,675 --> 00:38:40,515
Wait a minute.

567
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,075
Close your eyes.

568
00:38:42,275 --> 00:38:43,925
Open then after the questions.

569
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,790
Quick.

570
00:38:50,025 --> 00:38:50,865
Su Jinbei.

571
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,550
From now on.

572
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,750
Whether rich or poor

573
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,325
in sickness and in health,

574
00:38:56,475 --> 00:38:57,666
will you take

575
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,517
this man to live together
in the estate of matrimony?

576
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:00,475
Will you love him,

577
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,740
honor him,

578
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:02,865
confirm her

579
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,775
and keep him

580
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,550
and forsaking all others, be true to
her as long as you both shall live?

581
00:39:15,275 --> 00:39:16,300
I will.

582
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,141
I just wrote a Weibo.

583
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:08,900
They are all saying that you're handsome.

584
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,550
What else did they say?

585
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,200
Blessings of course.

586
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:17,525
Congratulations, Mr. Zhou.

587
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,600
Congratulations, Mrs. Zhou.

588
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,925
Newly married happiness!

589
00:40:27,075 --> 00:40:28,150
Newly married happiness!

590
00:40:31,425 --> 00:40:33,225
Are you congratulating us too?
