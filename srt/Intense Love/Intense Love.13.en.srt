=Episode 13=

3
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,029
That gentleman is my new driver.

4
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,062
I forgot to tell him I have a live today.

5
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:56,125
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

6
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,678
Alright, let's go on.

7
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,764
It's hard for an ordinary person
to date a star.

8
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:04,480
What you'll go through
is far more than what you imagine.

9
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:24,277
Mom.

10
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,128
Oh my gosh.

11
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:28,529
How could you live
together with other guys?

12
00:02:29,302 --> 00:02:30,506
What?

13
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:31,579
That's Zhou Shiyun.

14
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:36,171
Listen.

15
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,704
Don't juggle with words.

16
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,000
It's not okay even it's Shiyun.

17
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:43,009
However.

18
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:44,866
Tell me honestly.

19
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:48,762
How's the relationship of you two now?

20
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,374
You should inform mom...

21
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
for such a breaking news.

22
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:57,347
You shouldn't let the internet tell me.

23
00:02:57,561 --> 00:03:00,240
We are just temporary roommates.

24
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,463
We have separate bedrooms.

25
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:03,344
Don't think too much.

26
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,768
I won't.

27
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,383
But...

28
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:11,722
your dad doesn't think so.

29
00:03:15,477 --> 00:03:16,317
Dad knows it?

30
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:18,217
I know it.

31
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:19,520
Of course dad does.

32
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:22,320
What did he say?

33
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:25,354
He's very angry now.

34
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:30,347
He asked you two to come home right now
and explain it to him.

35
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:32,473
Go home?

36
00:03:33,753 --> 00:03:34,617
We two?

37
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:36,360
Yeah.

38
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,842
You and Shiyun.

39
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:39,757
Come home right now and explain…

40
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:40,800
No.

41
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:47,045
Mom, I have a cold.

42
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:48,222
Fever.

43
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,965
My temperature is over 39 degree Celsius.

44
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:51,151
Alright, alright.

45
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:52,960
Don't deceive me.

46
00:03:53,663 --> 00:03:56,880
Stop showing yourself off
with your poor acting skills.

47
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:59,078
What are you thinking about?
Listen.

48
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:03,588
To be frank.

49
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:06,909
You dad is so angry now.

50
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:09,124
The consequence is severe.

51
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:10,713
You...

52
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:14,850
You and Zhou Shiyun must
come home right now to beg forgiveness.

53
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,786
Got it?

54
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:21,686
Go home?

55
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:23,440
Go home?

56
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,354
He will go home with me?

57
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:28,907
Is it too early?

58
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:30,040
Our relationship.

59
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:31,840
Will he say yes?

60
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:34,120
Why not?

61
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:35,187
I've already visited his family.

62
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:36,657
It should be normal for him to visit mine.

63
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,193
You offered to do not.

64
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:40,520
It's not asked by him.

65
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:42,379
Of course he asked.

66
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,260
I...

67
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:44,788
I...

68
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:48,236
Sister.

69
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,784
Where's my brother?
Not home yet?

70
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:52,682
Not yet.

71
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:54,840
Where did you go?

72
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:55,881
You left early in the morning.

73
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:57,480
Nothing.

74
00:04:57,521 --> 00:05:00,281
It's just a gathering
of Jiawei's fans club.

75
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:01,161
We had lunch together.

76
00:05:13,197 --> 00:05:14,037
Jinbei.

77
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:14,918
Please don't go.

78
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:18,600
I know you can't
believe my feelings for you.

79
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:20,695
But can you give me some time.

80
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:22,239
Let me prove myself.

81
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:24,387
I'm afraid not.

82
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:27,520
But why?

83
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:30,980
I have a fiance.

84
00:05:38,676 --> 00:05:39,516
Come in.

85
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:43,619
-Jiawei.
-Bro Shui.

86
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,649
Here are some resumes
for the post of your assistant.

87
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:47,845
Thank you.

88
00:05:54,236 --> 00:05:55,094
Take a look.

89
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:56,733
If there's no problem,
I'll arrange the interview.

90
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:58,329
Alright.

91
00:05:58,467 --> 00:05:59,640
-Okay.
-Hey, bro.

92
00:06:00,506 --> 00:06:01,587
There's another candidate.

93
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:03,080
I recommend her to you.

94
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:04,034
Please also invite her to the interview.

95
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:05,560
Okay.
Send it to me.

96
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,960
So handsome.

97
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:22,613
Hello.

98
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:23,925
It's me.

99
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:27,320
Jiawei's assistant.

100
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:28,626
Really?

101
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:30,404
2:00 tomorrow afternoon.

102
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:31,600
Okay, I get it.

103
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,525
Thank you, thank you.

104
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:37,279
I love you, sis.

105
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,160
Why?

106
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:40,323
They invite me to
the interview for Jiawei's assistant.

107
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:41,920
It's you, right?

108
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:44,560
He keeps the promise.

109
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,647
But Yingying.

110
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:46,528
I...

111
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:49,823
Never mind, that's quite another matter.

112
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:51,000
It's up to you.

113
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:54,160
What do you mean?

114
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,092
It's just an interview.

115
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:59,439
I can't promise that you can get the job.

116
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,632
An interview is enough.

117
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,160
I love you, sis.

118
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:09,280
Don't look at me like this.

119
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,960
I'm blushing.

120
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,130
I have magic eyes.

121
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:17,755
Now you are happy.

122
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,280
But I'm not.

123
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:21,427
Why?

124
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:25,482
Did my brother tease you?

125
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:27,650
I'm on your side.

126
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:30,040
I'll fix him for you when he comes back.

127
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:31,994
No.

128
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:35,000
My parents asked me to bring him home.

129
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:37,960
Is it possible he rejects me?

130
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:39,688
That is possible.

131
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:41,525
He's so aloof.

132
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:42,585
What should I do?

133
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:45,640
Although he is cold,

134
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,600
he's actually warm inside.

135
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:48,800
You can beg him.

136
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:52,446
Or show your miseries.

137
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:53,532
That may work.

138
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:54,899
Show my miseries.

139
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:02,438
It's time to use my acting skills.

140
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:04,794
You can do it.

141
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:13,880
Quickly.

142
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:27,246
Jinbei, what happened?

143
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,040
Nothing.

144
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:37,960
My mom told me she's not feeling well.

145
00:08:39,762 --> 00:08:43,237
She could eat nor sleep.

146
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,440
Has she been to the hospital?

147
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:47,880
She can come to
Chongguang to have a check-up.

148
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:49,478
No, thanks.

149
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:52,640
It's not physical problem.

150
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:54,920
She just missed me too much.

151
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:57,480
Then you should go visit your parents.

152
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:03,036
That's what I said.

153
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:04,795
But she said...

154
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,240
although she wants to see me,

155
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:09,262
she'd rather...

156
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:15,920
have the two of us go back together.

157
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,089
This cooling ointment is so irritating.

158
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:25,227
Honey.

159
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:29,946
I know you are too busy to go with me.

160
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,136
So maybe.

161
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:37,400
I just tell them we'll visit later.

162
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:40,440
But my mom's not feeling good.

163
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:42,326
I don't know when she will…

164
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:43,240
It's fine.

165
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,080
I can go with you.

166
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:47,835
Really?

167
00:09:51,797 --> 00:09:52,837
Honey.

168
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,400
I'm surprised that you agree so quickly.

169
00:09:59,317 --> 00:10:00,242
Thank you.

170
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:02,342
I love you.

171
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:40,237
From now on,

172
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll make over you thoroughly.

173
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,669
I'm already perfect.

174
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:48,800
It'll be hopeless if I don't do it now.

175
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:13,845
It's good on me.

176
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:16,717
You have a good taste, Didi.

177
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,975
Of course.

178
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:26,326
It's all done.

179
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,880
We can visit my parents tomorrow.

180
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:29,600
Besides wine,

181
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:30,880
what other hobbies does you dad have?

182
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:33,800
Other hobbies?

183
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,360
He likes playing Chinese chess.

184
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,500
Okay, I got it.

185
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:44,556
Let's go.

186
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:47,159
Xiao Yuansong.

187
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:48,744
Now that you live here,

188
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:51,040
it's necessary that we set rules.

189
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,760
To hang your clothes in the wardrobe,

190
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:55,040
you have to classify them at first.

191
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:57,760
Keep in mind don't
put coats and pajamas together.

192
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,943
I need my apartment to
keep clean and tidy all the time.

193
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:09,184
So after using something,

194
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:10,585
put it back to the original position,

195
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:12,031
particularly in the bathroom.

196
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,234
You can watch short videos to relax.

197
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,858
But don't make it too loud,

198
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,840
especially when I'm working.

199
00:12:58,091 --> 00:12:58,931
Didi.

200
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,480
Can I sleep on your bed for one night.

201
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:05,399
We've agreed that you sleep on the couch.

202
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,280
No.

203
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:08,081
Just for one time.

204
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:09,440
I'm not a robot.

205
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:12,680
Sleeping on the couch is
bad to my muscle and neck.

206
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:14,241
Robot won't hurt its neck.

207
00:13:14,282 --> 00:13:15,240
Rhetoric.

208
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:38,463
Xiao Yuansong.

209
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:40,880
You used the toilet too often last night.

210
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,600
Go back to your couch tomorrow.

211
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,360
Sister, which one is better?

212
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:59,120
What you are wearing is more professional.

213
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:00,960
The other one is cute.

214
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:05,680
Which one do you think Jiawei likes?

215
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:06,892
Where are you going?

216
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:14,434
I forgot to tell you.

217
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:15,827
Suying has an interview today.

218
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:16,828
I recommend her.

219
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:19,763
Is it about that Xu Jiawei?

220
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:21,581
His assistant.

221
00:14:21,622 --> 00:14:22,462
No.

222
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,186
Brother.

223
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:28,520
Our eldest brother won't let you
work in the show-biz.

224
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:30,641
That's prejudice.

225
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:31,801
What's wrong with the show-biz?

226
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:34,689
My sister also works in the show-biz.

227
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,879
She's excellent.

228
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,607
You call her sister now.

229
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,480
Have you forgot what
you said about her before?

230
00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:41,911
I...

231
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:43,204
That was not right.

232
00:14:43,245 --> 00:14:44,521
I already knew I was wrong.

233
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:46,429
It's my fault to tease her before.

234
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,760
It's also wrong to take pictures secretly
or put dead mice at her gate.

235
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,914
It was you!

236
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,921
-You naughty girl.
-Brother, help me.

237
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,836
Zhou Suying, stop!

238
00:15:02,877 --> 00:15:03,717
Stop!

239
00:15:07,227 --> 00:15:08,360
You always help her.

240
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:16,826
You are aware of it.

241
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,520
Honey, you are so sharp-sighted
I can't hide anything from you.

242
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,040
What's this?

243
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:25,998
Chinese chess.

244
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:27,921
I saw it before in an old store.

245
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:29,529
The pieces are made
from precious old materials.

246
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,560
Present for my dad?

247
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,164
My dad will definitely like it.

248
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:41,203
It's hard to see...

249
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:43,960
you are pretty thoughtful.

250
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:48,709
It's getting late.

251
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,831
Let's go.

252
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:18,440
Xiao.

253
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:21,080
Are you sick?

254
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,960
Almost there?

255
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:48,841
Yes.

256
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,832
Who's that?

257
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:50,850
Nothing.

258
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:05,600
How's the result, Prof. Ma?

259
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:06,481
Dr. Xiao.

260
00:17:06,522 --> 00:17:08,040
Do you get up frequently at night?

261
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:11,011
Yes.

262
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:11,920
Having dizziness and headache?

263
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,390
Yes.

264
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:16,780
And sometimes illusions?

265
00:17:19,795 --> 00:17:21,651
A little bit I guess.

266
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:26,125
Tell you the truth.

267
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:27,920
It's probably late stage of uremia.

268
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:30,327
What?

269
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:32,527
Uremia?

270
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:35,240
But there may be deviation.

271
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:38,235
My suggestion is to check up again
and see the result.

272
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:41,560
Don't think too much.

273
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:42,441
Have a good rest.

274
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:25,640
Tell you the truth.

275
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,720
It's probably late stage of uremia.

276
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:31,000
Late stage of uremia.

277
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:35,160
Am I dying?

278
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,052
Who can take care of Didi?

279
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:57,200
Really good.

280
00:18:58,324 --> 00:18:59,524
Su.

281
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:00,560
Listen.

282
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,120
The stewed pork I cooked...

283
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:05,608
tastes even better than
that of Junhao Restaurant.

284
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:12,880
So what?

285
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,280
What's wrong with you?

286
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:18,160
Look at your poker face.

287
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:19,760
Alright.

288
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:21,534
Come on.

289
00:19:21,947 --> 00:19:22,787
Smile.

290
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:23,745
Smile.

291
00:19:23,986 --> 00:19:25,109
Cheer up.

292
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,613
I'm not in the mood to laugh.

293
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:29,780
It's not a big deal.

294
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:32,797
Just live in one apartment?

295
00:19:36,027 --> 00:19:40,600
We also lived in one house
before we got married.

296
00:19:41,854 --> 00:19:42,800
That's different.

297
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,080
I came here for studying
but have no place to stay.

298
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:47,640
It's just lodging.

299
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:49,718
And I only slept on the couch.

300
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:53,833
It's the same for Beibei.

301
00:19:54,488 --> 00:19:55,720
She said,

302
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:59,000
her place is not safe.

303
00:19:59,347 --> 00:20:02,080
She just lodges with
Shiyun for a few days.

304
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,120
They have separate rooms.

305
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:09,772
Shiyun looks like an upright guy.

306
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:11,720
I think he's reliable.

307
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:14,987
Reliable?

308
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:18,467
He didn't show up at the engagement.

309
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:21,171
Missing that important event.

310
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:22,200
I don't think he's reliable.

311
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,800
You are unreasonable.

312
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:27,440
I've told you.

313
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:29,040
He's a doctor.

314
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,520
He's a doctor.

315
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:32,800
He has to save other people's lives.

316
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:35,640
Unreasonable.

317
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:37,025
You...

318
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:40,240
Beibei's arrived.

319
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,480
Hurry up.

320
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:43,632
Go! Go! Go!

321
00:20:44,629 --> 00:20:45,649
That's enough.

322
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:47,069
Change your expression.

323
00:20:47,224 --> 00:20:48,084
Be nice.

324
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,800
Hurry up.

325
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:50,760
Hurry up.

326
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:52,409
Hold on.

327
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,635
Fine.

328
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:55,276
Coming.

329
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,595
-Welcome.
-Mom, dad.

330
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:02,191
Shiyun.
This is dad, this is mom.

331
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:03,880
Uncle and aunt, nice to meet you.

332
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:05,601
Long time no see.

333
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:06,586
Come in.

334
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:08,360
You are even more handsome.

335
00:21:09,307 --> 00:21:10,531
After so many years.

336
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:12,840
I can't barely recognize you.

337
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:17,387
Do you miss me, dad?

338
00:21:17,691 --> 00:21:18,800
I thought you will not come back anymore.

339
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:20,760
I'm busy recently.

340
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:22,328
Don't be mad.

341
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,580
When you were a little boy,

342
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:26,701
your mom showed me a lot of your photos.

343
00:21:26,742 --> 00:21:28,026
You were so adorable.

344
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:29,360
So chubby.

345
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:30,347
Have a seat.

346
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:31,942
Mom.

347
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:33,320
Shiyun bought these for you.

348
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:36,400
Skin care products like
hand cream and masks.

349
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:37,882
-All yours.
-Take a seat.

350
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:41,480
You are so nice of
bringing so many gifts.

351
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:43,045
Shiyun.

352
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:45,390
Take out the liquor you bought for dad.

353
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,742
Dad, I remember you like drinking liquor.

354
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:50,400
This is good one.

355
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,240
-It's very expensive.
-That's right.

356
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:54,074
Wine is not good for health.

357
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:56,360
Don't drink too much.

358
00:21:57,977 --> 00:21:59,244
Shiyun.

359
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,880
Where's the special gift for dad?

360
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:03,483
Special gift?

361
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:05,668
Uncle, Jinbei told me
you like Chinese chess.

362
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:07,685
I bought it from an old store.

363
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,660
It's made from old material.

364
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:11,772
It's nicely packed.

365
00:22:12,688 --> 00:22:13,661
Let me see it.

366
00:22:15,956 --> 00:22:17,635
It's true.

367
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:19,720
Very precious.

368
00:22:20,113 --> 00:22:21,493
Have a look, Su.

369
00:22:21,534 --> 00:22:23,204
It's your favorite.

370
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:26,413
It's very kind of you.

371
00:22:28,611 --> 00:22:30,240
Of course.

372
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,713
He's a good boy.

373
00:22:37,462 --> 00:22:40,545
Your uncle's just like a duck.

374
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:41,551
Let Beibei tell you.

375
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:43,563
He's double-faced.

376
00:22:43,873 --> 00:22:46,111
I know he likes it very much.

377
00:22:46,152 --> 00:22:47,255
He just doesn't say it.

378
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,889
Enjoy yourself here.

379
00:22:49,462 --> 00:22:50,643
I'll go cooking.

380
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:52,155
It's almost done.

381
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:54,680
-Have a taste!
-Let me help you.

382
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:55,722
No, thanks, just sit there.

383
00:22:55,763 --> 00:22:56,784
Let mom show her skills.

384
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:57,664
That's right.

385
00:22:59,606 --> 00:23:00,600
Give him a cup of water.

386
00:23:01,273 --> 00:23:02,376
Take care of him.

387
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:03,840
Okay

388
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:06,040
Have a taste of my stewed pork.

389
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,369
You can't find it in restaurants.

390
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:13,080
Mom, your cooking skill is even better.

391
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,260
Perfect combination of color,
aroma and taste.

392
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,350
Wonderful!

393
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:18,812
Nonsense.

394
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:20,683
You haven't eat it yet.

395
00:23:20,724 --> 00:23:22,029
How could you know it?

396
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,694
Help yourself.
Try this stewed pork.

397
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:26,405
Try this.

398
00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:28,855
You too.
Shiyun, have more.

399
00:23:29,754 --> 00:23:32,562
-Thank you.
-The pork is wonderful.

400
00:23:32,603 --> 00:23:33,480
Also try this.

401
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:34,840
My mom's stewed pork is the best.

402
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:36,826
Yeah.
Agaric is good for your health.

403
00:23:37,881 --> 00:23:38,798
Also have some mushroom.

404
00:23:39,388 --> 00:23:41,093
Su, have more, too.

405
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:42,047
Come on.

406
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,005
Dad, you have more.

407
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:47,665
Okay, I'm good.

408
00:23:47,838 --> 00:23:48,740
Take care of yourself.

409
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:49,751
Shiyun.

410
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,680
Does it suit your taste?

411
00:23:52,552 --> 00:23:53,408
Delicious.

412
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,358
Really?

413
00:23:54,491 --> 00:23:56,760
Then you can come more often
I'll cook this for you.

414
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:01,592
You young people eat too many takeouts.

415
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:03,186
Mom, you are wrong.

416
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:06,642
Dr. Zhou likes cooking.

417
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:09,480
He cooks very well.

418
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:13,560
Just a little bit better than you.

419
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:17,113
You are so not shy.

420
00:24:17,715 --> 00:24:19,307
Your Dr. Zhou?

421
00:24:21,322 --> 00:24:23,171
He can cook.

422
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,187
Awesome.

423
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:28,307
He should build his career
instead of cooking at home.

424
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:32,447
Mom.

425
00:24:33,956 --> 00:24:37,268
I heard that Shiyun's
already an attending doctor.

426
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:43,884
Not attending doctor,
he's a chief physician

427
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:46,800
and also a professor.

428
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:49,920
That's so outstanding.

429
00:24:50,575 --> 00:24:53,417
Shiyun, you are 28 years old, aren't you?

430
00:24:53,707 --> 00:24:55,721
A 28-year-old professor.

431
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:56,974
So impressive.

432
00:24:57,015 --> 00:24:58,043
That's so outstanding.

433
00:24:58,156 --> 00:24:59,026
Su.

434
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:02,891
I remember you were almost 40
when you became a professor.

435
00:25:02,932 --> 00:25:04,367
No, it's 41.

436
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:05,401
You...

437
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:08,223
No. 40 or 41?

438
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,600
I've forgot.

439
00:25:09,913 --> 00:25:10,760
Alright.

440
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:14,219
Take your time.

441
00:25:14,455 --> 00:25:15,295
I'm full.

442
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:18,992
You barely eat nothing.

443
00:25:20,555 --> 00:25:22,491
-Mom.
-Unreasonable.

444
00:25:22,532 --> 00:25:23,480
He's angry.

445
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:25,712
Did I say anything wrong?

446
00:25:25,962 --> 00:25:27,040
Didn't you?

447
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:33,201
Narrow-minded.
Here you are.

448
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,520
Never mind, have a crab.

449
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:46,027
-Mom.
-It's fine. I can handle it.

450
00:25:47,576 --> 00:25:48,840
-Come on.
-Su.

451
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:50,905
Have some fruit.

452
00:25:52,503 --> 00:25:54,005
-Dad.
-This melon is really sweet.

453
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,100
Alright.

454
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,439
I can help myself.

455
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:03,741
Dad.

456
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,806
You like playing Chinese chess very much.

457
00:26:06,847 --> 00:26:09,027
Maybe Shiyun can play with you.

458
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:10,080
Yeah.

459
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:11,765
I stopped playing long time ago.

460
00:26:12,268 --> 00:26:13,226
Nonsense.

461
00:26:13,523 --> 00:26:15,480
You played with Zhou yesterday.

462
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,350
Shiyun, come and sit here.

463
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,419
Use the pieces you bought, okay?

464
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,040
Alright. I'll fetch it.

465
00:26:22,285 --> 00:26:23,343
I'm used to the old ones.

466
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:25,859
Okay, then we use the old ones.

467
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:31,080
Yeah, playing Chinese chess.

468
00:26:31,812 --> 00:26:34,053
Do you know?
My dad is a good chess player.

469
00:26:38,352 --> 00:26:39,680
Round one.

470
00:27:07,698 --> 00:27:08,594
Checkmate.

471
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:18,240
That doesn't count, let's start again.

472
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:20,656
It's just warm-up.

473
00:27:20,697 --> 00:27:21,760
Come on.

474
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:23,565
Come on.

475
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:24,710
Let me see.

476
00:27:25,137 --> 00:27:26,137
Put them back.

477
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,385
Lose on purpose.

478
00:27:30,806 --> 00:27:32,080
Where should it be?

479
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:33,236
I forget it.

480
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,000
Okay, round two.

481
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,200
I lose the game.

482
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:19,387
Dad, you won.

483
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:21,402
The older, the wiser.

484
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,583
Losing on purpose...

485
00:28:24,572 --> 00:28:25,967
is not what a gentleman should do.

486
00:28:30,548 --> 00:28:31,508
Hypocritical.

487
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:41,714
Can't this be easy.

488
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,487
I lost.

489
00:28:43,528 --> 00:28:44,968
I see.

490
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:47,680
Maybe it's too obvious.

491
00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:50,452
Go.

492
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:52,291
Let's go.

493
00:29:09,474 --> 00:29:10,503
Where are you going?

494
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:12,320
Outside.

495
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:13,864
Where?

496
00:29:15,076 --> 00:29:15,916
To the supermarket.

497
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:17,097
Supermarket?

498
00:29:19,972 --> 00:29:20,812
I'll go with him.

499
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:22,546
Where are you going?

500
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:24,107
My dad is mad at you.

501
00:29:24,147 --> 00:29:25,138
Let him go.

502
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:26,520
It'll be fine.

503
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,359
Bye.

504
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:32,688
Alright.

505
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:34,246
It's fine.

506
00:29:34,287 --> 00:29:35,379
Spend time together with mom.

507
00:29:40,437 --> 00:29:41,277
Uncle.

508
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:52,801
People say life is like a chess game.

509
00:29:53,445 --> 00:29:54,602
What's your opinion?

510
00:29:55,804 --> 00:29:56,971
Life is a chess game.

511
00:29:57,536 --> 00:30:00,171
Every time you move a piece,

512
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:01,412
you should think and plan carefully.

513
00:30:01,505 --> 00:30:02,760
Consolidate at every step.

514
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:06,637
You are a rigorous man.

515
00:30:07,313 --> 00:30:10,333
Why did you lose on purpose?

516
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,120
Rigour and rules are important.

517
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:18,636
But sometimes...

518
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:21,520
emotion is more important.

519
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:31,347
I was not satisfied with you.

520
00:30:32,553 --> 00:30:36,332
But what you just said changed my opinion.

521
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:39,869
Don't worry, uncle.

522
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,938
I'll take good care of Jinbei.

523
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,720
I trust you.

524
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:04,304
Not good.

525
00:31:04,345 --> 00:31:05,639
Your face is too small.

526
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,387
Hold on, let me step behind.

527
00:31:07,427 --> 00:31:09,923
You sit in front of me and hold the phone.

528
00:31:10,115 --> 00:31:11,240
Hurry up.

529
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:13,000
Great, that works.

530
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:14,080
Mom.

531
00:31:14,516 --> 00:31:16,160
They won't fight each other, will they?

532
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:17,996
Don't watch too much idol dramas.

533
00:31:18,036 --> 00:31:19,510
How can that happen?
This looks good.

534
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,968
I played in too much dramas
not watching.

535
00:31:27,868 --> 00:31:28,880
Forget it.

536
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:30,640
Tell mom honestly.

537
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:34,400
What's going on in your relationship?

538
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:37,000
What do you mean?

539
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,753
What do I mean?

540
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,320
Don't play the fool.

541
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:43,303
You are so beautiful.

542
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:45,213
Of course, it's mainly inherited from me.

543
00:31:45,716 --> 00:31:47,880
But you hang out and
live together everyday.

544
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:49,000
Have you…

545
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:50,642
Mom.

546
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:53,172
This app is wonderful.

547
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:55,394
And I think
your skin has turned white recently.

548
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:56,619
You look good in every angle.

549
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,500
Really?

550
00:31:58,275 --> 00:32:00,751
-Have a look.
-I always have a good skin.

551
00:32:01,098 --> 00:32:02,035
I tell you ah...

552
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:04,427
I don't laugh out loud now.

553
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:05,461
I only smile in this way.

554
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,080
Otherwise there will be
winkles on my face.

555
00:32:08,828 --> 00:32:10,297
You successfully changed the topic.

556
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:11,819
Tell me the truth.

557
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,700
I've got a message.

558
00:32:14,555 --> 00:32:16,270
Sister, is everything alright?

559
00:32:16,372 --> 00:32:17,843
Does my brother behave well?

560
00:32:19,836 --> 00:32:20,676
Who's that?

561
00:32:21,202 --> 00:32:22,881
Suying, Shiyun's little sister.

562
00:32:24,023 --> 00:32:25,811
Sister-in-law.

563
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:30,316
Just a little episode.

564
00:32:30,357 --> 00:32:31,197
But everything is okay.

565
00:32:31,635 --> 00:32:33,117
How about your interview?

566
00:32:39,427 --> 00:32:40,480
I'm not peeping.

567
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,027
It has not started yet.

568
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,387
There are several other candidates.

569
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,480
But I'm not nervous.

570
00:32:47,187 --> 00:32:49,600
That's great, go ahead.

571
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:16,640
Jiawei's here.

572
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:41,240
Gu Zhenglin, come in.

573
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:52,695
Next, Zhou Suying.

574
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:02,968
Hello.

575
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:03,849
Please have a seat.

576
00:34:08,476 --> 00:34:10,160
Please tell us a little about yourself.

577
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,059
Hello everyone, I'm Zhou Suying.

578
00:34:13,324 --> 00:34:15,529
I'm an undergraduate
student of Donghao University.

579
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:16,703
My major is Economy and Management

580
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:19,730
I've passed NCRE-4 and CET-6.

581
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,881
I like reading and playing video games.

582
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,680
You were playing games just now, right?

583
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:25,541
Yes.

584
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:28,760
Do you care about this interview?

585
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:32,403
Why did you play games
in such an important occasion?

586
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,165
Or maybe you think
you've got the recommendation...

587
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:38,155
to get the job easily.

588
00:34:38,196 --> 00:34:39,641
So this interview is just a formality?

589
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:40,666
That's not true.

590
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,723
It's because...

591
00:34:46,188 --> 00:34:49,415
I worship you very much.

592
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,121
So.

593
00:34:52,213 --> 00:34:53,800
So I'm little nervous.

594
00:34:54,347 --> 00:34:59,400
I know that you also
relax through video games.

595
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:02,440
I also know that you like Chinese food
rather than western food.

596
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:03,736
You don't eat coriander.

597
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:05,700
You are good at playing the guitar.

598
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:07,640
But no one else is allowed to touch it.

599
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:09,680
Because in your opinion.

600
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:11,906
Your guitar is not only
a musical instrument,

601
00:35:11,947 --> 00:35:13,987
but a buddy who has been
through the ups and downs with you.

602
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:16,596
I think she's good.

603
00:35:16,637 --> 00:35:19,680
Maybe I'm lack of working experience.

604
00:35:19,741 --> 00:35:22,234
But as your fan,

605
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:23,947
I'm very much familiar with you.

606
00:35:24,063 --> 00:35:26,441
If I can be your assistant,

607
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:29,519
maybe it will save time for you.

608
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:34,027
For example, you don't have to tell me
what are your allergens,

609
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:35,337
your favorite fruit,

610
00:35:35,387 --> 00:35:37,200
or how much sugar
you'd like in your coffee.

611
00:35:39,747 --> 00:35:41,880
Don't mercy me next time.

612
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,100
No losing on purpose.

613
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,870
Next time, we must
play fully and delightfully.

614
00:35:46,336 --> 00:35:47,319
Not bad.

615
00:35:48,223 --> 00:35:49,063
You are back.

616
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,551
-Give it to me.
-No, thanks, it's too heavy.

617
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:52,754
Let him do it.

618
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:54,760
Let's put them in the kitchen.

619
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:55,641
Okay

620
00:35:56,593 --> 00:35:57,520
You are in a good mood.

621
00:35:57,736 --> 00:35:58,583
What happened?

622
00:35:58,624 --> 00:35:59,464
I'll tell you later.

623
00:36:01,098 --> 00:36:03,401
Dad, you bought so much food today.

624
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:04,888
Mom will be busy for dinner.

625
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,049
Busy?

626
00:36:06,156 --> 00:36:07,186
Let me tell you.

627
00:36:07,227 --> 00:36:08,717
I'll be on strike tonight.

628
00:36:08,758 --> 00:36:11,884
I'll call Junhao Restaurant now
for a big private room...

629
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:15,501
and call your uncles
and aunts to go together.

630
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:17,812
We are having a great gathering tonight.

631
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:19,412
Mom is depleting her wallet tonight.

632
00:36:19,686 --> 00:36:20,526
Come here.

633
00:36:23,029 --> 00:36:23,875
Mom.

634
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:24,916
Now that we are eating outside.

635
00:36:24,957 --> 00:36:27,852
Let's put fresh stuff into the fridge.

636
00:36:27,892 --> 00:36:28,732
Okay.

637
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:36,329
Take it.

638
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:39,358
Put the cabbage on the upper layer.

639
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:40,239
Alright.

640
00:36:42,431 --> 00:36:43,271
And this.

641
00:36:45,611 --> 00:36:47,451
I have a shocking material of your fiancee
