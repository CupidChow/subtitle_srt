1
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:51,816
Dr. Zhou.

2
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,791
Is Jinbei there?

3
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,100
She's not here.

4
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:56,150
I'll make another phone call.

5
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,650
Sorry, the subscriber
you dialed is power off.

6
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:00,725
It's power off again.

7
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:03,050
What time did she leave?

8
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:04,975
About ten o'clock in the morning.

9
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,325
They're calling off the
Future Woman Warrior.

10
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,141
Then she said she wanna stay alone,

11
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:10,616
I came to her after half an hour

12
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,767
only to found that she was gone.

13
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,850
Why do they have to solve it.

14
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,250
It's just about the pictures.

15
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:20,625
I heard that they fired Ethan

16
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,150
in order to refute rumors.

17
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,800
She's taking this movie too seriously.

18
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,340
She...

19
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:32,543
Where will she go?

20
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:34,618
In my understanding of her.

21
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,316
If she's unhappy, she'll eat and drink.

22
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,900
Just like last time she missed
going back home with you.

23
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:40,865
She did the same way.

24
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:42,531
Otherwise, let's go

25
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:44,315
somewhere she might go.

26
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,516
Okay, let's split up.

27
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:46,441
Okay.

28
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,066
We haven't even taken
a picture together.

29
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,666
Let's do it.

30
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,590
Come on.

31
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,340
Hi, Beibei.

32
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,400
Zhou Shiyun.

33
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,750
This is Su Jinbei's mother.

34
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:05,508
Hello, Aunt.

35
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,775
I'm not okay,

36
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,740
I tell you.

37
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,700
Beibei has gone back to hometown.

38
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,067
You come to my place now.

39
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,475
Okay, I'll be right there.

40
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,950
What did he say?

41
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,341
When I,

42
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,525
his mother-in-law, got mad.

43
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,275
He lost his nerve at once

44
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,866
I told you.

45
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,250
When he comes here to apologize to Beibei.

46
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,816
She won't be angry any more.

47
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,475
Then it's all over.

48
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,675
That'd be great.

49
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,140
Mom.

50
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:34,383
Why did you call him with my cell phone?

51
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,400
I... I...

52
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,440
We...

53
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:39,525
It's not me, it's your dad.

54
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:40,391
You can look at my hands.

55
00:04:40,475 --> 00:04:41,016
Nothing.

56
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,491
You.

57
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:42,415
Mom.

58
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,516
Beibei.

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,941
Mom's doing what's best for you.

60
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:46,816
Right?

61
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,850
I tell you.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,266
I didn't show him any respect.

63
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,341
And I gave him a lash.

64
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:52,916
Yes, yes.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,716
You just wait.

66
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,475
He's on his way to apologize to you.

67
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,975
Who wants him to apologize

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
I don't want to see him.

69
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,140
Well.

70
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,341
What's wrong with her?

71
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:05,325
She showed no respect for me.

72
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,700
All right, all right.

73
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,416
She's just like you.

74
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,625
Persuade them well.

75
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,190
Damn!

76
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:26,416
Under the influence of cold current,

77
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,341
the temperature in our city is
expected to drop dramatically.

78
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:30,325
The highest temperature today
is three degrees above zero.

79
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,125
And the lowest temperature
will be at five degrees below zero.

80
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,250
Zhou Shiyun.

81
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,016
What's the time now?

82
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,450
He hasn't come yet.

83
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,175
Stop watching TV.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,750
Yeah, he should be here.

85
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:08,191
Is it him?

86
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:09,575
I'll answer the door.

87
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,575
What's the rush.

88
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,250
Let him wait a bit longer.

89
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:14,825
Who was in a hurry just now.

90
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,600
He's here to apologize.

91
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:18,750
Just let him wait a while.

92
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,500
Teach him a lesson.

93
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,875
Remember

94
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,991
I'll play the bad guy
and you the good one.

95
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:26,950
Okay, Okay.

96
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,350
Coming.

97
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,941
Remember what l told you.

98
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes. Yes. Hurry up.

99
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,066
Why are you so late.

100
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,991
Sorry, Aunt.

101
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:42,525
There was a bit of crowded traffic.

102
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:45,866
Shiyun, come here.

103
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,716
Come in.

104
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,850
I'm just reminding you.

105
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,825
Beibei's mad at you.

106
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:51,650
You'd better be careful.

107
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,725
Who sent you here?

108
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:56,050
Auntie called me to say
you were back to hometown.

109
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:57,550
So I came here at once.

110
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:58,725
If my mom didn't call you

111
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,275
you'll never come here.

112
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,875
I didn't expect you would go back home.

113
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:04,065
Of course you will not.

114
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,650
You don't even try to understand me.

115
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:06,241
Beibei.

116
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:06,716
I...

117
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,591
Since he is here.

118
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:09,050
Why don't you be nice?

119
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:10,141
Come in.

120
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:11,550
No, no, no. Step aside.

121
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,716
Get out, get out

122
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,767
I don't want to even see you.

123
00:07:14,075 --> 00:07:14,975
Go! Go! Go!

124
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,940
Beibei.

125
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:17,065
You.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,975
Beibei.

127
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,266
You'd better let him in.

128
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:22,916
No.

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
If anyone lets him in, I won't spare him.

130
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,000
He is there.

131
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:37,600
Beibei.

132
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,300
Shiyun's at the door.

133
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,450
Let him in.

134
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,925
He looks so regretful

135
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,650
and even hit his head against the wall.

136
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:51,325
Well, well, well.

137
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,741
Go and have a look, Beibei.

138
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:54,516
No.

139
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,325
He even hit his head against the wall.

140
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,400
He might get hurt.

141
00:07:59,025 --> 00:07:59,866
Go and have a look.

142
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,790
He's hurting himself.

143
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,075
Good girl, give him a chance.

144
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,850
Let him in.

145
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,150
Well, give him a chance.

146
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,141
Shiyun.

147
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,500
What?

148
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,325
He has no sincerity.

149
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,680
Damn!

150
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:26,044
Beibei.

151
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,525
Beibei.

152
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,700
Zhou Shiyun, he's really...

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,700
I think he's furious.

154
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:02,675
Now that he has gone this far.

155
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,700
It is so cold.

156
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:06,250
Maybe five or six degrees.

157
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,800
It's already below zero

158
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,175
I didn't notice it's so cold.

159
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,475
In such a cold day

160
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,016
and he has gone this far.

161
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,466
Why don't they talk nicely.

162
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,500
Why he became dumb outside the door.

163
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,350
Then he can yell through the door.

164
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,625
Maybe Shiyun

165
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,925
is an introvert boy.

166
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:28,300
Yes.

167
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:31,850
Well, yes.

168
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,650
Look, Zhou Shiyun

169
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,700
is a poor kid.

170
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
His parents died when he was young

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,200
and he was brought up by
his grandmother and brother.

172
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,950
He has a cold disposition.

173
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,100
But in other words,

174
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:47,816
he can't do that even
with such a cold disposition.

175
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,740
Right?

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,225
If you're embarrassed,

177
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,250
you can wait for a while.

178
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,275
That's over?

179
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,300
Maybe he hasn't gone far yet.

180
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:01,191
Why don't you call him back?

181
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:01,941
Yes, yes.

182
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:03,841
OK OK, call him right now.

183
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:04,891
Let him sincerely apologize.

184
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:07,075
All right, stop it, all of you

185
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,250
I'm telling you seriously

186
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:09,375
I wouldn't call him.

187
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:12,275
As your mother said,

188
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:15,725
even if he is introverted, he
should know the right occasion.

189
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:19,325
And I didn't say anything about him.

190
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,950
How can he leave like that?

191
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,475
Well, well, I don't want to hear it.

192
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,341
You just go, go out.

193
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:25,265
Beibei.

194
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:25,991
Get out. Get out.

195
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:27,225
Well, think it over by yourself.

196
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:27,866
Beibei.

197
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,716
Go! Go! Go!

198
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,466
OK

199
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:29,966
Okay, come on.

200
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,925
Okay, okay.

201
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,740
Get out.

202
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,800
Come on, let's get something to eat.

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,925
You've been hungry all day.

204
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:12,725
Baby.

205
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:15,525
Eat something no matter what happened.

206
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,225
No, I won't.

207
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:19,375
Put it outside.

208
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:37,785
Why don't you follow your heart?

209
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:44,276
Send him a message on WeChat.

210
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:46,915
No.

211
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:48,865
No.

212
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,400
No.

213
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,550
What's wrong with you?

214
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,641
He came to see you on such a cold day.

215
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:56,816
And you drive him away.

216
00:11:56,901 --> 00:11:58,251
Don't you regret it?

217
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,525
He doesn't care about me

218
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,825
and looks down on me.

219
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,050
He doesn't care about you?

220
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:08,616
He's such a prideful man.

221
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,000
But he's desperate to see you.

222
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:11,725
Isn't that enough?

223
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,325
But.

224
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,950
Didn't you always say
something bad about him?

225
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:17,500
So, why you've changed?

226
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,650
I've been watching you all the time.

227
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,625
Even the coldest heart will melt.

228
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:26,674
Text him.

229
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:37,625
For what.

230
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:18,865
It's snowing.

231
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,325
What are you waiting for?

232
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:47,325
Zhou Shiyun.

233
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,250
Beibei.

234
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have gone to see Ethan.

235
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,975
You have been working hard.

236
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,475
Thanks for coming after me.

237
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:07,375
What a heavy snow!

238
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:28,065
Beibei.

239
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,340
Marry me.

240
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:03,456
Yes.

241
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,140
Hurry up.

242
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,550
You must be freezing.

243
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:15,725
Hurry up, come in.

244
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,016
Look at you.

245
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,125
Just give it to me.

246
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:20,466
Go in.

247
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,390
It's cold right?

248
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,450
Have something hot.

249
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:32,715
Mom.

250
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,150
Why are you looking at us?

251
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:36,750
We cannot even

252
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:38,650
know how to eat.

253
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,525
All right, all right.

254
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:42,515
Let's go.

255
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,940
Come on, eat up.

256
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,640
Come on.

257
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:49,750
This one cooked by my
mom tastes pretty good.

258
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,316
Leave them alone.

259
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,325
Watch TV.

260
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,450
What's the matter with you?

261
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,925
Just like my mom.

262
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,200
Why are you looking at me?

263
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,625
After I met you just now.

264
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,325
I...

265
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,300
Even in every minute, every moment

266
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,650
I don't want you out of my sight.

267
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,475
I have never thought

268
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:36,250
you can say such love prattle

269
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,950
I just talk from my heart.

270
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,875
Here.

271
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,850
Come on, sit here.

272
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,250
Be closer,

273
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,300
a little closer.

274
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,600
Yes, I'm beautiful
enough to feast your eyes.

275
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,525
But my Dr. Zhou can't go hungry.

276
00:20:18,915 --> 00:20:19,755
Come on.

277
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,240
Let me help you.

278
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:34,421
Okay?

279
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,240
Open your mouth.

280
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,450
Well, that's a relief.

281
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:46,941
Where are you going?

282
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:47,591
Honey

283
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:49,725
I'll see if they have enough to eat.

284
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,390
Don't go.

285
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,475
Why.

286
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,775
Let them have a good meal.

287
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,666
One more.

288
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,590
Damn.

289
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,125
I'll just see if they have enough to eat.

290
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:03,250
Xueyan.

291
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,525
Don't worry about it.

292
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,590
Just think about it.

293
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,650
When we fell in love,

294
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:12,725
we didn't like to be disturbed by parents.

295
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,591
Damn!

296
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:16,515
Yes.

297
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,590
Eat some melon seeds.

298
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,725
Xiaofang, come here.

299
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,550
Come on. Let me wash your feet.

300
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,190
Come on.

301
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:32,450
Take care, slow down.

302
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,616
Come on.

303
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,025
Lei.

304
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,275
Go back to sleep.

305
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,125
You've been tired the whole day.

306
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,875
If you stay with me at night,

307
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,250
you won't sleep well.

308
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:49,100
Watch out, take it easy.

309
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,465
Come on.

310
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:51,641
Have a seat.

311
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:52,565
Take care.

312
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,375
Zhou said that

313
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,500
he'll stay here all these days.

314
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,525
Nothing serious.

315
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,925
I know.

316
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,725
I would worry about you if I returned.

317
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:10,300
I'm relieved to be here with you.

318
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:14,325
Don't worry.

319
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,550
It's Okay.

320
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:24,150
Shiyun,

321
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,200
you can stay in her room today.

322
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,225
Mom, I don't think so.

323
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:32,425
You sleep with me.

324
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,216
And my dad?

325
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,675
He'll sleep on the sofa.

326
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:39,700
Aunt, it's not good

327
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:40,991
I'll sleep on the sofa.

328
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:41,915
Never mind.

329
00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:44,850
Your uncle's used to.

330
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,075
He's used to.

331
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,240
Well.

332
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,116
When my father prepared for
the postgraduate entrance exam,

333
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,425
he's already in love with my mom.

334
00:22:51,675 --> 00:22:52,866
But there was no place to live then,

335
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,716
so he had to stay at my mom's,

336
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,716
sleeping at the sofa.

337
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,775
Alright.

338
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,525
No more gossip about us.

339
00:22:59,075 --> 00:23:01,275
Hurry to sleep after your talk.

340
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,466
Good night, mom.

341
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,141
Good night.

342
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:03,791
Aunt, go bed early.

343
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:04,715
OK

344
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,641
Honey

345
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:08,450
I have something to tell you.

346
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,950
In think that

347
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,625
we should learn from this thing.

348
00:23:19,075 --> 00:23:21,050
You didn't ask Ethan for help,

349
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,125
but you feel that

350
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,150
the thought of it may do me wrong.

351
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:27,050
So you blame yourself all the time.

352
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,575
And it's also my fault

353
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,675
I didn't even give you
a chance to explain.

354
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:32,850
So,

355
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,416
we need to talk about
everything in the future.

356
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,340
Okay?

357
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:39,250
In the future, if anything happens,

358
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:41,750
let's all keep in touch.

359
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,550
Now it's all over

360
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:48,850
I will

361
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,250
give you a nice reward.

362
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,300
I served him a bowl of soup.

363
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,850
Where's it?

364
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:53,941
I'm on the way.

365
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,941
Well, stop acting

366
00:24:56,025 --> 00:24:57,400
and thinking about playgoing.

367
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,240
Honey.

368
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,525
I am going to sleep. Good night.

369
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,390
Good night.

370
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:08,925
Mom, give me a bowl of soup, too.

371
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,150
Shiyun,

372
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,425
listen to your teacher at school.

373
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,400
Zhou Shiyun, right?

374
00:26:12,675 --> 00:26:13,391
I warn you.

375
00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:14,316
About the fact that we're engaged,

376
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,325
you can't tell anyone.

377
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:18,016
However,

378
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,866
you must be good to me.

379
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,791
You'll do whatever I say.

380
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:20,791
Buy me something delicious.

381
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:21,641
And help me do homework.

382
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:22,625
If someone's picking on me,

383
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,716
you must be the first to stand up.

384
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,640
Can you do it?

385
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:26,315
OK

386
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,940
Go.

387
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,475
Honey. Wake up.

388
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,475
Honey.

389
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,150
My honey

390
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,175
even slept with the picture of me.

391
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,450
How much do you love me.

392
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:10,500
But I like the way you love me.

393
00:27:12,675 --> 00:27:13,515
Get up.

394
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,991
Today

395
00:27:16,075 --> 00:27:18,250
I'll show you my hometown carefully

396
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,240
as a guide.

397
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:36,450
I'll take you to eat my favorite food.

398
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,590
What?

399
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,050
You'll see.

400
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,240
Go.

401
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,391
Is it the...

402
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:48,700
stinky tofu (smelly tofu)

403
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:49,925
Yes, let's go.

404
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,475
Stinky... smelly... tofu.

405
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:53,465
Uncle Zhang.

406
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:55,250
Give me a bowl of stinky tofu.

407
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,390
Okay.

408
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,975
A bowl of stinky tofu.

409
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,125
It's me.

410
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,940
Jinbei.

411
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,125
I haven't seen you for a long time.

412
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:06,900
You haven't eaten

413
00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:08,425
the stinky tofu for some days.

414
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:10,691
Here you are.

415
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:11,725
Thanks

416
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,875
I've been eating this since I was a kid.

417
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:14,916
My favorite.

418
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,500
Try it, honey.

419
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:19,125
I gonna have to pass.

420
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:21,125
Just try it, good boy.

421
00:28:24,225 --> 00:28:25,800
Well, is it good?

422
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,100
Sorry, I shouldn't have forced it on you.

423
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,775
It's delicious.

424
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:41,625
You're lying.

425
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,250
In my hometown,

426
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,775
there are so many famous snacks.

427
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:51,791
Zhao's marinated chicken
feet, Gui's fried chicken

428
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:52,975
and Xianglixiang wonton.

429
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,875
Anyway, I'm gonna take you

430
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,400
to eat all the tasty food.

431
00:28:58,075 --> 00:28:58,915
Just you and me?

432
00:28:59,025 --> 00:29:00,191
Can we eat that much?

433
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:01,125
Eat slowly then.

434
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,175
Anyway, I'm the belle with a big stomach.

435
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,050
Yes, yes.

436
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:06,850
Great.

437
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:08,725
One more, honey.

438
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:09,865
Just one.

439
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,075
Thatâ€™s how it works.

440
00:29:12,225 --> 00:29:14,200
Under the snow dancing in the air,

441
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,275
he got down on one knee

442
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,275
and proposed to me.

443
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,525
So romantic!

444
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:27,550
I feel the same way.

445
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,075
When will you get married?

446
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,416
I haven't thought about it.

447
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,675
Take it easy.

448
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,225
In the name of the Zhou Family,

449
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:43,175
it must be a luxurious wedding.

450
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,075
That's not important.

451
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,275
The important thing is to
be with someone you like.

452
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,050
How's Xiao doing with you?

453
00:29:52,275 --> 00:29:53,550
Fine?

454
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,575
Just so so.

455
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,725
Maybe he's preparing a surprise for you.

456
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:07,925
He didn't even think about it.

457
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,590
Will he?

458
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:11,800
Maybe.

459
00:30:21,025 --> 00:30:21,865
Zhou.

460
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,066
Congratulations!

461
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,990
Thanks.

462
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,775
I do admire you in fact.

463
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,316
A gentle man like you

464
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,240
an make it in a quick way

465
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,534
every time it comes to the crunch.

466
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:32,425
No, I don't.

467
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,075
Just sincere.

468
00:30:34,475 --> 00:30:36,250
So do I.

469
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,684
But I'm too scared to do anything.

470
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:38,916
If you're sincere,

471
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,975
then buy the ring first.

472
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,250
When did you buy the ring?

473
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,840
Zhou

474
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:50,466
I feel the call of nature

475
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,816
I have to go to the rest room.

476
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,716
See you at the carbarn.

477
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,640
OK

478
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,666
This.

479
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,590
OK

480
00:31:06,675 --> 00:31:08,150
Since you're ready,

481
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,250
then take action now

482
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,750
I do.

483
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,975
But I'm still thinking.

484
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:16,325
Well, you know.

485
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,666
Wu Di was engaged the last time,

486
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,475
but it fell apart.

487
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:32,300
Honey.

488
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,925
I saw Didi.

489
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,300
Well, in your opinion,

490
00:31:38,425 --> 00:31:40,700
is Xiao really in love with her?

491
00:31:41,425 --> 00:31:42,625
Of course.

492
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,616
So why did he

493
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,900
show that.

494
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,150
You mean...

495
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:52,925
Actually, he's already bought the ring.

496
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,350
But he's afraid to propose.

497
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:56,900
Why?

498
00:31:57,025 --> 00:31:57,941
He's hesitating.

499
00:31:58,025 --> 00:31:59,416
He's worried about that Wu Di

500
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,134
has not recovered from
her last failed engagement.

501
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,000
It's a total overreaction.

502
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,525
That was a long time ago

503
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,850
I can feel it.

504
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,250
Didi does like him.

505
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,325
And she really wants him to do something.

506
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,525
Really?

507
00:32:16,675 --> 00:32:18,750
Maybe we can help him.

508
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,675
Didi.

509
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,465
Beibei.

510
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:42,891
Go.

511
00:32:42,975 --> 00:32:43,991
Could you please help me carry my bag?

512
00:32:44,075 --> 00:32:44,891
You've got me.

513
00:32:44,975 --> 00:32:45,900
You home is near here.

514
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,666
Why did you stay at the resort?

515
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,100
I told you before.

516
00:32:49,225 --> 00:32:50,725
The resort has just opened.

517
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:52,266
The boss asked me for a recommendation.

518
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,866
And it doesn't cost anything.

519
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,250
Why didn't I stay here.

520
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,340
Really?

521
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,940
Alright.

522
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,725
I'll count one, two, three.

523
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,566
You'll fly the pigeons together.

524
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,850
Okay, okay.

525
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,340
Honey.

526
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,725
When Xiao says some honeyed words.

527
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,125
Kneel on one knee and show the ring.

528
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:18,925
All the pigeons in the back will fly.

529
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,700
The scene will be extremely romantic.

530
00:33:20,825 --> 00:33:21,665
Honey.

531
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:23,391
A good idea, isn't it?

532
00:33:23,475 --> 00:33:24,315
OK

533
00:33:26,075 --> 00:33:27,250
Coming.

534
00:33:28,225 --> 00:33:29,425
Quick! Hide!

535
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,516
Why you take me to the garden?

536
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,750
Nothing.

537
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,575
How beautiful the view is

538
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:37,741
I just want to take a walk with you

539
00:33:37,825 --> 00:33:38,665
and just talk.

540
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,440
Didi.

541
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,540
I...

542
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:51,025
I take you out because...

543
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,750
Ready.

544
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,141
Why are there so many pigeons?

545
00:34:05,225 --> 00:34:06,065
Yes.

546
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:09,125
Why are there so many pigeons.

547
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:12,450
Just flying around like that.

548
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:15,175
Well, what were you trying to say.

549
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:20,600
I just want to say.

550
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,125
I'm prepare...

551
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,675
I just take you

552
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:34,525
to see the pigeons.

553
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,300
That's boring.

554
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,725
See yourself. I'm gonna
go back to my room.

555
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,050
I'm not even in the mood

556
00:34:58,275 --> 00:34:59,925
when you released the pigeons.

557
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,266
All my honeyed words

558
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,475
haven't been said yet.

559
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:04,350
Sorry, Xiao

560
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:06,700
I didn't get along with the waiter.

561
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,740
It's all my fault.

562
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,791
Not Beibei

563
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,600
I should have let the waitress rehearse.

564
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,740
It's all my fault.

565
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:13,050
It's my fault.

566
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:14,266
How can he blame you?

567
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,450
No, it's my fault

568
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,775
I must be blamed for this.

569
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,425
So kind of you.

570
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:21,475
You two.

571
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:25,675
Can you stop showing off your affection?

572
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,450
My heart aches.

573
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,150
Don't worry, Xiao.

574
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,316
We've got a big plan.

575
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,216
Let's make persistent efforts.

576
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,525
It'll work. Come on.

577
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,516
Come on, Xiao.

578
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,440
Come on.

579
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,266
Come on.

580
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,190
Come on.

581
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,850
Where are you?

582
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:47,475
Talking here with Zhou.

583
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,800
What you always stay in other's room?

584
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:52,775
Can you stop being a fifth wheel?

585
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,190
But

586
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,850
he's not himself today.

587
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,725
After all you've done so much for Wu Di.

588
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,650
She would be touched if she knew.

589
00:36:22,675 --> 00:36:24,050
Let go of them.

590
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,016
It's mainly because of her last experience

591
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,200
which has a big influence on her.

592
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,750
So I won't let her down.

593
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,150
I have to make her happy.

594
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,225
But, Zhou.

595
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,141
You've always been more rational than I am

596
00:36:40,225 --> 00:36:42,375
I need you to analyze it objectively.

597
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,000
Wu Di has such a strong character

598
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,850
and can't let go of the past.

599
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,050
If I propose,

600
00:36:51,225 --> 00:36:53,250
it's easy to fail, right?

601
00:36:53,425 --> 00:36:55,116
Well, stop thinking like that.

602
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,040
Well, in your opinion,

603
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:58,450
I really love Wu Di,

604
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:04,375
so none of these forms
really matter, do they?

605
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:10,700
Xiao Yuansong.

606
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,575
Will you back out?

607
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,540
I...

608
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,167
If Xiao doesn't want to propose,

609
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,391
then he'd better give up.

610
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:25,875
Forced love does not last.

611
00:37:26,275 --> 00:37:28,750
Well, is that difficult?

612
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,790
It's just...

613
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:34,341
Didi

614
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:35,650
I need to talk to you.

615
00:37:35,825 --> 00:37:37,300
See you at the lounge.

616
00:38:25,225 --> 00:38:28,150
Aren't you going to say anything?

617
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,450
I want to say.

618
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,550
I'm saying...

619
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:41,150
Why are Su Jinbei and Zhou still not here.

620
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:45,225
This place is so big.

621
00:38:45,475 --> 00:38:47,225
It's empty and quiet.

622
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,675
It's not fun.

623
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,925
This environment is so great.

624
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,900
There's should be a
good atmosphere, right?

625
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,350
OK, stop talking.

626
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,840
Xiao.

627
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,950
I know what you want.

628
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,725
But as you said,

629
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,400
the procedure is not important.

630
00:39:08,025 --> 00:39:11,300
Let's skip this process

631
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,725
and just get married.

632
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,525
It's one o'clock, we can still make it.

633
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,200
Let's go to get card now.

634
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,240
Are you numb.

635
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:26,825
Speak.

636
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,240
Alright.

637
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,516
Go.

638
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,440
Go.

639
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:42,775
Let's talk to your director.

640
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,800
You said you come to apologize to me?

641
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,540
Wu Di.

642
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:10,200
We haven't had the food.

643
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,666
What are you doing?

644
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,591
Enough, Xiao Yuansong.

645
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:13,600
That ends here.

646
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,125
Don't waste your time.

647
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,467
It's a technique of dislocation.

648
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:22,300
You seem to be kissing.

649
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,450
But actually you didn't.

650
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,516
Wu Di, you are a professional agent.

651
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,925
And it is a nice trick.

652
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,650
Didi, Didi.

653
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:35,541
Listen to me.

654
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:36,859
What do you have to say for yourself?

655
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,590
Do you

656
00:40:40,225 --> 00:40:41,850
want to see me

657
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,725
die in pain like this.

658
00:41:03,225 --> 00:41:04,525
You bastard.

659
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,075
How can you torture me like this.

660
00:41:08,225 --> 00:41:11,150
Why are you so cruel
