=Episode 20=

3
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,090
Honey.

4
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:45,629
Who's that?

5
00:01:46,545 --> 00:01:47,385
A friend.

6
00:02:11,117 --> 00:02:12,320
Hello, Mr. Wu.

7
00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:13,687
This is Zhou Shiyun.

8
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:17,656
Yes, my brother had dinner with you.

9
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,880
I want to talk to you
about some of your projects.

10
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:23,559
Okay, see you.

11
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:37,793
Long time no see, Mr. Li.

12
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,110
For the spokesman project
you mentioned before,

13
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,300
we can discuss it.

14
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,940
Me...

15
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,920
I'm Wu Di, the celebrity
agent of Su Jinbei.

16
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:48,368
What?

17
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:49,285
Signed it.

18
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:51,404
Can you...

19
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:53,273
Hello.

20
00:02:53,763 --> 00:02:54,603
Hello.

21
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:00,532
Painful.

22
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:01,413
What's the matter?

23
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:04,031
Painful.

24
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:07,790
Let me give you rub.

25
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,475
How is it?

26
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:14,997
It's comfortable.

27
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:18,810
You just give me a message every day
for two hours from now on.

28
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,255
Two hours.

29
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,509
Is it necessary?

30
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,730
We have money,

31
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:27,246
we can hire professionals
I think you are professional.

32
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:29,480
Here.

33
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:30,952
Harder.

34
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:38,995
Too hard
I said I'm not professional.

35
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:40,061
You mean it.

36
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:41,841
No.

37
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:43,780
-Yes.
-How can I?

38
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,034
Yingying, I made soup.

39
00:03:58,075 --> 00:03:59,100
Do you want some?

40
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:00,775
No.

41
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:15,234
The popular actor Xu Jiawei
exposed a lot in a live video.

42
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:18,589
Because of the video,
he was affected greatly.

43
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:22,217
The personality his company
shaped for him collapsed.

44
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,525
Jiawei.

45
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:25,435
Are you okay?

46
00:04:46,739 --> 00:04:47,580
Do you like that?

47
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,371
I like it very much, thank you.

48
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,440
Fool.

49
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:51,840
You are so happy for a balloon.

50
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,300
It's a present from you.

51
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:04,650
You're right.

52
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,275
You will be shut out by all media.

53
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:10,937
You have to take the consequence.

54
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:13,396
You're not a child,

55
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,500
you should know this.

56
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:04,800
The traditional logic is
expressed by natural language

57
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:08,150
while the modern logic
uses symbols as its major carrier.

58
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,575
So we call the modern logic
symbolic logic.

59
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:28,742
I knew that you wouldn't listen to it.

60
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:30,594
You are afraid of losing.

61
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:33,360
I am not afraid of losing.

62
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,475
Well, in three minutes,
if you don't fall asleep, I lose, okay?

63
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:50,175
Yingying.

64
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:03,560
Give up.

65
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:05,802
You're not my opponent.

66
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,725
Impossible, my Wuxiang magic skill
is on the ninth level.

67
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,712
It must have a result today.

68
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:34,265
Xiaoyu'er.

69
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:36,992
Xiaoyu'er.

70
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:38,673
Xiaoyu'er.

71
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:42,155
Actually.

72
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:45,040
I don't want to fight with you.

73
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:47,916
I just want to.

74
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,962
I want to see your face.

75
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:05,024
Don't be afraid.

76
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:07,911
I'll pass my strength of 500 years to you.

77
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,425
I want you to live.

78
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:10,365
It wouldn't help.

79
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:12,274
Why?

80
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:17,107
I will be shut out by all media.

81
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:21,606
I don't want to live.

82
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:26,681
Jiawei.

83
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:31,684
Wake up, Jiawei.

84
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:32,565
Jiawei.

85
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:38,981
No, I have to save Jiawei.

86
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:50,240
Please.

87
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,000
No problem.

88
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,332
Okay.

89
00:08:58,693 --> 00:08:59,533
Where are you going?

90
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:01,126
To my hometown.

91
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,560
For what?

92
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:04,149
It is an emergency.
Don't mind me, brother.

93
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:05,234
I've ordered a car.

94
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:06,515
Be careful.

95
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:08,585
Text me when you're at home.

96
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,465
I know.

97
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,740
This kid.

98
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:16,916
Sorry.

99
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:18,662
Go on.

100
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,475
You went to the book store with Dr. Zhou.

101
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,540
How can you be spotted
by a reader passing by.

102
00:09:25,284 --> 00:09:26,964
I really don't know.

103
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:29,605
I remembered there was no one there.

104
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:32,881
It's okay, Mr. Wang.

105
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:35,560
Everyone is blessing them.

106
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,961
Don't worry.

107
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:37,876
Don't worry.

108
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:40,796
Did you see the reviews?

109
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:41,998
Yes.

110
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:44,916
I'll read it for you.

111
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:45,797
Listen.

112
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:48,240
What a happy couple.

113
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,925
I believe in love again.

114
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,949
Beibei must be happy.

115
00:09:54,663 --> 00:09:55,947
They are all positive.

116
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:56,851
And this.

117
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:58,440
I've watched the plays of
Beibei since I was young.

118
00:09:58,676 --> 00:09:59,761
Now she's engaged,

119
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:02,527
I suddenly realized
that I'm no longer young.

120
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,590
See.

121
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,125
No longer young.

122
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,223
What's that?

123
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,025
This is a very dangerous signal.

124
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:12,811
Jinbei.

125
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:15,468
You centered at youth operas.

126
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,250
Now you are a mature woman to the public.

127
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:23,499
You will have less and less opportunities.

128
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:26,143
Be careful.

129
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:29,329
Okay, I know.

130
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:38,870
According to all,

131
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:41,744
the suspense detective drama The Pursuer
booted today.

132
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:46,080
The leading actress is the popular
young actress Gao Zitong.

133
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,320
Gao Zitong started her career
from the women's League.

134
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:49,496
Her comprehensive quality is strong.

135
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:51,059
In the popular love
developing variety show.

136
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,210
Heartbeats,

137
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,828
she attracted many fans.

138
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,225
Now Gao Zitong...

139
00:10:58,111 --> 00:10:58,986
It's okay, Beibei.

140
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,450
We have other projects.

141
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:02,591
Don't worry.

142
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:08,640
This is the script, Zitong.

143
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:19,320
Something's wrong.

144
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:20,666
Come here.

145
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:22,441
-What's wrong? Let's see.
-Okay.

146
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:23,321
Come on.

147
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:28,767
Zitong.

148
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,130
Sorry,

149
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:31,866
please wait for a while.

150
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:34,064
What's the matter?
What's wrong, Producer Jiang?

151
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:34,945
Don't mention it.

152
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:37,784
Zheng Ying got hurt in
the movement shooting at Group B.

153
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:38,725
She's sent to the hospital.

154
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:40,487
Is it serious?

155
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:42,712
Can she continue the shooting?

156
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:43,889
Probably not.

157
00:11:45,764 --> 00:11:47,864
Talk to you later
I have to contact another actress.

158
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:48,745
Hold on.

159
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,415
Producer Jiang.

160
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:52,704
I've got a good person.

161
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:55,386
Look at the camera.

162
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:56,800
Left.

163
00:11:57,338 --> 00:11:58,488
Right.

164
00:11:59,066 --> 00:11:59,991
Nod.

165
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:02,476
Okay.

166
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,840
What's the matter?

167
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,468
I put your face recognition
in my phone,

168
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:09,560
you can use my phone
whenever you want.

169
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:11,243
Give me yours.

170
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:20,735
Put mine in,

171
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:25,328
so we can see each other's phones.

172
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,344
There's will be no secrets.

173
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,950
Okay.

174
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,574
Why should I see your phone.

175
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:37,371
I won't see yours
I just think in this way,

176
00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:40,575
we would be one person
with no barriers.

177
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:42,227
Whatever.

178
00:12:53,003 --> 00:12:54,103
Hi, Didi.

179
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,929
Do you know who just called me?

180
00:12:57,425 --> 00:12:58,265
Who's that?

181
00:12:58,479 --> 00:12:59,319
Jiang Tao.

182
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,781
The producer of The pursuer.

183
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,957
Why did he call.

184
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:08,810
He said
the supporting actress had an accident.

185
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:10,259
He wanted you to fill in.

186
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,500
I got angry and scolded him then refused.

187
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:17,669
Gently.

188
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,240
Gently.

189
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:25,170
Why did you refuse?

190
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:26,098
Have a try!

191
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:27,432
Serious? Su Jinbei.

192
00:13:27,953 --> 00:13:29,153
What a shame.

193
00:13:29,902 --> 00:13:32,152
You can only play the supporting actress.

194
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:35,197
You are Su Jinbei.

195
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,135
Isn't it hard to shoot plays lately?

196
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:40,059
A few days ago you and Wang told me this.

197
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,510
You forget?

198
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,320
No.
It's two different things.

199
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:47,200
You can't lose your dignity, can you?

200
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:49,000
And who's the leading actress.

201
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,341
Gao Zitong.

202
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,771
We don't have to please her.

203
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,450
Gao Zitong.

204
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,650
I think it's okay.

205
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,400
Gently.

206
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,934
What are you doing, Wu Di?

207
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,550
Can you stop calling me
in times of this.

208
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,490
You.

209
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:15,799
Do you feel shame.

210
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:18,184
What are you thinking?

211
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,653
I'm having a message.
Xiao's doing message on me.

212
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:21,534
Say something.

213
00:14:21,575 --> 00:14:22,575
Hey, superstar.

214
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:25,089
This is Xiao Yuansong.

215
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,489
I'm giving her a massage.

216
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:30,203
Are you sure?

217
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,050
You're not bullying her?

218
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:36,111
You...

219
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:37,764
What's wrong with you?

220
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:38,755
Is Dr. Zhou here?

221
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,635
Dr. Zhou.

222
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:41,357
Yes.

223
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:44,149
Look at your Jinbei.

224
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:46,119
Her mind is full of nonsense.

225
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:50,184
Let's get to the point.

226
00:14:50,225 --> 00:14:52,950
Are you sure you want this role?

227
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,750
Nothing I can't accept.

228
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,775
What do you say, honey?

229
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,275
It's not bad.

230
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:04,200
Then please discuss this for me, Didi.

231
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,934
Okay, I'll handle this.

232
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:08,304
Bye.

233
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:09,185
Bye.

234
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:14,403
I finally have to work.

235
00:15:14,843 --> 00:15:15,760
I'll work hard.

236
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:19,137
Come on!

237
00:15:49,218 --> 00:15:51,043
Hello, I'm Wuque.

238
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,459
I'm back.

239
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:54,470
Master.

240
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,049
Now you're finally here
for live streaming on Shuabao.

241
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,833
You are great.

242
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:03,292
I've decided.

243
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:05,134
You can sign the contract anytime.

244
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:06,015
Great.

245
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,850
Money will be transferred
to your account on time.

246
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:37,767
Mr. Shui.

247
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:40,680
Jiawei, where are you?

248
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,125
At home, what's wrong?

249
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:45,322
Nothing.

250
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,466
About the termination of contract.

251
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,215
I want to talk to you.

252
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:53,456
Termination of contract.

253
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:09,739
Jiawei.

254
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,875
What's your plan?

255
00:17:13,507 --> 00:17:14,757
I haven't made up my mind.

256
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:18,707
I may take some rest
and concentrate on my music.

257
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:20,600
It's good to pursue your dream.

258
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:22,653
Jiawei.

259
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:25,781
Although there's some setbacks,

260
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:29,452
you can get through this
with your ability.

261
00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:30,400
I trust you.

262
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:32,908
Anyway.

263
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,600
We've been working together for so long,

264
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,955
I wish you can go further.

265
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:40,355
Thank you.

266
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:43,711
By the way,

267
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:45,342
the person...

268
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:49,425
that paid the liquidated damages for me
doesn't want to see me?

269
00:17:50,354 --> 00:17:51,504
What's his name.

270
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:55,087
He didn't say.

271
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:57,840
He said he's Wuque.

272
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,790
Wuque.

273
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,200
Jiawei.

274
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:25,287
Mr. Shui, I want to ask
when did you meet him yesterday.

275
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:27,352
Yesterday afternoon.

276
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:30,689
Specific time?

277
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:33,851
About 3:00.

278
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:42,696
Stop, that's her.

279
00:18:51,835 --> 00:18:53,474
Aren't you cold in so little clothes?

280
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:55,161
No, I wear more than you.

281
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,041
Producer Jiang.

282
00:18:57,251 --> 00:18:59,350
-Producer Jiang, hello.
-Producer Jiang.

283
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:00,527
Zitong.

284
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,770
Producer Jiang.

285
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,520
-How do you feel?
-It's good.

286
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,034
-You've been working hard lately.
-What a snob.

287
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:08,025
They are all like this.

288
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:11,462
I need to take this call.

289
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:12,343
You go busy.

290
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:13,553
Hello.

291
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:15,755
Don't worry about being annoying.

292
00:19:17,802 --> 00:19:19,927
Tell Su Jinbei I need to
read the script with her.

293
00:19:20,091 --> 00:19:20,931
Go.

294
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:24,957
Jinbei.

295
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,115
Zitong wants to read the script with you.

296
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:29,255
Okay.
Give me the script...

297
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:30,771
I've drawn out the lines for you.

298
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,375
Beibei, I'll leave for a while.

299
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,680
You go busy.
I am busy now.

300
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:38,381
Be careful.

301
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:39,262
Don't worry.

302
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:53,569
Zitong, Jinbei is here.

303
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:56,734
I had a cold.

304
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:57,811
It's pretty bad.

305
00:19:58,717 --> 00:19:59,830
I'm afraid I would infect you.

306
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,938
You just stand outside the door.

307
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,150
Okay.

308
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,740
I improved the script.

309
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:06,066
You read it first.

310
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:07,799
Okay.

311
00:20:19,246 --> 00:20:20,446
You also have today.

312
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:24,157
Enjoy the pain I used to endure.

313
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:26,891
It's so cold.

314
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,329
I said don't come in.

315
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,853
It doesn't matter.
I'm not afraid of being infected by you.

316
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,530
But I don't like you.

317
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:36,985
What?

318
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,125
Su Jinbei, who are you?

319
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,475
Because you're lucky?

320
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:44,823
Everyone has to circle around you.

321
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:46,039
Everyone has to sacrifice for you.

322
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:48,229
Who do you think you are?

323
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:50,527
Have you ever suffered for work?

324
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:53,160
Will work hard on shooting
and dedicate all to work like me?

325
00:20:53,596 --> 00:20:55,059
Why can you succeed?

326
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,275
You're a pest.

327
00:20:58,033 --> 00:20:58,873
You...

328
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,559
Because of Xu Jiawei?

329
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,975
I had nothing with him, really.

330
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:08,176
I know.

331
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:11,184
Even if there's nothing between you,

332
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:14,092
he's willing to sacrifice
everything for you.

333
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:17,876
And I, who's willing to
sacrifice everything for him...

334
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:21,080
became a clown in front of you.

335
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:23,083
Get out.

336
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:24,296
Get out.

337
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,520
Get the hell out of here.

338
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:46,371
Why is Zitong still not here?

339
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:48,787
We've been waiting for two hours.

340
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,895
Miss Gao is here.

341
00:21:54,566 --> 00:21:56,018
Miss Gao. Zitong.

342
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:56,948
Director Zhao.

343
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,582
I improved the script.

344
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,985
Miss Gao.

345
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:08,175
You are enemies for life
and she is the ultimate villain.

346
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,045
First time you meet,

347
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:14,275
she was beaten to death by you
and she can't fight back.

348
00:22:14,937 --> 00:22:16,412
That doesn't make sense, right?

349
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:18,151
I think it's okay.

350
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,485
I'm the female detective,
representing justice.

351
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:24,966
I'm rubbing the evil under my feet.

352
00:22:25,425 --> 00:22:27,100
Isn't it fun to watch?

353
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,020
From the perspective of drama,

354
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:30,411
it's fun.

355
00:22:31,122 --> 00:22:33,414
But it's your fist meeting.

356
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:34,359
First,

357
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,250
I can't continue the rest.

358
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:37,391
Find a script writer.

359
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:40,920
I can find one for you if you can't.

360
00:22:43,372 --> 00:22:45,023
Easy! Easy!

361
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:47,289
Director, Gao Zitong is so popular now.

362
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,450
Even the investor wants her in this.

363
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:51,751
Please endure it.

364
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:53,696
-It's just a scene.
-No.

365
00:22:53,736 --> 00:22:56,361
You have to make sure
Su Jinbei is willing to act.

366
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:57,241
It's okay, director.

367
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:00,835
I'll do it.

368
00:23:23,116 --> 00:23:23,956
Stop!

369
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:29,710
It's you.

370
00:23:33,306 --> 00:23:34,256
How did you know?

371
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,175
See how I tidy up you!

372
00:23:58,606 --> 00:23:59,446
Stop.

373
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:03,480
Who said that?

374
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:20,839
Brother.

375
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,720
So handsome.

376
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:24,664
Who are you?

377
00:24:24,705 --> 00:24:25,787
Why are you interrupting here?

378
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:30,339
He knows Jinbei?

379
00:24:31,441 --> 00:24:32,660
Are you okay, sister-in-law?

380
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:33,776
What are you doing here, brother?

381
00:24:34,115 --> 00:24:35,400
Let me introduce to you.

382
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,991
This is Mr. Zhou of Haohan Group,

383
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,430
the investor of The Pursuer.

384
00:24:42,174 --> 00:24:43,318
Let's give him a round of applause.

385
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:44,521
Investor.

386
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:46,725
He is the secret boss.

387
00:24:47,675 --> 00:24:48,515
Right.

388
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:50,794
It's said that filming is
only a small part of business...

389
00:24:50,835 --> 00:24:51,675
of the Haohan Group.

390
00:24:51,971 --> 00:24:53,171
He seldom takes this up personally.

391
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:55,112
I don't know why he came here in person.

392
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:56,960
Something's happening.

393
00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:58,634
Guys.

394
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:02,709
The Haohan Group will support
the project as usual...

395
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:04,850
and I will invest more...

396
00:25:05,513 --> 00:25:08,588
to make The Pursuer into a fine art.

397
00:25:09,702 --> 00:25:10,687
Great.

398
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:12,853
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

399
00:25:13,118 --> 00:25:15,818
There's no need to thank me
because it has nothing to do with you.

400
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,262
I hereby announce that...

401
00:25:18,303 --> 00:25:23,375
Gao Zitong is cancelled
because she is not qualified.

402
00:25:24,157 --> 00:25:25,307
Effective immediately.

403
00:25:25,871 --> 00:25:28,081
Why do you say I'm not qualified?

404
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:29,377
You don't have the moral integrity of art.

405
00:25:30,025 --> 00:25:31,142
Funny.

406
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:32,408
Moral integrity of art.

407
00:25:32,812 --> 00:25:33,840
Don't be sarcastic here.

408
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,275
You just want me to leave.

409
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:37,989
Okay.

410
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:40,434
But you have to pay me liquidated damages.

411
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,875
No problem.

412
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:44,280
But now,

413
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:46,240
please leave.

414
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:48,938
Okay.

415
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:51,112
I don't even like this senseless play.

416
00:25:51,757 --> 00:25:53,124
There are other people out there
begging to get me.

417
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,450
Su Jinbei.

418
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,120
Let's wait and see.

419
00:26:00,555 --> 00:26:01,395
Zitong.

420
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,593
Finally.

421
00:26:08,324 --> 00:26:09,164
Jinbei.

422
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,840
What else help do you need?

423
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:12,836
No.

424
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,835
Bu brother,

425
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,150
is it unfair for Gao Zitong to fire her.

426
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:20,930
Jinbei, you are too kind.

427
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:22,934
Did you know...

428
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:25,479
a bunch of things of yours
were made up by her.

429
00:26:27,025 --> 00:26:27,975
What?

430
00:26:28,725 --> 00:26:30,675
She recommended you
as the supporting actress,

431
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,248
so that she can humiliate you here,

432
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:34,952
and the video that...

433
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,325
caused misunderstandings between
you and Shiyun was also sent by her.

434
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,162
Even the earlier news
saying that you hit her...

435
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:43,640
was created by her.

436
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,875
There is such a thing?

437
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,600
The world is not as simple as you think.

438
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:53,478
Some people is afraid of the light.

439
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,268
They can only hide
in the darkness quietly.

440
00:26:58,042 --> 00:26:58,942
But brother,

441
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,001
how do you know this?

442
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:02,591
Why did you investigate this?

443
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:05,320
I didn't investigate.

444
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,000
I did nothing.

445
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,960
I was just listening to the arrangement
and showed up here.

446
00:27:12,362 --> 00:27:13,252
Then...

447
00:27:14,293 --> 00:27:15,133
Who?

448
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,599
Okay, I have some business to do.

449
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,560
Let's have dinner together some other day.

450
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,480
Okay.

451
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:54,240
Thank you so much for everything.

452
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:00,320
It's my duty.

453
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,000
Are you busy, Mr. Shui?

454
00:29:11,243 --> 00:29:14,040
I'm free lately.

455
00:29:14,524 --> 00:29:16,960
Can you give me more projects?

456
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:18,960
I can't take care of your projects now.

457
00:29:20,686 --> 00:29:22,261
Why did you say this?

458
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:25,298
Did I do something wrong?

459
00:29:31,254 --> 00:29:32,440
You did it yourself.

460
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:36,584
How dare Zhao...

461
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:39,550
said that I changed the script
lost my temper and disrespected them.

462
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,600
Nonsense.

463
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,945
Is it?

464
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,802
You bad name is spreading.

465
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:47,840
Do you know?

466
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:51,942
No director
wants to cooperate with you.

467
00:29:59,123 --> 00:30:00,400
How could this be?

468
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,680
From now on,

469
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,360
I can't help you anymore.

470
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
I'm sorry.

471
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:49,011
Is Wuque online today?

472
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,146
No.

473
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:58,120
Prepare to destroy the tower.

474
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,480
Have you seen the live broadcast of Wuque?

475
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:04,951
Your tactics are very much like his.

476
00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:07,807
I've seen the skills.

477
00:31:07,848 --> 00:31:10,448
The skills are almost the same.

478
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,600
Follow me, quick.

479
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:20,993
What's going on?
Do you feel uncomfortable?

480
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,950
I didn't have a good rest.
I can't sleep at night.

481
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:25,408
What's wrong?

482
00:31:26,922 --> 00:31:27,920
I can't forget something.

483
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:30,379
I really miss the days
in after-school classes...

484
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:32,440
I could sleep tight when
the teacher began his class.

485
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,193
The traditional logic is
expressed by natural language.

486
00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:41,909
My friend gave me
a music with good hypnotic effect.

487
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:44,462
The moment I hear it I can fall asleep.

488
00:31:44,682 --> 00:31:46,040
I don't believe this.

489
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:48,135
Okay, you can listen to it yourself.

490
00:31:48,176 --> 00:31:49,326
If you don't feel sleepy, I lose.

491
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:53,337
How did Yingying know
the conversation between me and Wuque.

492
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,377
Did she...?

493
00:31:58,198 --> 00:31:59,038
Hello.

494
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,027
You found the license plate?

495
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,662
Wuque.

496
00:32:47,947 --> 00:32:48,797
Su Jinbei.

497
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,169
You don't let me live.

498
00:32:52,217 --> 00:32:53,517
So won't I.

499
00:32:53,823 --> 00:32:55,221
I hereby announce that...

500
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:59,700
Gao Zitong is cancelled because
she is not qualified for her job.

501
00:33:00,236 --> 00:33:01,261
Effective immediately.

502
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:02,384
No.

503
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:03,920
Why do you say I'm not qualified?

504
00:33:04,354 --> 00:33:05,684
You don't have the moral integrity of art.

505
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:08,100
Su Jinbei.

506
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:09,760
Let's wait and see.

507
00:33:12,143 --> 00:33:12,983
Zitong.

508
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:20,675
The more you treat me like this
the harder I want to succeed.

509
00:33:21,037 --> 00:33:22,012
I will never give up.

510
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:30,788
Zitong.

511
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:32,729
Director Zhang is in
the office of Mr. Shui.

512
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:34,109
Which Director Zhang?

513
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:36,562
The famous Director Zhang.

514
00:33:36,603 --> 00:33:38,484
And it seems that he has a project
and wanted to cooperate with us.

515
00:33:38,525 --> 00:33:39,365
So...

516
00:33:40,257 --> 00:33:41,145
Zitong.

517
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:54,267
Mr. Zhang, I'm Gao Zitong.

518
00:33:54,514 --> 00:33:56,239
I've seen your movies since childhood.

519
00:33:58,186 --> 00:33:59,240
No... No.

520
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:01,400
Director Zhang.

521
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:02,853
Nice to see you.

522
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,125
I like your Flying Clouds best
and Red Bean.

523
00:34:07,155 --> 00:34:08,791
I want to recommend myself...

524
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:10,457
to be the leading
actress of your next movie.

525
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:21,368
You can do this, Gao Zitong, come on.

526
00:34:22,283 --> 00:34:23,141
Director Zhang.

527
00:34:23,182 --> 00:34:26,309
This is our favorite
young actor Ouyang Minghao.

528
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,190
Director Zhang.

529
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:28,419
Nice to meet you.

530
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:31,503
Let him act with Su Jinbei.

531
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,154
With your guidance,

532
00:34:33,195 --> 00:34:34,620
this project will be a success.

533
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:37,320
I agree.

534
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:38,881
Zitong.

535
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:41,386
What?

536
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,469
What's the matter?

537
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:49,253
Zitong.

538
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:20,031
Zitong.

539
00:35:20,072 --> 00:35:21,056
Zitong, open the door.

540
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:22,172
I need to talk to you.

541
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:30,135
Zitong.

542
00:35:30,556 --> 00:35:31,396
Zitong.

543
00:35:32,974 --> 00:35:34,024
I need to talk to you.

544
00:35:41,585 --> 00:35:42,425
Zitong.

545
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:43,931
My house is this simple.

546
00:35:44,651 --> 00:35:45,601
Laugh if you want.

547
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:46,920
I don't care.

548
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,600
These are the promises
you made for yourself.

549
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:04,684
So what?

550
00:36:05,802 --> 00:36:06,977
Because of you,

551
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,264
now I can't even be an actress.

552
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:11,040
Why do I care about this?

553
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,090
Zitong.

554
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:15,729
Let's talk.

555
00:36:16,404 --> 00:36:17,244
I don't need it.

556
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:22,109
But I need an explanation.

557
00:36:22,797 --> 00:36:24,200
Why a person I take as my friend...

558
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:27,056
would do
such surprising things behind my back.

559
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,251
She has her respectful dream,

560
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:33,217
but why did she waste
her time in hurting me.

561
00:36:34,344 --> 00:36:35,184
Why?

562
00:36:35,331 --> 00:36:37,209
You hide so many things in your heart,

563
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:40,200
but you solve problems
in such a way that hurt us both.

564
00:36:43,521 --> 00:36:45,046
You see me as your friend,

565
00:36:48,566 --> 00:36:49,941
I thought you were pretending.

566
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:52,040
Why would I?

567
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:57,088
Yep.

568
00:36:58,654 --> 00:37:00,080
You seemed to have everything.

569
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,500
You don't have to win others' respect
with fake emotions.

570
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:09,225
You can win your love
without sacrifice.

571
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:12,030
How can you feel...

572
00:37:12,071 --> 00:37:13,821
the pain of wanting
something but can't have it.

573
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:22,327
See,

574
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:25,800
how close we used to be.

575
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
We laughed so happily.

576
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:35,415
Do you know why...

577
00:37:35,456 --> 00:37:37,120
even when I'm successful
in front of everyone,

578
00:37:37,644 --> 00:37:41,600
I still choose
to live in this simple house.

579
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,881
Because I have to save money.

580
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,875
I have to pinch and scrape.

581
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,925
Me and Jiawei all came
back from abroad training.

582
00:37:57,448 --> 00:38:00,440
We need a lot of money
to plan our future.

583
00:38:01,536 --> 00:38:02,376
Ridiculous?

584
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,395
You've taken up all his heart...

585
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:11,675
and I'm still planning our future
as a one-sided wish.

586
00:38:15,645 --> 00:38:18,470
I think every tear for him
is mocking me.

587
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:21,036
Even the air I'm breathing is mocking me.

588
00:38:26,163 --> 00:38:27,480
Why did I treat you like that?

589
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:30,118
Because you are rich in love.

590
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,415
Everyone loves you...

591
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,164
and I own nothing
I don't want to take these alone.

592
00:38:36,205 --> 00:38:37,980
I want you to join me.

593
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:39,519
Is this reason good enough for you?
