3
00:01:36,707 --> 00:01:39,234
You are so happy for a balloon.

4
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:41,475
It's a present from you.

5
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,351
Yingying.

6
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,550
I still feel that the present
is too simple.

7
00:02:33,307 --> 00:02:34,607
Then, Jiawei.

8
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:37,634
Can you help me realize a small wish?

9
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:39,978
No problem.

10
00:02:43,612 --> 00:02:47,087
I want to take a picture with you.

11
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:49,037
It's okay.

12
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:50,178
No problem.

13
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:52,026
Come here.

14
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,054
One, Two, Three.

15
00:03:30,248 --> 00:03:31,088
You are back.

16
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,140
Brother.

17
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:40,856
You are still up?

18
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:43,582
I'm not sleepy.

19
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:47,437
Your job as an assistance.

20
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,485
Is it busy?

21
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:51,961
As I thought...

22
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:53,652
It's special today.

23
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,850
By the way.

24
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,584
After I left,

25
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,200
did my eldest brother say something?

26
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,280
He didn't.

27
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,300
But...

28
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,564
How long are you going to play?

29
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,125
You think I'm just
playing around with him?

30
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:20,869
Otherwise.

31
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
I have my plan.

32
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,250
Think about your future.

33
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:38,425
Don't get in too deep.

34
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,758
The master's online, let's do it.

35
00:05:08,698 --> 00:05:11,698
Little fish, can I ask you
a question first?

36
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:15,650
What?

37
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:25,529
If someone you trust deceived you,

38
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,170
what would you do?

39
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:36,078
I won't forgive him.

40
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:41,864
What if it's a white lie.

41
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:46,214
That depends who it is.

42
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,953
The emerald earrings are passed
on from generation to generation...

43
00:06:15,994 --> 00:06:17,662
by Zhou's daughter-in-laws.

44
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:20,184
Grandma gave it to my mother,

45
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:21,896
now it's given to you.

46
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:24,187
I see, my second brother
must see you as his Ms. Right.

47
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:28,385
Then I'll send him a present.

48
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:38,786
Mr. Zhou.

49
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,200
There is a gift at your door,
please check it.

50
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,200
Surprise!

51
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:54,979
The present is you?

52
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:57,745
What? You don't like it?

53
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,005
Why did you get up so early?

54
00:08:08,245 --> 00:08:10,570
My honey gave me something important.

55
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:12,337
I want to give you a present as well.

56
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:22,787
One moment.

57
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,709
There is one for you.

58
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,605
I'll take your present.

59
00:08:56,962 --> 00:09:00,337
This one was given by my mother
when I was young.

60
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,075
Yours.

61
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:11,836
My mother asked for it from the temple.

62
00:09:11,877 --> 00:09:13,102
They are a pair.

63
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,025
Why didn't my mother tell me.

64
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,044
Honey.

65
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,950
It means that we've been connected
to each other a long time ago.

66
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:38,068
What a world?

67
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:27,637
Did you eat?

68
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,540
Hold on.

69
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,253
Recently, in a popular
love developing variety show.

70
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:48,513
Heartbeats.

71
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:51,995
Gao Zitong received the affection
of many male participants...

72
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:54,109
because of her cheerful
and challenging personality.

73
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,259
During the interview, Gao Zitong said,

74
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,350
no matter in life or in the show,

75
00:10:58,553 --> 00:11:01,353
she always took work
and love life seriously.

76
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:04,481
She hoped that her contribution
could be rewarded.

77
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:05,696
Gao Zitong really works hard.

78
00:11:06,235 --> 00:11:07,441
With these efforts,

79
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:09,016
she could definitely
expect the same in return.

80
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:23,150
Thank you.

81
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,040
Thank you.

82
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:31,120
You sure you want to ride on this?

83
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,182
Yes, I am.

84
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:34,384
If you want to drive,

85
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:36,040
you can take my car.

86
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,000
That's different.

87
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,920
What's different?

88
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,920
You might see me like this now,

89
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:47,425
but I grew up in a very traditional
and doctrinal environment.

90
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:51,601
Whatever I do,

91
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:53,541
I have to follow my parents' rules.

92
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,321
I loved these trains when I was young,

93
00:11:57,361 --> 00:11:59,311
but my parents only
allowed me to play once.

94
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,875
It's disappointing,

95
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,525
so I was always dragging
home while crying.

96
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:10,118
You haven't told me
much about stories of your childhood.

97
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:11,426
You like it?

98
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
I...

99
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,795
I can tell you when I have time.

100
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,528
Show me the tickets.

101
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:23,440
-It's our turn.
-Give me the ticket.

102
00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:26,072
Who will take the train?

103
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:28,193
He.

104
00:12:29,154 --> 00:12:30,459
Are you serious?

105
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,784
It's a mini-train for children.

106
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:33,485
We really want to.

107
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:34,604
I want to take this.

108
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:35,559
Yes, yes.

109
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,634
If you want to play,

110
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:38,260
you can try the Ferris wheel
and pirate ship over there.

111
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,562
Go.

112
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:41,841
No.
We are here for this today.

113
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:44,850
But we have a rule
that adults can't play this.

114
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,205
Sorry.

115
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,590
It's okay.

116
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:48,759
Let's go.

117
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,875
I'm sorry.

118
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,550
No, you came here for this.

119
00:12:58,703 --> 00:12:59,703
Hello, mom.

120
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:01,002
Beibei.

121
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:03,394
How are you doing with Shiyun?

122
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:05,199
It's good, what's up?

123
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:07,087
Nothing, I'm just asking.

124
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:11,400
Shiyun is really considerate.

125
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,470
After he came back from the mountain area,

126
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:16,925
he went here
to apologize to me and your father.

127
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,784
He explained a lot.

128
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:19,950
I see.

129
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,008
Mom.

130
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:25,453
Do you remember
the peace talisman you gave me?

131
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,700
Why did Shiyun have one as well.

132
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,375
Peace talisman.

133
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,525
I almost forget.

134
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:36,497
That's right.

135
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:40,988
Why haven't I heard you...

136
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,910
mention a lot about Shiyun's mother.

137
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:46,521
I have mentioned her.

138
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:51,450
Because you didn't
care about this marriage at first...

139
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:52,937
and you forget.

140
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,400
It's all my fault.

141
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:57,059
Tell me about it.

142
00:13:57,776 --> 00:14:00,834
We've been good friends since childhood.

143
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,375
You know this.

144
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:06,329
We grew up in the same Lane.

145
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:09,065
Then she married to another city,

146
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:11,181
so we seldom met afterwards.

147
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,034
After she had Shiyun,

148
00:14:14,075 --> 00:14:16,350
she went back to our home town once.

149
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,075
You were young.

150
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:19,509
You don't know.

151
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,200
His mother saw you are a little girl.

152
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,834
She liked you very very much.

153
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,925
So we decided a child betrothal
for you two kids.

154
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:32,122
Really?

155
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,788
I have no recollection of that.

156
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:38,850
Because Shiyun's mother died young.

157
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:43,125
Shiyun is a poor kid.

158
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:47,309
If his mother could see this in heaven...

159
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,904
and knew that his son was so excellent...

160
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:52,870
and was so happy and sweet
with my daughter,

161
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:54,661
she would be really happy.

162
00:14:57,954 --> 00:14:59,404
Yes, she would.

163
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:00,822
Of course.

164
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,058
-Will you?
-Yes.

165
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:07,555
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

166
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:11,319
Watch out.

167
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:12,771
Watch out!

168
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,190
Slow down.

169
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,925
Quick reaction.

170
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:20,850
I got it from escaping from
the reporters with Beibei.

171
00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:22,478
You have to grasp these
when escaping from reporters?

172
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:23,358
Of course.

173
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,475
Hurry... Hurry.

174
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:26,109
You have to come as well.

175
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,325
I'm going to have to pass.

176
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,459
No.

177
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,340
Go! Go! Go!

178
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,434
I'll turn on the electricity switch first.

179
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:33,315
Okay, okay, okay.

180
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:38,259
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

181
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,140
Watch out!

182
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:40,021
Close the door.

183
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:44,265
Good.

184
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,590
Let's go.

185
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:46,665
Let's go.

186
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:49,115
Here we go.

187
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,855
Let's go.

188
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:28,134
-It's funny, right?
-Yes.

189
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:29,015
Cool!

190
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,834
Funny.

191
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:31,798
What are you doing?

192
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:33,920
-Let's go.
-Hurry up!

193
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:38,550
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!
Quick.

194
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:39,801
Go! Go! Go!
Hurry up!

195
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:40,681
Stop!

196
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:52,633
Exciting?

197
00:17:57,538 --> 00:17:58,378
Hey.

198
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,460
Dr. Zhou.

199
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,275
The director wants you
to take Dr. Xiao's shift.

200
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:03,722
Okay, coming.

201
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:06,456
What happened to Dr. Xiao?

202
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,225
I've never seen him since I came back.

203
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:11,120
Dr. Xiao asked for leave, don't you know?

204
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,140
I see.

205
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:51,065
Ms. Su.

206
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:52,356
You don't look good.

207
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,050
Do you need some rest?

208
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:56,229
Thank you.

209
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:05,253
Please hand me my phone.

210
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,921
I had my period. It hurts.

211
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:14,841
Okay.

212
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:15,931
Thank you, Doctor.

213
00:19:16,475 --> 00:19:18,675
Please wait outside.

214
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:19,941
I'll give you the case in a moment.

215
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:31,315
Isn't Wu Di here with you?

216
00:19:39,236 --> 00:19:41,811
No, I can't get in touch with her.

217
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:54,243
It's weird, where are the two people?

218
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,275
I'll go pick you up after work.

219
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,940
Fine.

220
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:08,681
Okay, Dr. Zhou

221
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:09,561
I'm off work.

222
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:25,410
Okay, cut.

223
00:20:25,713 --> 00:20:27,729
Everyone!
We are now coming to a wrap!

224
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,195
Thank you for your efforts, director.

225
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:31,400
-Thank you, director.
-Ms. Su.

226
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,490
You've done good.

227
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,156
You finished shooting
when you don't feel well.

228
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,409
It's my duty. Thank you all.

229
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,925
-You are welcome.
-Thank you, thank you.

230
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:39,748
Okay, just put them there.

231
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:40,914
Thank you all.

232
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,600
-Don't forget your things.
-Okay.

233
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,820
You are really here.

234
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:46,618
Um, I brought you brown sugar ginger tea.

235
00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:48,581
That's very kind of you.

236
00:20:49,742 --> 00:20:50,992
Why do you wear so little?

237
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:53,408
You have to keep warm.

238
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:56,400
I need to work.

239
00:20:59,075 --> 00:20:59,915
Come here.

240
00:21:02,075 --> 00:21:02,915
Arm.

241
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:22,921
Come on, it's warm in the car.

242
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,620
Where's Wu Di?

243
00:21:30,168 --> 00:21:31,384
I need to,

244
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:33,525
I've never seen her since I came back.

245
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,325
It's weird.

246
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,625
Xiao didn't come for work these days.

247
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:40,150
What a coincidence.

248
00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:43,580
But Didi is not a kind of a person
that would leave work behind.

249
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,975
Anything happened?

250
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:49,115
Let's go.

251
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,800
I win.

252
00:22:07,396 --> 00:22:09,356
You learn so fast.

253
00:22:09,397 --> 00:22:10,384
Of course.

254
00:22:10,425 --> 00:22:13,425
My name doesn't come from nothing.

255
00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:14,829
Again?

256
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:16,354
Who's it?

257
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,340
I'll answer the door.

258
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:18,681
Wu Di.

259
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:20,504
Wu Di, are you home?

260
00:22:20,544 --> 00:22:21,494
Coming.

261
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,998
How did you come?

262
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,014
What happened to you?
I can't get in touch with you.

263
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:32,050
Is it your home?

264
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,250
Xiao, you are really a walking virus.

265
00:22:35,526 --> 00:22:36,560
Everywhere you go is affected by you.

266
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,817
Thank you for your praise.

267
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,760
You want to give up your life?

268
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:46,640
He's a doctor.

269
00:22:47,027 --> 00:22:49,127
He knows much more than me.

270
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,600
I don't want to see him suffer.

271
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:55,029
All these years,

272
00:22:56,545 --> 00:22:58,720
I've been alone...

273
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:02,491
and I've been more and
more picky towards men.

274
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,400
I also feel less and less secure.

275
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,384
When he broke into my life,

276
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,875
I didn't know what to do.

277
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:13,470
Because he is a trouble.

278
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:15,625
Then,

279
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,900
I realized that I'm just afraid
to get hurt again.

280
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,165
I'm afraid that once I open my heart,

281
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:28,080
it will never be closed again.

282
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:37,280
But it doesn't matter now.

283
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:43,600
That's it.

284
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:50,348
What the hell are you
looking at me like that for?

285
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:52,850
Late stage of uremia.

286
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:54,840
I don't believe you.

287
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:58,388
You can,

288
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:00,504
but you have to believe the report.

289
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,930
Anyway.

290
00:24:08,526 --> 00:24:09,693
This is something I can't overlook.

291
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,600
You know it and I know it.

292
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:14,942
Curing this disease is really painful.

293
00:24:15,526 --> 00:24:17,176
I've seen much,

294
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,040
so I don't want to torture myself.

295
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,330
What about Wu Di?

296
00:24:24,648 --> 00:24:26,053
Have you thought about that?

297
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,350
She supports my decision.

298
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:43,900
She may not want you to suffer.

299
00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:46,612
But have you thought about it.

300
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,553
If you gave up the treatment now,

301
00:24:49,514 --> 00:24:51,489
she would lose you forever.

302
00:24:51,716 --> 00:24:54,416
It means she have to
accept this cruel fact...

303
00:24:55,523 --> 00:24:56,948
and send you off with a smile.

304
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:17,785
Professor Ma.
I'm sorry to trouble you about that.

305
00:25:17,825 --> 00:25:20,459
It's fine.
I've understood the situation of Dr. Xiao.

306
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,100
However, I suggest he have
another through inspection.

307
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,050
Xiao Yuansong.

308
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,190
Xiao Yuansong.

309
00:25:51,331 --> 00:25:52,681
For all these years,

310
00:25:53,282 --> 00:25:56,282
I've been afraid of stepping
onto the same path in relationship.

311
00:25:57,194 --> 00:25:59,282
I finally accepted him,

312
00:25:59,323 --> 00:26:00,598
but now.

313
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,728
I just hope I can be with
him for one more day...

314
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:07,993
even just one more minute.

315
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,718
Tomorrow is his birthday.

316
00:26:12,275 --> 00:26:14,100
Maybe I should be thankful...

317
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:16,470
that I have the chance to
spend his birthday with him.

318
00:26:18,097 --> 00:26:19,572
He loves surprises.

319
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,325
I'll prepare a last surprise for him.

320
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,952
Isn't this a nice place?

321
00:26:37,271 --> 00:26:38,796
It's my first time here as well.

322
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,564
It's well and
I heard the food is good as well.

323
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:46,433
How's the result of Dr. Xiao.

324
00:26:46,797 --> 00:26:49,100
-Is there a result?
-It'll be out till tomorrow.

325
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,125
Tomorrow is Dr. Xiao's birthday.

326
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:55,301
Wu Di prepared a gathering
in secret for him.

327
00:26:55,412 --> 00:26:57,192
She wants to let him say
goodbye to some friends...

328
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:58,408
in case he has regrets.

329
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,350
Can you secretly
inform his friends for me?

330
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:05,109
Xiao doesn't know?

331
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,950
It's a surprise.

332
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:08,378
How could he know.

333
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,620
It's Wu Di's little present.

334
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:14,434
Just help me.

335
00:27:14,475 --> 00:27:15,681
You don't have to inform too many people,

336
00:27:15,722 --> 00:27:18,297
just some close ones.

337
00:27:19,353 --> 00:27:20,478
All right, I got it.

338
00:27:21,295 --> 00:27:22,135
Thank you.

339
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,425
Why is there a new advertisement board?

340
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,500
Yes, we changed it yesterday.

341
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,995
Why the spokesperson changed?

342
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:33,771
Wasn't it Su Jinbei?

343
00:27:33,922 --> 00:27:35,847
Why is it Gao Zitong now?

344
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,197
Who is Gao Zitong?

345
00:27:37,624 --> 00:27:39,124
You don't know Gao Zitong?

346
00:27:39,275 --> 00:27:40,875
Do you watch Heartbeats?

347
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:43,410
She's hot on that variety show.

348
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,975
She's now almost as popular as Su Jinbei.

349
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,225
Su Jinbei has come out for many years.

350
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,725
She's really not as popular
as new actresses now.

351
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:51,606
Yeah.

352
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:54,939
Honey, I want this.

353
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:56,657
-Okay?
-Just order it.

354
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,470
This looks nice.

355
00:27:59,718 --> 00:28:00,558
Order it.

356
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:01,859
I'll order more dishes.

357
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,800
What do you want to eat?

358
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:03,821
As you wish.

359
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:25,028
Zitong, this is the latest activities.

360
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:25,994
Do you want to see?

361
00:28:32,942 --> 00:28:35,142
I don't know what happened to
the celebrity agent of Su Jinbei.

362
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:36,841
She has done nothing.

363
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:40,135
She just gave away all these work to us.

364
00:28:40,992 --> 00:28:44,500
My opportunity was given by Su Jinbei?

365
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,120
No, I didn't mean that.

366
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:52,600
You earned it on your own.

367
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:06,681
Dr. Xiao.

368
00:29:06,722 --> 00:29:08,021
This is a big joke.

369
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:16,646
Xiao.

370
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,560
Are you sick?

371
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:50,840
You should be serious.

372
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:52,963
You don't know you are sick or not?

373
00:29:53,145 --> 00:29:54,345
I'm not serious at all.

374
00:29:54,386 --> 00:29:55,422
The first day you know me?

375
00:29:55,463 --> 00:29:56,303
And.

376
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:57,560
That is a good thing.

377
00:29:57,601 --> 00:29:59,126
You should be happy for me.

378
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,160
Didi asks us to have dinner together.

379
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:08,990
Gosh.

380
00:30:10,741 --> 00:30:11,581
What are you doing?

381
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,028
You made such a big joke.

382
00:30:14,714 --> 00:30:16,189
Do you have any idea
how it's going to end.

383
00:30:17,793 --> 00:30:20,281
Do you think I should tell her
the good news now?

384
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:21,400
-You.
-Forget it.

385
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:24,793
Such a big deal,
I should tell her in person.

386
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:27,721
I'm not sick.

387
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,250
Thank you, Julie.

388
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:54,525
You're welcome.

389
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:56,871
I want to do something for Dr. Xiao.

390
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,060
It's so cold today.

391
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,950
They are coming.

392
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:03,166
I wore too little.

393
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,320
Wu Di.

394
00:31:05,903 --> 00:31:07,538
Yes.
Hello.

395
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:10,121
I always saw your picture
on the WeChat moments of Xiao.

396
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:11,595
It's the first time
to see the real person.

397
00:31:11,845 --> 00:31:13,395
You look much prettier than the pictures.

398
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:14,801
Thank you!

399
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:17,141
I heard that you are
the celebrity agent of Su Jinbei.

400
00:31:17,677 --> 00:31:18,517
Yes.

401
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:20,030
Is Jinbei here today?

402
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,700
-She is...
-I mean I'm her fan.

403
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,325
It's the birthday of Dr. Xiao.

404
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:28,170
I shouldn't steal his thunder.

405
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:29,086
Jinbei.

406
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:30,109
Jinbei is really here.

407
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,775
Okay, don't mind me.

408
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:33,650
It's the birthday of Dr. Xiao.

409
00:31:38,503 --> 00:31:40,203
It must be hard...

410
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:43,689
looking after him, right?

411
00:31:44,873 --> 00:31:45,818
Not bad.

412
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:47,559
It's weird.

413
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,384
He doesn't look so bad.

414
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:51,634
It's true.

415
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:53,850
He always has a good body.

416
00:31:53,989 --> 00:31:55,359
When we were in college,

417
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,875
he was the prince of sports.

418
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,280
We didn't expect
that he could catch this disease.

419
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:02,709
He was not only the prince of sports.

420
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,925
He was also the most handsome boy.

421
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:05,881
The most handsome? He?

422
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:06,896
He gave himself that title.

423
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,325
He was so proud of himself.

424
00:32:09,675 --> 00:32:10,515
Well, yes.

425
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:12,718
He's still like this.

426
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:15,700
At that time,

427
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,590
the ripped jeans were not so popular.

428
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:22,240
He was fashion enough
to cut some holes on his jeans...

429
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:24,867
and wore it to show off.

430
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:25,881
Yes, yes.

431
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:29,611
He even went to the downstairs
of girls' dorm building of Art School...

432
00:32:29,652 --> 00:32:30,761
and sang love songs.

433
00:32:30,802 --> 00:32:31,721
Yeah.

434
00:32:31,762 --> 00:32:32,787
What are you talking about?

435
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:33,809
Wu Di's here.

436
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,321
Don't listen to them.
It never happened.

437
00:32:35,361 --> 00:32:36,201
Sorry, Sorry.

438
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:40,800
Back then at college we were poor.

439
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:44,175
We could only eat instant
noodles at the end of each month.

440
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,560
Every time
I would split a bowl of noodles with Xiao.

441
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:49,160
Now.

442
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:51,800
I want to have another
bowl of noodles with him.

443
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,601
Don't be too sad.

444
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:04,241
It's his birthday.

445
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:07,561
We should be happy
and leave him a happy memory.

446
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:08,921
-Right!
-Yes, yes.

447
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:09,961
Be happy.

448
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:10,894
Cheer up.

449
00:33:10,934 --> 00:33:13,212
Wu Di.
Where should we put the presents?

450
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:14,481
Here.

451
00:33:14,522 --> 00:33:15,362
Okay.

452
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:22,404
When will you arrive?

453
00:33:22,825 --> 00:33:23,665
How long?

454
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,550
We're almost there.

455
00:33:30,414 --> 00:33:31,254
Coming right up.

456
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,727
Almost here.

457
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,050
Let's prepare.

458
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:37,184
Okay, come on.

459
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:38,425
That... yes.

460
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:40,650
Here you are.

461
00:33:40,691 --> 00:33:41,531
Put it here.

462
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:46,573
Xiao.

463
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:54,771
I see.

464
00:33:55,471 --> 00:33:59,146
You must be really exciting
seeing me coming back from death.

465
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:02,800
You must want to hug me hard.

466
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,840
Come on.

467
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,450
Come on.

468
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,320
There's something I want to tell you.

469
00:34:14,808 --> 00:34:16,808
Dr. Xiao, you are here.

470
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:19,125
Ms. Wu is waiting for you inside.

471
00:34:19,354 --> 00:34:21,001
You came out to pick me up in person.

472
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,540
-You're welcome.
-Come inside.

473
00:34:33,022 --> 00:34:36,397
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

474
00:34:38,825 --> 00:34:40,125
You all come.

475
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,191
Yes.

476
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:43,862
Song.

477
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,960
You are so cruel!

478
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:48,337
You disappeared for so long.

479
00:34:48,701 --> 00:34:49,913
What did you do recently?

480
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,406
We?

481
00:34:51,447 --> 00:34:52,297
Just busy.

482
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:57,535
Look!

483
00:35:03,672 --> 00:35:04,512
Look!

484
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:05,789
Do you like it?

485
00:35:06,762 --> 00:35:07,602
Surprise!

486
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
What's wrong with you!

487
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,275
You said it's a simple meal,

488
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:14,750
but you made it so grand.

489
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:18,371
I hate to say it,

490
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,600
but I have to thank Julie.

491
00:35:22,126 --> 00:35:23,376
-It's romantic.
-Yeah.

492
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:26,167
But it's your birthday,

493
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:28,854
I should prepare this for you.

494
00:35:29,032 --> 00:35:30,532
I want to spend your birthday with you.

495
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,704
This is my birthday wish.

496
00:35:34,544 --> 00:35:38,219
Today everything here belongs to you.

497
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:43,925
So romantic, we can't stand it.

498
00:35:43,966 --> 00:35:44,816
Totally.

499
00:35:48,114 --> 00:35:49,539
Why do you stand so far away?

500
00:35:56,962 --> 00:36:01,570
Are you afraid
that you are so handsome...

501
00:36:01,611 --> 00:36:03,986
that you would steal Dr. Xiao's thunder.

502
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,640
Let's go.

503
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:15,067
Didi.

504
00:36:15,752 --> 00:36:17,002
I need to talk to you.

505
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:21,200
We have plenty of time to talk.

506
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:24,528
Everyone today came for your birthday.

507
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,927
Don't keep them waiting.

508
00:36:26,968 --> 00:36:28,943
Yeah.
Don't stay here.

509
00:36:29,075 --> 00:36:31,075
Totally.
I'm full of your romance.

510
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,560
Leave me some appetite
for the birthday cake.

511
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:33,720
Totally.

512
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:34,680
Well.

513
00:36:35,177 --> 00:36:36,352
May I have your attention.

514
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:38,758
I thank you all.

515
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:39,639
Thank you all.

516
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:44,375
In this life, I can have such
a grand birthday party,

517
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,675
I have no regrets.

518
00:36:47,063 --> 00:36:48,438
Nonsense.

519
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:49,319
I...

520
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,660
It's okay.

521
00:37:01,506 --> 00:37:02,881
What are you doing?

522
00:37:03,153 --> 00:37:04,234
I'm fine.

523
00:37:04,275 --> 00:37:06,159
-It's real, I'm fine.
-Okay, Xiao.

524
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,771
We are buddies for so many years.

525
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:08,901
I know you are tough.

526
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:10,649
But you see, today.
I...

527
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,859
All of your friends and families are here.

528
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,350
Don't take this alone.

529
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,140
If you keep doing this,

530
00:37:15,511 --> 00:37:16,659
we would feel terrible.

531
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,250
No, I mean...

532
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,640
What's up?

533
00:37:20,422 --> 00:37:22,320
You really want to make us cry?

534
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,440
I see.

535
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:28,475
I am rude and strict to you.

536
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,640
You must feel wronged.

537
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:34,560
Today in front of everyone,

538
00:37:35,162 --> 00:37:37,712
I, Wu Di, promise...

539
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,750
I will no longer be so
strict with Xiao Yuansong.

540
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,400
He can do whatever he wants.

541
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:44,375
I'll never be mad.

542
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,940
Really?

543
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,725
It's my birthday gift to you.

544
00:37:51,884 --> 00:37:53,544
A word spoken is past recalling.

545
00:37:53,585 --> 00:37:54,425
Good.

546
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,115
Deal.

547
00:37:59,425 --> 00:38:00,265
Deal.

548
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:01,800
Okay, Xiao.

549
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:04,183
I came with a present as well.

550
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:06,200
That five hundred yuan,

551
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:07,275
you don't have to return to me.

552
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:09,528
Five hundred yuan?

553
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:10,494
What? Want to default?

554
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:13,179
I don't know who he was?

555
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,065
Bro.

556
00:38:15,225 --> 00:38:16,745
Brother.
God.

557
00:38:16,915 --> 00:38:18,290
Save me.

558
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:21,760
What are you doing? Xiao.

559
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,940
You do the math.

560
00:38:23,323 --> 00:38:25,073
How much is it with interest.

561
00:38:25,246 --> 00:38:26,971
Do you like the present?

562
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,500
Okay.

563
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,540
Stop it!

564
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,909
Your presents are here.

565
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,200
This guitar is from Song.

566
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:40,959
What are you doing?

567
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,375
Just coming here is good enough.

568
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,158
See.
Showing off.

569
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:45,038
Game machine.

570
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,159
Liangzi, is it from you?
Right?

571
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,500
We are buddies for so many years.

572
00:38:49,945 --> 00:38:52,107
So many years, you've not changed.

573
00:38:52,148 --> 00:38:53,098
Yes.
Still the same.

574
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:55,704
Have a look.

575
00:39:01,977 --> 00:39:02,817
Bro.

576
00:39:04,117 --> 00:39:04,957
Brother.

577
00:39:05,864 --> 00:39:06,704
God.

578
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:09,953
You always repeat this
sentence when you're begging.

579
00:39:10,503 --> 00:39:12,603
Save me.

580
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:15,156
Why don't you say it?

581
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:16,810
I did.

582
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,525
They don't believe me.

583
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,250
I'll say it for you.

584
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:25,300
Okay, I admit.

585
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:27,657
I'm a little selfish.

586
00:39:27,947 --> 00:39:32,600
I hope that temporarily, temporarily
this can be a secret.

587
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:34,725
Why is that?

588
00:39:35,345 --> 00:39:36,244
Isn't this a good thing?
