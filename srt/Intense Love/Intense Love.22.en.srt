1
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,525
Don't move

2
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,475
Gently

3
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:42,300
It doesn't work!

4
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,650
I am a little nervous, honey

5
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:04,525
Why?

6
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,625
Because they will announce the result tomorrow

7
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:09,825
Then

8
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,725
I'm afraid

9
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,325
if it's not me

10
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,100
You want it to be you?

11
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,850
Yes

12
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,675
How much

13
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,950
I'll work so hard for it

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,975
Did you work hard

15
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,725
See my arms

16
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,525
I really nearly put my life in it

17
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:28,975
Then what do you fear?

18
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,050
Do you believe me? Honey

19
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,725
I believe in your hard work

20
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,375
Then I'll go gently

21
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,525
Thank you for your hard working these days

22
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,450
Thank you for your participation

23
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,475
So taking your comprehensive situation into consideration,

24
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:02,550
our producer

25
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,050
and director decided

26
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,725
that the leading actress is

27
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:15,450
Su Jinbei

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,650
Great

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,700
Thank you!

30
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,375
Great

31
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:28,925
Good for you, Jinbei

32
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,325
Thanks

33
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,250
I've told you

34
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,425
Jinbei

35
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:36,350
Congratulations

36
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,125
Thank you, Zitong

37
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:39,600
Thanks, coach

38
00:03:39,675 --> 00:03:40,650
You are good as well

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,550
Good

40
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,050
Keep going

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,100
Thank you, coach

42
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,775
It's better than fine

43
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,275
Good

44
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,450
Zitong

45
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:48,450
You are good as well

46
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:50,150
Hope to cooperate later

47
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:50,950
Thank you very much

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,475
Thank you

49
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:51,950
Come on!

50
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,625
You two made great progress

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,200
I'll tell you your future arrangements

52
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,150
Take a rest

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,275
OK

54
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,075
Go

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,775
Great

56
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,825
I want to tell my honey

57
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,525
Where is he?

58
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:17,150
He's not here, He's gone

59
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,900
Give me your phone

60
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,850
I'll call him

61
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,250
Here

62
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,925
He didn't answer

63
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,925
I'll text him

64
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,450
Don't think too much

65
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,450
He must be busy

66
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,850
Honey, I

67
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,250
Honey

68
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,725
Honey

69
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,350
Beibei

70
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:53,525
Congratulation!

71
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:57,925
You knew

72
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
The crew told me,

73
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:03,125
so I want to prepare early at home

74
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:13,525
You went home early to prepare a surprise for me

75
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,800
Thank you, honey

76
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:15,650
Thanks

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,500
See, I can handle it

78
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:21,000
You worried about me

79
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,075
What a waste?

80
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,225
Now you should know how great I am

81
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,650
Do you know how great your honey is

82
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,725
I know

83
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:29,300
It's not enough

84
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,225
You need to praise me more

85
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:37,075
Too much delicious food!

86
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,150
You are so great

87
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:48,075
You are the most perfect

88
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,550
and excellent girl I've seen

89
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,425
Who's that?

90
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,075
I'll answer it

91
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:18,925
Didi, why are you here?

92
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,375
I didn't go too long

93
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,900
and received this

94
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:32,850
The leading actress of Future Female Warrior goes to Su Jinbei,

95
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,950
but she achieved this through the relationship of her fiance

96
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,400
It's not good

97
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,450
The crew called me

98
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,425
They want you to make an announcement

99
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,700
How come?

100
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,275
Wait a minute

101
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:51,075
Are you OK?

102
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,625
Is that Wu Di

103
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,250
What was the matter of you?

104
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,225
Why did you do this?

105
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,725
It's not what you think

106
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,075
Then what is it?

107
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,650
Am I this bad in your eyes

108
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,525
Without your help,

109
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,900
I can't do anything?

110
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,050
You can win an award with your ability,

111
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:35,875
but I have to rely on a man

112
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:41,425
You are looking down on me

113
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,900
or yourself

114
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:48,350
If I'm this bad,

115
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,200
why did you come for me?

116
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,600
I worked so hard

117
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,775
to be good enough for you,

118
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,100
but I just got

119
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,825
you distrust

120
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,075
You are deceiving me all the time

121
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,125
You are looking down on me

122
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:29,475
I'm so disappointed

123
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:14,800
You've been sitting here for a night

124
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,925
without saying a word

125
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,050
Get some sleep

126
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:25,750
Beibei

127
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,525
I know you feel bad

128
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:30,450
But it happened

129
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,025
We have to face it

130
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,950
The photo has been spread

131
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:39,175
Dr. Zhou is your fiance

132
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,750
and he met with the producer Ethan

133
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,125
These are all real

134
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,300
If we want to stop this

135
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,825
I think we have to refuse this role

136
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,200
You...

137
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,000
No

138
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,575
I worked hard for this

139
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,450
I will not give up

140
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,400
If I quit now

141
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,500
I'm just admitting it

142
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,900
Why should I admit

143
00:12:09,425 --> 00:12:11,025
something I didn't do

144
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,625
It's good

145
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,950
It's good of you to think like this

146
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,925
Let's cheer up

147
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,100
When the movie finished shooting and is released

148
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,650
We'll show them the outcome

149
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,750
See what they can say

150
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,000
Didi

151
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,325
Do you believe me?

152
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,625
I believe you all the time

153
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,075
You've never let me down

154
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,150
Beibei

155
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,275
Dr. Zhou was just helping you

156
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,975
Don't mention him

157
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,025
I'm begging you

158
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:14,700
Dr. Zhou

159
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,650
Dr. Zhou

160
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,650
What's going on?

161
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:22,050
I don't know

162
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,150
You are in a good status

163
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:28,650
All signs are normal

164
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,850
Keep it up

165
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,600
You were laborious

166
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,525
It's my duty

167
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:35,250
Just actively cooperate with the treatment

168
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,850
There should be no problem

169
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,250
Ok, Ok

170
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,025
Don't repeat these nonsense

171
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:41,950
Director

172
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,325
The time of defecation, urination and drinking water should be recorded

173
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,525
Call me if there's a problem

174
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,350
I know

175
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:49,850
Aunt Fang, I have an operation

176
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,850
Have some rest

177
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,475
OK

178
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:52,475
Go about your work

179
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:53,025
OK

180
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:56,450
Sorry

181
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,475
I know I made a mistake

182
00:13:57,475 --> 00:13:57,975
Dr. Zhou

183
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,250
At that time,

184
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:00,050
there's nothing I can do

185
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,400
Go to the blood station to get blood without a box

186
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:02,425
You'd better not make

187
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,725
such a silly mistake again

188
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,925
I'm so sorry

189
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,325
For patients

190
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,600
One second is precious enough

191
00:14:08,025 --> 00:14:08,500
Yes

192
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:13,550
Dr. Xiao

193
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,475
What's the matter with Dr. Zhou these days?

194
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,650
You have to work

195
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,700
Why do you mind these

196
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,925
He's really different

197
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:24,925
Although he used to be cold,

198
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,250
but not like this

199
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,150
Yes

200
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:30,225
These days, he's been turning from an iceberg

201
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:32,025
to a volcano that erupts at any time

202
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:32,600
Right

203
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,800
Yes

204
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,325
He passed by here in dorm checks

205
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,850
He had a really sad face

206
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,075
Er...

207
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,700
This is because he is busy with a project

208
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,500
about 3D printing to improve the preoperative plan

209
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,950
of patients with congenital heart disease

210
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:48,225
This project is really important

211
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:50,150
in our hospital

212
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,425
So

213
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:52,925
he treated you strictly

214
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:57,150
And you

215
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,650
Just do two things

216
00:14:59,225 --> 00:14:59,825
Speak less

217
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:00,925
and do more

218
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,175
The important thing is that you can't make mistakes

219
00:15:05,475 --> 00:15:06,550
If there is a mistake...

220
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,350
Go to your work

221
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,150
Don't chat here

222
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,225
Let me help you

223
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,500
No, thanks

224
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:40,425
Really?

225
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:58,025
Is your heart beating fast?

226
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,925
The emerald earrings are passed on from generation to generation

227
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,475
by Zhou's daughter-in-laws

228
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:32,975
Grandma gave it to my mother,

229
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,875
now it's given to you

230
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,125
I see, my brother must see you as his Miss Right

231
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,825
This time I'll take my trophy

232
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,875
with my abilities

233
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,075
Wait to be proud of me

234
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,650
It's not enough

235
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,275
You need to praise me more

236
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,400
You are so great

237
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:37,925
You are the most perfect

238
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,150
and excellent girl I've seen

239
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,325
Are you kidding me

240
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,950
I am this perfect and excellent

241
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:26,850
Do you remember

242
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,925
what you're going to say to Dr. Zhou?

243
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,650
I can recite it

244
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,600
Dr. Zhou didn't mention this to you?

245
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,200
There's not many words in his one sentence

246
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:39,325
Now,

247
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,800
there's even less

248
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:42,450
He didn't mention

249
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,775
When I asked him,

250
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,075
he didn't even talk to me

251
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,050
Zhou Shiyun

252
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,725
Is he made of wood?

253
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,150
What do you think?

254
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,125
Not everyone is like me,

255
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:56,150
brazen-faced shameless

256
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:58,125
But Su Jinbei

257
00:19:58,425 --> 00:19:59,900
should give him an excuse

258
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,325
I don't dare to mention

259
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:05,650
Zhou Shiyun in front of her lately

260
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,800
You women are really ambivalent

261
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,475
Xiao Yuansong

262
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:16,150
You mean...

263
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:19,175
You've absorbed experience from me

264
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,550
I don't dare to

265
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,725
Dr. Zhou

266
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:30,125
Your looks

267
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,400
Is this a right attitude

268
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:34,850
towards a voluntary messenger?

269
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,775
My queen Didi

270
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,025
asked me to tell you something

271
00:20:41,225 --> 00:20:43,325
Not me

272
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,050
Say

273
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,000
Su Jinbei has entered the crew in advance

274
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:50,550
The preparation has started

275
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,525
All is good

276
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:54,150
But

277
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,925
your problem is not solved

278
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,875
See

279
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:04,025
What's the big deal?

280
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,850
When I pursued Wu Di,

281
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,050
I paid so many efforts

282
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:12,125
Compared with me,

283
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,150
this is nothing

284
00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:15,100
Your attitude is not good

285
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,300
The colleagues

286
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,725
are all feeling unhappy with you

287
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:21,525
You have two night shifts this week, don't you?

288
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,850
Are you listening?

289
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:27,075
I'll take over yours

290
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:29,925
Why?

291
00:21:31,475 --> 00:21:33,425
I have to speed up my

292
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,275
Clinical research projects

293
00:21:36,825 --> 00:21:39,675
Zhou Shiyun, can you find another excuse?

294
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,550
You've used this to take over the night shifts of

295
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,150
Yang, Liu and Li

296
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,725
And now It's me

297
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:46,975
I want to

298
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,850
I have nothing to do at home

299
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,325
Wu Di just can't wait to live

300
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:52,550
with Su Jinbei

301
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,325
these days

302
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:56,350
I have nothing to do at home as well

303
00:21:57,825 --> 00:21:58,650
We've got a deal

304
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:00,000
Tuesday and Saturday, right?

305
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:03,775
Zhou, you can't do this

306
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,450
You have to explain to her

307
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,725
I can't explain clearly

308
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:09,675
How come?

309
00:22:10,225 --> 00:22:11,925
You met with the producer,

310
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,725
but you didn't do anything

311
00:22:13,825 --> 00:22:15,800
that may affect Su Jinbei, right?

312
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:18,925
You can go find her

313
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:20,500
and explain to her carefully

314
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,900
Apologize

315
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,325
She's so kind

316
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,525
She will forgive you

317
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,125
But I can't forgive myself

318
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:31,600
Yes, I didn't

319
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,050
ask Ethan to help her,

320
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,325
but the moment I asked her out

321
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm doubting the ability of Jinbei

322
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:42,975
The moment I had this thought,

323
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,650
I looked down on her

324
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,250
I feel sorry for her

325
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,800
Thanks

326
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,850
Mr. Shui

327
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,600
Mr. Shui

328
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,850
Don't you have to work today

329
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:14,925
Why did you come?

330
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,250
I can't get through your phone

331
00:23:17,825 --> 00:23:18,975
I have to come to the company

332
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,650
What's up?

333
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:23,775
Mr. Shui

334
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,675
Did you make the News of Su Jinbei

335
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,325
Why?

336
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,800
Why?

337
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,700
Are you asking me why?

338
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,200
You didn't know why?

339
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,725
If you can do better,

340
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,850
how would I do that

341
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,875
Thank you, Mr. Shui

342
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,175
But I don't want to do this

343
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,050
I don't want to take anything with tricks

344
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:53,250
I want to earn it with my abilities

345
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,550
Abilities?

346
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,000
Gao Zitong

347
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:59,400
If you're capable, how did it come to this?

348
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,475
Zitong

349
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,350
Thanks

350
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,975
Why are you here?

351
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,425
There's one last thing to do for the termination of contract

352
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,650
I'm here to deal with it

353
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,800
You all hear that

354
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:51,400
This is retribution!

355
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:54,525
I did so many bad things

356
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:57,075
I think you are right

357
00:25:01,075 --> 00:25:02,600
How've you been?

358
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:04,650
Fine

359
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:08,275
I'm free now

360
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,075
I can do a lot of things I like

361
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:15,075
Sorry, Jiawei

362
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:17,600
It's my fault

363
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:20,625
I was too naive

364
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,725
It's OK, Zitong

365
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:24,250
It's all right. It's all over now

366
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,000
Actually

367
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,250
I'm responsible too

368
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:31,950
Thank you, Zitong

369
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,675
Thank you for doing so much for me

370
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,000
All the time

371
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,325
I know you loved me

372
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,900
I refused you because...

373
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:46,950
Jiawei

374
00:25:47,225 --> 00:25:48,825
It's all over now

375
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,975
Don't mention it

376
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,800
Let's work hard

377
00:25:53,275 --> 00:25:54,800
just like when we were abroad

378
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:56,450
Yes

379
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:59,950
It's fine

380
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:14,275
I'm finally home

381
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,325
The shooting hasn't started yet

382
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:18,900
But the training is so hard

383
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:22,250
Do you think I should communicate with them

384
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:23,925
No

385
00:26:24,225 --> 00:26:25,325
They all look

386
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,275
kind on the surface

387
00:26:27,675 --> 00:26:31,200
calling me Miss Su

388
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,975
In fact,

389
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,000
they all see me

390
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:37,125
as the relative of the director

391
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,975
Don't take it to heart

392
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,850
I didn't

393
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,950
My clear conscience laugh at false accusation

394
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,575
I just do my job and hope that is enough

395
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,950
I don't care about them

396
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:55,925
Beibei

397
00:26:57,275 --> 00:27:00,725
Dr. Zhou is asking about you every day

398
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,050
This was someone's trick

399
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,950
It's not all his fault

400
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:09,550
I know he did this for me

401
00:27:09,675 --> 00:27:12,375
I am not mad at this

402
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:14,625
What was it?

403
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,525
Didi

404
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:18,050
We've known for a long time

405
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,450
You know me

406
00:27:19,825 --> 00:27:21,825
This is the first time I actually

407
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,325
worked hard for something

408
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,150
I didn't do it for myself

409
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,525
but also for him

410
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,825
He's so excellent

411
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,750
I want him to be proud of me,

412
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,050
even if I have to sacrifice everything

413
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:34,600
You did it

414
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,150
But he thinks differently

415
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,100
The moment he

416
00:27:42,275 --> 00:27:43,650
asked Ethan out,

417
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,075
he didn't trust me

418
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:47,650
He doesn't believe me

419
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,950
He didn't think I can make it

420
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:52,050
Although I've told him many times

421
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,500
that I want to win accreditation with my abilities

422
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,500
Beibei

423
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,600
Dr. Zhou was just helping you

424
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,625
But in the end,

425
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:03,925
he didn't mention you to Ethan

426
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,600
It's still the same

427
00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:08,675
He said he believed in my hard work

428
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,600
But in the end

429
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,450
He is the one

430
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,650
that broke his words

431
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,925
Don't look at me like this

432
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
I'll go sleeping

433
00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:24,075
Good night

434
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:38,475
Come in

435
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:40,750
Dr. Zhou

436
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:42,575
Why you still here?

437
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:45,100
I remember it's Doctor Xu's shift

438
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,075
I'm taking his shift

439
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:47,575
Again?

440
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,950
You've been taking many night shifts

441
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:52,250
I heard from Dr. Xu

442
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,950
that you asked for this night shift

443
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,625
Why?

444
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,325
What? You want me too?

445
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,900
No, No

446
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,850
Why?

447
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:01,850
Just for work

448
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,925
What's up?

449
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,075
It's ok

450
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,300
I'll just leave

451
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,275
Thanks

452
00:29:30,275 --> 00:29:32,700
You really plan to live in the hospital

453
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,825
Didn't you see that Aunt Fang is not doing well

454
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,950
I'm here

455
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,125
You?

456
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:39,650
I still fell uneasy

457
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:41,950
Forget it

458
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,925
You are just avoiding

459
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,250
Wait here

460
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,200
Why is your face so white?

461
00:29:52,025 --> 00:29:52,850
White?

462
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,225
It's called beauty improvement

463
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,000
People are all like this

464
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,725
Come on, another one

465
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:06,000
These guys!

466
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,250
You terrified me!

467
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:08,725
What's up?

468
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,525
Director, meeting!

469
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,925
It's time

470
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,175
Let's go

471
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,375
Today's entertaining time

472
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,850
ends

473
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,175
You are entertaining

474
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,275
Director

475
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,100
Come on, come on, come on

476
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,075
Here, look this way

477
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,475
Wait a moment

478
00:30:28,675 --> 00:30:29,275
Slightly nearer

479
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,075
Yes

480
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,450
Nasty guy!

481
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,050
Young people

482
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,625
should concentrate on work

483
00:30:34,675 --> 00:30:36,025
Don't let romance relationships

484
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:38,175
consume too much of your energy

485
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,675
Director, you say it like you mean it

486
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:41,650
How can

487
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:42,925
you...

488
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,300
I said these to you young people

489
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:47,925
I'm old

490
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,450
Don't compare with me

491
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,050
We can't

492
00:30:51,825 --> 00:30:52,700
And

493
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,400
You can engage yourselves in love

494
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,425
We can also enjoy our old romance

495
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,025
It...

496
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,700
OK

497
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:01,800
Good words

498
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,025
You judged me

499
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,725
and learned from me

500
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,875
Nasty guy!

501
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,125
Help me

502
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,000
Ok, Ok

503
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:09,850
To the meeting now

504
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,400
Dr. Zhou, something happened in ward 15

505
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,850
Hurry up!

506
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,050
Director

507
00:32:12,075 --> 00:32:12,975
Aunt Fang

508
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,800
Is aunt Fang dying

509
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,675
Em...

510
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,675
Not positive

511
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,350
How much time we got?

512
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,875
At the most

513
00:32:28,675 --> 00:32:29,300
one month

514
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,750
One month?

515
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,925
It's my fault

516
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,050
It's my fault

517
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,850
Cancer cells are hard to detect early

518
00:32:43,025 --> 00:32:44,875
Aunt Fang's tumor is deep in the organ

519
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,100
This is not your fault

520
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,100
I'm totally ignored

521
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,850
Director

522
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:57,250
It's ok

523
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:58,775
Don't comfort me

524
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:03,600
I know what you want to say

525
00:33:04,225 --> 00:33:06,950
I've said these to the family of the patient

526
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:08,325
for many times

527
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,275
When it comes to me,

528
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,850
I can't get through it

529
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,150
I can't

530
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,450
I can't get through it

531
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,300
She's awake

532
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,575
I didn't expect to see you again

533
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,625
Come off it!

534
00:33:36,825 --> 00:33:37,925
I asked Shiyun

535
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:40,225
There's no problem

536
00:33:40,825 --> 00:33:43,325
It's just because you didn't eat well

537
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,825
Take some rest

538
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,725
You have to listen to me now

539
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,625
Hey

540
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:17,750
Wuque appeared again

541
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,300
I got her

542
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:19,925
I got it

543
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:29,075
She's not here

544
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:30,275
She's still online

545
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,075
The location changed

546
00:34:42,475 --> 00:34:44,325
And it's just nearby

547
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,400
Welcome

548
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,125
Yingying

549
00:34:59,075 --> 00:35:00,125
Xu Jiawei

550
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,775
Sorry, I made a mistake

551
00:35:06,075 --> 00:35:06,800
So handsome

552
00:35:58,875 --> 00:35:59,925
Hello, Yingying

553
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,150
Jiawei

554
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,425
Hello

555
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,225
Let's go

556
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:24,000
Great

557
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:34,825
You can listen to it yourself if you don't believe me

558
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,075
If you don't feel sleepy, I lose

559
00:37:45,425 --> 00:37:46,400
Wuque

560
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,525
Jiawei

561
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
I know it's you

562
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,550
Dr. Zhou

563
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:29,250
You don't look very well

564
00:38:30,425 --> 00:38:32,450
There's so many operations

565
00:38:33,025 --> 00:38:34,750
and you have to study the research Subjects

566
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,650
I'm afraid you can't take it

567
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,125
It's alright

568
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,250
You...

569
00:38:50,225 --> 00:38:53,825
Look how pity Dr. Zhou is

570
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,350
What are you doing?

571
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,350
I'm here to transmit the director's instruction

572
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,725
He will cancel

573
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,850
all your clinics and operations for one week

574
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,625
He asked you to have a good rest

575
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:10,650
I know

576
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,600
Look at your

577
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,675
I can't endure it

578
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,000
Those closely involved cannot see clearly

579
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,850
It's no big deal

580
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,825
You don't have to torture yourself like this

581
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,275
When Wu Di dumped me,

582
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:26,325
how did you persuade me

583
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,425
Everything you said then made sense

584
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,725
Now

585
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,225
When it comes to you,

586
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,250
you back down

587
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:35,225
You have to explain, then just go and explain to her

588
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,875
That's another case

589
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,675
I have nothing to explain

590
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
It is my fault

591
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,000
She should be mad at me

592
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,750
Then

593
00:39:45,825 --> 00:39:46,525
It's finished?

594
00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:48,450
What's next?

595
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,975
What a foolish student?!

596
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,225
Since you are wrong, you have to apologize

597
00:39:58,225 --> 00:40:01,150
Are you waiting for her to stop being angry and come back at you?

598
00:40:03,425 --> 00:40:05,100
Why are you still looking at me?

599
00:40:05,825 --> 00:40:08,125
Do you need me to teach you how to apologize?

600
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,100
Since you are wrong, you have to apologize

601
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,950
Are you waiting for her to stop being angry and come back at you?

602
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:41,800
Dr. Zhou

603
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,000
Is Jinbei there

604
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,725
She's gone
