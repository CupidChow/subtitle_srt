=Intense Love=

2
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:36,084
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:39,117
Coming right up!

4
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:43,558
Su Jinbei!

5
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:48,189
You have the guts
to take advantage of others.

6
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,849
Don't you dare show your true face?

7
00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:52,881
Su Jinbei. I'm warning you.
Stay away from our...

8
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:56,080
This is the hospital. If you
misbehave again, I'll call the police.

9
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:57,547
-Su Jinbei.
-What's the matter?

10
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,374
-You shameless and bad woman.
-Security.

11
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,291
Shame on you

12
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:02,362
I tell you.
Stay away from Jiawei.

13
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:03,484
You let go of me.

14
00:02:03,568 --> 00:02:04,952
-What's wrong?
-Let go of me.

15
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:07,188
I will reveal your true face.

16
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,501
Jiawei is mine.

17
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:13,226
Miss Su.

18
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:16,277
I think you saw that...

19
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:20,512
your stay here has affected
the order of our hospital.

20
00:02:21,738 --> 00:02:22,848
So please.

21
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:26,441
Go through the discharge formalities
as soon as possible.

22
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:34,992
You let me go.

23
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:41,199
You have recovered.

24
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:45,290
What if I don't leave?

25
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:48,119
Then I'll break off the engagement.

26
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,355
You already know who I am but you're still
pretending not to know me.

27
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,358
Interesting, isn't it?

28
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:51,759
I'm not pretending.

29
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:54,759
I just didn't find the appropriate time
to tell you everything.

30
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:55,968
Really?

31
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,070
Yes.

32
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:59,326
I thought you didn't know who I was.

33
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:01,046
Now it seems...

34
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:02,966
you already knew that.

35
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:05,095
-Don't you?
-So what?

36
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,002
For a fiance who is absent
from the engagement party.

37
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:09,406
I could have assumed that the marriage
did not exist at all.

38
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:12,250
As far as I know Miss Su was not
at the engagement party, either.

39
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:14,242
Nonsense.
I had a car accident that day.

40
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:15,159
How can I get engaged?

41
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:16,712
Well.

42
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:19,409
Let's stop blaming each other.

43
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:21,600
Dr. Zhou.

44
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:24,190
You must be against this marriage.

45
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:28,533
I didn't say that.

46
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:31,025
Why are you threatening me like this.

47
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:34,166
That's because you're cured
but you're still in the hospital.

48
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:36,831
You're affecting other patients
and our normal work.

49
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:42,444
Yes. I affect your work.

50
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:44,100
Your job is more important
than other things.

51
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:46,406
But have you considered my feelings?

52
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:48,470
You know exactly who I am.

53
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:51,016
But you're not good for me
when I was attacked.

54
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:53,288
You threatened
to break off our engagement.

55
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,529
Dr. Zhou.

56
00:04:55,806 --> 00:04:57,789
Your attitude towards the engagement.

57
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:59,951
I think I understand quite well.

58
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:22,772
Are your feet okay?

59
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:10,944
-Your luggage.
-Thank you.

60
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:29,153
It must have been you yesterday.

61
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:31,688
You were under postoperative anesthesia.

62
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:32,988
Unconscious.

63
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,137
It's normal to do something out of line.

64
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:37,406
I don't blame you.

65
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:44,350
Thank you.

66
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:46,849
But I don't have the habit
of eating late at night.

67
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:50,975
Your stay here...

68
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:53,486
has affected the order of our hospital.

69
00:07:55,014 --> 00:07:56,584
You let me go.

70
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:03,195
Who is it?

71
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:30,309
I knew he wouldn't leave me alone.

72
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:36,846
Didn't you say
you were breaking off the engagement?

73
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:08,969
Come with me.

74
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:23,406
Another one.

75
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,886
Usually you look cool.

76
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,361
I didn't realize you were so sweet.

77
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:44,532
Do you hate girls in showbiz?

78
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,267
No.

79
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:51,085
She's usually quite noisy.

80
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:52,766
Do you find her annoying?

81
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,771
Maybe...

82
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:56,765
I won't.

83
00:10:59,394 --> 00:11:01,812
She has many rumors.

84
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:04,094
But actually she and those boys
have no affairs.

85
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:06,926
Do you believe what the media say?

86
00:11:07,723 --> 00:11:08,646
I won't.

87
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:19,919
It hurts.

88
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:25,366
Walk less these days.

89
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:27,122
Be careful not to touch water.

90
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,591
I see.

91
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:41,002
It's freezing outside now.

92
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,058
Why don't you stay and have a cup of tea?

93
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:48,922
It's fine.

94
00:11:49,204 --> 00:11:51,861
We still have a lot of drinks
in the fridge. I'll get it for you.

95
00:11:56,369 --> 00:11:58,964
I think there's a lot left.

96
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:00,503
Just...

97
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,937
Why did you leave without saying goodbye?

98
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:11,992
It seems it is hard to move him.

99
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:15,092
I have to go get help.

100
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,651
-Didi.
-Coming right up!

101
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:41,346
Why you are here?

102
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,526
You should call in advance.

103
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:44,284
I miss you.

104
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:47,277
Come on.

105
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:49,619
There must be something wrong.

106
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:50,849
No kidding.

107
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:52,612
My feet are okay.

108
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:55,223
I'm here about Shiyun.

109
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:59,348
You call him Shiyun?

110
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:03,004
You said you'd stop
if you couldn't make it in three days.

111
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:04,884
It's been so long.

112
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:06,835
Are you serious about what you said?

113
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:08,347
Of course.

114
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:10,990
I promised you
to act in the Misty Rain.

115
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,998
I'll put on a good show.

116
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:15,844
Not bad.

117
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:19,003
But are you sure your feet are all right?

118
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:21,471
Yes. He checked it for me.

119
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:26,806
Who's that? It's too loud.

120
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:30,285
Recently a silly youth move to downstairs.

121
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:31,703
Every day he play this punk song.

122
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:32,656
It's annoying.

123
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,714
Why don't you talk to him?

124
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:36,326
I want to ignore him.

125
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:37,534
Let me get to the point.

126
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:39,336
About that professor Zhou.

127
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,884
I'm just not convinced.

128
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:43,235
How could anyone not be obsessed with me?

129
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:44,806
I must make him fall in love with me.

130
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:47,186
Help me, Didi.

131
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,162
You can't handle it.

132
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,111
How can I help?

133
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:53,675
Then.

134
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:55,166
Just like last time.

135
00:13:58,006 --> 00:13:59,737
Last time?

136
00:14:00,644 --> 00:14:01,560
How?

137
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:06,129
Didn't you give me a idea
that he is jealous?

138
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:07,581
It's very useful.

139
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,153
Can you...

140
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,533
Bye.

141
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:12,808
Take care.

142
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:16,482
I haven't said anything yet, have I?
Why are you so angry?

143
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:18,859
That's your tune.
I know what you're doing.

144
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:19,971
Listen, Su Jinbei.

145
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:22,842
What I have done cannot be done again.

146
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:24,347
Impossible.

147
00:14:24,524 --> 00:14:25,357
Never mind.

148
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:27,000
You can have dinner
with Xiao Yuansong again.

149
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:29,471
And drink something.

150
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:31,167
-Didi.
-Take your stuff.

151
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:32,682
-No
-Then you are... Go.

152
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:33,896
Talk to him.

153
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,214
It's not hard to have a dinner.

154
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:38,038
Bye bye.

155
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:40,792
I won't go to that play.

156
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,260
Whatever.

157
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:52,322
A man called a fool.

158
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,564
Cried out the youth.

159
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:58,611
Would you mind making less noise?

160
00:14:58,886 --> 00:15:00,032
What do you scream?

161
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:02,089
-It's annoying.
-What the hell is yelling?

162
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:04,142
Does my dolphin voice sound good?

163
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,179
If you want to be a dolphin,
you should go to the sea.

164
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:08,449
What are you yelling here?

165
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,262
If you have the sea in your heart,

166
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:12,381
everywhere you go
is spring flowers blooming.

167
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,301
There seems to be some truth in that.

168
00:15:21,091 --> 00:15:24,304
Women today
have no appreciation of music at all.

169
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:27,935
But the voice...

170
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:30,583
Why does that voice sounds familiar?

171
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:46,608
What's that?

172
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:19,341
I know it's late.

173
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,084
But could you do me a favor?

174
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:22,366
Don't knock at the door.

175
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:24,424
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

176
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:26,795
I'll pay you more. Three times.

177
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:28,338
Four.

178
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:30,020
Hey? Hey?

179
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:32,772
Who's that?

180
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:33,926
It's annoying.

181
00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:39,451
How come it's you?

182
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:42,366
Am I having a bad dream?

183
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,252
You're the nightmare.

184
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:47,155
Did we have a deal
to never to see each other again?

185
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:50,120
How come you chase to my home?

186
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:53,188
How did I get to your house?

187
00:16:53,406 --> 00:16:55,086
I live downstairs, okay?

188
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:12,606
You and Dr. Zhou went
in the same college.

189
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,746
-Wrench.
-Here you are.

190
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:16,762
Yeah.

191
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:18,486
We were in the same dormitory.

192
00:17:19,644 --> 00:17:22,674
What kind of person he is?

193
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:24,530
At the beginning,

194
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:26,038
he didn't even talk to me.

195
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:28,572
Six months later,

196
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,589
we were getting to know each other.

197
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:33,127
Well.

198
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:35,464
He is slow to warm.

199
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:36,636
I think so, yeah.

200
00:17:38,756 --> 00:17:39,827
Let me ask you something.

201
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:42,020
Zhou Shiyun and Su Jinbei.

202
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:44,131
How did they get engaged?

203
00:17:44,532 --> 00:17:47,590
Is it an arranged marriage?

204
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:48,822
I don't know.

205
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,406
You can ask Dr. Zhou.

206
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:52,361
Aren't you guys brother?

207
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:54,922
He doesn't want to talk.

208
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:56,959
He won't say anything.

209
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,134
Look like you guys aren't that good.

210
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:02,096
Su Jinbei didn't tell you either.

211
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,666
Fake sister.

212
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:05,536
Do your job.

213
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:11,919
Well.

214
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:14,526
I'll try the water valve.

215
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:18,251
It's done.

216
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,747
Handsome Xiao is awesome.

217
00:18:23,182 --> 00:18:24,244
Wow, awesome.

218
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,652
Come here and have a look.

219
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,693
This one.

220
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,212
We have to tighten it up.

221
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:31,206
Right?
Otherwise it will keep watering.

222
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:54,497
Sorry. I'm...

223
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:56,510
I'm sorry.

224
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:36,542
Come on!

225
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:38,666
Come on, sister.

226
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,085
Join the hot summer.

227
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:43,905
Come on!

228
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:46,240
Come on, sister.

229
00:19:46,592 --> 00:19:49,215
Join the hot summer.

230
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:51,173
You're hot on a cold day?

231
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:53,570
Are you having a fever?

232
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,743
No, I didn't. Director.

233
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,848
I'm a young youth with passion.

234
00:19:58,124 --> 00:19:59,526
Then try to lower the temperature.

235
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,976
Don't bother me.

236
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,287
You are right. I'm going to
the morgue's freezer right now.

237
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:06,686
Cool it down.

238
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:07,933
No, I mean.

239
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:09,536
Why do you talk against me all the time?

240
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:10,677
-Say too much.
-Sorry... Sorry.

241
00:20:10,762 --> 00:20:11,691
Director.

242
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:14,696
I'll give you the operation report later.

243
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:16,312
Well.

244
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,163
You the brat.

245
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:26,486
Look at that old man.

246
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,746
He's not good for me every time
he sees me,

247
00:20:29,006 --> 00:20:31,006
but to you his face is full of affection.

248
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:33,086
It's a different story.

249
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,377
In a good mood?

250
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:39,086
I think you slept well last night.

251
00:20:40,724 --> 00:20:41,899
Last night.

252
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:46,046
It was not bad.

253
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:47,999
Really?

254
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:50,410
But...

255
00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:52,802
I told her about you last night.

256
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:55,933
And she's going to tell your fiancee.

257
00:20:56,288 --> 00:21:00,032
And your fiancee will be here.

258
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,459
And ask you something.

259
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:03,126
Really?

260
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:06,687
I...

261
00:21:06,771 --> 00:21:09,069
I don't think it's a betrayal.

262
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:10,255
It counts.

263
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:13,386
What to do?

264
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:16,762
I'll treat you a dinner.

265
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:17,885
Alright.

266
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:20,486
Fine.
See you in the canteen at noon.

267
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:22,832
Get out.

268
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:25,584
Add one more bean curd at most.

269
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:48,069
Hey.

270
00:21:48,863 --> 00:21:51,031
Get up, big lazy pig.

271
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:55,711
What time is it? You call me so early.

272
00:21:56,007 --> 00:21:58,946
I just want to send you five words.

273
00:21:59,491 --> 00:22:00,758
What five words?

274
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,424
Moisture is fine and silent.

275
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:08,056
Would you in the morning
stop guessing riddles.

276
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:10,427
I want to sleep to dream the Duke of Zhou.

277
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:12,356
The Duke of Zhou?

278
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:14,382
Not another one?

279
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:19,103
Did you mean Zhou Shiyun?

280
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,213
Yeah.

281
00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:21,679
I tell you.

282
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:23,246
Just remind...

283
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,720
Now your best bet is
moisture is fine and silent.

284
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:30,785
Taking it slowly and quietly.

285
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:32,330
Really?

286
00:22:32,486 --> 00:22:34,120
Where did you get the information?

287
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,427
Well.

288
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:38,726
At the beginning,

289
00:22:39,063 --> 00:22:40,703
he didn't even talk to me.

290
00:22:42,156 --> 00:22:43,082
Six months later,

291
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,051
we were getting to know each other.

292
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:49,816
So he is slow to warm?

293
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,989
You just leave it.

294
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,926
I have my own channels.

295
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:56,942
Dr. Zhou is shy.

296
00:22:57,286 --> 00:23:02,134
So you should take it slowly
to move him.

297
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:04,635
I see.

298
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:08,057
I got it.

299
00:23:19,736 --> 00:23:20,569
Yao.

300
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:22,085
What is this?

301
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,773
Lei.

302
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:25,094
I typed this wrong.

303
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:26,241
Typed wrong?

304
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:29,938
The very important thing for a doctor
is to pay attention to details.

305
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:32,581
A small mistake may affect
the patient's health,

306
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:33,599
even their lives.

307
00:23:33,802 --> 00:23:35,655
Make preciseness a habit.

308
00:23:36,286 --> 00:23:38,006
That's how you make sure
everything is okay.

309
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:39,686
Sorry, teacher.

310
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:41,166
I'll be careful next time.

311
00:23:44,886 --> 00:23:46,419
Dr. Zhou, your express.

312
00:23:46,806 --> 00:23:47,639
It's not mine.

313
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:49,482
It has your name on it.

314
00:23:51,884 --> 00:23:53,753
This package has stories.

315
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:54,925
Zhang.

316
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,166
The format of your report is not right.

317
00:23:57,647 --> 00:23:59,200
-Rewrite it.
-Yes, teacher.

318
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,373
It's just a format.

319
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:02,872
Should I rewrite？

320
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,444
I see.

321
00:24:07,764 --> 00:24:09,410
Now it's a little problem.

322
00:24:09,686 --> 00:24:11,202
Then there's the big question later.

323
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:12,651
Right? Zhou?

324
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,522
Take it easy.

325
00:24:14,743 --> 00:24:17,336
Look.
The interns are scared of you.

326
00:24:18,436 --> 00:24:19,596
Teacher, let us go first.

327
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,513
Go ahead.

328
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:23,531
But Zhou.

329
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:26,154
Still pay attention to your health.

330
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:33,303
Please protect your face
from the recent dry weather.

331
00:24:33,797 --> 00:24:34,942
My skin has been dry lately.

332
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,853
Just what I need. Thanks!

333
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:38,447
Put it down.

334
00:24:43,486 --> 00:24:44,410
Buy it yourself.

335
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:46,435
You are mean.

336
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:14,747
Thank you.

337
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,814
Are your feet better?

338
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:08,816
Don't worry about my feet.

339
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:09,951
The new play is on.

340
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,419
Wish me luck.

341
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,416
Also I hope everything goes well with you.

342
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:17,126
Thank you for the mask.

343
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:31,366
-I see.
-Miss Su, take a photo.

344
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:33,063
Go.

345
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:36,432
Be careful.

346
00:26:39,716 --> 00:26:40,549
Come here.

347
00:26:41,573 --> 00:26:42,406
Miss Su please.

348
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:55,269
Miss Su.

349
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:56,648
Director.

350
00:26:56,922 --> 00:26:57,755
Hello, director.

351
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:00,469
-Miss Jinbei.
-Director.

352
00:27:01,276 --> 00:27:02,821
-Jinbei please stand in the middle.
-Come here. Stand here.

353
00:27:02,905 --> 00:27:03,738
Thank you.

354
00:27:04,566 --> 00:27:05,399
It's my pleasure.

355
00:27:06,268 --> 00:27:08,838
Good luck in booting.

356
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:19,241
What are you looking at?

357
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:20,502
So happy.

358
00:27:23,312 --> 00:27:24,527
What are you looking at?

359
00:27:58,486 --> 00:27:59,726
Are you ok?

360
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:01,667
What's wrong with Gao Zitong?

361
00:28:01,938 --> 00:28:02,940
Can't remember the script.

362
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:04,716
It was you who caught the cold
in the play.

363
00:28:04,846 --> 00:28:06,316
But she kept coughing.

364
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,282
You are the most sincere.

365
00:28:08,366 --> 00:28:10,316
You eat dozen bowls of rice all morning.

366
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,194
I would have been pissed.

367
00:28:17,712 --> 00:28:18,806
Stomach pain?

368
00:28:19,606 --> 00:28:20,439
Somewhat.

369
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,380
Why are you pretending?

370
00:28:22,606 --> 00:28:23,807
It's fine.

371
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,512
She won't remember you're generous.

372
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:28,705
In the crew,

373
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:30,761
It wasn't easy when she was sick.

374
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:32,037
That's okay.

375
00:28:33,006 --> 00:28:34,326
I think,

376
00:28:34,686 --> 00:28:36,155
she is pretending to be sick.

377
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,229
Did you miss me?

378
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:54,115
What are you doing?

379
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:01,067
Concentrate on playing.

380
00:29:03,884 --> 00:29:04,823
Okay.

381
00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:08,793
Sister, new script.

382
00:29:09,925 --> 00:29:12,123
This one's coming soon.
Please have a look.

383
00:29:24,307 --> 00:29:25,140
Come in.

384
00:29:26,006 --> 00:29:27,522
Dr. Zhou,
the director wants to talk to you.

385
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:28,726
Yeah, I got it.

386
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,057
You haven't seen each other
in a long time, have you?

387
00:29:52,141 --> 00:29:53,106
Be happy.

388
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,026
Be enthusiastic.

389
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:56,261
After sitting here it will happen.

390
00:29:56,345 --> 00:29:57,646
Those girls and wenches.

391
00:29:58,168 --> 00:29:59,638
Just let them stand on either side.

392
00:30:00,197 --> 00:30:01,292
Show the...

393
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:05,714
-Are you okay?
-Nothing.

394
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,970
Show the majesty of a master.

395
00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:09,848
Just walk comfortably.

396
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:14,825
Would you like to drink some water?

397
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,800
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine

398
00:30:15,884 --> 00:30:16,717
Just a minute.

399
00:30:17,143 --> 00:30:18,125
-Okay.
-Really caught a cold.

400
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:20,216
What else don't you understand.
Just ask me.

401
00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:22,329
Everyone says that...

402
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:25,812
you are our important doctor
in this hospital.

403
00:30:26,941 --> 00:30:27,855
Let me ask you.

404
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:30,953
Compared with me...

405
00:30:31,645 --> 00:30:32,957
Which one is more powerful?

406
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:34,726
Of course you are.

407
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:36,642
Yes, yes.

408
00:30:36,726 --> 00:30:38,486
That's what I thought.

409
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,753
A knife.

410
00:30:40,195 --> 00:30:41,251
Whenever...

411
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:42,988
All the best is the older one.

412
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:43,999
Do you think so?

413
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,515
So. This operation is not that difficult.

414
00:30:47,618 --> 00:30:49,655
I'll leave it to you.

415
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:50,685
Well.

416
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,366
Don't let me down.

417
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:56,185
It looks like...

418
00:30:57,014 --> 00:30:58,536
She is not pretending it.

419
00:30:59,006 --> 00:30:59,864
I told you.

420
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:01,694
No one want to do that for nothing.

421
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:02,809
Those tricks.

422
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:05,021
Don't judge so quickly.

423
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:08,043
There are many bad guys
in the world.

424
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,608
We couldn't be more careful.

425
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,243
Don't worry.

426
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:13,768
I have you.

427
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:16,612
The skillful and thorough superwoman.

428
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,369
I can do everything.

429
00:31:19,623 --> 00:31:20,773
Look at you!

430
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:23,153
Jinbei. Are you here?

431
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:24,583
I'll get it.

432
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,369
What's up?

433
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:34,409
We'll have a sister-on-sister scene later.

434
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,356
I want to talk with Jinbei
about the emotion.

435
00:31:36,846 --> 00:31:38,303
-Beibei.
-Coming.

436
00:31:39,307 --> 00:31:40,231
All right, come here.

437
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:42,333
It's windy out there.
Be careful not to cough again.

438
00:31:42,576 --> 00:31:43,686
I'll just stand here.

439
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,246
Don't transfer the virus to your bus.

440
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,689
-I'll come down.
-No, thanks.

441
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:51,118
It's easy to talk like that.

442
00:31:52,926 --> 00:31:54,140
This is going to be a scene.

443
00:31:54,224 --> 00:31:55,676
Sister finally becomes angry.

444
00:31:56,036 --> 00:31:57,286
Slapped me in the face.

445
00:31:57,935 --> 00:31:59,966
So you want me to pretend when I hit you.

446
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,619
No, no, just the opposite.

447
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:04,011
Sister should have her own emotional play.

448
00:32:04,286 --> 00:32:05,846
So let's do it really then.

449
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:07,608
Just do it.

450
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:09,132
-Well.
-Bye.

451
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,049
Bye.

452
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:12,999
Shiyun.

453
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:18,926
You always do things carefully
for this operation.

454
00:32:19,475 --> 00:32:22,310
You can't be distracted.

455
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:29,782
You should be careful all the time.

456
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:34,090
The same goes when you talk to your boss.

457
00:32:38,193 --> 00:32:39,203
Shiyun.

458
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:41,612
What did you say?

459
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:44,440
I said this operation...

460
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,582
You really need to take it seriously.

461
00:32:47,686 --> 00:32:50,809
This time the patient
is the majority shareholder's...

462
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:53,510
the second cousin of the aunt's brother.

463
00:32:53,595 --> 00:32:54,782
She is so serious when she's sick.

464
00:32:54,867 --> 00:32:56,218
Gao Zitong really works hard.

465
00:32:56,371 --> 00:32:59,286
If I were her
I'd be sleeping in a hotel room.

466
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,690
Why do I think it's not that simple?

467
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:04,240
You have to let me think.

468
00:33:05,072 --> 00:33:06,399
What do you have in mind?

469
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,234
It was me who slapped her,
not the other way around.

470
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,815
You might have a beauty sleep
if you have time.

471
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,141
It's not sending.

472
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:20,560
Sorry. I was busy.

473
00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:21,821
I'll take care of myself.

474
00:33:21,905 --> 00:33:22,977
You too.

475
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:29,892
Don't worry. Director.

476
00:33:29,976 --> 00:33:31,002
I'm ready for the operation.

477
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:31,959
No problem.

478
00:33:37,704 --> 00:33:39,994
What's the matter these days?

479
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,119
Sister.

480
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:45,420
Life is short.

481
00:33:45,846 --> 00:33:47,884
Love is not easy to get.

482
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:50,886
Why should you care so much?

483
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,123
You hate me.

484
00:33:52,686 --> 00:33:54,102
You may haggle with me.

485
00:33:54,526 --> 00:33:56,982
Why would you want to go after a girl?

486
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,774
If you like,

487
00:33:59,108 --> 00:34:01,237
I can talk to the owner for you.

488
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:02,886
But why Ling'er?

489
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:04,875
You did this to her.

490
00:34:05,246 --> 00:34:06,463
She went away with a grudge.

491
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:08,151
Just for me.

492
00:34:08,406 --> 00:34:10,446
Yes. It's you!

493
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:12,015
You are always praising your kindness.

494
00:34:12,223 --> 00:34:13,598
You are always failing to going
for what you want when necessary

495
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:17,436
Till now, you still put on airs

496
00:34:18,046 --> 00:34:19,860
You don't care about money and treasure.

497
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:22,438
You even don't give a shit to God's bless

498
00:34:23,486 --> 00:34:25,158
In the Zhao's Grand Courtyard,

499
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:28,766
calculating and scheming abound
plots in secret are everywhere.

500
00:34:30,387 --> 00:34:31,804
My dear sister,

501
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:34,774
you can rest assured without any anxiety
in your current place

502
00:34:34,888 --> 00:34:36,921
I'm the one deserving your thanks.

503
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:41,636
If I hadn't made a prompt decision
to get rid of your obstacles,

504
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:43,564
we would have never enjoyed all luxuries.

505
00:34:45,966 --> 00:34:46,799
By the way,

506
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:51,655
On her deathbed
she still murmured your name.

507
00:34:52,246 --> 00:34:55,806
She thought it's you
who stabbed her in the back.

508
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:58,451
And then she just kept her eyes
widely open,

509
00:34:58,885 --> 00:35:00,458
and finally died with a grievance.

510
00:35:01,846 --> 00:35:02,984
Shame on you.

511
00:35:06,846 --> 00:35:07,680
Cut!

512
00:35:07,764 --> 00:35:09,013
-NG
-Are you okay?

513
00:35:09,097 --> 00:35:09,930
Nothing.

514
00:35:10,261 --> 00:35:11,403
Come on.

515
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:13,083
Sorry, director.

516
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:15,470
Three, two, one.

517
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:16,532
Action.

518
00:35:16,846 --> 00:35:17,844
Shame on you.

519
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:22,886
Cut.

520
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:25,792
Shame on you.

521
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,757
-You missed.
-Once again.

522
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:31,487
Shame on you.

523
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:33,799
Sorry.

524
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:35,094
Again.

525
00:35:35,178 --> 00:35:36,414
Come on, action.

526
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:39,443
Shame on you.

527
00:35:44,966 --> 00:35:46,066
Cut, NG.

528
00:35:46,526 --> 00:35:47,579
Shame on you.

529
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:52,724
Cut.

530
00:35:53,187 --> 00:35:54,020
Are you okay?

531
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,027
Nothing.

532
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:57,232
What's going on?

533
00:35:57,704 --> 00:35:58,766
It's all good just now.

534
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:00,571
Why are you always failing
to the last take.

535
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,278
Zitong had a cold.

536
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:04,972
Well, what's going on with you, Miss Su?
How come you also cough?

537
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,411
-I'm really sorry for that.
-Sorry, director.

538
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:10,259
Jinbei must be infected by me.

539
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:12,225
I'm really sorry for that.

540
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:13,946
How about another take?

541
00:36:15,218 --> 00:36:16,051
NG

542
00:36:16,277 --> 00:36:17,197
Hurry up!

543
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,376
Jinbei.

544
00:36:19,536 --> 00:36:21,850
Hit me. It doesn't matter.
We can make it this time

545
00:36:28,825 --> 00:36:29,974
Okay, come on.

546
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:32,798
Ready!

547
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:34,285
Come on, action.

548
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:35,884
Three, two, one.

549
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:36,862
Action!

550
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:37,928
Shame on you.

551
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:45,581
Cut!

552
00:36:45,698 --> 00:36:47,126
Good take! Let's call it a day!

553
00:36:47,857 --> 00:36:49,566
-Thank you, director.
-Many thanks!

554
00:36:49,898 --> 00:36:50,806
It's wonderful!

555
00:36:51,037 --> 00:36:52,307
-How is your face?
-It's fine.

556
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:53,839
Alright. Let's go.

557
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:54,756
Well.

558
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:05,856
Sis.

559
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:23,686
Gosh, something terrible had happened.

560
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:25,329
What's going on?

561
00:37:27,046 --> 00:37:28,126
Go look for yourself.

562
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:33,534
Su Jinbei bullied junior
on the filming site.

563
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:36,075
Making actress Gao Zitong...

564
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:39,893
disfigured on site.

565
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,039
Su Jinbei gets in trouble this time.

566
00:37:42,582 --> 00:37:46,086
Indeed.
She was amiable when in hospital.

567
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:47,406
How come she hit others?

568
00:37:47,886 --> 00:37:48,895
Who knows?

569
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,294
-Cats hide their claws.
-You've heard of it.

570
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:52,158
Last time
you were scolded for gossip.

571
00:37:53,216 --> 00:37:55,194
It is also unacceptable to talk casually.

572
00:38:11,516 --> 00:38:12,349
Sis.

573
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:14,398
Why don't we go to the hospital?

574
00:38:14,516 --> 00:38:16,091
No, thanks, give me a break.

575
00:38:16,787 --> 00:38:18,831
Alright.
Go home and have a rest.

576
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:20,319
Remember to drink a lot of water!

577
00:38:20,566 --> 00:38:21,399
Don't worry.

578
00:38:22,274 --> 00:38:23,107
Okay.

579
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:29,963
It is cold in your room.

580
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:36,620
Why is the power out?

581
00:39:13,715 --> 00:39:14,675
Hey.

582
00:39:14,963 --> 00:39:16,242
Were you on set?

583
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:17,887
Why is your voice so low?

584
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:19,211
I'm home now.

585
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:20,250
I'm sick.

586
00:39:20,503 --> 00:39:21,336
What's wrong?

587
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:22,926
Severe or not?

588
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:30,265
Never mind, just a cold.

589
00:39:32,516 --> 00:39:33,349
Hello?

590
00:39:34,475 --> 00:39:35,308
Su Jinbei.

591
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:36,524
Hello?

592
00:39:37,796 --> 00:39:38,629
Hello?

593
00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:40,323
Su Jinbei, can you hear me?

594
00:39:44,431 --> 00:39:45,264
Su Jinbei?

595
00:39:46,006 --> 00:39:47,946
If you can hear me talk to me!

596
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:50,974
Hey.

597
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:52,999
Hey.
