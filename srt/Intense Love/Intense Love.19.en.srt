3
00:01:36,953 --> 00:01:38,256
In our mind,

4
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:40,639
you are brave and smart.

5
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,880
How can you believe the gossips online?

6
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:44,200
-That's right.
-Okay, okay.

7
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:46,490
We can discuss this.

8
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:49,120
You don't have to praise me like this.

9
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:51,513
Whatever the truth is,

10
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:55,440
our website was affected.

11
00:01:56,391 --> 00:01:58,676
I'll pay your loss.

12
00:01:58,717 --> 00:01:59,559
You?

13
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,900
No, Mr. Yue.

14
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:06,150
She means we will cooperate
with all your needs.

15
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,690
Alright.

16
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,273
Since you are just friends
with Mr. Zhou.

17
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,400
Why don't you take a
live video or an interview...

18
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,520
to clear this up in front of the public.

19
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:18,024
As a public figure,

20
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:19,240
I already have little privacy.

21
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:22,090
I won't hurt my friend
and take away his.

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,804
-No.
-Beibei.

23
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:26,095
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:27,988
Beibei.

25
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,400
-Your coffee.
-Okay, thanks.

26
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:36,409
Zitong.

27
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,059
On the official Weibo of The Pursuer,

28
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,775
the public welcomes you most.

29
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,660
What do you think?

30
00:02:42,903 --> 00:02:44,678
Do you want to be the leading actress?

31
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:48,281
Isn't it decided on Sister Jinbei?

32
00:02:48,656 --> 00:02:49,581
Don't mention it.

33
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:51,654
The news about his boyfriend...

34
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,195
is buzzing.

35
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:55,288
Boyfriend?

36
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,635
Not fiance?

37
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,516
Fiance?

38
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:01,751
I shouldn't have said that.

39
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,435
What...

40
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:04,640
Isn't this nonsense?

41
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:08,240
I'm right to change the actress.

42
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,560
Zitong.

43
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,101
Do you have time.

44
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,880
Yes,

45
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:18,990
but how can I grab the play from Jinbei.

46
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,625
We are close.

47
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,866
I know you are kind,

48
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:25,675
but you know
how hard it is to shoot a play.

49
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:27,246
We have to avoid the risks.

50
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,040
It's great that you have time.

51
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:31,181
We will discuss
the followings with Mr. Shui.

52
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,600
It's done?

53
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:47,662
I see.

54
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:50,480
What?

55
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:54,600
You are totally serious
with Professor Zhou.

56
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:58,125
So you can't
agree with their requirements.

57
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:05,120
I'm sorry, Didi.

58
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:06,848
I don't want to do that.

59
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:09,200
That would hurt him.

60
00:04:10,302 --> 00:04:12,760
Don't you worry about your career at all.

61
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:17,920
If I can only choose one
from my fame and him.

62
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,165
I choose him.

63
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,875
Sorry, Jiawei.

64
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:29,384
I lied to you,

65
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:30,850
but I didn't mean it.

66
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,780
I have fell in love with
you for many years!

67
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:38,440
I'm so happy and excited
to be your assistance by your side...

68
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:41,152
especially when I see you work so hard.

69
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,040
You are more perfect than I think.

70
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:46,800
I hope
I can support you with all my efforts.

71
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:50,975
So I dare not to tell you
that I'm Wuque.

72
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,375
I'm afraid you would
think that I'm cheating you,

73
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:56,680
but I have to tell you...

74
00:04:57,412 --> 00:04:58,887
because the longer it goes,

75
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,225
the harder it is to tell the truth.

76
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,575
I'm wrong, Jiawei.

77
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:05,907
Please forgive me just this once.

78
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,540
Okay.

79
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:14,601
It's time for the battle.

80
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:28,800
-Yes.
-Xiaozhou, you've come just in time.

81
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,283
Check it out...

82
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:32,280
the contact number of the
person-in-charge of Love for Life website.

83
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,403
Okay.

84
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,385
By the way.

85
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:41,293
Remember.

86
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:43,109
Don't ask for help
from their inside staff.

87
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,907
Contact their person-in-charge.

88
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:45,920
I want to talk to him in person.

89
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:49,098
Okay.

90
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
Hello.

91
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:14,000
Is it Dr. Zhou?

92
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:17,880
This is Wu Di.

93
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:21,016
Finally,

94
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:23,182
I think I have to call you.

95
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:27,040
It's about Beibei.

96
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:42,734
Jiawei.

97
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:44,040
It's done.

98
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:45,810
The person-in-charge is
under the surname of Yue...

99
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,450
3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

100
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,664
But your work...

101
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:51,600
Cancel them.

102
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:53,065
It...

103
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:55,469
Tell them I'm sick.

104
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:03,120
I'll go outside.

105
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,800
As long as you don't seek
responsibility from Su Jinbei,

106
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,800
I can be your spokesman for free.

107
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:22,480
It looks like Miss Su
is important to Mr. Xu.

108
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,652
But that's not the point.

109
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:25,959
I'm not seeking responsibility.

110
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:29,960
The mistake of Miss Su
has caused huge loss to our website.

111
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:32,760
What do you want?

112
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:37,575
I know that Gao Zitong
are in the same company.

113
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,700
If you two can be the spokesmen
for our website.

114
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,754
I believe the loss...

115
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:45,671
can be forgotten.

116
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:47,884
Jiawei, he's fishing in troubled waters.

117
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,025
With your reputation,
there's no need for another star.

118
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:52,743
Mr. Xu,

119
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:54,419
what do you think?

120
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:58,369
No problem.

121
00:07:59,067 --> 00:07:59,907
Okay.

122
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,863
Have a cordial working relationship.

123
00:08:04,904 --> 00:08:05,880
Have a cordial working relationship.

124
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:12,828
Jiawei.

125
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:15,760
Do you feel worthy?

126
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:18,218
What?

127
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:19,363
What are you saying?

128
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:20,818
I mean...

129
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,630
why grievance yourself?

130
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:27,109
Did I?

131
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:28,237
I think it's okay.

132
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:34,560
IS Jinbei special to you?

133
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:41,125
Do you love her?

134
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,699
This question
is beyond an assistance's responsibility.

135
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,800
But I want to know.

136
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:04,884
You are off duty.

137
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:05,880
I won't send you today.

138
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,415
So you traded me for Su Jinbei?

139
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:41,184
It's a normal spokesman work.

140
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:42,900
You can have the money.

141
00:09:43,252 --> 00:09:45,120
I won't take it.

142
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,000
Hello?

143
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,250
Jiawei.

144
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,700
How long have we known each other.

145
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:00,035
For a long time.

146
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:02,765
Yes.

147
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:07,875
I can't even recall how we met.

148
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,477
I remembered when I had nothing.

149
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,223
I sincerely hope someday,

150
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:20,640
I can cooperate with you
and fight on the same stage.

151
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,075
But now you fulfilled my wish.

152
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,295
I feel...

153
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,190
that you are not sincere.

154
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,960
Are you saying that I'm cheating you?

155
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,659
I mean you've never seen me
as a good friend.

156
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,750
You are hiding something.

157
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:41,480
You are hiding the most important thing.

158
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:53,979
I used to like Su Jinbei a lot.

159
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,155
I told her,

160
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:05,246
but there's no place for me in her heart.

161
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:09,288
So...

162
00:11:12,725 --> 00:11:13,565
Forget it.

163
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,400
Why am I telling you these?

164
00:11:17,562 --> 00:11:20,000
I just hope I can be her good friend,

165
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,620
protect...

166
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:23,569
and bless her.

167
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:25,919
I hope she can live happier.

168
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:28,880
So you take the spokesman work for this.

169
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:32,469
The money is just nothing.

170
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,320
I can make more.

171
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,875
If this
can help her through the trouble.

172
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:41,028
I feel worthy.

173
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,850
But she's already with someone else.

174
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,120
Are you sure you want to do this?

175
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:47,931
Even if she's already with someone else,

176
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:51,160
I can still help her.

177
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,040
Right?

178
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:57,280
The matter has so many influence on her.

179
00:11:57,888 --> 00:12:02,225
I don't want to see my friend
end her career like this.

180
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,680
Okay, I got it.

181
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:08,920
I'll do it.

182
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,920
Thank you, Zitong.

183
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:17,503
You're welcome.

184
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,680
You have to keep it a secret for me.

185
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,800
Let's eat.

186
00:12:58,156 --> 00:12:59,210
As long as you don't
seek responsibility from.

187
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,600
Su Jinbei,

188
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:02,520
I can be your spokesman for free.

189
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,325
Why grievance yourself?

190
00:13:05,538 --> 00:13:07,330
I think it's okay.

191
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:10,680
Is Jinbei special to you?

192
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:54,473
I used to like Su Jinbei a lot.

193
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:56,281
I told her,

194
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:03,237
but there's no place for me in her heart.

195
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,360
So...

196
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,390
Forget it.

197
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,225
Why am I telling you these?

198
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:15,046
I just hope I can be her good friend,

199
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,048
protect...

200
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:18,784
and bless her.

201
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:26,359
Wu Di loves to tittle-tattle.

202
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,440
It's good for you.

203
00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:30,960
Jinbei, I agree with her.

204
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:33,520
I can attend the press
conference with you.

205
00:14:35,247 --> 00:14:36,400
No matter how it turns out,

206
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:38,240
we'll face it together.

207
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:45,850
But I think...

208
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:47,250
It's too much for you.

209
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:49,800
You can't destroy your career for love.

210
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,396
If I can make a difference,

211
00:14:58,575 --> 00:14:59,900
it's not too much.

212
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,770
Alright.

213
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,750
Don't hesitate.

214
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:09,148
Listen to me.

215
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:14,531
Thank you for being with me.

216
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:16,846
Baby.

217
00:15:17,802 --> 00:15:19,452
It's my responsibility to make you happy.

218
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,545
I'm your fiance.

219
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:24,571
I'm your fiancee as well.

220
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,700
Lately the public has paid much attention
on the private affairs of Su Jinbei,

221
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,425
so we arranged this interview.

222
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:47,235
I hope this interview
will tell the public the truth.

223
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:48,115
Thanks!

224
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:51,375
Please ask your questions.

225
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,876
Miss Jinbei.

226
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:55,217
Please introduce this man.

227
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:59,840
Are you in a relationship
as it is reported?

228
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,360
He is a doctor...

229
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:05,791
with excellent medical skills,
skillful hands and benevolence.

230
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:07,920
His looks...

231
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:10,600
Well, you can all see.

232
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:13,280
As to our relationship...

233
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:22,915
He...

234
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:25,038
Is my fiance.

235
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,005
Fiance?

236
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:28,680
I've never heard of this.

237
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,946
They've engaged.

238
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:32,600
When we were kids,

239
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,200
our parents
arranged this marriage for us.

240
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,209
When I was in hospital before,

241
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,675
he was my doctor-in-charge.

242
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:42,525
He cured my wounds and my heart.

243
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:47,120
He is cold and talks less.

244
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:48,914
So what?

245
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:51,434
Whenever I need protection,

246
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:54,725
he would appear like a hero
and solve my problems.

247
00:16:55,408 --> 00:16:56,758
He's so patient to me.

248
00:16:57,301 --> 00:16:58,576
He's never afraid of trouble.

249
00:16:59,054 --> 00:17:02,604
The exposure of his personal data online
gave me a heavy psychological pressure.

250
00:17:03,073 --> 00:17:06,360
But he never blamed it in front of me.

251
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,960
I stand here today to tell you that...

252
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:14,076
as you guessed,

253
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:16,840
we are close.

254
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:30,650
He's the one I love.

255
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,685
Jiawei.

256
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:49,565
Hello.

257
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:52,595
Sorry to say goodbye in this way.

258
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,700
I decided to quit my job
for personal reasons.

259
00:17:57,301 --> 00:17:58,626
Take care, Jiawei.

260
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,630
Hope everything is okay with you.

261
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:31,074
Look.

262
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:32,790
The comments are all congratulating me.

263
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:38,175
Although it's a dangerous way,
I won the battle.

264
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,638
Because Dr. Zhou is
so attracting to the public.

265
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,315
They are all praising him online...

266
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,760
saying his handsome
and cute when he blushed.

267
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:52,550
I didn't expect that my honey
has the potential to be a star.

268
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:55,400
So attracting.

269
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,434
By the way.

270
00:18:58,475 --> 00:19:01,125
Love for Life also changed their attitude.

271
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,640
They told me that they
wouldn't seek our responsibility...

272
00:19:03,681 --> 00:19:04,981
and wanted to keep cooperating with us.

273
00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:06,824
What's your opinion?

274
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:08,625
No.

275
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,696
But for the harsh terms of their contract,

276
00:19:10,737 --> 00:19:12,862
I wouldn't have told
the public I was single,

277
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:17,425
causing so many troubles
and it even affected my honey.

278
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:19,969
I'll just say no.

279
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,450
My queens.

280
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:26,040
Dinner's ready.

281
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:27,480
It's wonderful!

282
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:31,625
They rarely come here
and you let Dr. Zhou cook.

283
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:33,440
It's okay.

284
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:35,291
Zhou's cooking is great.

285
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:38,525
And he has a handsome me as an assistance.

286
00:19:38,902 --> 00:19:39,742
No problem.

287
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:45,120
-Honey.
-So tasty, Zhou.

288
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,111
Delicious.

289
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:47,992
For you.

290
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:56,085
Delicious.

291
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:04,823
What's the matter?

292
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,775
I feel happy with Jinbei
even when she has a boyfriend.

293
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,610
It's just a special situation.

294
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,543
I can sacrifice for her.

295
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:22,509
I don't mind.

296
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:25,804
It will all pass.

297
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,760
What the hell?

298
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,550
I really don't know.

299
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:33,871
He did express his love to me,

300
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:35,062
but I don't...

301
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:36,179
You don't have to explain it.

302
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:37,718
I know.

303
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:39,926
You know.

304
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:41,625
I, I...

305
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,470
Dr. Zhou trusts you.

306
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:57,126
What are you doing? Eat.

307
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,010
Eat.

308
00:20:59,062 --> 00:20:59,942
Eat.

309
00:21:00,244 --> 00:21:01,680
-Here you are.
-Let's eat first.

310
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:03,583
This.

311
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,765
It's alright.
Eat.

312
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,150
Delicious.

313
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:17,529
Is it you?

314
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:27,465
Yes.

315
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,490
Why?

316
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,537
When you begged me for Su Jinbei,

317
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:37,800
have you thought about my feelings.

318
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,950
You said those
because you treated me as your friend.

319
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:44,435
Right?

320
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,740
Thank you.

321
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:48,800
So touching.

322
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:53,400
I have no choice but do like this
to express my feeling.

323
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:55,976
Gao Zitong.

324
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,341
I really didn't think you will be that...

325
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,675
That is your contribution!

326
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:07,000
Angry, sad, grievance.

327
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:09,929
Hurt?

328
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,750
It's the same.

329
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:54,917
Sorry, Jinbei.

330
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:56,464
It's my fault

331
00:22:56,787 --> 00:22:58,637
I'll solve it.

332
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,025
So what are you going to do?

333
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,565
Text back.

334
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,729
Sorry!
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

335
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:16,603
How does he plan to solve it?

336
00:23:16,644 --> 00:23:18,744
It's already troublesome here.

337
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,582
Don't make more troubles for me.

338
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,285
What should I do?

339
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,137
Don't panic.

340
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:28,050
In my understanding of him,

341
00:23:28,712 --> 00:23:30,237
he won't hurt you.

342
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,960
I know.

343
00:23:47,812 --> 00:23:51,112
I want to clear something up today.

344
00:23:52,425 --> 00:23:56,080
The gossip between me and Su Jinbei
has never ended.

345
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:58,480
Now is more buzzing.

346
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:00,619
I want to say...

347
00:24:03,188 --> 00:24:04,456
I liked Jinbei.

348
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:06,279
I told her,

349
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:09,880
but it was a long time ago
and she refused me.

350
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,159
She...

351
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:18,196
was right to do so,

352
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,560
because at first I approached
her for a purpose.

353
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:24,095
The gossip of us at first...

354
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,175
was arranged by the company.

355
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:28,240
What's wrong with the young people today!

356
00:24:28,606 --> 00:24:31,000
The company treated you so well
and you repay it with this?

357
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:40,527
Zhang.

358
00:24:42,956 --> 00:24:48,304
Go get the lawyer, accountant here
for an emergency meeting.

359
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:49,185
Okay.

360
00:24:52,597 --> 00:24:53,840
Xu Jiawei.

361
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:57,227
You want to destroy your future.

362
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,800
Don't blame me.

363
00:25:02,553 --> 00:25:04,120
Jinbei never doubted me.

364
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,920
She simply treated me as a brother.

365
00:25:08,344 --> 00:25:09,520
Xu Jiawei, are you mad?

366
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:12,720
I was caring for her,

367
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:17,480
because I don't want her
to suffer a big low point of her life.

368
00:25:18,071 --> 00:25:19,496
I helped her...

369
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,210
as a friend
without any other purposes.

370
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:27,091
The recording online is not real.

371
00:25:28,189 --> 00:25:31,240
It was edited
on purpose by someone.

372
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,875
I can assure you here,

373
00:25:34,594 --> 00:25:35,794
that the story between me and Jinbei...

374
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,050
never started.

375
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,056
Jiawei.

376
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:40,071
but ended long time ago.

377
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,040
You've experienced
a lot to the point here.

378
00:25:44,173 --> 00:25:46,284
Now you just throw yourself behind?

379
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:47,625
Just like all of you who care for her.

380
00:25:48,326 --> 00:25:50,151
I saw her engagement.

381
00:25:52,323 --> 00:25:53,240
I want to say...

382
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:57,120
best wishes to you, Jinbei.

383
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,625
I don't expect that Xu
Jiawei would help me like this.

384
00:26:04,337 --> 00:26:08,040
I hope this
will not affect him too much.

385
00:26:11,156 --> 00:26:12,631
Are you jealous?

386
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,240
No.

387
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:16,265
I trust him...

388
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:19,690
and I believe you more.

389
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:41,521
Beibei.

390
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:53,565
I had a nightmare.

391
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:56,467
I dreamed that.

392
00:27:57,195 --> 00:27:58,745
I fell into a swamp.

393
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:01,901
I kept struggling but kept falling deeper.

394
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:06,266
I waved my hand
trying to grab something but I failed.

395
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:09,480
I just fell and fell and fell.

396
00:28:10,752 --> 00:28:11,592
Don't be afraid.

397
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:13,127
I'm here.

398
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,720
But I can't sleep.

399
00:28:21,756 --> 00:28:22,656
Follow me.

400
00:28:30,998 --> 00:28:32,148
I like this.

401
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:42,035
Wait a moment.

402
00:28:48,946 --> 00:28:51,240
Wear this.

403
00:28:52,238 --> 00:28:53,680
It can protect your wrist.

404
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:00,765
Sign on it.

405
00:29:01,845 --> 00:29:02,685
Quick.

406
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,214
Okay.

407
00:29:08,804 --> 00:29:09,964
When I'm wearing this,

408
00:29:10,005 --> 00:29:12,105
it's like my honey is holding my wrist.

409
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:14,099
Come on.

410
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:53,512
What's up?

411
00:29:54,187 --> 00:29:55,031
No.

412
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,912
Don't be shameless.

413
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:01,441
I won.

414
00:30:06,312 --> 00:30:07,152
Honey.

415
00:30:07,653 --> 00:30:08,493
Thank you.

416
00:30:10,197 --> 00:30:11,037
You're welcome.

417
00:30:12,151 --> 00:30:15,276
Being with you
is the luckiest thing to happen to me.

418
00:30:16,596 --> 00:30:17,721
I'm so happy.

419
00:30:18,933 --> 00:30:19,960
Baby.

420
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:29,979
Jinbei.

421
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,053
I've worked on this soap
opera for a long time,

422
00:30:33,594 --> 00:30:36,144
but the customer still doesn't
want to sign the contract.

423
00:30:36,921 --> 00:30:39,846
They say that the leading
role is a rookie in the workplace...

424
00:30:40,475 --> 00:30:41,950
and you don't fit that.

425
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:45,537
It shouldn't be
I look young and energetic.

426
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:46,578
Why don't I fit?

427
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:48,575
That's the past.

428
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,255
Now you are engaged,

429
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:54,262
you are a mature woman now to the public.

430
00:30:55,874 --> 00:30:58,350
It doesn't matter.

431
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,275
I'll just act a mature
woman in the workplace.

432
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:03,842
Have them change the script
I've never tried this kind of role before.

433
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,240
Jinbei.

434
00:31:07,025 --> 00:31:08,300
Listen carefully.

435
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,500
The current situation of
the industry is not very good,

436
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,736
you know,

437
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:19,850
it's not easy to have a play
and it could be your only chance.

438
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:22,728
-Cherish it.
-Okay.

439
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:26,084
Since you've told the public
about the engagement,

440
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,025
there's nothing we can do.

441
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,375
You have to be careful...

442
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,410
and keep a low key.

443
00:31:32,854 --> 00:31:34,454
Okay, I will.

444
00:31:34,801 --> 00:31:35,880
Wu Di,

445
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,312
keep an eye on Jinbei.

446
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:39,696
You must help her.

447
00:31:40,587 --> 00:31:42,812
I know, Mr. Wang I will.

448
00:31:43,717 --> 00:31:44,557
Okay.

449
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,621
Finally.

450
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:58,625
It's not easy for him lately.

451
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:08,100
I have something urgent.
I got to go.

452
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,290
Dr. Zhou.

453
00:32:10,776 --> 00:32:11,616
Be careful.

454
00:32:11,657 --> 00:32:12,497
Don't worry.

455
00:32:17,656 --> 00:32:19,320
Hello, Zitong.

456
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,800
Is everything alright?

457
00:32:23,112 --> 00:32:23,987
That's good.

458
00:32:25,087 --> 00:32:28,080
Is food at the shooting site delicious?

459
00:32:30,404 --> 00:32:33,200
Mr. Shui is afraid that
you won't like the food.

460
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:34,948
So I found a cook for you specially.

461
00:32:38,921 --> 00:32:39,796
It's a bit spicy.

462
00:32:40,462 --> 00:32:42,440
Is she from Sichuan?

463
00:32:42,948 --> 00:32:46,000
I tell her to put less chili
or we can change a cook.

464
00:32:48,714 --> 00:32:50,789
Zitong don't hesitate
to tell me your needs.

465
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,825
I'm here to provide service for you
and be your shield.

466
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,880
Okay, bye.

467
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:02,686
Mr. Shui.

468
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:06,000
What's up?

469
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:11,640
Why are my work all cancelled?

470
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:13,560
It's great.

471
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:16,586
You can have some rest.

472
00:33:19,023 --> 00:33:20,608
Don't you like music.

473
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:22,998
You can produce music now.

474
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,560
It's good.

475
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,675
The company wants to prohibit me
from appearing in the media, right?

476
00:33:30,253 --> 00:33:31,153
You see.

477
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:32,827
Not easy!

478
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:35,348
You're right.

479
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,080
You will be shut out by all media.

480
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:44,900
I admit that I was too impulsive
about the live video,

481
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:47,800
but I just told the truth
I wasn't wrong, right?

482
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,700
Then the company is right.

483
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,019
You have to take the consequence.

484
00:33:52,711 --> 00:33:54,373
You're not a child,

485
00:33:54,414 --> 00:33:55,440
you should know this.

486
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:57,679
Then I want to terminate the contract.

487
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:02,415
Okay.

488
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,475
But you have to pay the liquidated damages
and the fee of abroad training.

489
00:34:38,236 --> 00:34:39,076
Honey.

490
00:34:42,518 --> 00:34:44,993
There aren't any people in the bookstore.

491
00:34:46,006 --> 00:34:47,281
No, it's membership-oriented.

492
00:34:47,898 --> 00:34:49,248
No one will bother you.

493
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:01,489
Flowers.

494
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,775
Honey, take a picture for me.

495
00:35:15,504 --> 00:35:16,879
Here you are.

496
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,881
Not okay from this angle.

497
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:26,896
Squat!

498
00:35:26,937 --> 00:35:28,154
My face looks too big in this.

499
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:29,869
Squat!

500
00:35:49,513 --> 00:35:50,488
Do you finish?

501
00:35:51,194 --> 00:35:52,034
Come on.

502
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:10,301
Let me see.

503
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:13,675
Honey, you're so talented.

504
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:14,997
Oh, honey.

505
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:16,713
We haven't taken a picture together yet.

506
00:36:16,912 --> 00:36:17,987
Let's take a picture.

507
00:36:18,028 --> 00:36:19,942
Please.

508
00:36:20,035 --> 00:36:21,135
Never.

509
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,875
Come on.

510
00:36:25,156 --> 00:36:26,881
One, two.
