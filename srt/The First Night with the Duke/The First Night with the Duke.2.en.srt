1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,890
<i>All child actors appeared with
guardian consent and were filmed safely.</i>

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,640
<i>Animal scenes were staged and
followed expert welfare guidelines.</i>

3
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,330
Did I drink too much?

4
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,110
Is this a dream?

5
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,040
Or am I still in the novel?

6
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,370
Why is it so complicated?

7
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,870
Gosh, whatever.

8
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,020
Right?

9
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,060
<i>Eun Ae comes out for a night walk</i>

10
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,670
<i>and she meets Yi Beon.</i>

11
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,950
<i>I think that long-awaited moment happens now.</i>

12
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,970
I can't miss a highlight like that.

13
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,480
Where's Eun Ae?

14
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,500
Is she not here yet?

15
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,570
<i>His features look like delicately sculpted ice.</i>

16
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,180
<i>A perfect-looking man.</i>

17
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,210
<i>What? Why does this feel familiar?</i>

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,270
By chance, are you...

19
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,310
the male lead, Yi Beon, Prince Gyeongseong?

20
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,700
Gosh, it's you. It's you.

21
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,140
I finally did it.

22
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,040
Shake my hand.

23
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,530
This is so crazy.

24
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,930
Did you lose your mind?

25
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,250
If you try to do anything funny,

26
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,910
you might lose your fingers.

27
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,870
Go ahead and try.

28
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,630
The worst thing that could happen is me dying

29
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,480
in this novel.

30
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,840
You are staring at me directly

31
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,740
when you know who I am?

32
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,930
Because the rumor says something horrific

33
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,350
happens to you if you make eye contact with you?

34
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,450
Why don't I check if that rumor

35
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,720
is true or not?

36
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,400
Try cutting these lips in half, too.

37
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,880
You can't do it.

38
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,750
To be honest, I know everything.

39
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,380
The secrets you keep.

40
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,310
Because you don't want to kill anyone,

41
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,180
you created such rumors yourself.

42
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,430
Even though you'd be left alone,

43
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,880
you chose to be lonely

44
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,180
than to be in agony.

45
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,760
It's not your fault.

46
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,640
You did nothing wrong.

47
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,410
Why...

48
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,460
are you so sure that you know...

49
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,250
- so well about me?
- It's because...

50
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,520
I read your mind completely.

51
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,460
You felt hurt because you were lonely.

52
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,030
But once you fall in love,

53
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,080
you're good to your woman.

54
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,120
<i>No woman ever told me</i>

55
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,060
<i>something like that.</i>

56
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,360
[Episode 2: The first night in this life]

57
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,160
[Episode 2: The first night in Yi Beon's life]

58
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,560
Gosh, my head.

59
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,620
What are you doing?

60
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,150
<i>My Lord.</i>

61
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,540
What do I do? What do I do?

62
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,780
Were you into this kind of thing?

63
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,260
<i>My Lord.</i>

64
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,190
No, no, no.

65
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,140
This is not reality. This is not the novel. No...

66
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,640
This is... What do you call it?

67
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,470
Trying to evade what happened last night,

68
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,390
if you're pretending not to remember...

69
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,550
Or if you're playing ignorant
because you think so lightly

70
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,460
of this between a man and a woman,

71
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,600
so that you do not think such a thing again,

72
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,420
I will make sure to...

73
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,280
crush this small head of yours.

74
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,620
So, you had better...

75
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,600
wait here until I come back.

76
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,770
I had a one-night stand...

77
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,210
with someone else's man?

78
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,030
Be calm. Let's think this through.

79
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,830
Feeling upset from the Dahong Club meeting,

80
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,320
<i>Eun Ae was walking alone and</i>

81
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,940
<i>ran into Yi Beon by the water.</i>

82
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,390
<i>By chance, because of me,</i>

83
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,220
did they miss their first encounter?

84
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,760
Gosh, that can't be...

85
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,530
But that could actually be the case...

86
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,900
This is unsettling.

87
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,370
Why did I black out at that moment?

88
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,780
I need to check on my own.

89
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,960
By chance,

90
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,980
is my wish coming true, My Lord?

91
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,400
Or will she become a Buddhist nun, too?

92
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,560
Was it your wish for me to marry?

93
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,240
You know well.

94
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,020
But you said you will never marry.

95
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,770
So, I thought that was the case.

96
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,100
The women who crossed paths with you once

97
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,400
are forced to become Buddhist nuns,
according to a rumor.

98
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,470
Rumors can be useful sometimes.

99
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,410
It was a rumor you started, of course.

100
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:04,230
By the way, how...

101
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,630
<i>To be honest, I know everything.</i>

102
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,760
<i>The secrets you keep.</i>

103
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,020
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

104
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,960
<i>You did nothing wrong.</i>

105
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,510
Make sure she doesn't leave
Hoseondang until I return.

106
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,700
Yes, sir.

107
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,000
She is different than most noble women.

108
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,880
So, take extra care.

109
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,940
It might be good to prepare a wedding proposal.

110
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,620
Already?

111
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,550
Did the sun rise from the west today?

112
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,020
Are you in there?

113
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,190
Are you in there?

114
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,850
Is she still sleeping?

115
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,870
Why is it so complicated?

116
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,070
What is this, an escape room?

117
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,750
Gosh, is this right?

118
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,390
You've got to be kidding.

119
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,790
Hello.

120
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,850
Hello.

121
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,340
Which way should I go to exit?

122
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,490
Well, t-that way.

123
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,370
- Thank you.
- Sure.

124
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,120
Who is she, by the way?

125
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,600
I wonder.

126
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,260
Looks like she came from the guest room.

127
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,010
No way. At Hoseondang,

128
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,760
there is no woman except for the cook lady.

129
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,330
Is she a thief, by chance?

130
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,530
We should catch her, then.

131
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,510
Hold on. We cannot catch her.

132
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,660
She could be a thief...

133
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,700
who stole the Lord's heart.

134
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,200
What happened yesterday, anyway?

135
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,240
So, what happened to Eun Ae, then?

136
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,220
<i>This must be the place.</i>

137
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,000
Lady Sun Chaek.

138
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,860
What happened yesterday?

139
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,170
I was scared because you suddenly disappeared.

140
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,230
I must've drank too much last night.

141
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,760
I don't remember so well.

142
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,460
I prepared a tea that is good for a hangover.

143
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,530
Shall we?

144
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,970
Yes.

145
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,320
Thank you so much for
helping me in a bind last night.

146
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,950
I will forever be grateful.

147
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,360
Well...

148
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,740
I think I was...

149
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,080
slightly drunk last night.

150
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,350
Did I make a mistake in front of people

151
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,600
or cause trouble by chance?

152
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,680
Mistake? Oh, no.

153
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,900
What are they called... your cocktails?

154
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,050
- Right?
- Yes...

155
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,400
Everyone was talking about them last night.

156
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,160
The teahouse was packed with people

157
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,320
who came to see your cocktails.

158
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,480
Is that so?

159
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,480
Yes. We will serve cocktails
for the full moon, too.

160
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,660
Could you teach me your know-how later, My Lady?

161
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,610
H-How to make cocktails?

162
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,540
Well, if that's what you want.

163
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,930
By chance,

164
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,370
d-did something else happen last night?

165
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,390
Something else?

166
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,990
<i>Did Yi Beon and Eun Ae even meet last night?</i>

167
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,470
Nothing else happened.

168
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,020
Everyone went home happy, thanks to you.

169
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,140
Everything went well.

170
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,120
I see.

171
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,160
<i>They couldn't meet because of me.</i>

172
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,730
Did you not run into someone named Yi Beon

173
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,380
or the Prince Gyeongseong briefly, by chance?

174
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,570
I have heard of him many times,

175
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,270
but I have never met him in person.

176
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,250
I heard that Prince Gyeongseong
frequents this area these days.

177
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,910
Aren't you curious?

178
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,940
- Really?
- Yes.

179
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,800
That is a bit scary.

180
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,310
I heard you cannot upset him or

181
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,390
make eye contact with him.

182
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,980
I do not have a lot of connections,

183
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,970
but the teahouse people told me about him.

184
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,250
But he might not be as scary as you think.

185
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,730
Rumors are just rumors.

186
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,160
Have you heard?

187
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,350
According to what I heard recently...

188
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,260
since he has no interest in women,

189
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,140
there's a rumor that there might
be something wrong with him.

190
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,160
Gosh, that's not true.

191
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,100
To be exact, he's full of vitality...

192
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,550
<i>I thought I didn't remember.</i>

193
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,360
<i>I remember now.</i>

194
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,150
<i>Crazy.</i>

195
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:44,080
I still have not broken away
from my brother's influence yet.

196
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,660
Is it because I lack virtue?

197
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,690
It took long because it was
an undercover operation.

198
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:54,260
You do not have to worry
about Heuksa Clan for a while.

199
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,940
I need to get China's approval.

200
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,530
I need to be appointed officially

201
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,540
so the former King's remaining factions
can't run wild any longer.

202
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,510
Prince Gyeongseong, what do you think?

203
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,540
Our relationship with China is important,

204
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,910
but securing people's support comes first.

205
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,020
Since you've been focusing
on destroying the rebels,

206
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,850
you're not thinking clearly.

207
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,740
Getting acknowledged by China

208
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,660
will naturally win the people's support.

209
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,210
I have not...

210
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,330
won your support yet, Prince Gyeongseong.

211
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,450
- That is not true-
- If not,

212
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,780
I would like you to lead the envoys

213
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,120
that I am sending to China.

214
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,310
Take grains, visit the Emperor,

215
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,570
and bring me my official appointment.

216
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,210
Forgive me, Your Majesty,

217
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,830
but I do not think I would be

218
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,710
able to join the envoys.

219
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,960
Is there a particular reason?

220
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,760
There is something I need to take care of.

221
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,420
I will not be able to for a while.

222
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,910
Something to take care of?

223
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,480
I...

224
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,710
have someone I would like to marry, Your Majesty.

225
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,520
You hold no prejudices

226
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,660
and you speak up regardless of hierarchy.

227
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,820
You even corrected the rumor
regarding Prince Gyeongseong.

228
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,910
You are such a great person.

229
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,710
<i>You are meant to end up with the male lead</i>

230
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:39,660
<i>and that would make this story
and my life easier, too.</i>

231
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,090
I think I developed a crush.

232
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,570
- Pardon?
- On you, My Lady.

233
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,480
Can I dare ask you to be my friend?

234
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,190
I would like to see you often.

235
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,650
U-Us being friends is...

236
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,670
It might be kind of difficult.

237
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,000
Of course, you dislike me, too.

238
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,830
I am sorry. I should have known better.

239
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,470
I dare asked to befriend the minister's daughter.

240
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,860
No, it's not like that.

241
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,750
I am an orphan with an unknown origin

242
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,550
and they say I seduced my father
and got adopted as a mistress...

243
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,790
Who says that?

244
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,430
I'm very aware of how great of a person you are.

245
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,280
Even when you struggle or are sad,

246
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,510
you help others who struggle more than you.

247
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,430
You're such a blessing.

248
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,220
How dare they say bullshit like that...

249
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,880
Let's be friends, okay?

250
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,260
You aren't allowed to say
something so pitiful, okay?

251
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,100
Lady Sun Chaek.

252
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,730
How about you join the envoys in three months?

253
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,120
Get married during that time.

254
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,660
Your wedding will be

255
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,450
treated with utmost respect in the royal court.

256
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,100
You will not refuse this, will you?

257
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,210
All right, then.

258
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,330
I will follow your order.

259
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,620
You should also experience the family affection

260
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,490
you didn't know about for a while.

261
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,910
I will take my leave.

262
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,530
All right.

263
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,650
He suddenly wants to get married.

264
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,460
What is he thinking?

265
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,380
Watch him closely from now on.

266
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

267
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,170
Is that not the Prince Gyeongseong?

268
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,490
Looks like he just visited His Majesty.

269
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,310
Prince Gyeongseong.

270
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,440
Queen Mother.

271
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,250
What happened to you?

272
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,670
Your handsome face looks so tired.

273
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,350
Did you have a serious
conversation at the Main Hall?

274
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,300
It is nothing.

275
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,850
If so, I think you need a wife to care for you.

276
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,510
That would liven up your face a little.

277
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,480
I am planning to invite all the daughters

278
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,200
of noble families at the banquet early this month.

279
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,740
How about you find a wife there?

280
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,350
I appreciate your concern,

281
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,210
but I will choose who I will marry.

282
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,100
I will take my leave now.

283
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,820
Fine.

284
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,190
He insidiously hides his feelings.

285
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,830
It is impossible to know what he is thinking.

286
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,700
Is it still about what happened then?

287
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,740
How could he be so sharp as a razor?

288
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,200
The thing is...

289
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,130
Is that true?

290
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,860
He took in a woman last night?

291
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,440
Not only did I have a one-night
stand with the male lead,

292
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,530
I befriended the female lead, too.

293
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,740
This isn't right.

294
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,090
Yes. This happened because of me.

295
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,140
I need to correct things somehow.

296
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,630
Gosh, what do I do?

297
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,810
My Lady!

298
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,100
Lady Sun Chaek!

299
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,430
My Lady... My Lady...

300
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,190
My Lady, where did you spend the night last night?

301
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,330
Something serious happened.

302
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,310
Things can't get any worse than it is.

303
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,450
You should have warned me sooner.

304
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,110
I had no idea you had a lover.

305
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,320
What do you mean a lover?

306
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,630
Gosh, you are so clueless.

307
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,450
You are about to get married.

308
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,420
Get married?

309
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:43,880
<i>A wedding proposal for you just arrived.</i>

310
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,160
So, did my family see it?

311
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,320
They are not home right now.

312
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,700
I wanted to warn you
before His Excellency gets home.

313
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,840
But he should be coming home soon.

314
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,210
<i>I'm getting married at this point?</i>

315
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,670
<i>No, I need to stop it.</i>

316
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,250
My Lady, move!

317
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,340
<i>Maybe this is how...</i>

318
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,500
<i>Cha Sun Chaek leaves the story.</i>

319
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,010
Gosh, she survived.

320
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,760
She survived. She survived.

321
00:23:45,964 --> 00:23:49,214
I told you to stay put and wait.

322
00:23:49,214 --> 00:23:51,354
Did you want to get killed by a horse
before the wedding?

323
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:55,074
I never asked you to send a wedding
proposal or whatever.

324
00:23:55,074 --> 00:23:59,254
Wedding proposals have nothing
to do with how the couple feels.

325
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:01,164
It's just formality between the families.

326
00:24:01,164 --> 00:24:03,974
Do you think it makes sense

327
00:24:03,974 --> 00:24:05,814
for us to get married?

328
00:24:05,814 --> 00:24:07,674
If a man and woman spent a night together,

329
00:24:07,674 --> 00:24:10,144
they have to get married, of course.

330
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:13,184
But I have no memory of it.

331
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:15,404
If you say you have no memory of it,

332
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:17,754
will it cancel out what happened?

333
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:20,124
And I remember last night very clearly.

334
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:22,674
Who took my clothes off so aggressively?

335
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:25,424
Someone might hear you. Lower your voice.

336
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:28,594
You have shame. You had none yesterday.

337
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:30,724
Even if I did,

338
00:24:30,724 --> 00:24:34,104
I don't think we should
get married only because of that.

339
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:36,764
You seduced me and spent a night with me.

340
00:24:36,764 --> 00:24:39,094
But you are denying it now?

341
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:43,874
Are you blaming me for everything, by chance?

342
00:24:43,874 --> 00:24:47,694
It wasn't your first time, was it?

343
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,544
Come on. It wasn't right?

344
00:24:55,074 --> 00:24:58,324
Do you think I am a horny animal who sleeps with

345
00:24:58,324 --> 00:25:00,114
any woman I can find?

346
00:25:00,114 --> 00:25:03,334
No, it's not that...

347
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:07,084
<i>With your face, body, and wealth,</i>

348
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:09,934
<i>you had to have been with a woman before.</i>

349
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:12,644
The first night with a woman
is important to a nobleman.

350
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,514
That is why I have been saving myself.

351
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,154
Since we spent the first night together,

352
00:25:16,154 --> 00:25:19,844
of course, we should be responsible for the other.

353
00:25:19,844 --> 00:25:23,924
<i>Why is he so obsessed with the first night?</i>

354
00:25:25,384 --> 00:25:29,214
But still, I think this is too unfair.

355
00:25:29,214 --> 00:25:32,084
I cannot marry you.

356
00:25:35,504 --> 00:25:37,364
If so,

357
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:43,474
you seduced me on purpose
and took my virginity away.

358
00:25:43,494 --> 00:25:45,624
Not only that, you stopped me trying to go

359
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:48,724
against the King's word and tried to hurt me.

360
00:25:48,724 --> 00:25:50,274
That is an attempt at assuming royal authority.

361
00:25:50,274 --> 00:25:54,194
It is safe to call it treason.

362
00:25:55,114 --> 00:25:58,154
Yes, that is exactly it.

363
00:25:58,154 --> 00:25:59,774
This is...

364
00:26:01,274 --> 00:26:03,564
treason.

365
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:04,944
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

366
00:26:04,944 --> 00:26:06,144
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

367
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:08,284
<i>Wait for me! Wait.</i>

368
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:10,064
<i>Hurry up.</i>

369
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:12,544
How do you like the yeot, Father?

370
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:15,484
It is very sweet.

371
00:26:22,004 --> 00:26:23,374
<i>Not only you,</i>

372
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:26,474
<i>but the family can lose their rank
and positions immediately.</i>

373
00:26:26,474 --> 00:26:29,864
<i>Three generations can be executed,
so the family ceases to exist.</i>

374
00:26:29,864 --> 00:26:33,604
<i>Who would be responsible
for the end of the Cha family?</i>

375
00:26:33,604 --> 00:26:35,424
Sun Chaek,

376
00:26:35,424 --> 00:26:38,274
why couldn't you just marry him?

377
00:26:38,274 --> 00:26:40,454
Why did you do that?

378
00:26:41,394 --> 00:26:44,844
How dare you turn down the Prince Gyeongseong?

379
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:46,864
I never even got to marry.

380
00:26:46,864 --> 00:26:49,164
You think I did?

381
00:26:49,164 --> 00:26:52,964
This is where our family's bloodline ends.

382
00:26:52,964 --> 00:26:54,494
My dear ancestors,

383
00:26:54,494 --> 00:26:57,274
I am terribly sorry.

384
00:26:57,274 --> 00:26:59,784
I hope we do not...

385
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,264
meet again in the next life.

386
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:05,864
<i>What if this family actually ceases</i>

387
00:27:05,864 --> 00:27:08,774
<i>to exist because of me?</i>

388
00:27:12,704 --> 00:27:15,254
I'm sorry!

389
00:27:15,254 --> 00:27:17,104
I'll get married.

390
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:21,294
So, please spare me.

391
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:22,694
What can I say?

392
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:25,434
You only had one chance.

393
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:32,604
This woman deceived me.

394
00:27:32,604 --> 00:27:35,694
Kill her very cruelly and painfully.

395
00:27:35,694 --> 00:27:37,584
Yes, Prince Gyeongseong.

396
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:39,364
She tarnished a royal's virginity.

397
00:27:39,364 --> 00:27:41,664
Cha Sun Chaek, a traitor...

398
00:27:41,664 --> 00:27:44,534
will be torn apart to death!

399
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:49,564
Spare me!

400
00:28:18,804 --> 00:28:20,444
<i>He was acting crazy earlier.</i>

401
00:28:20,444 --> 00:28:23,104
<i>Why does he have such a sweet smile?</i>

402
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:26,914
You must care about your family.

403
00:28:29,684 --> 00:28:32,834
I care about all lives.

404
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:35,954
That's why I'd like to share the news about

405
00:28:35,954 --> 00:28:39,854
my marriage personally with my dear family.

406
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:41,834
I'm their precious only daughter.

407
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:45,354
If I suddenly tell them I'll get married,
they'll feel disappointed.

408
00:28:45,354 --> 00:28:48,444
Until I bring it up with them myself,

409
00:28:48,444 --> 00:28:51,544
could you wait just a moment?

410
00:28:51,544 --> 00:28:53,824
Sure, fine.

411
00:28:53,824 --> 00:28:56,744
I will give you three days.

412
00:28:56,744 --> 00:28:58,194
After three days,

413
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,204
I will resend the wedding proposal.

414
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:05,414
<i>How about you join the envoys in three months?</i>

415
00:29:05,414 --> 00:29:07,894
<i>Get married during that time.</i>

416
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:09,384
<i>Your wedding will be</i>

417
00:29:09,384 --> 00:29:12,874
<i>treated with utmost respect in the royal court.</i>

418
00:29:12,914 --> 00:29:15,574
<i>You will not refuse this, will you?</i>

419
00:29:16,784 --> 00:29:20,484
Three days is... That's way too short.

420
00:29:20,484 --> 00:29:23,404
No, it is more than enough.

421
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:25,974
As long as you do not try to run away.

422
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:29,874
If you are thinking that, you had better give up now.

423
00:29:31,254 --> 00:29:32,844
Of course not.

424
00:29:32,874 --> 00:29:37,814
The geography and security
of this city is in the palm of my hands.

425
00:29:37,814 --> 00:29:40,024
If you want to confirm that,

426
00:29:40,024 --> 00:29:42,164
feel free to try.

427
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,944
So, you did not come home last night

428
00:29:49,974 --> 00:29:52,774
because you slept with the Prince...
the Prince Gyeongseong?

429
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:55,374
We didn't just sleep together.
It was his first time, apparently.

430
00:29:55,374 --> 00:29:57,964
And he said to be responsible by marrying him.

431
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,754
How does that make sense?

432
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:02,544
So, what will he do about the wedding proposal?

433
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:04,514
He said he will resend it in three days.

434
00:30:04,514 --> 00:30:08,054
So, I'll run far away as quickly as possible.

435
00:30:08,054 --> 00:30:10,844
Pack everything that's small,
light, and worth money.

436
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:12,614
Oh, yes...

437
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:18,984
Why do you have to run away, by the way?

438
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:22,644
The Prince may not be the nicest person,

439
00:30:22,674 --> 00:30:26,544
but he is a royal, handsome,
and all women desire him.

440
00:30:26,544 --> 00:30:29,004
That makes him the best marriage material.

441
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:30,584
That is not all.

442
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:33,384
You will become the King's
relative by marrying him.

443
00:30:33,384 --> 00:30:35,644
You will get paid regularly for that.

444
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:38,474
It would be an honor
to the family, too. Isn't that nice?

445
00:30:38,474 --> 00:30:41,474
That has always been your dream.

446
00:30:41,474 --> 00:30:43,184
- My dream?
- Yes.

447
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:45,934
Your dream has always been

448
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:48,874
marrying a son of a family that is suitable,

449
00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:52,374
<i>having as many children
as possible, living a happy life,</i>

450
00:30:52,424 --> 00:30:54,284
<i>and ending your life in peace</i>

451
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:57,924
<i>while being cared for by your grandchildren.</i>

452
00:30:57,924 --> 00:31:01,324
I'd enjoy a lot of things as a royal,

453
00:31:01,324 --> 00:31:04,534
but that would put me in danger, too.

454
00:31:07,894 --> 00:31:09,944
No!

455
00:31:09,974 --> 00:31:13,334
Spare us.

456
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:15,124
The female lead always...

457
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:18,524
face all sorts of hardship and danger.

458
00:31:18,524 --> 00:31:21,334
Gosh, I don't want to be the female lead.

459
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:22,844
And most importantly...

460
00:31:22,844 --> 00:31:26,684
<i>The Prince is supposed to marry someone else.</i>

461
00:31:27,664 --> 00:31:30,574
But you said he wants to marry you.

462
00:31:30,574 --> 00:31:33,314
That's why I need to run away quickly.

463
00:31:33,314 --> 00:31:35,584
That will not be easy.

464
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:39,324
If he sets his mind to it,
there is no one he cannot find

465
00:31:39,324 --> 00:31:42,664
or get rid of in this world.

466
00:31:45,064 --> 00:31:46,254
See?

467
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:48,144
He must've noticed you were running away.

468
00:31:48,144 --> 00:31:50,114
What do I do?

469
00:31:58,694 --> 00:32:02,464
Do you not even invite your guests to come in?

470
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:05,784
You cannot just barge in like this.

471
00:32:08,614 --> 00:32:11,304
Are you okay, Bang Wool?

472
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,394
How dare you touch me?

473
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:15,624
Go outside and stay away.

474
00:32:20,884 --> 00:32:23,684
What brings you here?

475
00:32:25,964 --> 00:32:29,164
I stopped by to ask you something.

476
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:32,664
Last night,

477
00:32:32,664 --> 00:32:36,024
you suddenly left the club meeting.

478
00:32:36,024 --> 00:32:38,244
You went to Prince Gyeongseong's Hoseondang

479
00:32:38,244 --> 00:32:39,934
and left this morning.

480
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:43,164
Someone I know saw it. Is that true?

481
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:46,304
That's...

482
00:32:46,304 --> 00:32:47,334
T-The thing is-

483
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:49,084
It is true.

484
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:52,364
Well, I don't really remember it...

485
00:32:54,074 --> 00:32:55,464
Don't try to lie, and

486
00:32:55,464 --> 00:32:58,444
say you do not remember because you were drunk.

487
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:04,064
By chance, did you spend the night with the Prince?

488
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,314
My hunch was correct.

489
00:33:11,304 --> 00:33:12,834
You let me have the silk dress and sided with me

490
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:15,274
but you stabbed me in the back? How shameless-

491
00:33:15,274 --> 00:33:16,834
<i>Is this when...</i>

492
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:20,354
<i>Do Hwa Seon uses her signature
move by splashing water?</i>

493
00:33:33,724 --> 00:33:35,644
What are you doing...

494
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:38,364
Were you prepared to disgrace me?

495
00:33:38,364 --> 00:33:41,294
No, I didn't do that.

496
00:33:41,294 --> 00:33:44,154
You splashed water at me first.

497
00:33:44,154 --> 00:33:47,434
All I did was block it like this.

498
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:52,754
The fan the Queen Mother gave me was ruined.

499
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:01,804
I will repay you for this humiliation.

500
00:34:01,804 --> 00:34:06,084
I will do so much more than
just splashing water next time.

501
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:08,064
Just wait and see.

502
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,214
What's going on?

503
00:34:17,214 --> 00:34:20,274
Why do things keep going haywire?

504
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:22,434
I'm not supposed to do anything.

505
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:26,714
Why does my body keep moving against my will?

506
00:34:30,314 --> 00:34:32,654
My Lady,

507
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:37,174
you do not have to do this for someone like me.

508
00:34:40,004 --> 00:34:42,414
You are the only one

509
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,864
who took revenge for me.

510
00:34:45,574 --> 00:34:49,774
I will do anything for you from now on-

511
00:34:49,774 --> 00:34:51,234
My Lady.

512
00:34:51,234 --> 00:34:53,344
My Lady! My Lady!

513
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:07,174
Beon, what brings you here?

514
00:35:07,744 --> 00:35:10,274
I am here because you said this place

515
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,834
has the best view of Hanyang.

516
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:15,764
You never seemed to listen to me.

517
00:35:15,764 --> 00:35:18,714
I have never seen you doing this.

518
00:35:18,714 --> 00:35:20,434
So...

519
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:22,924
have you really not been to this gazebo before?

520
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:26,534
Everyone knows about this one.

521
00:35:26,534 --> 00:35:28,594
This is my first time here.

522
00:35:30,784 --> 00:35:33,654
What has gotten into our Beon?

523
00:35:33,654 --> 00:35:38,534
What made you visit a place for the first time?

524
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:43,644
You said your binoculars were broken.

525
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:45,184
Yes.

526
00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:48,024
It broke...

527
00:35:48,024 --> 00:35:50,204
because I dropped it from a rooftop.

528
00:35:50,204 --> 00:35:52,304
It was not easy to acquire these.

529
00:35:54,304 --> 00:35:56,034
Let me get you a new pair.

530
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:57,474
Do you mean it?

531
00:35:58,194 --> 00:35:59,514
But why?

532
00:36:00,184 --> 00:36:02,324
I would love that,

533
00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:04,914
but you are acting very suspiciously.

534
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:09,234
Let us say it is to celebrate my first visit here.

535
00:36:09,964 --> 00:36:11,774
And most importantly,

536
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:16,364
it is because you are my first and only friend.

537
00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:23,254
It looks like you find all things first meaningful.

538
00:36:23,254 --> 00:36:25,594
I am still your only friend because

539
00:36:25,594 --> 00:36:28,324
you did not let anyone in afterward.

540
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:33,434
I thought everyone was like that.

541
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:35,164
It is...

542
00:36:35,164 --> 00:36:38,184
special because not everyone

543
00:36:38,184 --> 00:36:40,454
cherishes the beginning.

544
00:36:41,214 --> 00:36:44,244
I hope you have many beginnings.

545
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,424
That way, I would...

546
00:36:46,424 --> 00:36:49,004
strike more gold like this.

547
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:05,104
My Lady...

548
00:37:14,924 --> 00:37:16,414
<i>Plan A.</i>

549
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:18,144
<i>Escape.</i>

550
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:21,504
We were told not to let any unwed

551
00:37:21,504 --> 00:37:23,554
noblewomen through the four gates.

552
00:37:23,554 --> 00:37:25,634
This is something very urgent.

553
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:29,024
I cannot disobey the order from above, either.

554
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:33,754
My Lady is so ill.

555
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:37,434
She needs to rehabilitate in the countryside.

556
00:37:42,374 --> 00:37:43,714
If that is why,

557
00:37:43,714 --> 00:37:46,284
there is a good place
to rehabilitate in Hanyang, too.

558
00:37:46,284 --> 00:37:48,394
It is called Hoseondang Spa.

559
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:49,424
Hoseondang?

560
00:37:49,424 --> 00:37:51,894
It is a spa owned by the Prince Gyeongseong.

561
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,974
How about you go there instead?

562
00:37:57,584 --> 00:37:59,554
My Lady! Gosh...

563
00:38:14,154 --> 00:38:16,224
Let me do a search.

564
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:18,634
As you can tell,

565
00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:20,574
I am not a noblewoman.

566
00:38:20,574 --> 00:38:24,974
It is a search for finding a culprit.

567
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:26,304
Culprit?

568
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,894
As soon as we find the woman
who stole one and only thing

569
00:38:28,894 --> 00:38:31,684
very precious to the Prince Gyeongseong,

570
00:38:33,314 --> 00:38:36,994
we are supposed to arrest and detain her.

571
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:48,304
You had better just leave quietly.

572
00:38:48,304 --> 00:38:51,274
If you walk past this gate,

573
00:38:51,274 --> 00:38:54,544
he will send bounty hunters.

574
00:38:55,614 --> 00:38:57,624
No way...

575
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,594
No!

576
00:39:01,344 --> 00:39:03,054
Let me go!

577
00:39:03,054 --> 00:39:06,654
We will bring her body if we have to!

578
00:39:15,674 --> 00:39:17,614
No! No!

579
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:21,974
Lift her.

580
00:39:22,924 --> 00:39:25,384
- Okay, let us go.
- Save me...

581
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:41,394
You appear to be in a good mood.

582
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:49,244
That cannot be.

583
00:39:49,244 --> 00:39:51,094
You are mistaken.

584
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:55,904
Can I dare to tell you something?

585
00:39:58,684 --> 00:40:02,414
Fear tactics do not work in this field.

586
00:40:02,414 --> 00:40:06,754
The engagement policy works well in this case.

587
00:40:16,154 --> 00:40:20,844
I can't seem to breathe.

588
00:40:20,844 --> 00:40:22,894
If you really do not want to,

589
00:40:22,894 --> 00:40:27,764
just make the Prince fall out of love with you.

590
00:40:28,744 --> 00:40:32,054
You're right. Why didn't I think of that?

591
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,694
Gosh, Bang Wool.

592
00:40:34,694 --> 00:40:38,184
You're smarter than I thought, Bang Wool.

593
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:42,944
What would be a good way,
do you think, for example?

594
00:40:44,514 --> 00:40:46,284
I am not sure.

595
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:48,934
I have thought about how to make someone like me,

596
00:40:48,934 --> 00:40:52,684
but I have never tried to do the opposite.

597
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:54,904
The kind of woman men hate...

598
00:40:54,904 --> 00:40:58,624
The kind of woman men hate?

599
00:41:02,214 --> 00:41:03,964
Yes.

600
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:08,454
Perhaps I'm an expert in this field.

601
00:41:09,933 --> 00:41:11,006
<i>My Lord!</i>

602
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:12,821
<i>My Lord! My Lord!</i>

603
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:14,991
My Lord. My Lord.

604
00:41:14,991 --> 00:41:17,241
Send the wedding proposal in two days.

605
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,761
Is the rest of the preparation going well?

606
00:41:19,761 --> 00:41:21,671
This is more urgent.

607
00:41:21,671 --> 00:41:24,051
You need to see this.

608
00:41:37,141 --> 00:41:40,641
What am I seeing right now?

609
00:41:41,381 --> 00:41:44,001
I am not so sure, either.

610
00:41:45,371 --> 00:41:47,881
Gosh, My Lord.

611
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:51,401
You must have missed me this morning.

612
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:01,381
What are you doing here?

613
00:42:01,381 --> 00:42:02,831
<i>Plan B.</i>

614
00:42:02,831 --> 00:42:06,201
<i>Provoke the obsessive male lead.</i>

615
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:08,161
<i>As I know, Yi Beon from the novel</i>

616
00:42:08,161 --> 00:42:11,681
<i>hates anything dirty and impure.</i>

617
00:42:11,681 --> 00:42:13,931
<i>He won't be able to stand this.</i>

618
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,041
Why do you look like this?

619
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:19,621
You smell, too.

620
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:21,211
Gosh, the fertilizer smell.

621
00:42:21,211 --> 00:42:25,381
I dug up and ate some because I got hungry.

622
00:42:25,381 --> 00:42:27,961
Unlike how I look,

623
00:42:27,961 --> 00:42:30,301
I love emergency crops like this.

624
00:42:30,301 --> 00:42:33,051
And you aren't smelling fertilizer.

625
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,801
It's actual poop.

626
00:42:34,801 --> 00:42:36,981
My stomach hurts because I ate too much.

627
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:40,521
So, I pooped and buried it there.

628
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:41,831
For cleaning,

629
00:42:41,831 --> 00:42:44,641
this foxtail grass is perfect.

630
00:42:45,871 --> 00:42:47,571
As time goes by,

631
00:42:47,571 --> 00:42:51,761
it will fertilize Hoseondang's soil, too.

632
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:55,581
<i>Disgusting and insufferable, right?</i>

633
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:58,241
<i>With your clean and perfectionist personality.</i>

634
00:42:58,241 --> 00:42:59,571
<i>Ditch me already.</i>

635
00:42:59,571 --> 00:43:01,901
<i>I'm ready for it.</i>

636
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:18,421
A nobleman's daughter's hands...

637
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:21,171
show signs of labor.

638
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:23,561
It's very refreshing and inspiring.

639
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:25,641
- Pardon?
- Not only do you have a common appetite,

640
00:43:25,641 --> 00:43:27,681
you are harvesting emergency crops during

641
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:30,761
downtime to encourage and inspire others.

642
00:43:30,761 --> 00:43:32,621
You will set an example...

643
00:43:32,621 --> 00:43:34,361
as a royal.

644
00:43:44,031 --> 00:43:45,681
Let us go.

645
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:47,391
Well, yes.

646
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,061
Yes...

647
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:52,661
<i>Plan C.</i>

648
00:43:52,661 --> 00:43:54,261
<i>A toxic woman's...</i>

649
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:56,321
<i>vanity and extravagance.</i>

650
00:43:56,321 --> 00:43:58,661
Gosh, My Lady.

651
00:43:58,661 --> 00:44:01,601
If you buy this much, even the Minister's family

652
00:44:01,601 --> 00:44:04,251
would run out of money soon.

653
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:05,421
Shut up.

654
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:06,611
I want to buy things.

655
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:08,671
How dare a servant lecture me?

656
00:44:08,671 --> 00:44:11,481
Should I cut off your wrists immediately?

657
00:44:12,161 --> 00:44:14,801
Gosh, for my delicate wrists...

658
00:44:14,801 --> 00:44:17,381
even this jewelry is so heavy.

659
00:44:17,381 --> 00:44:19,511
You carry this, too.

660
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:26,331
Did I toss it that hard?

661
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,751
My Lady.

662
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:32,371
Gosh, the Prince Gyeongseong.

663
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:35,791
We run into each other often.

664
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:36,911
What are you doing here?

665
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:39,831
Our upcoming wedding has made me feel restless.

666
00:44:39,831 --> 00:44:42,671
I wanted to adorn myself from head to toe.

667
00:44:42,671 --> 00:44:45,391
I bought the best goods in Joseon...

668
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,981
No, I only bought imported goods.

669
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:49,171
Why?

670
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:52,971
Because I worship foreign countries.

671
00:44:52,971 --> 00:44:55,061
I want to continue to buy all the

672
00:44:55,061 --> 00:44:59,281
limited edition goods from
Japan and China from now on.

673
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:01,831
Can you buy them for me the rest of my life,

674
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:03,631
Prince Gyeongseong?

675
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:06,751
<i>A clueless beauty who spends taxpayers' money.</i>

676
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:10,891
<i>A royal like Yi Beon won't tolerate this, right?</i>

677
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:16,031
Aigoo, so heavy...

678
00:45:20,391 --> 00:45:23,391
You need to dress like this to be on my level.

679
00:45:23,391 --> 00:45:26,601
Envoys are visiting us in a few months.

680
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:28,701
Please assist me with that.

681
00:45:33,101 --> 00:45:36,651
You have a global taste, too.

682
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:40,551
<i>What? What's going on?</i>

683
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:42,721
<i>It's not working at all.</i>

684
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:46,461
<i>Why is he so impenetrable?</i>

685
00:45:49,221 --> 00:45:51,131
<i>Plan D.</i>

686
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:53,311
<i>Fatalism.</i>

687
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:10,451
What brings you here at this late hour?

688
00:46:10,451 --> 00:46:13,931
You could not have missed me already.

689
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:19,441
We're not supposed to miss each other.

690
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:20,501
What do you mean by that?

691
00:46:20,501 --> 00:46:22,341
Using your fortune...

692
00:46:22,341 --> 00:46:25,541
and mine, I checked our compatibility.

693
00:46:29,261 --> 00:46:31,401
How is our compatibility?

694
00:46:33,631 --> 00:46:35,261
It says if we get married,

695
00:46:35,261 --> 00:46:39,561
you're destined to die young, apparently.

696
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:45,401
It does not matter.

697
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:46,541
Pardon?

698
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:49,841
I-It doesn't matter?

699
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:53,171
They say you will die if you marry me.

700
00:46:53,171 --> 00:46:55,741
I think of this life...

701
00:46:55,741 --> 00:46:58,661
as a bonus, anyway.

702
00:46:58,661 --> 00:47:00,831
If I could meet someone I love

703
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:02,991
and live happily, even briefly,

704
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:06,681
I will think of it as a gift from my parents

705
00:47:06,681 --> 00:47:08,171
and accept it willingly.

706
00:47:08,171 --> 00:47:12,871
No, I'll become a widow.

707
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:16,201
All of my assets will become yours, then.

708
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:17,621
However,

709
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:21,671
you cannot remarry.

710
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:25,311
I will not allow you another man even if I am dead.

711
00:47:39,571 --> 00:47:41,081
<i>Plan E.</i>

712
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:42,821
<i>Become religious.</i>

713
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:46,741
A noble lady is joining the temple?

714
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:48,911
Yes, that is correct.

715
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:51,051
Being free from material desires and pain...

716
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:52,381
<i>Especially Yi Beon.</i>

717
00:47:52,381 --> 00:47:54,151
is my wish.

718
00:47:54,151 --> 00:47:55,911
Please accept me-

719
00:47:55,911 --> 00:47:59,361
I am sorry, but you cannot join the temple.

720
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:02,391
How did you know I was here?

721
00:48:07,381 --> 00:48:10,101
Do you know each other?

722
00:48:10,101 --> 00:48:13,961
Of course. We know each other very well.

723
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:17,281
Why do you say she cannot join us?

724
00:48:17,281 --> 00:48:19,131
You only need faith in Buddha's world-

725
00:48:19,131 --> 00:48:22,921
This maiden lacks in faith.

726
00:48:22,921 --> 00:48:24,561
First of all,

727
00:48:24,561 --> 00:48:26,971
she loves drinking. Very much so.

728
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:28,801
I can quit.

729
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:30,631
Of course, I should.

730
00:48:30,631 --> 00:48:32,531
And she loves eating meat.

731
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:34,531
For breakfasts, her family

732
00:48:34,531 --> 00:48:36,931
eats meat from land, sea, and sky.

733
00:48:36,931 --> 00:48:39,921
I ate it because they were there.

734
00:48:39,921 --> 00:48:41,371
They were there.

735
00:48:41,371 --> 00:48:43,841
I can go vegetarian, ma'am.

736
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:46,511
And I won't eat much, either.

737
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:49,491
So, please accept me.

738
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:51,681
Please spare me.

739
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:54,761
It is up to her to join the temple.

740
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:57,341
No one can stop someone from doing that.

741
00:48:57,341 --> 00:49:00,491
Ma'am, I just thought about something

742
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:02,321
I forgot to mention.

743
00:49:03,051 --> 00:49:06,461
It is a reason she cannot become a monk.

744
00:49:06,461 --> 00:49:08,121
What is it...

745
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:17,991
Can a woman who is not celibate become a monk?

746
00:49:17,991 --> 00:49:19,351
P-Pardon?

747
00:49:19,351 --> 00:49:21,091
It's not true, ma'am!

748
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,671
You lie now?

749
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:25,831
Lying is not permitted in Buddha's world.

750
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:27,681
Don't listen to this man, ma'am.

751
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:30,601
- I-
- Gosh, stop!

752
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:33,121
I am the one she spent the night-

753
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:35,231
Namu Amitabha, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva...

754
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,661
- Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva...
- He's out of his mind, ma'am.

755
00:49:38,661 --> 00:49:40,001
I swear it's not true.

756
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:42,371
You will not become a monk.

757
00:49:43,491 --> 00:49:45,441
<i>Forget about the plans.</i>

758
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,521
<i>Is running away at night the only option?</i>

759
00:49:47,521 --> 00:49:49,121
<i>Just run away.</i>

760
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:50,771
Nothing works.

761
00:49:50,771 --> 00:49:53,291
How could this be?

762
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:57,261
I just need to disappear.

763
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:04,271
Wow, we smelled makeup powder
in the middle of the night.

764
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:05,511
We had to come check.

765
00:50:05,511 --> 00:50:08,031
It is not just the makeup powder.

766
00:50:09,111 --> 00:50:11,181
I smell gold, too.

767
00:50:11,911 --> 00:50:13,401
I'll give you this.

768
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:15,561
I swear I didn't see anything.

769
00:50:15,561 --> 00:50:17,021
It's so dark.

770
00:50:17,021 --> 00:50:20,331
It looks like you are a nobleman's daughter.

771
00:50:20,331 --> 00:50:23,181
Should we sell the jewelry and silk?

772
00:50:23,181 --> 00:50:26,031
I knew I had a lucky dream.

773
00:50:26,031 --> 00:50:28,791
We will finally make good money.

774
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:31,281
Help me!

775
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,721
Screaming will not help.

776
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:38,681
There are not even ants here at night.

777
00:50:39,311 --> 00:50:42,181
So, go ahead-

778
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:46,901
What?

779
00:50:46,901 --> 00:50:48,261
Geez.

780
00:50:48,961 --> 00:50:50,441
This is...

781
00:50:52,021 --> 00:50:53,201
yeot.

782
00:50:53,201 --> 00:50:56,441
Yeot fell from the sky?

783
00:51:20,281 --> 00:51:22,601
Gosh, my apologies.

784
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:26,441
I was eating yeot while stargazing.

785
00:51:26,441 --> 00:51:29,051
But I dropped it by accident.

786
00:51:29,051 --> 00:51:31,571
<i>Supporting character, Jung Su Gyeom?</i>

787
00:51:32,261 --> 00:51:33,661
Are you okay?

788
00:51:33,661 --> 00:51:35,271
- Help me.
- Geez.

789
00:51:35,271 --> 00:51:38,501
- You look like a pretty boy.
- Come on.

790
00:51:38,501 --> 00:51:40,541
Do not do anything dangerous now.

791
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:42,291
Since we are in this situation,

792
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:44,311
we will have to kill you both.

793
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:45,961
I will take the lady.

794
00:51:45,961 --> 00:51:48,141
No, I will take the lady.

795
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:51,161
Do you have a sword? Can you fight?

796
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:54,651
We're dead.

797
00:51:54,651 --> 00:51:55,771
Are you a good runner?

798
00:51:55,771 --> 00:51:57,311
Pardon?

799
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,481
It is okay if you aren't.

800
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:07,311
They are running away.

801
00:52:07,311 --> 00:52:10,101
I said I will take the lady.

802
00:52:32,391 --> 00:52:35,101
Eat this yeot, you thieves.

803
00:52:38,051 --> 00:52:41,191
<i>Yes, my type has always been</i>

804
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,951
<i>the supporting characters.</i>

805
00:52:48,881 --> 00:52:50,531
Why was a nobleman's daughter

806
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:53,811
roaming in the mountains at night?

807
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:56,501
You are the Chief State Minister's
daughter, correct?

808
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:58,171
How did you know...

809
00:52:58,171 --> 00:52:59,541
To be honest,

810
00:53:00,391 --> 00:53:04,181
I stopped by the teahouse
on the night of the full moon.

811
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,771
Y-You saw me at the teahouse?

812
00:53:06,771 --> 00:53:08,221
Yes.

813
00:53:08,221 --> 00:53:12,241
You made drinks in such a fun and satisfying way.

814
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:15,471
It was so impressive that I could not forget.

815
00:53:16,471 --> 00:53:17,671
<i>What's this?</i>

816
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:20,771
<i>Jung Su Gyeom was there that night, too?</i>

817
00:53:22,051 --> 00:53:24,511
My film cut off that night...

818
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:30,251
I mean, I cannot remember that night.

819
00:53:30,251 --> 00:53:33,971
Anyway, thank you for saving me.

820
00:53:33,971 --> 00:53:35,941
I do not know how to return the favor.

821
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:38,371
You do not have to do anything special.

822
00:53:38,371 --> 00:53:40,521
But I have a request.

823
00:53:41,321 --> 00:53:43,481
Would you say yes?

824
00:53:43,481 --> 00:53:46,111
Of course. Tell me.

825
00:53:46,951 --> 00:53:49,351
Could you join the Seonmun Club

826
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,331
that I created?

827
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:53,051
Seonmun Club?

828
00:53:53,051 --> 00:53:55,641
<i>Seonmun Club is a drinking club</i>

829
00:53:55,641 --> 00:53:59,611
<i>disguised as an astrology club started by him.</i>

830
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:03,441
I have always been interested
in the sun, moon, and stars.

831
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:06,301
I started the club to study the celestial bodies'

832
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:09,921
movements and discuss life and fate.

833
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:13,601
<i>I know that's just an excuse to drink.</i>

834
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:15,401
<i>Don't try to make it sound impressive.</i>

835
00:54:15,401 --> 00:54:17,341
<i>Jung Su Gyeom is smoother than I thought.</i>

836
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:19,911
I heard the next full moon will be big.

837
00:54:19,911 --> 00:54:23,341
How about we enjoy your fascinating

838
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:25,751
and unusual drinks together, then?

839
00:54:25,751 --> 00:54:29,801
<i>The cocktails made a great impact.</i>

840
00:54:29,801 --> 00:54:33,241
<i>But I'm running away now.</i>

841
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:36,171
I appreciate the suggestion, sir.

842
00:54:36,171 --> 00:54:39,901
But a nobleman's daughter can't leave home at night

843
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,401
and drink on top of that.

844
00:54:42,401 --> 00:54:45,751
But if you want the recipes for the cocktails,

845
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:48,781
I'll write them down for you.

846
00:54:48,781 --> 00:54:50,081
You cannot.

847
00:54:50,081 --> 00:54:51,721
I want you to teach me everything

848
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,771
directly in person. And...

849
00:54:56,131 --> 00:54:58,471
it is not about alcohol.

850
00:54:59,271 --> 00:55:01,081
Studying the sky is...

851
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:05,021
the most romantic thing
the current youth can enjoy.

852
00:55:06,171 --> 00:55:10,831
I want you to enjoy the romantic experience, too.

853
00:55:18,851 --> 00:55:23,471
You will not say no to me, will you,
Maiden Sun Chaek?

854
00:55:26,501 --> 00:55:30,351
J-Just once, then.

855
00:55:30,351 --> 00:55:31,971
<i>I do not allow it.</i>

856
00:55:48,941 --> 00:55:50,401
Beon.

857
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:57,671
What brings you here?

858
00:55:58,671 --> 00:56:00,091
And what do you mean you will not allow?

859
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:02,411
I am planning to ban all the gatherings between

860
00:56:02,411 --> 00:56:06,661
unwed men and women of the capital for now.

861
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:09,461
Why all of a sudden?

862
00:56:12,241 --> 00:56:15,691
There is something I need to protect and manage.

863
00:56:23,001 --> 00:56:26,081
The yellow leaves are so nice.

864
00:56:28,321 --> 00:56:31,781
Ho Yeol, isn't that Sun Chaek?

865
00:56:34,321 --> 00:56:37,611
What are you all doing here?

866
00:56:38,901 --> 00:56:41,331
What are you doing here, then?

867
00:56:45,351 --> 00:56:47,401
You were here, too, Prince Gyeongseong.

868
00:56:47,401 --> 00:56:49,511
Let us greet you.

869
00:56:50,651 --> 00:56:52,081
Yes.

870
00:56:52,081 --> 00:56:55,721
Are you my future brothers-in-law?

871
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:02,631
Brothers-in-law, did you say?

872
00:57:02,631 --> 00:57:04,351
I think you heard him wrong, Hyungnim.

873
00:57:04,351 --> 00:57:07,511
No, he heard me correctly.

874
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:09,601
It sounds like your sister...

875
00:57:09,601 --> 00:57:12,551
did not tell you anything.

876
00:57:13,551 --> 00:57:16,761
What strange things were you talking about, anyway?

877
00:57:16,761 --> 00:57:21,291
I, Prince Gyeongseong,
will declare directly and openly.

878
00:57:21,291 --> 00:57:24,091
<i>Right now?</i>

879
00:57:26,011 --> 00:57:28,381
Your sister and I will soon-

880
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:32,881
She will soon-

881
00:57:33,631 --> 00:57:36,111
Cover your ears. Cover your ears.

882
00:57:36,111 --> 00:57:38,861
- W-What...
- No, no!

883
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:42,221
- She will soon-
- No!

884
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:05,391
<i>This handsome psycho's
obsession for his first night</i>

885
00:58:05,391 --> 00:58:10,031
<i>will end when I die, it seems.</i>

886
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:16,181
Sun Chaek!

887
00:58:23,821 --> 00:58:26,251
[Epilogue]
Gosh, gosh...

888
00:58:26,251 --> 00:58:29,271
You should have watched where you were going.

889
00:58:29,271 --> 00:58:32,491
Shit. What about you, then?

890
00:58:32,491 --> 00:58:34,321
Geez, should I hit you or not?

891
00:58:34,321 --> 00:58:36,111
- This is your fault.
- My fault?

892
00:58:36,111 --> 00:58:37,501
You little...

893
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:47,951
Why are you doing this to us?

894
00:58:47,951 --> 00:58:49,731
We were just passing by-

895
00:58:49,731 --> 00:58:51,491
Do you know...

896
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:54,691
who you dared to threaten?

897
00:58:54,691 --> 00:58:58,261
She will become my wife soon.
Me, Prince Gyeongseong.

898
00:58:58,261 --> 00:59:00,111
Prince Gyeongseong...

899
00:59:00,111 --> 00:59:01,781
F-Forgive us.

900
00:59:01,781 --> 00:59:04,131
We were just trying to feed ourselves to survive.

901
00:59:04,131 --> 00:59:09,311
By the way, she ran away
holding another man's hand.

902
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:11,141
No, don't...

903
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:13,801
If you did this to feed yourselves and survive,

904
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:16,161
I should get rid of your mouths first.

905
00:59:16,161 --> 00:59:18,041
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

906
00:59:19,321 --> 00:59:21,161
S-Spare us!

907
00:59:21,161 --> 00:59:22,831
Beg him right now.

908
00:59:22,831 --> 00:59:25,891
Forgive us. Please spare us.

909
00:59:25,891 --> 00:59:27,681
