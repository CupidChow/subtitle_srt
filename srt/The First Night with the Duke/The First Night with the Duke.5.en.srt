00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:15,916
But if you still want to,

187
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,076
- I will willingly-
- No, no, no!

188
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:21,326
Never, never, never! I don't want to!

189
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:24,636
I am willing to-

190
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:26,366
No!

191
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:29,736
Let me go!

192
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:32,686
Gosh!

193
00:19:43,686 --> 00:19:48,296
Are you walking like that for me to see?

194
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:57,626
I will lend you my back.

195
00:19:57,626 --> 00:19:58,736
What are you saying?

196
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:01,436
I never asked you to carry me.

197
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:21,126
I got scared.

198
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:32,266
<i>♫ Just like the moment I first met you ♫</i>

199
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:36,136
<i>♫ Stay by my side always ♫</i>

200
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:38,686
<i>♫ I'm only you ♫</i>

201
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:42,566
<i>♫ Show me your heart ♫</i>

202
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:47,786
<i>♫ I love you forever ♫</i>

203
00:20:49,026 --> 00:20:51,626
<i>♫ I think of you ♫</i>

204
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:55,156
<i>♫ You are all I can see ♫</i>

205
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:59,346
<i>♫ The fortune came to me like a dream ♫</i>

206
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:01,966
<i>♫ I can give you my everything ♫</i>

207
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:05,756
<i>♫ That's how beautiful you are ♫</i>

208
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:08,346
<i>♫ I'm happy ♫</i>

209
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:12,926
<i>♫ My heart is calling for you ♫</i>

210
00:21:12,926 --> 00:21:16,116
Why do you keep getting more clingy?

211
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:18,016
Clingy?

212
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:21,106
When you put your hand on my back,

213
00:21:21,106 --> 00:21:23,716
it seemed very intentional.

214
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:27,046
There are intentions behind our actions.

215
00:21:27,046 --> 00:21:28,976
You're subtly sneaky, too.

216
00:21:28,976 --> 00:21:31,776
Being subtle isn't my style.

217
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,366
I prefer to be blatant.

218
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:41,976
Have you no shame?

219
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:47,186
That would require me to feel
embarrassed about myself.

220
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:48,996
I have nothing to be embarrassed about.

221
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:52,596
<i>♫ Shall we begin? ♫</i>

222
00:22:47,386 --> 00:22:49,446
What a weak-kneed physician.

223
00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:52,026
How would you make yourself useful?

224
00:23:04,686 --> 00:23:08,836
I do not think she has a plague.

225
00:23:08,836 --> 00:23:09,876
Are you sure?

226
00:23:09,876 --> 00:23:11,646
The symptoms are similar,

227
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:13,446
but she is recovering differently.

228
00:23:13,446 --> 00:23:15,386
I was so sick I could die.

229
00:23:15,386 --> 00:23:16,446
She also coughed up blood.

230
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:19,206
But she does not have necrosis or sores.

231
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:21,816
Most importantly, her pulse is stable.

232
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:25,386
I think it is another illness, not a plague.

233
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:28,136
Another illness?

234
00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:34,526
Did you intake or touch anything in particular?

235
00:23:34,526 --> 00:23:37,166
Try to think carefully.

236
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,456
I was trapped in a room.

237
00:23:39,456 --> 00:23:42,626
<i>I met Lord Su Gyeom.</i>

238
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:45,316
<i>I went to Lady Eun Ae's house and...</i>

239
00:23:47,746 --> 00:23:51,196
I did meet a Westerner on the streets.

240
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,996
He was in trouble because he was
stranded on his journey.

241
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:56,856
I showed him around places.

242
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:00,476
Westerner?

243
00:24:00,476 --> 00:24:03,006
We pray. We pray.

244
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:06,806
We pray for Sun Chaek's safe return.

245
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:11,646
Please let My Lady come back safely.

246
00:24:15,946 --> 00:24:18,446
Sun Chaek...

247
00:24:23,116 --> 00:24:25,896
If you would just watch us standing like that,

248
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:28,536
just go inside instead.

249
00:24:30,346 --> 00:24:32,896
A scholar does not believe in superstition.

250
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:34,306
Superstition?

251
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,196
Sun Chaek is in danger of dying right now.

252
00:24:37,196 --> 00:24:40,456
I do not care if it is superstition or not.

253
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:41,636
She is right.

254
00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:44,356
It is about your child's life.
Why should it matter

255
00:24:44,356 --> 00:24:47,306
whether you are a scholar or a slave?

256
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:49,666
If Sun Chaek returns,

257
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:53,756
I will grant any of her wishes.

258
00:24:53,756 --> 00:24:55,256
I pray...

259
00:24:55,256 --> 00:24:58,216
I will call Sun Chaek "Noonim."

260
00:24:58,216 --> 00:25:03,136
I do not mind if she gets married before me.

261
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:07,856
I already miss her face and voice.

262
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:10,486
<i>I said I can walk by myself.</i>

263
00:25:10,486 --> 00:25:11,966
<i>Put me down.</i>

264
00:25:11,966 --> 00:25:14,036
Am I hearing things?

265
00:25:14,036 --> 00:25:18,356
I feel like I could hear her voice.

266
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:21,296
<i>Gosh, I'm okay.</i>

267
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:28,546
Put me down, I said.

268
00:25:28,546 --> 00:25:29,986
People could see us.

269
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,446
Noonim!

270
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,976
- Seriously, put me down.
- Noonim!

271
00:25:35,006 --> 00:25:36,836
Sun Chaek.

272
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:45,506
Is that you, my Sun Chaek?

273
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:47,516
You came back alive, did you not?

274
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:49,746
- Father.
- Yes, yes, yes.

275
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:51,416
Aigoo.

276
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:54,476
Aigoo, my Sun Chaek.

277
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:57,696
Your face got so slender.

278
00:25:57,696 --> 00:26:00,846
You look so worn out.

279
00:26:00,846 --> 00:26:05,256
The moon heard our prayer.

280
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:07,746
Sun Chaek came back alive.

281
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:10,396
I am proud of you, my sister.

282
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:13,506
I'm okay.

283
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:15,676
I'm really okay.

284
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:18,446
Gosh.

285
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:22,686
By the way, what brings you here...

286
00:26:23,966 --> 00:26:26,846
I was able to return in good health

287
00:26:26,846 --> 00:26:29,946
thanks to Prince Gyeongseong.

288
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:32,586
He saved my life.

289
00:26:37,366 --> 00:26:39,956
I see.

290
00:26:39,956 --> 00:26:42,236
Thank you.

291
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:43,786
The night air is cold.

292
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:46,486
Come inside with us.

293
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:54,866
I will get going now.

294
00:26:54,866 --> 00:26:58,056
It is getting late. You should go inside.

295
00:26:58,056 --> 00:27:00,556
Yes. Well, then.

296
00:27:01,346 --> 00:27:03,646
- Let us go inside.
- But we should-

297
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:04,806
Let us go.

298
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:07,676
But he saved Sun Chaek...

299
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:10,316
Are you really leaving like this?

300
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:15,696
If we stay together tonight,

301
00:27:15,696 --> 00:27:18,486
something dangerous might really happen.

302
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:26,406
Something dangerous? L-Like what, exactly?

303
00:27:26,406 --> 00:27:29,736
Will there be assassins or swordsmen?

304
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:32,746
There is something dangerous

305
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:34,776
you do not know about.

306
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,186
I am giving you a pass tonight.

307
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:19,213
You wanted to see me first thing in the morning.

308
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:21,083
What is the reason?

309
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:24,953
I heard my marriage was being
arranged behind my back.

310
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,643
How could I delay a moment?

311
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:31,533
Royal marriages are under the
Internal Court's jurisdiction.

312
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:33,513
You must be aware of that.

313
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:36,803
Technically speaking, I am not a prince.

314
00:28:36,803 --> 00:28:38,993
Please stop the selection.

315
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:40,603
Through a selection,

316
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:44,773
I want to find someone
who is a good match for you.

317
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:47,533
Do you not know how this old lady feels?

318
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:52,183
I have already found someone
who is a good match for me.

319
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:54,043
I am aware.

320
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:59,943
But royal marriages are not just
about personal feelings.

321
00:29:01,463 --> 00:29:03,283
Prince Gyeongseong,

322
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,513
you are more naive than I thought.

323
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:11,403
If you want, that woman can become a concubine.

324
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:14,003
There will be only one woman for me.

325
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:16,353
Do not argue with me.

326
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:19,673
I will consider it an insult, then.

327
00:29:19,673 --> 00:29:21,673
Leave right now.

328
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,153
Please remember.

329
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:38,353
I politely gave you the last chance
to change your mind.

330
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:42,753
- What did you say?
- Do as you wish.

331
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:47,273
Things will end up the way I want, anyway.

332
00:29:47,273 --> 00:29:48,843
What do you mean by that?

333
00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:53,543
The woman I chose will be selected in the end.

334
00:29:55,703 --> 00:29:58,203
P-Prince Gyeongseong.

335
00:30:06,573 --> 00:30:08,603
Prince Gyeongseong!

336
00:30:11,873 --> 00:30:13,483
A magpie cried this morning.

337
00:30:13,483 --> 00:30:15,473
I was wondering who I would run into.

338
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:17,143
I get to see you here.

339
00:30:17,143 --> 00:30:19,513
I suppose you just saw the Queen Mother.

340
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:20,553
I did.

341
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:22,713
I was also on my way to see her.

342
00:30:22,713 --> 00:30:26,223
You are visiting the Queen Mother's
chamber so early.

343
00:30:26,223 --> 00:30:28,833
You must be quite close to her.

344
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:33,723
Well, I am her favorite among her relatives.

345
00:30:34,773 --> 00:30:36,533
So, you were her relative.

346
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,073
My Lord,

347
00:30:38,073 --> 00:30:42,833
to be honest, I sent an application
for the selection-

348
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:46,233
Prince Gyeongseong,
could we have a tea together...

349
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:47,893
<i>A Westerner?</i>

350
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:50,683
Why all of a sudden?

351
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,513
I think she got involved in something unpleasant.

352
00:30:54,783 --> 00:30:56,153
All right.

353
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:57,943
I will move as quickly as possible.

354
00:30:57,943 --> 00:30:59,723
And one more thing.

355
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:04,573
There is someone I want you to watch.

356
00:31:08,523 --> 00:31:10,493
Selection process?

357
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:14,683
I cannot believe you made such a huge decision
without discussing it with us.

358
00:31:14,683 --> 00:31:18,063
Did Prince Gyeongseong threaten you?

359
00:31:18,063 --> 00:31:22,183
He did not. I did it because I wanted to.

360
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:25,333
So, please let me.

361
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,403
I cannot.

362
00:31:26,403 --> 00:31:29,033
Let her, My Lord.

363
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:31,503
Wife, why are you doing this now?

364
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:35,933
You said you would grant any
of her wishes if she returned.

365
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:40,623
A man cannot go back on his word
from just yesterday.

366
00:31:40,623 --> 00:31:42,303
Wife,

367
00:31:42,303 --> 00:31:44,713
we should be stopping this reckless girl-

368
00:31:44,713 --> 00:31:47,923
Why stop her? We should support her.

369
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:51,303
- Wife?
- I gave birth to her and raised her,

370
00:31:51,303 --> 00:31:55,883
but I have never been happier with her decision.

371
00:31:55,883 --> 00:31:58,743
She wants to get married ahead of her brothers

372
00:31:58,743 --> 00:32:01,753
and participate in the
notoriously difficult selection.

373
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,523
I am proud of her courage.

374
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:07,963
Sun Chaek, participating in the selection

375
00:32:07,963 --> 00:32:11,233
is not as simple as you think.

376
00:32:12,553 --> 00:32:14,923
Do you still feel the same way?

377
00:32:16,283 --> 00:32:20,313
Father, I understand you are worried,

378
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,543
but if I cannot participate in the selection,

379
00:32:22,543 --> 00:32:25,833
I am sure I will regret it later.

380
00:32:31,623 --> 00:32:34,303
Have faith in our daughter.

381
00:32:34,303 --> 00:32:39,073
The fact that the Queen Mother is taking
charge of a royal family's marriage.

382
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:41,673
It does not seem like an ordinary selection.

383
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:43,923
It makes me worry.

384
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:46,163
Please do not worry.

385
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:49,993
I'm confident I'll exceed your expectations.

386
00:33:02,303 --> 00:33:04,373
[Cha Sun Chaek]

387
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,753
Sun Chaek of the Cha family?

388
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:12,053
Yes, she is the youngest daughter
of the Chief State Minister Cha Ho Yeol.

389
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:14,623
She sent her application, too?

390
00:33:14,623 --> 00:33:16,273
Yes.

391
00:33:16,273 --> 00:33:17,953
That cannot be.

392
00:33:17,953 --> 00:33:21,523
I was told she was at the plague village.

393
00:33:21,523 --> 00:33:23,033
Pardon?

394
00:33:24,793 --> 00:33:26,533
It is nothing.

395
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:29,553
Carry on using the registry for now.

396
00:33:29,553 --> 00:33:34,573
I will start the first round per your order then.

397
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:45,453
<i>The woman I chose will be selected in the end.</i>

398
00:33:46,963 --> 00:33:50,353
Is that why he said that?

399
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:52,573
Secretary Do.

400
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:56,263
Yes, Queen Mother. Yes.

401
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:05,423
I want this selection to be different
than the usual ones

402
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:07,943
planned by the Royal Wedding Office.

403
00:34:07,943 --> 00:34:10,223
Would you like to hear about it?

404
00:34:11,163 --> 00:34:12,603
Yes.

405
00:34:22,663 --> 00:34:27,613
I'll bring honor to the Cha family.

406
00:34:27,613 --> 00:34:29,113
Yes.

407
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:34,443
Watch your head, My Lady.

408
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:42,593
[The first round is about basic manners]

409
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:44,633
[The second round is about how cultivated one is]

410
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:46,703
[The third round is about
one's character and wisdom]

411
00:34:47,473 --> 00:34:50,043
<i>I'm a romantic period novel fanatic.</i>

412
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:52,723
<i>Of course, I know about the selection.</i>

413
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,433
<i>I've read about it so much that</i>

414
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:57,683
<i>I can explain it off the top of my head.</i>

415
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:21,193
You sure have great handwriting.

416
00:35:39,983 --> 00:35:43,903
Is the material for the
Prince Training Hall contest ready?

417
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,363
Yes.

418
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:58,553
It is also nice to look at.

419
00:35:59,553 --> 00:36:01,323
Thank you.

420
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:13,803
Let us go get lunch now.

421
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:16,643
How about hot gukbap and makgeolli?

422
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:18,913
That is a good idea.

423
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:22,783
Why are you not getting up? Do you not want lunch?

424
00:36:22,783 --> 00:36:25,033
Gukbap is not my favorite.

425
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:26,893
Why not? It is delicious.

426
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,303
For me, gukbap is...

427
00:36:29,303 --> 00:36:33,283
The smell and the look of it feel barbaric.

428
00:36:33,283 --> 00:36:34,763
Do not act superior.

429
00:36:34,763 --> 00:36:36,923
I am not. It is a matter of taste.

430
00:36:36,923 --> 00:36:38,173
Please respect it.

431
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:41,083
Of course, Mr. Calligrapher.

432
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,783
By the way, did you hear?

433
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,423
There will be a royal spouse selection
at the Palace soon.

434
00:36:45,423 --> 00:36:47,193
You mean for Prince Gyeongseong?

435
00:36:47,193 --> 00:36:49,233
Hold on.

436
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:51,773
Selection for Prince Gyeongseong?

437
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:53,943
What do you mean by that?

438
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:07,403
Lady Eun Ae?

439
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:10,923
Gosh, My Lady.

440
00:37:10,923 --> 00:37:12,823
What are you doing here...

441
00:37:12,823 --> 00:37:14,153
Because my father insisted,

442
00:37:14,153 --> 00:37:16,903
I will also be participating in the selection.

443
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,453
Your father?

444
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:19,573
Yes.

445
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:23,143
He even purchased a fake nobility note.

446
00:37:24,983 --> 00:37:27,223
<i>If Eun Ae participates in the selection,</i>

447
00:37:27,223 --> 00:37:29,793
<i>does it make her my competition?</i>

448
00:37:29,793 --> 00:37:31,393
<i>By chance,</i>

449
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:35,003
<i>will Eun Ae and Yi Beon be able to connect again?</i>

450
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:38,683
<i>This world is too unpredictable.</i>

451
00:37:41,183 --> 00:37:43,633
I hope you are not mistaken.

452
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:47,023
I am still scared of Prince Gyeongseong.
I do not like him.

453
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:50,043
I do not even want to be married to him

454
00:37:50,043 --> 00:37:53,383
even in my dreams.

455
00:37:53,383 --> 00:37:56,433
Would you be okay being here, then?

456
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,003
My father said it was his dream.

457
00:38:01,003 --> 00:38:03,483
You're doing this just to be filial.

458
00:38:03,483 --> 00:38:05,903
I admire your filial heart, Lady Eun Ae.

459
00:38:05,903 --> 00:38:08,523
It is my duty.

460
00:38:09,423 --> 00:38:14,873
I hope I do not get in
between you and Prince Gyeongseong.

461
00:38:14,873 --> 00:38:17,103
- Not at all.
- Do not worry.

462
00:38:17,103 --> 00:38:20,203
I will get disqualified quickly
since I lack in many ways.

463
00:38:20,203 --> 00:38:23,943
I hope you have a good result.

464
00:38:28,593 --> 00:38:33,213
Gosh, I hear vulgar and unpleasant noises.

465
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:34,913
My Lady.

466
00:38:38,743 --> 00:38:41,913
<i>What is Cha Sun Chaek doing here?</i>

467
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:44,033
<i>Why is she not sick?</i>

468
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:46,303
You look like you saw a ghost.

469
00:38:46,303 --> 00:38:51,263
You are not happy to see me, either. Am I wrong?

470
00:38:52,523 --> 00:38:55,993
Here is your fan, My Lady.

471
00:38:55,993 --> 00:38:58,783
The world must be coming to an end.

472
00:38:58,783 --> 00:39:00,823
Even dogs and cows are
participating in the selection.

473
00:39:00,823 --> 00:39:02,333
Dogs and cows?

474
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:05,583
You are going too far.

475
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,973
A lowlife like you are
participating in the selection?

476
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:10,163
I can hear the sound of the royal family's

477
00:39:10,163 --> 00:39:12,813
authority falling all the way from here.

478
00:39:12,813 --> 00:39:17,593
I will show the difference between
a noblewoman and a lowlife like you.

479
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:21,143
I know I will get disqualified in the first round.

480
00:39:21,143 --> 00:39:22,533
You don't know that.

481
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:24,963
You never know until you compete.

482
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:28,933
Gosh. What a touching friendship.

483
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,903
They say, "Heukimjamuk."

484
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:32,473
If you stay close to something dirty,

485
00:39:32,473 --> 00:39:35,373
you end up getting dirty, too.

486
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,533
You mean, "Geunmukjaheuk."

487
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:43,433
What kind of food is "Heukimjamuk?"

488
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:48,033
You will regret ignoring my warning.

489
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:49,943
Cho Eun Ae or whatever her name is...

490
00:39:49,943 --> 00:39:54,883
You never know what sly nature she is
hiding behind her innocent face.

491
00:39:54,883 --> 00:39:56,683
It takes one to know one, they say.

492
00:39:56,683 --> 00:39:58,483
What did you say?

493
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:02,273
All right. Line up and go inside in order.

494
00:40:02,273 --> 00:40:03,963
Let's go.

495
00:40:12,663 --> 00:40:15,243
<i>It is a ritual for the Kitchen God.</i>

496
00:40:15,243 --> 00:40:18,993
<i>It signals the beginning of the selection.</i>

497
00:40:31,173 --> 00:40:35,563
The cauldron knob never bent before.

498
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:38,463
Does this signal something?

499
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:42,773
I dodged a bad omen.

500
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,013
I dodged it.

501
00:40:49,753 --> 00:40:53,523
The first round of the selection will commence.

502
00:40:53,523 --> 00:40:58,283
The Queen Mother gave you this task herself.

503
00:40:58,283 --> 00:41:00,423
It is called,

504
00:41:00,423 --> 00:41:04,563
"Triathlon Fitness Battle."

505
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:08,963
<i>Health is one of the three criteria
for women, along with intelligence and heart.</i>

506
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:16,013
Especially the royal women
need to be stronger than anyone.

507
00:41:16,013 --> 00:41:23,183
Women of this country carried
cannonballs themselves during wars

508
00:41:23,183 --> 00:41:27,953
and overcame crises alongside men
throughout our history.

509
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:29,383
Therefore,

510
00:41:30,383 --> 00:41:34,493
you lift up this cannonball...

511
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:40,753
Lift it up and

512
00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:43,303
toss it past that line.

513
00:41:43,303 --> 00:41:47,173
The ones who succeed will pass this round.

514
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:50,963
Who wants to toss it first?

515
00:41:52,503 --> 00:41:54,533
What do I do?

516
00:41:55,853 --> 00:42:00,223
Is there anyone who wants to go first?

517
00:42:00,223 --> 00:42:02,633
I will give it a try.

518
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:04,593
How admirable.

519
00:42:04,593 --> 00:42:07,823
Bring her the cannonball.

520
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:25,313
Toss it!

521
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:32,603
She passed!

522
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:34,863
Good job.

523
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:37,843
You did a great job.

524
00:42:43,293 --> 00:42:48,413
All right. Start tossing it in order.

525
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,853
She passed!

526
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:58,093
She failed!

527
00:42:58,093 --> 00:42:59,603
She passed!

528
00:42:59,603 --> 00:43:02,193
She failed!

529
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,393
She passed!

530
00:43:06,363 --> 00:43:09,653
She failed!

531
00:43:17,023 --> 00:43:19,513
She passed!

532
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,543
All she got is brute force.

533
00:43:23,563 --> 00:43:26,623
She failed!

534
00:43:27,743 --> 00:43:30,183
She passed!

535
00:43:38,993 --> 00:43:41,513
<i>Is it really this heavy?</i>

536
00:43:49,803 --> 00:43:52,433
<i>No, don't get scared.</i>

537
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:56,573
<i>Sports are about science, not force.</i>

538
00:44:05,803 --> 00:44:08,383
<i>Apply pressure to the core.</i>

539
00:44:08,383 --> 00:44:12,073
<i>Using the centrifugal force...</i>

540
00:44:12,073 --> 00:44:16,193
<i>toss it the moment you feel certain.</i>

541
00:44:20,223 --> 00:44:22,533
She passed!

542
00:44:38,563 --> 00:44:39,803
What brings you here?

543
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:42,453
How could you not tell me about your selection?

544
00:44:42,453 --> 00:44:44,543
I am very disappointed.

545
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:56,543
The selection was planned behind your back.

546
00:44:56,543 --> 00:44:58,793
You are finally facing a hardship, too.

547
00:44:58,793 --> 00:45:00,813
This is not much of a hardship.

548
00:45:00,813 --> 00:45:02,723
Do not be so confident.

549
00:45:02,723 --> 00:45:05,713
If another woman gets selected,

550
00:45:05,713 --> 00:45:07,123
what would you do then?

551
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:10,893
I can easily cancel the selection result.

552
00:45:10,893 --> 00:45:12,533
If you can,

553
00:45:12,533 --> 00:45:15,493
why are you letting the selection happen?

554
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:19,803
Just like in hunting,

555
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:22,793
everything has its moment.

556
00:45:22,793 --> 00:45:23,973
Hunting?

557
00:45:23,973 --> 00:45:28,183
I am suspicious that this selection started at all.

558
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,873
I am thinking of finding out the reason.

559
00:45:30,873 --> 00:45:32,433
And...

560
00:45:34,473 --> 00:45:38,733
hardships aren't necessarily bad.

561
00:45:41,843 --> 00:45:44,243
What are you so entertained by?

562
00:45:47,693 --> 00:45:49,393
This is so you.

563
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:51,463
You were watching this...

564
00:46:11,863 --> 00:46:14,533
Only the maidens who hit the bullseye

565
00:46:14,533 --> 00:46:17,373
can move on to the next stage.

566
00:46:29,443 --> 00:46:30,833
She passed.

567
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:58,583
Something is strange over there.

568
00:47:01,643 --> 00:47:03,053
She passed!

569
00:47:04,153 --> 00:47:06,833
I-It worked.

570
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:09,423
It was obviously suspicious.

571
00:47:09,423 --> 00:47:11,353
This is not fair.

572
00:47:11,353 --> 00:47:13,153
If you do not shoot at a count of 10,

573
00:47:13,153 --> 00:47:16,373
I will disqualify you.

574
00:47:35,813 --> 00:47:39,143
Even the best archer could not
hit the bullseye in this weather.

575
00:47:39,143 --> 00:47:44,713
This is also a part of her fate.

576
00:47:44,713 --> 00:47:46,753
You cheated.

577
00:47:46,753 --> 00:47:49,063
How dare you speak of fate?

578
00:47:49,063 --> 00:47:51,253
I will have to show her...

579
00:47:51,253 --> 00:47:55,353
that fate can change.

580
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:03,783
Ten!

581
00:48:03,783 --> 00:48:07,463
I'm Jumong's descendant.

582
00:48:07,463 --> 00:48:10,203
Korea is a nation of archery.

583
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:12,183
Seven!

584
00:48:12,183 --> 00:48:15,993
Sun Chaek better not delay too much.

585
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,113
Five!

586
00:48:18,113 --> 00:48:20,553
Four!

587
00:48:20,553 --> 00:48:23,063
<i>You don't calculate the wind.</i>

588
00:48:23,063 --> 00:48:24,553
Three!

589
00:48:24,553 --> 00:48:27,883
<i>- You overcome it.</i>
- Two!

590
00:48:28,863 --> 00:48:31,263
One!

591
00:48:33,433 --> 00:48:35,623
Wow!

592
00:48:36,573 --> 00:48:39,943
Even with this strong wind!

593
00:48:46,771 --> 00:48:48,513
Do not look him in the eye.

594
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:51,513
Oh, no, hurry.

595
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:53,383
Hurry.

596
00:48:55,653 --> 00:49:00,023
<i>I found the Westerner who approached Lady Cha.</i>

597
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:03,693
<i>I think he came off of a ship
that arrived about six days ago.</i>

598
00:49:03,693 --> 00:49:06,143
Six days ago?

599
00:49:09,623 --> 00:49:11,453
<i>He and Lady Cha went to a tavern, a fabric shop,</i>

600
00:49:11,453 --> 00:49:14,143
<i>and other places together.</i>

601
00:49:14,143 --> 00:49:18,363
<i>He is currently staying at an inn that
the fabric shop owner recommended.</i>

602
00:49:23,973 --> 00:49:27,593
<i>He did not display plague symptoms.</i>

603
00:50:10,493 --> 00:50:12,343
I am here to pick up my clothes.

604
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:15,293
You came with Lady Sun Chaek last time.

605
00:50:15,293 --> 00:50:17,313
I will bring them out now.

606
00:50:18,893 --> 00:50:21,483
He speaks our language well, by the way.

607
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:51,353
This is the last stage of the first round.

608
00:51:51,353 --> 00:51:54,493
Deliver refreshments for the internal court ladies

609
00:51:54,493 --> 00:51:56,973
who are working hard.

610
00:52:15,513 --> 00:52:17,413
Get started.

611
00:52:38,023 --> 00:52:41,343
My Lady, the porridge
on the left is about to spill.

612
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,713
Thank you.

613
00:52:42,713 --> 00:52:44,213
It's slippery here. Be careful.

614
00:52:44,213 --> 00:52:45,623
Okay.

615
00:52:49,403 --> 00:52:51,243
You wasted food that our countrymen

616
00:52:51,243 --> 00:52:53,983
grew with blood, sweat, and tears.

617
00:52:53,983 --> 00:52:55,503
You failed.

618
00:52:56,423 --> 00:53:00,663
<i>Don't underestimate a resident
of a hilltop neighborhood.</i>

619
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:24,083
You failed.

620
00:53:29,963 --> 00:53:31,603
The bowls you broke are...

621
00:53:31,603 --> 00:53:35,723
precious white porcelain, the Princess' favorite.

622
00:53:35,723 --> 00:53:37,363
You failed.

623
00:53:52,283 --> 00:53:55,473
I guess no experience is useless.

624
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:37,353
Are you okay?

625
00:54:37,353 --> 00:54:41,993
I might die before the selection ends.

626
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,973
Anyway, thanks for your help today.

627
00:54:48,913 --> 00:54:50,473
Do not mention it.

628
00:54:50,473 --> 00:54:53,963
You helped me a lot, too.

629
00:54:53,963 --> 00:54:55,833
<i>Don't smile like that.</i>

630
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:58,023
<i>I'm your competitor.</i>

631
00:54:58,023 --> 00:55:00,343
<i>You need to defeat me.</i>

632
00:55:00,343 --> 00:55:05,193
I feel secure that you are with me.

633
00:55:05,193 --> 00:55:07,583
<i>But I feel uncomfortable.</i>

634
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:12,243
<i>I'm sorry, sweet Lady Eun Ae.</i>

635
00:55:12,243 --> 00:55:14,513
Why do you look so down?

636
00:55:14,513 --> 00:55:17,993
You said we should work hard
without being discouraged.

637
00:55:17,993 --> 00:55:19,553
Let us do well until the end.

638
00:55:19,553 --> 00:55:22,213
But what would be the point?

639
00:55:22,213 --> 00:55:25,653
I think someone was already chosen internally.

640
00:55:27,443 --> 00:55:31,153
You saw Do Hwa Seon cheating, right?

641
00:55:40,573 --> 00:55:43,363
Is there anyone who does not know that?

642
00:55:43,363 --> 00:55:46,173
I hope we aren't playing sidekicks to Do Hwa Seon

643
00:55:46,173 --> 00:55:50,033
when the decision was already made.

644
00:55:50,033 --> 00:55:51,413
Geez.

645
00:55:51,413 --> 00:55:55,143
Thinking that makes me so angry.

646
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,323
My Lady, if nothing had changed,

647
00:55:57,323 --> 00:56:01,223
I would not have been able
to participate in this selection.

648
00:56:01,223 --> 00:56:02,803
I was born an orphan.

649
00:56:02,803 --> 00:56:05,473
No matter how wealthy my stepfather is,

650
00:56:05,473 --> 00:56:08,433
he is nothing but a merchant.

651
00:56:08,433 --> 00:56:11,753
But while he was growing his business,

652
00:56:11,753 --> 00:56:14,253
he was able to change his status.

653
00:56:14,253 --> 00:56:17,633
And I got to participate in the selection, too.

654
00:56:18,613 --> 00:56:20,263
Lady Eun Ae.

655
00:56:20,263 --> 00:56:23,183
Now, I think...

656
00:56:23,183 --> 00:56:26,803
nothing in this world was predetermined.

657
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:29,973
All we have is this moment.

658
00:56:36,113 --> 00:56:38,013
Was that out of line?

659
00:56:38,013 --> 00:56:39,663
No.

660
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:42,313
You're so admirable.

661
00:56:42,313 --> 00:56:45,743
"Nothing is predetermined in this world."

662
00:56:46,683 --> 00:56:48,913
It's such a cool idea.

663
00:56:56,343 --> 00:56:58,743
I wonder if the test went well.

664
00:56:58,743 --> 00:57:01,373
I wonder if she caused trouble.

665
00:57:10,233 --> 00:57:13,523
The person I saw was indeed Maiden Eun Ae.

666
00:57:14,423 --> 00:57:17,423
Why did she participate
in Prince Gyeongseong's selection?

667
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,013
No.

668
00:57:21,013 --> 00:57:23,253
No...

669
00:57:23,253 --> 00:57:25,613
This cannot be true.

670
00:57:28,493 --> 00:57:30,233
Right.

671
00:57:30,233 --> 00:57:32,703
I was worried most about Eun Ae,

672
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:36,273
but she said the present moment matters the most.

673
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:40,113
Let's stop feeling guilty.

674
00:57:41,323 --> 00:57:43,573
Just focus on what's ahead.

675
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,783
Is talking to yourself a trend these days?

676
00:57:54,903 --> 00:57:57,833
I don't even have the energy to be surprised.

677
00:57:57,833 --> 00:58:01,653
Do not say you already failed the first round.

678
00:58:01,653 --> 00:58:03,513
What do you mean, fail?

679
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:07,273
I hung in there with all my might and passed.

680
00:58:07,273 --> 00:58:09,423
The whole thing was already set up for Do Hwa Seon.

681
00:58:09,423 --> 00:58:12,653
Do you know how hard I worked?

682
00:58:12,653 --> 00:58:15,113
Look. My legs are shaking.

683
00:58:15,113 --> 00:58:18,133
Lady Eun Ae and I were so flustered.

684
00:58:20,173 --> 00:58:21,903
You know Lady Eun Ae, right?

685
00:58:21,903 --> 00:58:24,383
- At the Seonmun Club meeting-
- I am not interested.

686
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:28,343
All I am interested in is you, Cha Sun Chaek.

687
00:58:30,643 --> 00:58:34,373
So, no matter what the test is,

688
00:58:34,373 --> 00:58:36,473
make sure to pass.

689
00:58:36,473 --> 00:58:38,303
Getting married is important,

690
00:58:38,303 --> 00:58:42,803
but I'll make sure to win
for the sake of my dignity.

691
00:58:52,503 --> 00:58:57,483
Prove yourself as the female lead who suits me.

692
00:58:57,483 --> 00:58:59,063
If it is for winning,

693
00:58:59,063 --> 00:59:01,473
I will let you do anything.

694
00:59:01,473 --> 00:59:03,063
But...

695
00:59:03,063 --> 00:59:07,013
I cannot forgive you if you hurt yourself.

696
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:31,413
Let's go.

697
00:59:55,073 --> 00:59:58,173
For the second round of the selection today,

698
00:59:58,173 --> 01:00:00,033
out of intelligence, heart, and health,

699
01:00:00,033 --> 01:00:03,293
we will assess the intelligence.

700
01:00:41,823 --> 01:00:47,203
In the pouches, there are 10 nyang worth of coins.

701
01:00:47,203 --> 01:00:53,313
Increase the worth of 10 nyang in two days.

702
01:00:53,313 --> 01:00:59,563
That is the task I am giving you.

That's an admirable idea.

706
01:01:23,923 --> 01:01:28,433
I'm so impressed with you, Lady Eun Ae.

707
01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:30,833
<i>After being moved by Eun Ae's words,</i>

708
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:33,033
<i>Sun Chaek felt at ease.</i>

709
01:01:33,033 --> 01:01:37,473
<i>It's probably because
of the guilt she's been having.</i>

710
01:01:37,473 --> 01:01:41,653
<i>But what Eun Ae said to Sun Chaek wasn't for her.</i>

711
01:01:41,653 --> 01:01:44,693
<i>It was more of a promise to herself.</i>
