00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:47,093
The farmers and fishermen worked so hard on these.

184
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:50,143
I must not let it go to waste.

185
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:56,393
You have learned how to cherish the people.

186
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:59,243
You are all grown up now.

187
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:04,523
You must be old enough to marry now.

188
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:06,703
Father,

189
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:08,873
she is an adult now.

190
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:12,393
- She should find her match.
- You should do that first.

191
00:16:12,393 --> 00:16:13,873
Not just one,

192
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,833
but three brothers have not married yet.

193
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,343
I hear you can find your match at Dahong Club.

194
00:16:27,343 --> 00:16:28,943
Dahong Club?

195
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:32,743
The noble ladies' club, you know.

196
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:35,323
<i>I think I read about it in the book.</i>

197
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:36,703
[The Obsessive Tyrant]

198
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:40,573
[Dahong Club is a social club
of noblemen's daughters]

199
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:42,643
The club that meets on the 15th of every month?

200
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:46,073
The meeting happens tonight.

201
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:49,523
You need to start getting ready now.

202
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:50,833
Ready how?

203
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,453
Do you not remember?

204
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:55,773
You told me we had to prepare for it.

205
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:59,303
Anyway, we need to start getting ready now.

206
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:09,703
My Sun Chaek.

207
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:14,293
You are representing the Cha family of Yeonan.

208
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:17,643
Make sure you look the best in Hanyang.

209
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:20,553
Do not skimp.

210
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:22,703
Make sure to spend all of it.

211
00:17:22,703 --> 00:17:26,033
It is your father's order.

212
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:33,003
If that is your order,

213
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,623
I should follow it, Father.

214
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,903
Yes.

215
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:53,783
<i>Someone gets me dolled up,</i>

216
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:57,103
<i>dresses me,</i>

217
00:18:09,953 --> 00:18:12,163
<i>and makes me shine.</i>

218
00:18:13,073 --> 00:18:15,243
<i>This is the life of a side character?</i>

219
00:18:15,243 --> 00:18:17,183
<i>Daebak.</i>

220
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:22,143
I can't believe I'm in a fictional world.

221
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:29,843
What happens if I can't get out of here?

222
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:34,753
I'd be grateful, then.

223
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:37,413
Why would I leave this world?

224
00:18:45,663 --> 00:18:48,663
The smell of money is always so fragrant.

225
00:18:56,353 --> 00:19:00,793
And I'm in my favorite novel?

226
00:19:00,793 --> 00:19:04,253
This is better than winning the lottery.

227
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:08,503
I'm in the novel. Hooray!

228
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:19,373
What father scolds you for not spending money?

229
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:23,243
It's nice to be the Chief State
Minister's daughter.

230
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:25,823
So, what if I'm in someone else's body?

231
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,103
This is a dream, but I won't wake up.

232
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,193
Dahong Club and the full moon are tonight.

233
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:42,453
I'm still at the beginning of the book.

234
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:45,933
It's when the characters start crossing paths.

235
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,453
My Lady.

236
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:51,203
- This way.
- Oh, okay.

237
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:19,303
You came, Lady Sun Chaek.

238
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:21,083
Welcome, My Lady.

239
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,533
Yes.

240
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:38,183
My Lady.

241
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:40,553
Look at these colors.

242
00:20:40,553 --> 00:20:44,273
They must be angel's clothes.

243
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:47,313
Is this better?

244
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,463
Or is this better?

245
00:20:49,463 --> 00:20:51,803
I like both.

246
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:56,283
The clothes I'm wearing are made of silk, too.

247
00:20:56,283 --> 00:20:59,813
Since you like pure silk...

248
00:20:59,813 --> 00:21:02,803
Pure silk?

249
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,743
Silk made of pure silk yarn.

250
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:07,663
Because you kept talking about it,

251
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:11,613
they got it all the way from China in three months.

252
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:14,473
Did I do that?

253
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,353
Should we go with this, then?

254
00:21:18,183 --> 00:21:20,633
Since you only wear top-quality clothes,

255
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:23,023
you have exceptional taste.

256
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:24,303
My Lady,

257
00:21:24,303 --> 00:21:27,183
since His Excellency gave us plenty of money,

258
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:29,753
how about we get both?

259
00:21:29,753 --> 00:21:31,213
Should we?

260
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:35,883
No one else can buy these but you.

261
00:21:35,883 --> 00:21:37,743
Hold on a moment.

262
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:54,843
I think that dress will look better on me.

263
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:57,503
Let me have it this time.

264
00:21:58,493 --> 00:22:00,713
You came, Lady Hwa Seon.

265
00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:02,273
<i>Hwa Seon?</i>

266
00:22:03,163 --> 00:22:05,313
<i>Do Hwa Seon, by chance?</i>

267
00:22:07,363 --> 00:22:11,553
<i>Do Hwa Seon, the Right State
Minister's third daughter.</i>

268
00:22:11,553 --> 00:22:15,033
<i>As her name implies, she starts
all conflicts and incidents.</i>

269
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,713
<i>She's wicked.</i>

270
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:22,873
I heard someone ordered a summer
garment made from this silk.

271
00:22:22,873 --> 00:22:25,733
Yes, Prince Gyeongseong did.

272
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,673
I should wear this dress, then.

273
00:22:28,703 --> 00:22:33,683
We would look like a beautiful couple.

274
00:22:33,683 --> 00:22:37,993
But Sun Cheok ordered this first-

275
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:39,593
A-Are you okay?

276
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:42,703
How dare a lowly man jump into our conversation?

277
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:46,483
M-My apologies.

278
00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:47,793
Lady,

279
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:50,733
they act up if you treat them nicely.

280
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:52,833
Make them learn their place.

281
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,013
<i>Seeing her in person like this</i>

282
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:57,143
<i>is even more infuriating.</i>

283
00:22:57,143 --> 00:23:01,353
Do you want to tell me something, by chance?

284
00:23:02,743 --> 00:23:03,833
My Lady.

285
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,483
Excuse me,

286
00:23:07,843 --> 00:23:09,713
those clothes...

287
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:14,993
- Hwa Seon, you-
- Hwa Seon?

288
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:18,323
Lady Hwa Seon, you can...

289
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:20,733
just have it.

290
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:27,683
You are the Chief State Minister's daughter.

291
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:30,343
Assert dominance.

292
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:33,213
<i>Main skills. Arson and kidnapping.</i>

293
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:35,703
<i>Mastered poisoning and murdering as a hobby.</i>

294
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:37,893
<i>Getting involved with a notorious villain</i>

295
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:39,923
<i>would make my life tiring.</i>

296
00:23:39,923 --> 00:23:42,733
Do you mean it?

297
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:44,553
- Of course.
- My Lady.

298
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:45,993
What has gotten into you?

299
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:49,273
You always get top-quality silk.

300
00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:51,233
But you are letting me have this?

301
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:53,193
I wonder if you are plotting something.

302
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:55,513
I am so scared.

303
00:23:55,513 --> 00:23:58,703
<i>I find you scarier.</i>

304
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:03,143
<i>Please take those clothes and leave.</i>

305
00:24:03,143 --> 00:24:06,843
If you matched with Prince Gyeongseong,

306
00:24:06,843 --> 00:24:11,423
you would look so beautiful as a couple.

307
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:15,563
Of course, I should let you have it.

308
00:24:15,563 --> 00:24:17,873
If you insist,

309
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,463
I will not say no.

310
00:24:19,463 --> 00:24:21,593
I will leave now, then.

311
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,383
Hold on.

312
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:26,413
What is it now?

313
00:24:27,403 --> 00:24:29,253
Since you let me have the clothes,

314
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:32,123
I would like to treat you to a tea.

315
00:24:32,123 --> 00:24:35,933
You will not reject my kind offer, will you?

316
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,843
I am not rejecting it.

317
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:41,393
Okay.

318
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:45,463
Send the dress to our house.

319
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:47,113
Okay, got it.

320
00:24:47,113 --> 00:24:48,733
Let us go.

321
00:25:25,353 --> 00:25:27,133
My Lady,

322
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:33,643
thank you for letting us host
a Dahong Club meeting tonight.

323
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:38,243
I am a bit busy.

324
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,803
Acting all pitiful...

325
00:25:58,803 --> 00:26:01,913
Let us drink tea next time since I am upset.

326
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:04,833
Who is she, by the way?

327
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:07,363
Do you dislike her?

328
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:10,743
Yes, I do. Very much.

329
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:12,763
She is a depressing orphan.

330
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:14,603
How dare she try to join the Dahong Club?

331
00:26:14,603 --> 00:26:16,643
Even her name sounds fake.

332
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:18,953
It's Cho Eun Ae* or whatever.
(Means, "good kid")

333
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,153
Cho Eun Ae?

334
00:26:21,153 --> 00:26:22,823
She was born as an orphan

335
00:26:22,823 --> 00:26:25,633
and adopted by the wealthiest merchant
in Joseon by coincidence.

336
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:28,223
<i>Serendipitously, she falls in love
with Prince Gyeongseong,</i>

337
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:31,443
<i>Yi Beon, regardless of the class difference.</i>

338
00:26:32,973 --> 00:26:36,893
<i>I get to see my favorite, Eun Ae, in person.</i>

339
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:39,413
Let us work together...

340
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:42,733
and make sure she cannot come near here.

341
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:44,873
Let us teach her a lesson...

342
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:47,223
tonight.

343
00:26:47,223 --> 00:26:48,603
Tonight?

344
00:26:48,603 --> 00:26:51,803
The teahouse owned by her father, Cho Byeong Mo,

345
00:26:51,813 --> 00:26:54,793
will be in charge of the hosting
of the Dahong Club.

346
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:57,073
They are using money to mingle with the nobility.

347
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,303
I am planning to discipline her properly.

348
00:27:02,023 --> 00:27:03,533
Do you agree with me,

349
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:05,723
Lady Sun Chaek?

350
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:21,359
Gosh, look at this.

351
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,909
Are your brothers doing well?

352
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,949
- Thank you.
- I hope this is enough.

353
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:27,889
Thank you.

354
00:27:28,969 --> 00:27:31,609
Now that I've met her, I get why

355
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,259
Eun Ae is the female lead.

356
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:38,049
She's been through endless hardship since birth,

357
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:40,499
but endless coincidences and destined timing

358
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:42,569
that turn crises into opportunities.

359
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,509
She even has a devastating quality

360
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:49,359
that draws people in.

361
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:53,739
She's the perfect female lead.

362
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:59,799
On the other hand, Cha Sun Chaek

363
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:05,429
has a high status, endless money,

364
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:07,059
and a happy family.

365
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:10,159
She's not lacking in any sense.

366
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,659
The observer with a privilege.

367
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:18,919
I just need to observe this fun story, right?

368
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:21,449
This is amazing.

369
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,989
What's this?

370
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:28,239
I feel something.

371
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:40,919
It is Prince Gyeongseong.

372
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:56,189
I knew it. It's Yi Beon, Prince Gyeongseong.

373
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:03,989
He's way more handsome than I thought.

374
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:24,929
<i>Yi Beon, Prince Gyeongseong...</i>

375
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:41,429
<i>He volunteered to be the
hunting dog of the royal family.</i>

376
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:43,109
<i>He's a monster.</i>

377
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:50,329
<i>He shows no blood or tear.</i>

378
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:53,569
<i>He's the male lead of this world.</i>

379
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:01,909
Why can I not raise my head?

380
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:03,609
If you make eye contact with Prince Gyeongseong,

381
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:05,939
something terrible might happen to you.

382
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:07,749
During the royal banquet,

383
00:30:07,749 --> 00:30:10,089
<i>a hair was found in his food.</i>

384
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:11,799
We deserve to die!

385
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:14,089
<i>We deserve to die!</i>

386
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:15,919
<i>He apparently cut all the hair off</i>

387
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,599
<i>the kitchen staff's heads.</i>

388
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:22,159
A servant scratched his hand slightly
while dressing him up.

389
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,489
Your Highness!

390
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,699
Spare me. Spare me...

391
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:38,359
<i>He pulled out her fingernails and toenails.</i>

392
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:41,409
Someone who got caught chatting
during the rainmaking ceremony

393
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:44,719
got all of their teeth pulled out.

394
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:51,259
That is not all.

395
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:52,959
The women who spent a night with him

396
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:55,449
were forced to become Buddhist nuns the day after.

397
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:58,599
So, they had to join the temple by force.

398
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:01,009
There is no need to fear.

399
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:10,439
Here.

400
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:15,179
It is best to believe what you see
rather than listen to rumors.

401
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:17,349
Who are you?

402
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,969
<i>The supporting male character,
the official of Hongmungwan.</i>

403
00:31:22,969 --> 00:31:24,639
<i>Jung Su Gyeom.</i>

404
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:26,439
<i>He's sweet, proper,</i>

405
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:28,039
<i>and he's even intelligent.</i>

406
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,529
<i>He's the prime example
of a supporting character,</i>

407
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:33,599
<i>and the only friend of Yi Beon,
Prince Gyeongseong.</i>

408
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:37,229
Look, Beon. Wait for me.

409
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:46,509
Beon,

410
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:49,069
did you find out who that man was?

411
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:55,559
Your face tells me you have not caught him.

412
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:00,169
I can tell by just looking at your eyes.

413
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,749
I told you not to call me that.

414
00:32:04,749 --> 00:32:07,619
Come on, Beon. My Beon.

415
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:10,119
It is just between us.

416
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,939
I think I-

417
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,469
Prince Gyeongseong...

418
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:09,169
The love quadrangle is even
more intense in person.

419
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:11,619
If tonight is the full moon,

420
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:13,909
Eun Ae and Yi Beon's encounter

421
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,579
has not happened yet.

422
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:21,459
Do I just need to wait
for the highlight of the night?

423
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,179
Where can I get popcorn?

424
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:25,219
Explosion!

425
00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:49,529
This is the best spot to watch.

426
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:54,409
A masterpiece is still fun,
even when you know the ending.

427
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:10,569
Move!

428
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:13,529
- Move!
- Move!

429
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:15,279
Passing by. Move.

430
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:17,369
- Move!
- Move!

431
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:21,579
Gosh, I can't believe I'm going
to a Dahong Club meeting.

432
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:24,279
It's too exciting.

433
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:27,049
No.

434
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:28,979
It's exciting and nerve-wracking,

435
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:31,529
but I can't show it.

436
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:34,929
In this type of genre, a side character

437
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:38,369
can get wrongly involved and twist the story.

438
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:44,629
Know your place for everyone's sake.

439
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:47,239
Know your place.

440
00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:24,989
- Cook it all the way.
- Yes, My Lady.

441
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:37,349
Nothing can be lacking.

442
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:40,519
We need to prepare with
a lot more care than usual.

443
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:42,429
<i>Yes, My Lady.</i>

444
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:44,009
Yes, My Lady.

445
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,519
Gosh, no way.

446
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:54,029
It reminds me of your eyes.

447
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:56,389
So pretty.

448
00:35:57,299 --> 00:35:58,679
Lady Hwa Seon,

449
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:01,829
I cannot look at you tonight.

450
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:05,009
You are too radiant tonight.

451
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:08,619
I know.

452
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:11,099
Lady Hwa Seon sure is

453
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:14,109
the greatest beauty of Hanyang.

454
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:18,839
Do you not agree?

455
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:22,289
Oh, yes. You are right.

456
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:26,009
She is like a dragonfly...

457
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,429
I mean, she is like an angel from heaven.

458
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:35,229
Angel! Angel.

459
00:36:35,229 --> 00:36:37,469
<i>Blindly agreeing with others</i>

460
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:40,069
<i>is a side character's job.</i>

461
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:42,309
Everyone,

462
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:44,899
the tea and snacks are ready.

463
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:56,939
This is a work of art.

464
00:36:56,939 --> 00:36:59,049
Gosh, so beautiful.

465
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:00,769
So beautiful.

466
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:04,199
We can each take a plate.

467
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:14,009
My Lady,

468
00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:15,999
have a cup of tea.

469
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:31,969
Would you pour it for me?

470
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:37,879
Of course, My Lady.

471
00:37:49,949 --> 00:37:51,139
Was my hand slippery?

472
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:52,499
Are you okay, My Lady?

473
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:53,909
I feel so terrible.

474
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:55,519
The floor got so dirty.

475
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:57,769
I will clean it.

476
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,749
Could you clean quickly?

477
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:07,699
I am a bit sensitive.

478
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:09,589
Yes, My Lady.

479
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:25,929
I will come back in a bit.

480
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,909
My apologies.

481
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:35,999
Take this.

482
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,589
Thank you.

483
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:46,599
<i>Eun Ae, cheer up.</i>

484
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:49,229
<i>You'll win everything eventually.</i>

485
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:51,839
<i>You'll meet the male lead and be happy, too.</i>

486
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,879
<i>Because you're the main character of this novel.</i>

487
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:55,449
<i>Fighting.</i>

488
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:12,999
Why would you give a handkerchief to a servant?

489
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:16,319
Was I not aware that you are friends with her?

490
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:20,719
I just cannot stand blood.

491
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:24,079
My father raised me, making sure

492
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,719
I do not see anything horrific.

493
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:29,829
You must all know, do you not?

494
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:32,169
My father, the Chief State Minister,

495
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:36,209
His Excellency Cha Ho Yeol.

496
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:42,119
She is making a fuss over a little cut.

497
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:44,219
She must have acted pitiful
in front of Cho Byeong Mo

498
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:46,489
and got herself adopted.

499
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:48,459
Actually,

500
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:49,839
she is supposedly his daughter,

501
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,639
but she frequents his bedroom, apparently.

502
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:55,199
- Gosh, really?
- Yes.

503
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,219
She is so unexpectedly devious.

504
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:03,639
They say the tame cat reaches the roof first.

505
00:40:04,549 --> 00:40:07,299
<i>What awful gossip.</i>

506
00:40:07,299 --> 00:40:09,619
<i>Should I step in?</i>

507
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:11,309
<i>No.</i>

508
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:14,349
<i>Don't step in. You'll only give
yourself a headache.</i>

509
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:18,129
She looks innocent, but she is scary.

510
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:21,949
<i>I did not think she would be so obnoxious.</i>

511
00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:26,139
<i>I know. I know.</i>

512
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:35,139
According to a report,

513
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:37,039
they're hiding in this alley.

514
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:39,689
They apparently meet up

515
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:41,399
at this place often.

516
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:44,689
They do not even hide. How proud.

517
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:46,709
As if they have multiple lives.

518
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:49,879
They seem incredibly gutsy.

519
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:53,529
I wonder if someone is helping them.

520
00:40:55,549 --> 00:41:00,649
We can finally catch the Heuksa Clan, right?

521
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:23,699
What?

522
00:41:26,749 --> 00:41:28,619
It is not that, My Lady.

523
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,229
I did not want to believe the rumor,

524
00:41:30,229 --> 00:41:33,329
but you really are devious.

525
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:35,099
If I scold you,

526
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:39,559
people would say I bully you for no reason.

527
00:41:41,979 --> 00:41:44,219
That is not true. You are mistaken.

528
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:46,659
Mistaken? I am glad you said that.

529
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:51,329
Let us resolve the misunderstanding now.

530
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:53,509
- Pardon?
- I heard you and your father

531
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:55,219
have an inappropriate relationship.

532
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:57,889
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

533
00:41:57,889 --> 00:41:59,399
I heard you frequent his bedroom

534
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:01,979
and serve him by his bed.

535
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:04,899
<i>You cannot mess with her family.</i>

536
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:07,709
<i>She really is crazy.</i>

537
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:10,819
I do not mind you disgracing me,

538
00:42:11,939 --> 00:42:14,359
but please do not disgrace my father.

539
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:16,359
My father saved and raised me

540
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:18,999
when I had nowhere to go.

541
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:21,029
I did not say anything.

542
00:42:21,029 --> 00:42:22,749
I know.

543
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:28,729
I am just curious if Cho Byeong Mo
is your father or husband.

544
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:30,769
<i>No, hold back.</i>

545

547
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:35,069
<i>Stay put, I said.</i>

548
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:37,129
Are you in pain?

549
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:41,179
Stop!

550
00:43:44,379 --> 00:43:47,269
I will not go easy on you because
you are Prince Gyeongseong.

551
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:46,349
Who are you working for?

552
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:01,549
Stop, stop...

553
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,539
Stop, stop...

554
00:45:04,389 --> 00:45:07,949
Stop! Spare me! Spare me...

555
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:14,299
If you spare me,

556
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:16,889
I can make you the king.

557
00:45:16,889 --> 00:45:21,369
You don't want to be the royal
family's hunting dog forever.

558
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:23,969
I am not interested in the throne.

559
00:45:58,579 --> 00:46:01,309
Aigoo, here you go.

560
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:23,065
There is something I want to say.

561
00:46:23,065 --> 00:46:25,485
What do you want to say?

562
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:28,445
So, what I want to say is...

563
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:38,745
The full moon is so beautiful tonight.

564
00:46:38,745 --> 00:46:41,835
How about we all drink together?

565
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,575
Drink together?

566
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:46,775
Yes.

567
00:46:46,775 --> 00:46:49,655
But I do not mean tea.

568
00:46:49,655 --> 00:46:51,415
I mean alcohol.

569
00:46:51,415 --> 00:46:52,515
All of a sudden?

570
00:46:52,515 --> 00:46:55,625
Let us be honest. Why drink tea at night?

571
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:57,385
It will keep us up at night.

572
00:46:57,385 --> 00:47:01,175
Sir Cho Byeong Mo's daughter is a bit unhip...

573
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:06,495
I mean, she is a bit clueless.

574
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,075
Alcohol is appropriate at night.

575
00:47:09,075 --> 00:47:11,585
You need to drink when the full moon is up.

576
00:47:11,585 --> 00:47:14,495
Would that not be romantic?

577
00:47:17,155 --> 00:47:19,145
Instead of meeting at a teahouse,

578
00:47:19,145 --> 00:47:22,725
should we not meet at
a tavern on a night like this?

579
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:31,435
I noticed it at the garment shop, but you are...

580
00:47:34,965 --> 00:47:37,155
very much in sync with me.

581
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:39,075
Right?

582
00:47:42,065 --> 00:47:44,165
Let us drink.

583
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:49,555
Let us.

584
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,155
I hear Cho Byeong Mo is

585
00:47:53,155 --> 00:47:56,215

586
00:47:56,215 --> 00:47:59,415
Bring us the best kind.

587
00:48:01,435 --> 00:48:02,905
Yes.

588

590
00:48:43,145 --> 00:48:45,425
Here they are, My Lady.

591
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:47,315
If so,

592
00:48:48,615 --> 00:48:52,165
it is your turn to pour me a drink.

593
00:49:05,315 --> 00:49:06,455
What are you doing?

594
00:49:06,455 --> 00:49:10,315
I wanted you to try something new.

595
00:49:10,315 --> 00:49:12,385
Something new?

596
00:49:13,535 --> 00:49:16,515
Okay, let us see.

597
00:49:16,515 --> 00:49:18,965
They don't have beer here.

598
00:49:18,965 --> 00:49:21,625
What are you mumbling to yourself?

599
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,215
It is nothing.

600
00:49:23,215 --> 00:49:28,385
Everyone, have you heard of a cocktail?

601
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:30,725
<i>Cocktail?</i>

602
00:49:53,415 --> 00:49:56,505
This is Bokgeolju.

603
00:49:56,505 --> 00:50:00,085
I mixed bokbunja and makgeolli.

604
00:50:01,115 --> 00:50:05,335
I've never made a cocktail using bokbunja wine.

605
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:14,055
My gosh. It's tangy but smooth.

606
00:50:14,055 --> 00:50:17,285
I have never tasted anything like it.

607
00:50:18,345 --> 00:50:22,445
She is the Chief State Minister's
daughter. She cannot tell a lie.

608
00:50:24,805 --> 00:50:29,135
Here. This is the full moon drink.

609
00:50:29,135 --> 00:50:32,945
I made it just for Lady Hwa Seon.

611
00:50:34,715 --> 00:50:36,615
Drink the full moon inside of it.
