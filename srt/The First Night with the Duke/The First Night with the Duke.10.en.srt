00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,810
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,510
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:15,030
I do not want you to incur any more grievances.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,970
What does that mean?

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,000
It means I don't want you to kill people.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,490
By chance,

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,850
do you believe what Prince Seonghyeon said?

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,210
Correct me if I'm wrong.

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,090
Do you not trust me?

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,090
If I killed him,

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,950
will you call me a murderer

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,580
and run away again?

13
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,430
You know that's not what I meant.

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,020
I said to avoid him because
he is dangerous. Is that so hard?

15
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,890
Stay away from Prince Seonghyeon.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,260
This is an order.

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,140
I wish you didn't hide things from me.

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,200
Do you still think I killed that man?

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,550
- It's not that.
- Fine. This is great.

20
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,890
I might as well kill everyone in the market.

21
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,650
How much longer will you have blood on your hands?

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,550
<i>He must be possessed by a murderous spirit.</i>

23
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,990
<i>He's way too young.</i>

24
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,450
<i>How could he do that as a human?</i>

25
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,830
<i>He is not a human.</i>

26
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,580
<i>He is a dog. A hunting dog.</i>

27
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,900
<i>Whoever is near Prince Gyeongseong</i>

28
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,720
<i>will die.</i>

29
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,540
This might be your opportunity
to stop being called

30
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,380
a hunting dog or a murderous spirit.

31
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,050
I do not need such an opportunity.

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,230
This is not what I saw when I read your mind.

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,110
I know you're lonelier and tormented than anyone.

34
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,550
But why do you let people misunderstand you?

35
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,220
You said you know everything about me,

36
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,370
but you do not understand me at all.

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,780
I had better leave for the night.

38
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,440
[Episode 10: Destiny strikes again]

39
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,160
I took care of it as you ordered.

40
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,620
You are back to being the
old Prince Gyeongseong again.

41
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,830
My Lord!

42
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,050
It is cold. Why are you outside?

43
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,760
Because I do not feel at ease.

44
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,790
You must have argued with Lady Cha.

45
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,560
I know just by looking at your face, My Lord.

46
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,840
Do not worry.

47
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,630
A lovers' quarrel does not last.

48
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,540
Even a fight like that is a luxury to me.

49
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,460
Why would you say that?

50
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,640
Just like the rumors say,

51
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,100
I wonder if everyone near me...

52
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,700
ends up miserable.

53
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,430
Gosh, that is not true.

54
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,070
I am here to prove that wrong.

55
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:07,180
You do not know how happy
I am to serve you, My Lord.

56
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,450
<i>Make sure the body is...</i>

57
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,250
<i>discovered at the downstream.</i>

58
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,780
Don't look at me so scary.

59
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,330
What do you want from me?

60
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,100
I do not want anything from you.

61
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,710
Just stay the same as before.

62
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,690
Stay as Cha Sun Chaek's
trusty friend as you are now.

63
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,450
So, she listens to you and relies on you.

64
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,940
I will decide what you will tell her.

65
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,370
By the way,

66
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,980
what would you gain by doing this?

67
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,680
You will find out soon.

68
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,280
It will not be fun...

69
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,520
to spoil it in advance.

70
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,230
Was I too harsh?

71
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,380
Prince Gyeongseong seemed very hurt.

72
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,440
I don't know.

73
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,400
Where did things go wrong?

74
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,650
<i>You said you know everything about me,</i>

75
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,550
<i>but you do not understand me at all.</i>

76
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:12,840
<i>I already know how difficult of a past you had.</i>

77
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,430
<i>So, I just wanted to help you move on from it.</i>

78
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,710
<i>My Lady!</i>

79
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,320
<i>Lady Eun Ae is here.</i>

80
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,100
Yes, let her in.

81
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,180
My Lady, you were up.

82
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,330
What brings you here so early?

83
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,580
I wanted to help you prepare for the wedding.

84
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,150
Is something going on, My Lady?

85
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,400
The bride should be at her peak now.
But you do not look so well.

86
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,890
It is nothing.

87
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,400
I hope it is not because of the rumor.

88
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,730
Rumor?

89
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,680
The thing is...

90
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,260
Prince Gyeongseong apparently
killed a prime minister

91
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,500
- who is in exile.
- Pardon?

92
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,300
He was respected since
the former king was in power.

93
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,570
That must be why there is a lot of talk.

94
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,890
They say the bloodshed started again

95
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,060
and the hunting dog cannot help himself.

96
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,290
Although Prince Gyeongseong
must have followed the King's order.

97
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,290
It is just a rumor.

98
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,110
It hasn't been confirmed, either.

99
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,590
R-Right.

100
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,790
I should not have told you.

101
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,750
Do not worry.

102
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,250
How long am I supposed to do this?

103
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,110
Start the silence training all over again.

104
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,100
A-Again? Says who?

105
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,780
Do you think you could...

106
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,320
scare me staring like that?

107
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,060
You still have a long way to go.

108
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,460
Reflect on your sins through silence.

109
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,560
Why would he hit me? Seriously.

110
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,640
<i>Monk, please come out for a moment.</i>

111
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,120
I did not commit a sin.

112
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,210
Not this time.

113
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,710
Right.

114
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,300
To prove my innocence,

115
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,690
I will have to find the culprit
instead of meditating.

116
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,410
Yes, I am the embodiment of revenge.

117
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,450
No, revenge equals Do Hwa Seon.

118
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,710
Away! Go away!

119
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,730
Stop blocking the path and move.

120
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,910
Hold on.

121
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,060
I said move.

122
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,890
Seriously. Hold on a moment, I said-

123
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,260
I thought you were a beggar.

124
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,580
But it was you.

125
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,560
What? A beggar?

126
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,190
There is the Right State Minister.

127
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,380
Should I call him for you?

128
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,480
You be quiet.

129
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,100
Do not touch me with your dirty hand.

130
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,900
What? Dirty?

131
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,570
You are finally showing your true color.

132
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,380
Take a good look at yourself instead.

133
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,340
What? Seriously.

134
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,890
My gosh.

135
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,350
Look who is here.

136
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,150
What a miserable sight.

137
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,200
What were you talking about here?

138
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,220
Lady Hwa Seon must still find me to be an eyesore.

139
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,500
What did you just say?

140
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,860
Try running that big mouth again.

141
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,250
Gosh, she is so crude.

142
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,230
I cannot deal with you.

143
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,710
Are you crazy?

144
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,200
Do not fight because of me.

145
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,410
The Dahong Club meeting
preparation is almost ready.

146
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,790
I will let you know soon.

147
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,700
D-Dahong Club? Without me?

148
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,010
At your teahouse?

149
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,530
Lady Eun Ae will lead the club from now on.

150
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,500
Excuse us, then.

151
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,210
- Excuse us.
- Let us go, My Lady.

152
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,340
You are radiant today, Lady Eun Ae.

153
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,430
You are too kind.

154
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,430
Seriously!

155
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,270
So, you are treating me like a culprit, too?

156
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,770
Just wait and see.

157
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,350
I will catch the culprit.

158
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,190
Gosh, My Lord.

159
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,710
Were you waiting for me?

160
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,500
I need to talk to you urgently.

161
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,910
People can see us. You cannot do this.

162
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,010
What if people get the wrong idea?

163
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,490
I am the one...

164
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,590
who wants to resolve a misunderstanding.

165
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,520
What is this?

166
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:21,550
[Come to Cheonggyecheon,
where we first met. I will be waiting.]

167
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,660
Please explain properly

168
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,940
so I can understand.

169
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,670
[Come to Cheonggyecheon,
where we first met. I will be waiting.]

170
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,220
You are not mistaken.

171
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,530
What you are thinking is correct.

172
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,730
My Lady, what do you mean-

173
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,140
I lured Lady Cha with a fake letter

174
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,190
and had her kidnapped at Cheonggyecheon.

175
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,640
Are you satisfied to hear what you wanted to hear?

176
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,870
How...

177
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,150
How could you do something so evil?

178
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,310
Your innocent face makes me

179
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,170
feel like such a terrible person.

180
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,840
Why did you do that?

181
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,660
Tell me the reason, at least.

182
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,450
You would never understand.

183
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:31,350
The ones who were born with
everything could never understand why.

184
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:41,040
No reason in the world can justify hurting people.

185
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,780
Please...

186
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,580
confess now.

187
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,630
I have no interest in doing so.

188
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,540
If you keep acting like this,

189
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,140
I have no choice but to tell Prince Gyeongseong.

190
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,380
What a touching friendship.

191
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,230
Yes, do that.

192
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,450
But I am not sure if you know this, by the way.

193
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,650
Your father is a member of the Heuksa Clan that

194
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,990
Prince Gyeongseong has been fighting for decades.

195
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,800
How ludicrous!

196
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,540
It is not ludicrous. It is the truth.

197
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:38,490
If you are curious, ask the Chief Secretary
yourself and confirm.

198
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,600
Culprits always return to the crime scene.

199
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,980
Are you the culprit, then?

200
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,830
Now that I think about it,
the culprit is already dead.

201
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,620
Why are you telling me that now?

202
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,250
Because we just met.

203
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,340
Our fates brought us here. It was nice to meet you.

204
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,750
If I put myself in the culprit's shoes,
I thought I might think of a clue.

205
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,450
Crazy bastard. Seriously.

206
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,820
She asked for help with this?

207
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,650
Cha Sun Chaek sure is lucky.

208
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,750
Are you following me around by chance?

209
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,060
I think it is the opposite.

210
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,250
Stop following me.

211
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,460
The first one was a miss

212
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,120
and the second one was accurate.

213
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,260
A silver dagger*...
(Used by women for self-defense)

214
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,450
and a medium sword inflicted two wounds.

215
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,780
The silver dagger missed...

216
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,220
and the sword stabbed the vital spot exactly.

217
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,930
Did the woman...

218
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,680
have an accomplice?

219
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,030
My Lord.

220
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,170
What is going on?

221
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,160
His Majesty is looking for you urgently.

222
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,920
His Majesty?

223
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,010
Did you wait long?

224
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,760
No, Your Majesty.

225
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,450
I was waiting...

226
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,260
for you to confess your sin...

227
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,410
and repent.

228
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,530
- What do you mean-
- Prince Gyeongseong,

229
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,110
you promised to be loyal to me.

230
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,980
Do you remember?

231
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,350
Are you truthful with me?

232
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,240
Are you sure you are not hiding anything from me?

233
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,610
Were you going to fake his death

234
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,170
and hide him away?

235
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,220
That is not the case at all.

236
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,620
I just wanted to delay it.

237
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,650
Why did you want to delay it?

238
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,490
I asked him to wait until...

239
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,220
my daughter's wedding.

240
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,760
Shut your mouth.

241
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,740
How dare a sinner talk to His Majesty?

242
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,640
Did he affect you enough to go against my order?

243
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:28,180
Today, I killed you with my sword.

244
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,860
Have you softened up or...

245
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,190
did you have a change of heart?

246
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,400
Your Majesty,

247
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,190
what Prince Gyeongseong attempted
is tantamount to treason.

248
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,000
I agree.

249
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,740
Unless he sided with the minister,

250
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,280
how could he go against your order

251
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,130
and make a false report?

252
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,300
For going against your order,

253
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,900
please punish him harshly.

254
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,270
<i>Punish him harshly.</i>

255
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,910
Your Majesty,

256
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:12,110
he has been in exile as punishment for a long time.

257
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,170
Revisiting the past and blaming
him for his old crime

258
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,000
would not be approved by the people.

259
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,390
Even the Book of Law says one should
not be punished for sins from the past.

260
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,380
Displaying your generosity

261
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,720
would be a good way to set an example and be a good lesson.

262
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,270
Please listen to my plea.

263
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,420
Sins from the past?

264
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,840
Yes.

265
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,100
The Chief State Minister makes a good point.

266
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,240
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

267
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,560
I will be generous and...

268
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,210
give Prince Gyeongseong one more chance.

269
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,990
Kill this man in front of me now.

270
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,760
Then, I will let go of your past error.

271
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,440
Your Majesty.

272
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,630
Are you refusing or incapable?

273
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,830
Thank you.

274
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,160
I heard the wedding went well, thanks to you.

275
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,090
I am all right.

276
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,910
Kill me.

277
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,280
What are you doing? Kill him now!

278
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,230
<i>Don't kill.</i>

279
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:38,460
<i>I do not want you to incur any more grievances.</i>

280
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,020
Please kill me, Your Majesty!

281
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,480
Prince Seonghyeon.

282
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,100
I crossed the line, Your Majesty.

283
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,660
But I could not just sit and watch.

284
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,410
It is okay. It is okay.

285
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,850
I feel relieved, as if an enormous
burden has been lifted.

286
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,980
Prince Gyeongseong will be
stripped from his position now.

287
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,410
Wait for my disciplinary action for the dismissal.

288
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,290
Why did you do that?

289
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,960
That was so out of character for you.

290
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,440
It was your doing.

291
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,230
Why are you doing this?

292
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,680
Not only you disobeyed the King's order,

293
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,680
you dared to make a false report to him!

294
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,730
Is this how you show your claws?

295
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,990
What is it that you want?

296
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,460
That's why...

297
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,780
you should have done your job properly.

298
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,700
This would not have happened, then.

299
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,120
[The Obsessive Tyrant]

300
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,320
Pardon?

301
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,140
Prince Gyeongseong was stripped of his position?

302
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:10,340
He did not kill the man
His Majesty ordered him to kill

303
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,630
and made a false report.

304
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,150
Because the man had pleaded
with him for his daughter

305
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,400
who was about to wed.

306
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,850
<i>You said you know everything about me,</i>

307
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,920
<i>but you do not understand me at all.</i>

308
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,240
<i>Do you not trust me?</i>

309
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,620
What brings you to my room at this hour?

310
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,420
Cut your ties with Prince Gyeongseong.

311
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,140
What...

312
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,770
do you mean by that?

313
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,320
You will die if you stay by his side.

314
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,480
Father.

315
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,680
Have you sided with Prince Seonghyeon?

316
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,260
Is Prince Seonghyeon...

317
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,110
behind the Heuksa Clan?

318
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,880
- How did you know?
- Answer my question.

319
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,900
I thought you were completely oblivious.

320
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,850
I am impressed.

321
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,430
The owner of the Palace will change

322
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,110
and the new world will begin soon.

323
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,310
Does Prince Gyeongseong need
to be gone to achieve that?

324
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:02,280
The puppet king has been able to stay in power

325
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,690
all because of Prince Gyeongseong.

326
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,370
He needs to be eliminated first.

327
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,620
You have a duty.

328
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,360
Submit a petition and request
the execution of Prince Gyeongseong.

329
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,250
You must know well how important my mission is.

330
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:29,270
So, risk your life for it, too.

331
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,020
Prince Gyeongseong seems to be a dying flame.

332
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:58,330
I no longer know which rope to hold onto.

333
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,600
What do you think?

334
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,160
Father,

335
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,400
I gained a new card.

336
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,160
Are you all right?

337
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,040
I heard about what happened.

338
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,840
As you were concerned,

339
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,260
I ended up falling out of His Majesty's favor.

340
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,100
You had better not come here for a while.

341
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,160
Being friendly with me...

342
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,610
will not help you at all.

343
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,210
There is something I need to tell you.

344
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,540
You are not even shocked...

345
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,410
as if you were expecting me.

346
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,830
I see Sir Su Gyeom already tattled on me.

347
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,800
You killed, but you have no remorse.

348
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,390
Who is your accomplice?

349
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,160
I did it alone.

350
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:31,180
I found a trace of an accomplice
in the kidnapper's body.

351
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,630
Tell me the truth.

352
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,910
How long did you think you could deceive?

353
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,970
You would not feel wronged
even if you died like this.

354
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,520
Sure. Go ahead and kill me.

355
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,820
If you want to commit another
murder despite Lady Cha's wish.

356
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,330
I guess you actually love Lady Cha.

357
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,330
But a person's true color never changes.

358
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:17,140
You must know that better than anyone, My Lord.

359
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,160
If you do not reveal your accomplice,

360
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,470
I will send you to the Royal
Investigation Bureau. Decide wisely.

361
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:40,670
The store you built with
your father might be in danger.

362
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,530
She is Lady Cha's close friend.

363
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,200
What will you tell Lady Cha?

364
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,200
Watch her carefully.

365
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,830
Cho Eun Ae...

366
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,390
got caught by Prince Gyeongseong?

367
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,800
Murderous spirit.

368
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,900
Evil murderer!

369
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,840
You killed my husband, didn't you?

370
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,660
How many people have you killed?

371
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,410
No!

372
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,200
Stop throwing it!

373
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,240
Move!

374
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,280
Bring my husband back!

375
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,180
Bring my husband back!

376
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,640
Bring him back to life!

377
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,830
What you did today could have put you in danger.

378
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,320
You always live in danger.

379
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,520
I'm sorry for misjudging you.

380
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,750
I was all talk.

381
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,100
I guess I didn't understand you with my heart.

382
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:56,540
You are the first person who stepped in for me,

383
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,360
Cha Sun Chaek.

384
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,430
I can continue to do anything for you.

385
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,590
I'm so sorry for hurting you.

386
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,610
I am...

387
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,720
also sorry.

388
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,170
All of this is because of my shameful past

389
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,800
I want to put behind.

390
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,870
I have a terrible past

391
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:33,480
that could make you want to leave if you found out.

392
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,220
When His Majesty rose to the throne,

393
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,130
Prince Seonghyeon's parents,

394
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:46,970
my uncle and aunt were killed.

395
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,060
I was there then.

396
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,700
But...

397
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,650
to protect my family,

398
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,960
I sided with His Majesty.

399
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,700
I would've done the same.

400
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:07,490
I understand why Prince Seonghyeon hates me.

401
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:12,560
Because I do, I can sense
how dangerous his hatred is.

402
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,360
I have been afraid of his pent-up
anger from the past dozen years

403
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,440
and I lost my mind when I saw you with him.

404
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,440
I did not want his resentment
toward me to hurt you.

405
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,360
Don't say things like that.

406
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,440
Just because...

407
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,040
I asked you not to kill anyone,

408
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,560
you tried to change.

409
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,830
You want to leave your dark past
behind more than anyone.

410
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,170
I know that.

411
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,060
For you to be able to do that

412
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,910
and have nothing but happiness ahead,

413
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,990
I will help you.

414
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,320
I will make sure of it.

415
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:41,410
Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.

416
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:45,480
<i>Please execute him immediately.</i>

417
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,260
Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.

418
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,230
<i>Please execute him immediately.</i>

419
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:03,970
Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.

420
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,230
<i>Please execute him immediately.</i>

421
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,160
I am not happy about it,

422
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,310
but the only person His Majesty listens to now

423
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,890
seems to be Prince Seonghyeon.

424
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,600
It is you, Sun Chaek.

425
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,240
It is cold. Come inside.

426
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,860
No.

427
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,440
I'll talk to you here.

428
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,530
All right.

429
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,390
What is it?

430
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,850
Please help Prince Gyeongseong.

431
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,260
Help Prince Gyeongseong?

432
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,370
How could I when he went against the King's order?

433
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:51,480
I know that you hold a grudge against

434
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,920
Prince Gyeongseong from the past.

435
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,930
But you are still asking me that?

436
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,270
Please let Prince Gyeongseong live.

437
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,530
I beg you.

438
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,660
I see you truly love him.

439
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,200
I am sorry, but I do not have the power.

440
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,130
If you let him live, I will do anything.

441
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:38,440
What are you planning to do
with Prince Gyeongseong?

442
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,290
<i>Please execute him immediately!</i>

443
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,560
<i>- Your Majesty!</i>
- What do you think?

444
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,490
- I actually have a brilliant idea.
<i>- Please execute him immediately!</i>

445
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,700
Brilliant idea?

446
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:57,310
China is having trouble
with barbarians at the border.

447
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,700
Send Prince Gyeongseong there
to suppress the barbarians

448
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,560
and let him bring the Emperor's edict.

449
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,730
Are you saying send
Prince Gyeongseong to the border?

450
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,040
That is correct.

451
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,150
If we solve China's headache,

452
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,790
I am sure we can get the Emperor's attention.

453
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:25,390
We struggled for a long time
to eradicate those barbarians,

454
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,880
but I heard none of the generals
made it back alive.

455
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,380
I am sure Prince Gyeongseong
will easily defeat the barbarians

456
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,170
and bring back the edict as well.

457
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:40,870
Not only would it allow
Prince Gyeongseong to repent,

458
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,250
it is a great chance to...

459
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,550
bring honor to the country.

460
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,120
Summon Prince Gyeongseong.

461
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

462
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:13,420
<i>Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.</i>

463
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,940
<i>Please execute him immediately.</i>

464
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:25,680
<i>Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.</i>

465
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,090
<i>Please execute him immediately.</i>

466
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,890
<i>What is it regarding?</i>

467
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,980
I learned that...

468
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,980
my father is a member of the Heuksa Clan.

469
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,720
I might...

470
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,930
feel too ashamed to face you again.

471
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,440
Beon...

472
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,600
please forgive me.

473
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,080
This is no one's fault.

474
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,130
No matter what happens,

475
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,430
I will not blame you.

476
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:47,136
When I consider what happened yesterday,

477
00:43:47,136 --> 00:43:50,366
punishing you by death will not be enough.

478
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:52,226
But considering our bond,

479
00:43:52,226 --> 00:43:55,926
I want to give you a last chance
to redeem yourself.

480
00:43:57,706 --> 00:44:00,316
Go to the border.

481
00:44:00,316 --> 00:44:04,626
Kill the barbarian general
who is giving China trouble

482
00:44:04,626 --> 00:44:07,206
and achieve great success.

483
00:44:07,206 --> 00:44:10,946
Leave before sunrise tomorrow.

484
00:44:13,896 --> 00:44:16,136
I will follow your order.

485
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:19,606
Your Majesty,

486
00:44:19,606 --> 00:44:23,626
lastly, there is something I need to tell you.

487
00:44:25,206 --> 00:44:27,116
Please...

488
00:44:28,236 --> 00:44:30,426
beware of Prince Seonghyeon.

489
00:44:35,566 --> 00:44:38,176
I trusted you, but you betrayed me.

490
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:42,586
Prince Seonghyeon demonstrated
his loyalty toward me in action.

491
00:44:43,726 --> 00:44:45,826
I hope you do the same.

492
00:44:53,586 --> 00:44:56,206
Be healthy and well, Your Majesty.

493
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:16,796
Prince Gyeongseong.

494
00:45:31,756 --> 00:45:37,726
They immediately started appealing
as if they had prepared already.

495
00:45:37,726 --> 00:45:42,166
I am sorry I cannot help you much.

496
00:45:43,526 --> 00:45:45,226
Do not worry.

497
00:45:45,226 --> 00:45:46,716
Brother-in-law!

498
00:45:46,716 --> 00:45:48,016
Brother-in-law,

499
00:45:48,016 --> 00:45:50,646
I thought I would never see you again.

500
00:45:52,506 --> 00:45:55,996
How about you rest at our house

501
00:45:55,996 --> 00:45:58,636
for a few days to rejuvenate?

502
00:45:58,636 --> 00:46:00,436
Yes, Prince Gyeongseong.

503
00:46:00,436 --> 00:46:02,126
Don't be alone.

504
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,566
I am afraid I cannot.

505
00:46:05,566 --> 00:46:06,886
Pardon?

506
00:46:07,956 --> 00:46:12,286
I am being sent to the border
for a battle tomorrow.

507
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:15,186
A battle?

508
00:46:20,376 --> 00:46:22,816
I need to prepare for the battle now.

509
00:46:22,816 --> 00:46:23,956
No!

510
00:46:23,956 --> 00:46:25,446
- Brother-in-law.
- No...

511
00:46:25,446 --> 00:46:27,586
No, Brother-in-law.

512
00:46:28,506 --> 00:46:30,846
No...

513
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:02,056
Why did you make such a suggestion?

514
00:47:02,056 --> 00:47:05,056
It was a great chance to eliminate him immediately.

515
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:07,836
Do you think the hit list incident...

516
00:47:07,836 --> 00:47:11,296
could have eliminated Prince Gyeongseong?

517
00:47:12,726 --> 00:47:15,856
This is definitely the right way to handle him.

518
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,616
Do not worry.

519
00:47:22,226 --> 00:47:24,826
The path Prince Gyeongseong is on

520
00:47:26,296 --> 00:47:29,216
will not bring him back alive.

521
00:48:13,256 --> 00:48:15,126
<i>Prince Gyeongseong!</i>

522
00:48:23,956 --> 00:48:26,126
If you leave me behind,

523
00:48:26,126 --> 00:48:29,646
you won't go 10 ri without getting sore feet.

524
00:49:28,316 --> 00:49:32,006
It is so hard to marry you.

525
00:49:32,006 --> 00:49:35,376
We should've done this from the get-go, right?

526
00:49:40,156 --> 00:49:43,446
I might not be able to return.

527
00:49:43,446 --> 00:49:45,846
Don't say stuff like that.

528
00:49:45,846 --> 00:49:49,576
What happened to the obsessive tyrant I know?

529
00:49:51,506 --> 00:49:54,556
Like how you pursued me relentlessly,

530
00:49:54,556 --> 00:49:57,096
come back to me.

531
00:50:02,746 --> 00:50:04,336
I ended up...

532
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:08,046
becoming a source of trouble for you.

533
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,146
What do you mean, trouble?

534
00:50:10,856 --> 00:50:14,346
We are one from now on.

535
00:50:15,676 --> 00:50:17,686
Just like this ring.

536
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:30,056
Put it on me, too.

537
00:50:31,056 --> 00:50:34,936
We need to become a married
couple before the sun rises.

538
00:50:47,366 --> 00:50:49,136
How pretty.

539
00:50:51,486 --> 00:50:56,086
This makes us a married couple.

540
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,846
Bang, bang, bang.

541
00:51:02,406 --> 00:51:04,626
I cannot believe it.

542
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:07,426
It feels like a dream.

543
00:51:07,426 --> 00:51:09,966
Should I make it feel real for you?

544
00:51:12,026 --> 00:51:13,946
I, Cha Sun Chaek,

545
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:18,976
promise undying love
to Prince Gyeongseong, Yi Beon.

546
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:32,586
Let me hear from the groom, too.

547
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:41,146
My time, that was passing by meaninglessly,

548
00:51:42,726 --> 00:51:45,706
you are the only one who gave it meaning.

549
00:51:47,626 --> 00:51:49,136
The first and...

550
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:52,696
the last woman of Yi Beon's life is...

551
00:51:53,846 --> 00:51:55,536
Cha Sun Chaek.

552
00:51:56,676 --> 00:51:58,346
Only you.

553
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:05,466
<i>♫ Even under the moonlight ♫</i>

554
00:52:05,466 --> 00:52:10,756
<i>♫ You are all I can see ♫</i>

555
00:52:12,506 --> 00:52:16,026
<i>♫ I look at no one but you ♫</i>

556
00:52:16,026 --> 00:52:19,496
<i>♫ I love no one but you ♫</i>

557
00:52:19,496 --> 00:52:25,736
<i>♫ I am by your side every day ♫</i>

558
00:52:25,736 --> 00:52:33,326
<i>♫ Your smile is as warm as sunlight ♫</i>

559
00:52:33,326 --> 00:52:43,366
<i>♫ I fill my every day with you ♫</i>

560
00:53:13,126 --> 00:53:15,226
Prince Gyeongseong.

561
00:53:17,186 --> 00:53:18,686
My Lord.

562
00:53:18,686 --> 00:53:19,686
Yes...

563
00:53:21,506 --> 00:53:23,656
Return safely.

564
00:53:29,886 --> 00:53:33,416
Have a safe trip. Come back soon.

565
00:53:37,726 --> 00:53:40,016
I'll be right here!

566
00:53:40,706 --> 00:53:43,096
Bye!

567
00:53:45,316 --> 00:53:47,256
Do not worry so much.

568
00:53:47,256 --> 00:53:49,636
He will return safely.

569
00:53:54,346 --> 00:53:55,686
My Lady.

570
00:53:56,356 --> 00:53:58,826
Prince Gyeongseong is...

571
00:54:17,726 --> 00:54:20,036
[I will never leave you.
Be careful, Prince Gyeongseong.]

572
00:54:22,596 --> 00:54:24,516
I knew you would be like this.

573
00:54:36,966 --> 00:54:39,276
Do not cry because I am gone.

574
00:54:49,836 --> 00:54:51,506
Right.

575
00:54:56,396 --> 00:54:59,326
I will always be with you.

576
00:55:00,886 --> 00:55:02,816
Come back soon.

577
00:55:07,826 --> 00:55:09,556
I will be back.

578
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:24,396
Don't cry, My Lady.

579
00:55:30,046 --> 00:55:32,086
My Lady.

580
00:55:32,856 --> 00:55:35,026
Don't cry...

581
00:56:07,396 --> 00:56:09,736
I shouldn't be sitting here like this.

582
00:56:09,736 --> 00:56:11,406
Bang Wool.

583
00:56:11,406 --> 00:56:13,226
Yes, My Lady.

584
00:56:18,836 --> 00:56:20,846
Could you help me pack?

585
00:56:20,846 --> 00:56:23,516
Pack? What for?

586
00:56:26,146 --> 00:56:27,856
I will move into Hoseondang.

587
00:56:27,856 --> 00:56:30,516
You are suddenly moving into Hoseondang?

588
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:32,686
Actually...

589
00:56:32,686 --> 00:56:36,366
Prince Gyeongseong and I had a wedding last night.

590
00:56:37,086 --> 00:56:38,126
Pardon?

591
00:56:38,816 --> 00:56:41,956
Pardon? Why all of a sudden...

592
00:56:41,956 --> 00:56:43,876
It just happened so.

593
00:56:43,876 --> 00:56:46,046
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you, Bang Wool.

594
00:56:46,046 --> 00:56:48,256
My Lady.

595
00:56:57,376 --> 00:56:59,326
It is all right.

596
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:02,896
It is too late, but congratulations, My Lady.

597
00:57:02,896 --> 00:57:07,086
I should call you Madam, not Lady now.

598
00:57:08,176 --> 00:57:12,006
<i>Madam? What are you talking about?</i>

599
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:19,986
Mother and Father.

600
00:57:19,986 --> 00:57:23,036
Without your approval,

601
00:57:23,036 --> 00:57:25,856
we had a wedding, just the two of us.

602
00:57:26,886 --> 00:57:28,826
I'm sorry.

603
00:57:29,716 --> 00:57:33,506
I'm now Prince Gyeongseong's wife.

604
00:57:33,506 --> 00:57:36,426
Yes, I'm glad you did.

605
00:57:37,526 --> 00:57:41,026
Goodness. You are so delicate. How could you live alone

606
00:57:41,026 --> 00:57:44,056
in that huge house without a husband?

607
00:57:44,056 --> 00:57:48,596
That's why I should keep the house company.

608
00:57:49,296 --> 00:57:51,006
Don't worry, Father.

609
00:57:51,006 --> 00:57:54,426
No, Sun Chaek. I will come with you.

610
00:57:54,426 --> 00:57:55,936
Do not be like that, Your Excellency.

611
00:57:55,936 --> 00:57:57,176
I will go with her.

612
00:57:57,176 --> 00:57:59,466
You cannot. You cannot go alone.

613
00:57:59,466 --> 00:58:00,966
- Come on.
- Let go.

614
00:58:00,966 --> 00:58:03,116
What are you doing?

615
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:10,086
If you have decided,

616
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:13,396
get ready to move to Hoseondang.

617
00:58:13,396 --> 00:58:15,936
I will bring my belongings. Wait here.

618
00:58:15,936 --> 00:58:17,756
What are you doing, Your Excellency?

619
00:58:17,756 --> 00:58:20,126
I will go with her.

620
00:58:20,126 --> 00:58:21,926
Aigoo, Your Excellency.

621
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:47,636
There.

622
00:58:59,496 --> 00:59:02,866
Your moving cart must be here already.

623
00:59:02,866 --> 00:59:05,496
Let me check. Just one moment.

624
00:59:35,066 --> 00:59:36,806
This is...

625
01:00:36,096 --> 01:00:37,546
<i>It's the enemy!</i>

626
01:00:43,796 --> 01:00:45,436
Shield!

627
01:01:16,596 --> 01:01:21,256
[The First Night with the Duke]

628
01:01:23,686 --> 01:01:30,646
<i>♫ Because you let me smile again ♫</i>

629
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:38,326
<i>♫ Like the moonlight that is
absorbing into you right now ♫</i>

630
01:01:38,326 --> 01:01:45,726
<i>♫ It illuminates your heart ♫</i>

631
01:01:45,726 --> 01:01:48,996
<i>Prince Gyeongseong, even though we are apart,</i>

632
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,886
<i>I can sense you where I am.</i>

633
01:01:51,886 --> 01:01:55,406
<i>Everything ends when you reach the conclusion.</i>

634
01:01:55,406 --> 01:01:57,476
<i>I fear that...</i>

635
01:01:57,476 --> 01:02:01,916
<i>my lover will be sad when learning of my death.</i>

636
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,586
<i>Abdication is also an option.</i>

637
01:02:05,586 --> 01:02:08,266
<i>I will achieve what I'm after,
and I can make you happy.</i>

638
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,616
<i>You just need to accept me!</i>

639
01:02:10,616 --> 01:02:13,366
<i>Does it mean we switched bodies?</i>

640
01:02:13,366 --> 01:02:16,536
<i>Please tell me how to fix this situation.</i>

641
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:21,093
<i>♫ I will always be standing behind you ♫</i>
