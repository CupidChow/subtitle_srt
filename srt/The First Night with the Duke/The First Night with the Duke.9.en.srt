1
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,920
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,620
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,670
She received my letter and went out?

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,530
I looked everywhere,

5
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,210
but she is not at Cheonggyecheon.

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,210
I was away running an errand for Madam.

7
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,760
Where am I?

8
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,370
[Episode 9: The ones who were hurt]

9
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,270
- Your Excellency!
- Aigoo, Aigoo.

10
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,470
Aigoo, Sun Chaek.

11
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,950
Is there no news yet?

12
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,260
No, not yet.

13
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,180
If something happens to Sun Chaek,

14
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,300
I will also leave this world immediately.

15
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,440
Please do not say that.

16
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,310
There is no time for this.

17
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,360
Release all the servants in the house

18
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,830
and you should also look where she might be.

19
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,920
- Yes, Mother.
- Yes, Madam.

20
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,930
Let us go, Du Ho and Se Ho.

21
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,950
Aigoo, Sun Chaek...

22
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,370
I am sure she will return soon.

23
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,730
Gosh, Sun Chaek.

24
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,140
Let us go.

25
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,940
We are looking for the
Chief State Minister's daughter.

26
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,360
This way.

27
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,900
<i>Sun Chaek, where are you?</i>

28
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,730
Have you... Have you seen Sun Chaek?

29
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,500
She is this tall and has a slender face.

30
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,920
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

31
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,780
Make sure to tell us if you see her.

32
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,890
- Sun Chaek!
- Sun Chaek!

33
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,520
Sun Chaek!

34
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,660
- Sun Chaek!
- Sun Chaek!

35
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,310
My Lady! Lady Sun Chaek!

36
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,150
My Lady!

37
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,010
Lady Sun Chaek!

38
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,760
My Lady...

39
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,540
My Lady!

40
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,810
Look everywhere around here!

41
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,350
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

42
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,490
What on earth is going on?

43
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,180
The Chief State Minister's daughter is missing.

44
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,390
Everyone is looking for her.

45
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,760
Did you hear, My Lady?

46
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,720
The Chief State Minister's daughter is missing.

47
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,760
All hell broke loose.

48
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,980
Spare me.

49
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,640
Spare me! Spare me!

50
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,940
There is no use.

51
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,560
No one will hear you and come.

52
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,870
What do you want from me?

53
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,870
Die very painfully.

54
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,130
That is what that person wants.

55
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,540
Damn it.

56
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,860
You crafty thing.

57
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,400
You'd better stop now.

58
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,430
For whose benefit?

59
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,860
You are hastening your death.

60
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,280
My life is already in someone else's hands.

61
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,250
Who ordered you to do this?

62
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,550
Someone very important desperately wants you gone.

63
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,880
No matter who they are,

64
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,170
Prince Gyeongseong will not forgive them.

65
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,250
I'm certain he will find me.

66
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,010
I suppose Prince Gyeongseong could.

67
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,100
But even if he got lucky and found you,

68
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,440
it will be after you're dead.

69
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,030
- Anything yet?
- My apologies.

70
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,160
As you ordered, I released
all the soldiers to look for her.

71
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,840
Did you find the servant
who delivered the fake letter?

72
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,720
I ambushed their residence,

73
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,960
but they had already fled.

74
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,360
If there is no evidence,
we need to find witnesses.

75
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,350
Yes, My Lord.

76
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,370
Hold on!

77
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,390
Okay, I'll die.

78
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,710
I'll die as you wish.

79
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,580
I'm too exhausted to go on as well.

80
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,730
What are you plotting?

81
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,480
I'm not plotting.

82
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,560
I want to end my life beautifully.

83
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,590
I don't want to be killed
gruesomely by a huge hammer.

84
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,890
I'm still the Chief State Minister's only daughter.

85
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,040
I want to have a beautiful death.

86
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,350
If I'll die anyway,

87
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,450
you can do that for me, at least.

88
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,020
So, how do you want to die?

89
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,390
Well,

90
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,580
so...

91
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,280
The way I want to die is...

92
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,890
You thought you could fool me, didn't you?

93
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,140
What is going on?

94
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,070
Maiden Sun Chaek disappeared?

95
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,530
Where did she disappear to?

96
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,290
Prince Gyeongseong sure is powerful.

97
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,650
Wow.

98
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,480
Because your fiancée went missing,

99
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,710
you brought chaos to the capital.

100
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,470
How touching your affection is for her.

101
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,310
Looks like you are about to hit me.

102
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,850
I could do something worse.

103
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,330
You kill other people easily like flies.

104
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,770
But I guess you cherish your fiancée's life.

105
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,170
You should not be doing this now.

106
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,580
I found a witness who reportedly
saw her at Cheonggyecheon.

107
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,680
Where is the witness now?

108
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,860
This way.

109
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,330
Let us go.

110
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,000
I am a ginseng digger.

111
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,650
While I was descending the mountains this way,

112
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,560
I think I saw an unfamiliar palanquin.

113
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,900
An unfamiliar palanquin?

114
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,350
When was that?

115
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,730
It was about an hour ago.

116
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,950
If so, they must be still around there.

117
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,280
You can forget about dying beautifully.

118
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,840
Don't kill him!

119
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,220
My Lady!

120
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,840
Maiden!

121
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,150
- My Lady.
- Maiden.

122
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,290
Are you okay, Maiden?

123
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,950
Are you okay, My Lady?

124
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,980
Oh, no. My Lady...

125
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,140
Please pull yourself together, My Lady.

126
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,590
Bring him to me.

127
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,160
- Yes, sir.
- My Lady.

128
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,220
Cha Sun Chaek.

129
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,330
This is not good.

130
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,770
My Lady.

131
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,870
<i>Could it be...</i>

132
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,420
<i>It cannot be.</i>

133
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,150
Sun Chaek!

134
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,760
Sun Chaek!

135
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,130
This way. This way.

136
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,980
- Gosh, what's happened?
- Sun Chaek!

137
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,760
Oh, my gosh!

138
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,560
Aigoo, Sun Chaek.

139
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,620
Should I bring a physician?

140
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,310
What on earth is going on here?

141
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,460
Her pulses are irregular due to shock,

142
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,800
but she seems to be deeply asleep.

143
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,050
- All right.
- My Sun Chaek.

144
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,260
Looks like she needs rest.

145
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,460
Let us leave now.

146
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,420
Let us leave.

147
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,660
Are you leaving now?

148
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:08,490
- It is getting late. I will-
- Please rest here tonight.

149
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,860
But first,

150
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,490
how about a drink with me?

151
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,870
You seem very uncomfortable.

152
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,600
I am not.

153
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:38,060
I do not think I could sleep tonight
because of all the trauma.

154
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,800
I need to drink first.

155
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,810
This is our family's inherited...

156
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,830
authentic mountain ginseng wine.

157
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:29,880
Thank you for letting Sun Chaek
return to me, My Lord.

158
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,040
Once you have a child, you will learn

159
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,690
how it feels to cherish
someone more than yourself.

160
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,180
If you outdrink me tonight,

161
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,580
I will allow you to marry Sun Chaek.

162
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,610
Do you think you can beat me?

163
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,490
Of course,

164
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,620
I will lose.

165
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,940
I suggested we drink because I wanted to lose.

166
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,810
You are slow to read the air.

167
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,250
Forget the wounds from the past with this wine.

168
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,150
The hurtful words I said to you in the past

169
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:36,150
were said by the father, Cha Ho Yeol,
not the Minister, Cha Ho Yeol.

170
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,370
If you had a daughter like Sun Chaek,

171
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,870
you will soon understand how I feel.

172
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,300
She is in your care from now on.

173
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,240
You kept your promise to...

174
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,140
protect Sun Chaek for me.

175
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,050
Please always protect her like you did today.

176
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,420
I will...

177
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,260
keep that promise even when I am dead.

178
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,830
Then, let us drink...

179
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,270
the real mountain ginseng wine.

180
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,450
Who told you to do this?

181
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,240
Spilling it now would be better for your sake.

182
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,910
<i>It must mean there are that many people
who want you to see your blood.</i>

183
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,630
<i>Did you receive the letter I sent?</i>

184
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,410
<i>I cannot believe that he's being exiled.</i>

185
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,730
<i>I know.</i>

186
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,920
<i>I feel so sorry for him.</i>

187
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,100
<i>He is left alone. All alone.</i>

188
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,680
<i>The remaining ones need to go on.</i>

189
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,510
<i>What can you do...</i>

190
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,790
Cha Sun Chaek!

191
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,520
Prince Gyeongseong...

192
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,310
Cha Sun Chaek!

193
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,930
You're breaking out in cold sweats.

194
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,370
Did you have a nightmare?

195
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,840
Why are you doing this first thing in the morning?

196
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,010
I thought I had lost you again.

197
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:17,020
Because I've been through so much,

198
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,370
I pretty much got used to it.

199
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,800
It is all my fault.

200
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,220
How is it your fault?

201
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,160
I worry my enemies would threaten you

202
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,060
and my misfortune would affect you.

203
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,740
For the first time, I wondered...

204
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,560
if my love for you might be too selfish.

205
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,430
Prince Gyeongseong, why did you get so weak?

206
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,390
Once you love someone,

207
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:56,210
you share happiness and sadness together.

208
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,830
If I could alleviate your misfortune,

209
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,330
it would make me happy.

210
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,460
And if we end up sharing the misfortune,

211
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,570
my good fortune will reach you as well.

212
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,440
Chief State Minister... I mean...

213
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,970
Father-in-law gave us his approval.

214
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,930
Really?

215
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,550
You did it, Prince Gyeongseong.

216
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,440
See? What did I tell you?

217
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,080
Please have faith in your lucky charm,

218
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,570
Cha Sun Chaek, in the future, too.

219
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,200
I thought I lost this.

220
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,700
It reconnected us as the name suggested.

221
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,240
I will never lose it again.

222
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,770
<i>Seeing what I read about in the novel</i>

223
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:33,050
<i>in person made me feel afraid.</i>

224
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,670
<i>Don't kill him!</i>

225
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,970
<i>But...</i>

226
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,720
<i>I don't want Prince Gyeongseong
to kill any more people.</i>

227
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,750
<i>Even if it is to protect me,</i>

228
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,870
<i>it can't happen.</i>

229
00:23:57,463 --> 00:23:59,240
It was chaotic last night.

230
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,230
The Do family did that?

231
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,060
Probably Lady Do Hwa Seon, to be exact.

232
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,110
Yes, who else in the capital would do that?

233
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:12,310
<i>Lady Do loved Prince Gyeongseong.</i>

234
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,180
<i>Yes, she is more than capable.</i>

235
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,670
I think people are talking about me.

236
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,280
I kidnapped Chae Sun Chaek?

237
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,360
They blame me whenever something happens to her.

238
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,840
Did you do it?

239
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,640
F-Father.

240
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,460
I asked if you did it.

241
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,800
No, Father.

242
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,140
Who was it, then?

243
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,940
Why would you ask me that?

244
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,270
It was not me.

245
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,870
Are you deceiving me now?

246
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,020
I am innocent.

247
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,540
It sounded like...

248
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,350
something I could have done, but...

249
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,430
What?

250
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,700
I am just saying that. It really
was not me this time.

251
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,460
You are mistaken.

252
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,570
Stay at a temple for now.

253
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:21,430
- Pardon?
- Be away until things quiet down.

254
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,110
I am saying it was not me.

255
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,010
I can only tolerate you so much.
Do you understand?

256
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,100
He has not spoken a word yet.

257
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,030
They copied my handwriting.
[Come to Cheonggyecheon...]

258
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,250
They are really something.

259
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,540
Who was it?

260
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,220
If you confess, I will let you live.

261
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,080
I promise.

262
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,320
My Lord said he will let you live.

263
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,210
Confess and save your life, you bastard!

264
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,820
If you miss your chance to confess,

265
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,760
you will experience the worst pain possible.

266
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,930
Sir.

267
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,470
Maiden.

268
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,890
Did you come to see me today again?

269
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,740
The capital was in shambles last night.

270
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,250
You mean about Lady Sun Chaek?

271
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,990
Did you hear, too?

272
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,470
Of course.

273
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,180
What on earth is going on?

274
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,200
She is not seriously injured, is she?

275
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,660
I heard about her, and I could not
sleep because I was worried.

276
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,320
Who would do something so evil?

277
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:23,810
Did they catch the culprit?

278
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,040
The culprit...

279
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,050
was caught on scene.

280
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,470
Prince Gyeongseong captured the culprit

281
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,360
and is trying to find out who was behind it.

282
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,540
That is such a relief.

283
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,100
Did they happen to find out who was behind it?

284
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,900
They are suspecting someone,

285
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,040
however, they have not yet
caught the real culprit.

286
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,160
I am sure Prince Gyeongseong...

287
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,740
will find out.

288
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,930
Do you have something to say to me

289
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,240
No, I do not.

290
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,970
I hope I did not interrupt you
while you were busy.

291
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,320
Not at all.

292
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,790
I will put everything on hold at the store today

293
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,140
and visit Lady Sun Chaek with tea and snacks.

294
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,750
Maiden Sun Chaek?

295
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,570
Yes.

296
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,980
I would like to comfort her.

297
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,720
Would you like to come with me?

298
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,350
I will bring snacks for Lady Sun Chaek.

299
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,670
Please wait here for a moment.

300
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,160
I brewed this tea myself.

301
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,480
I will enjoy it.

302
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,880
Take your time preparing.

303
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,020
This is how Maiden Eun Ae is.

304
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,320
What am I imagining?

305
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:30,980
So, this is where Maiden Eun Ae works.

306
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,550
As expected of Maiden Eun Ae, it is subtle, clean,

307
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,740
and understated-

308
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:00,150
Sir, I am ready to go-

309
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,800
[Come to Cheonggyecheon,
where we first met. I will be waiting.]

310
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:19,330
Someone copied my handwriting very well.

311
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,580
They must know me very well.

312
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,010
Who could it be?

313
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,360
This is a special paper...

314
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,950
that was created by dehydration
and mixed with other materials.

315
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,820
People who would do something like this

316
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,200
must be no other than the Heuksa Clan.

317
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,760
This is different than their usual behavior.

318
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,680
I need to find out where
this paper was first distributed.

319
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,450
- What do we do, My Lady...
- I hope she recovers quickly.

320
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,850
- What happened?
- She needs to eat something.

321
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,780
We do not know what would happen.

322
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,430
Her symptoms say she is weak
and has poor blood circulation.

323
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,470
She must rest for now.

324
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,390
She also must take the medicine without fail.

325
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,170
Yes.

326
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,140
Thank you.

327
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,980
Thank you.

328
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,040
I will see him off. You stay here.

329
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:45,340
<i>My Lady, Lady Eun Ae is here.</i>

330
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,880
My Lady.

331
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,000
Lady Eun Ae.

332
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,090
You are okay.

333
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,430
You are not injured, are you?

334
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,360
Can't believe you were kidnapped.

335
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,860
I was so shocked that I could not sleep.

336
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,110
Thank you for worrying.

337
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:13,180
I will do my best to protect you from now on.

338
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,650
I brought you tea that will help you relax.

339
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,870
Brew the tea.

340
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,260
Pardon?

341
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,720
Oh, yes.

342
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,580
My Lady, your wound...

343
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,940
Hold on.

344
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,220
I brought you an ointment for wounds.

345
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,470
Do not fall for me too much.

346
00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:00,780
By the way, what happened to the culprit?

347
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,590
Prince Gyeongseong captured him,

348
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,760
but I don't know what happened afterward.

349
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,740
Maybe someone was behind it.

350
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,820
The rumor already spread in the market.

351
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,010
Someone who could plan such a thing

352
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,100
has to be only one person.

353
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,540
Do you mean Do Hwa Seon?

354
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:26,340
Yes. Make sure she cannot
get away with it this time.

355
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,290
How about you report to the
Royal Investigation Bureau?

356
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,790
I have Prince Gyeongseong, who is scarier
than the Royal Investigation Bureau.

357
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,910
By the way,

358
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,080
you look angrier than I am.

359
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,950
Because I consider your business as mine.

360
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,940
<i>The special paper you mentioned
is manufactured in only one place.</i>

361
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,260
Let me ask you something.

362
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,830
The special paper...

363
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,650
was sent to China as a tribute last year.

364
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,990
Since then, we no longer produce it.

365
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,610
Is that so?

366
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:22,480
It seems many people are
looking for it these days.

367
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,790
Did someone else look for it?

368
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:29,630
People from the biggest merchandise
store in Hanyang came recently.

369
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,180
Do you mean Cho Byeong Mu's Merchandise Store?

370
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,530
Someone who used to work at that store

371
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,830
worked here at the Paper Production Agency.

372
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,540
He had tons of special paper in his room.

373
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,860
Cho's Merchandise Store bought all of it.

374
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,310
Cho's Merchandise Store?

375
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,850
My Lord.

376
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,930
You have been summoned to the Palace immediately.

377
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,480
Thank you.

378
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,660
I have not yet been acknowledged by China.

379
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,510
What do you think the reason is?

380
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,170
I do not know how to say this, but...

381
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,930
It is okay.

382
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,480
Tell me.

383
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,460
Everything in the world is
about trade, Your Majesty.

384
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,350
Trade?

385
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,380
The Emperor is not interested
in this country at all.

386
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,460
You cannot get what you want from
someone who is not interested.

387
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,970
I think a bait that could interest him is needed.

388
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,230
- If you are uncomfortable-
- No.

389
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,650
It's okay.

390
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,890
No one has ever told me anything like this before.

391
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,320
Securing people's support comes first.

392
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,400
<i>Our relationship with China is important,</i>

393
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,600
<i>but securing people's support comes first.</i>

394
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,140
They only said something so obvious.

395
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,410
The people's support is not tangible.

396
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,320
It is easily swept away in the wind.

397
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,240
If a major path is determined,

398
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,910
everyone will end up following it.

399
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,270
It sounds like you have a good solution.

400
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,480
So, did you mention a bait earlier?

401
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,950
If you will allow me to do so,

402
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,810
I will help you set the foundation.

403
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,160
Did you rescue your fiancée successfully?

404
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,830
Why do you glare at me like that?

405
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:46,330
You are acting as if I hurt your fiancée.

406
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,200
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

407
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,940
<i>Prince Gyeongseong is here.</i>

408
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,780
Let him in.

409
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,270
I heard there was a huge ruckus last night.

410
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,580
You summoned all soldiers in the capital?

411
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,120
My apologies, Your Majesty.

412
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,020
Was it related to the Heuksa Clan?

413
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,360
Or...

414
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,410
did you summon the army to find your fiancée?

415
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,860
I do not have any excuses to make.

416
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:43,600
I did give you the right to use the military force,

417
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,930
but you used my soldiers for personal use.

418
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,990
Do you consider yourself the king by chance?

419
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:55,050
That is not the case at all.

420
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,690
The old sayings are never wrong.

421
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,470
They say you cannot see right under your nose.

422
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,560
I did not know a traitor would be right by my side.

423
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,580
My loyalty to Your Majesty remains unchanged.

424
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,290
Please listen to my plea.

425
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,460
I will gladly accept any punishment.

426
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,590
You will gladly accept any punishment?

427
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,860
No matter what it might be?

428
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,500
<i>S-Spare him.</i>

429
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,720
<i>I will do anything you want me to do, Uncle.</i>

430
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,730
<i>No matter what that might be?</i>

431
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,720
<i>Can you swing that sword for me?</i>

432
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,550
This is my hit list.

433
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,710
Your unchanging loyalty.

434
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,390
Go ahead and prove it.

435
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,620
If you leave now, you will arrive
tomorrow morning.

436
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,750
Take care of it now.

437
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,390
I did not say anything.

438
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,310
Do not worry.

439
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,340
I will make sure...

440
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,910
to succeed next time.

441
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,290
You are in bad shape.

442
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,940
Take this.

443
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,890
I...

444
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,040
do not need more money.

445
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:21,440
You have been so generous to a servant like me.

446
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,780
I did it to return the favor.

447
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,020
But still, take it.

448
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,870
You need to run away in order
to plan for the next time.

449
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:44,930
I knew you cared about people like me.

450
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:48,890
People might show up here soon. Run now.

451
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,370
I would be able to see you again, right?

452
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,600
As long as we stay alive,

453
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,620
I am sure we will meet again.

454
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,840
<i>I was able to come this far on my own.</i>

455
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,320
<i>Actually, she is supposedly his daughter,</i>

456
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,050
<i>but she frequents his bedroom, apparently.</i>

457
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,100
<i>Oh, my.</i>

458
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,920
<i>Of course, you dislike me, too.</i>

459
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,960
<i>I am sorry. I should have known better.</i>

460
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,650
<i>I dare asked to befriend the minister's daughter.</i>

461
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,630
<i>Excuse me, Maiden Do Hwa Seon.</i>

462
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,340
<i>My name is not Do Hwa Seon.</i>

463
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,310
<i>My name is Cho Eun Ae.</i>

464
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,320
<i>Lady Eun Ae?</i>

465
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,170
<i>Wasn't she at the plague village?</i>

466
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,680
<i>M-My Lady.</i>

467
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,810
<i>Nothing is predetermined in this world.</i>

468
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,930
<i>- Your Highness.
- Keep massaging her.</i>

469
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,330
<i>Your Highness. Your Highness.</i>

470
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,100
Everything went wrong because
of you, Cha Sun Chaek.

471
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,570
<i>Buying a fake nobility note</i>

472
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:00,300
<i>cannot change one's fate, I suppose.</i>

473
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,730
Fate changes.

474
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,360
An abandoned orphan on the streets

475
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,080
grew a successful store and
even became a noblewoman.

476
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,110
I cannot be satisfied now.

477
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:17,640
I will get rid of anyone who gets in my way.

478
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,670
You could not even do that properly.

479
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,540
Pathetic bastard.

480
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,770
My goodness.

481
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,470
Did I see something I was not supposed to?

482
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,330
You are...

483
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,140
It was a good try,

484
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,030
but you are still clumsy.

485
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,370
You missed the vital spot.

486
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:00,460
Should I finish him off for you?

487
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:04,000
Do not worry.

488
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,860
I will keep this a secret.

489
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,830
What do you want from me?

490
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:17,150
Similar people recognize each other.

491
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:20,980
Perhaps we share the same goal.

492
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:25,650
You want to change the world, too.

493
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,700
What are you talking about?

494
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,090
No need to try to act in front of me.

495
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,720
If you are quick,

496
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,590
you must have understood me immediately.

497
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,940
Let us not waste each other's time.

498
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,640
Would you like to work with me?

499
00:46:11,337 --> 00:46:13,277
Mother.

500
00:46:13,277 --> 00:46:14,297
How is this one?

501
00:46:14,297 --> 00:46:15,777
Yes, that is nice.

502
00:46:15,777 --> 00:46:17,227
Nice.

503
00:46:18,747 --> 00:46:20,807
How pretty.

504
00:46:24,297 --> 00:46:25,977
Mother, what is that?

505
00:46:25,977 --> 00:46:28,617
We can let the servants do other things,

506
00:46:28,617 --> 00:46:32,297
but I wanted to embroider
the newlyweds' bedding myself.

507
00:46:32,297 --> 00:46:34,807
Why have you been hiding a talent like this?

508
00:46:34,807 --> 00:46:38,577
I had no opportunity to use my talent.

509
00:46:38,577 --> 00:46:44,447
Your grandmother used to
do embroidery herself as well.

510
00:46:44,447 --> 00:46:48,827
I guess she wanted you to
live happily ever after.

511
00:46:48,827 --> 00:46:51,967
You must have become happier
after getting married.

512
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:56,087
Getting married does not always bring happiness.

513
00:46:56,087 --> 00:46:58,647
- Pardon?
- Marriage means...

514
00:46:58,647 --> 00:47:02,117
going through things with
your spouse and your children

515
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:04,447
and creating the new future

516
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,367
while facing hardships from time to time.

517
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:10,957
Happiness follows in the process.

518
00:47:10,957 --> 00:47:14,157
Nothing is predetermined.

519
00:47:14,157 --> 00:47:16,077
Then, the process of

520
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:19,357
putting the efforts with Prince Gyeongseong
must be important.

521
00:47:19,357 --> 00:47:23,357
I want to make Prince Gyeongseong happy.

522
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:25,357
What should I do?

523
00:47:25,357 --> 00:47:29,717
You are so determined, Sun Chaek.

524
00:47:29,717 --> 00:47:33,287
You could finish the bridal training quickly, too.

525
00:47:33,287 --> 00:47:35,277
Bridal training?

526
00:47:35,277 --> 00:47:39,067
So you could survive better
than anyone after getting married,

527
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:42,477
I'll share my tips with you thoroughly.

528
00:47:42,477 --> 00:47:44,307
Brace yourself.

529
00:47:45,307 --> 00:47:47,517
Mother...

530
00:47:51,087 --> 00:47:55,457
There is something I would
like you to do beforehand.

531
00:47:56,747 --> 00:47:58,597
What is it?

532
00:48:11,437 --> 00:48:15,957
<i>Is there a reason you are revisiting the past?</i>

533
00:48:15,957 --> 00:48:19,787
He was the former king's favorite prime minister.

534
00:48:19,787 --> 00:48:25,477
He is apparently more respected
than the local governor there.

535
00:48:25,477 --> 00:48:28,397
<i>It is time to get rid of the
source of future troubles.</i>

536
00:48:29,287 --> 00:48:32,367
Who are you?

537
00:48:56,297 --> 00:48:58,857
Is it His Majesty's order?

538
00:48:59,747 --> 00:49:05,257
Will His Majesty's bloodbath start again?

539
00:49:05,257 --> 00:49:10,397
I am just someone who follows the King's order.

540
00:49:10,397 --> 00:49:12,327
I will die as he wishes.

541
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:16,457
Just give me some time, Prince Gyeongseong.

542
00:49:16,457 --> 00:49:20,527
You know that I cannot do that.

543
00:49:20,527 --> 00:49:25,597
Tomorrow is my youngest daughter's wedding day.

544
00:49:25,597 --> 00:49:30,717
I cannot let her have her father's
funeral before a celebration.

545
00:49:31,787 --> 00:49:33,617
I beg you.

546
00:50:28,937 --> 00:50:30,877
So, this is the place.

547
00:50:32,827 --> 00:50:36,767
<i>Before weddings, my parents always</i>

548
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,897
visited the temple to pray.

549
00:50:39,897 --> 00:50:45,367
Offer a devout prayer for a good
marriage to Prince Gyeongseong.

550
00:50:48,237 --> 00:50:50,287
My Lady,

551
00:50:50,287 --> 00:50:52,387
while you are praying,

552
00:50:52,387 --> 00:50:55,337
I will run an errand for Madam quickly.

553
00:50:55,337 --> 00:50:56,517
Sure.

554
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:01,307
Yes.

555
00:51:01,307 --> 00:51:04,017
Think of it as a Templestay.

556
00:51:21,187 --> 00:51:23,257
Prince Seonghyeon?

557
00:51:23,257 --> 00:51:27,017
Why is he standing there getting all wet?

558
00:51:36,697 --> 00:51:39,547
What are you doing here?

559
00:51:41,147 --> 00:51:43,787
You'll catch a cold. Come this way.

560
00:51:43,787 --> 00:51:45,037
Hurry.

561
00:51:54,677 --> 00:51:58,507
See? You already caught a cold.

562
00:51:58,507 --> 00:52:02,247
Why were you foolishly standing in the rain?

563
00:52:06,927 --> 00:52:09,417
Standing in the rain...

564
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:12,957
makes it feel like old wounds
are getting washed away.

565
00:52:12,957 --> 00:52:14,927
Wounds?

566
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:18,177
When I left Hanyang, I had my parents'

567
00:52:19,517 --> 00:52:21,657
memorial service at this temple.

568
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:25,887
I was greeting them after being away for 10 years.

569
00:52:27,587 --> 00:52:31,077
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

570
00:52:32,377 --> 00:52:34,347
It is okay.

571
00:52:34,347 --> 00:52:36,957
You make me feel less lonely.

572
00:52:39,587 --> 00:52:42,117
Are you sure you're okay?

573
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:52,337
Being here reminds me of that day.

574
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:53,597
That day?

575
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:57,467
You fell in the study
at our house, and I saved you.

576
00:52:57,467 --> 00:53:01,837
We ended up falling together, and you got injured.

577
00:53:01,837 --> 00:53:04,397
Where did you get hurt back then?

578
00:53:05,397 --> 00:53:08,957
Was it m-my head?

579
00:53:10,647 --> 00:53:14,547
No, was it my leg?

580
00:53:16,077 --> 00:53:18,717
Are you really Sun Chaek?

581
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:30,927
It was too long ago.

582
00:53:34,697 --> 00:53:39,077
Looking at your puzzled look, you are Sun Chaek.

583
00:53:39,077 --> 00:53:41,417
I was joking. I was joking.

584
00:53:45,897 --> 00:53:47,727
Goodness...

585
00:53:49,217 --> 00:53:50,567
What are you doing?

586
00:53:50,567 --> 00:53:53,447
I would like to take a short nap.

587
00:53:53,447 --> 00:53:56,687
I have not been able to sleep for three days.

588
00:53:56,687 --> 00:53:59,307
It will only take a moment.

589
00:53:59,307 --> 00:54:01,657
Just until it stops raining.

590
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:07,547
<i>Cha Sun Chaek and Yi Gyu must've
been closer than I thought.</i>

591
00:54:07,547 --> 00:54:09,937
<i>What do I do?</i>

592
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:30,147
Are you awake?

593
00:54:33,107 --> 00:54:35,037
Look at this.

594
00:54:35,037 --> 00:54:37,417
It's a puppy.

595
00:54:38,457 --> 00:54:40,157
So cute.

596
00:54:40,157 --> 00:54:41,517
Where did you come from?

597
00:54:41,517 --> 00:54:43,587
He was lost and totally wet.

598
00:54:43,587 --> 00:54:45,607
I found him nearby.

599
00:54:46,427 --> 00:54:49,327
What do we do? I think he lost his mom.

600
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:52,537
I think I will have to keep you.

601
00:54:52,537 --> 00:54:56,507
I cannot bring myself to leave you behind.

602
00:54:57,447 --> 00:54:58,667
Could you give him a name?

603
00:54:58,667 --> 00:55:00,887
- Me?
- Yes.

604
00:55:07,117 --> 00:55:10,557
- Is it a person? A person is dead?
- A person is dead.

605
00:55:12,607 --> 00:55:14,087
How did he end up dying?

606
00:55:14,087 --> 00:55:16,467
- What's going on?
- I wonder.

607
00:55:16,467 --> 00:55:19,787
- What's that?
- Let us check it out.

608
00:55:26,747 --> 00:55:29,587
<i>My goodness! Look.</i>

609
00:55:41,827 --> 00:55:44,067
You should not have seen that.

610
00:55:44,067 --> 00:55:45,927
It is okay.

611
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:48,987
It is okay.

612
00:55:56,397 --> 00:55:58,477
What are you doing right now?

613
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:01,827
It is Prince Gyeongseong.

614
00:56:13,877 --> 00:56:15,597
There is...

615
00:56:16,697 --> 00:56:20,627
There is the body of my kidnapper.

616
00:56:33,137 --> 00:56:35,137
It is okay.

617
00:56:35,137 --> 00:56:37,137
I am here now.

618
00:56:40,087 --> 00:56:43,877
This country obviously has the Ministry of Justice.

619
00:56:45,037 --> 00:56:47,757
If one condemns another personally,

620
00:56:48,687 --> 00:56:51,187
what would be the use of the law?

621
00:57:10,067 --> 00:57:12,557
Sun Chaek looks very shocked.

622
00:57:13,327 --> 00:57:15,297
Provide comfort for her.

623
00:57:39,937 --> 00:57:43,237
I am all right.

624
00:57:46,687 --> 00:57:48,447
Thank you.

625
00:57:59,737 --> 00:58:01,527
Prince Gyeongseong.

626
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:09,727
What Prince Seonghyeon said earlier...

627
00:58:14,887 --> 00:58:16,857
Prince Seonghyeon, Yi Gyu...

628
00:58:16,857 --> 00:58:21,007
You cannot be close to him, no matter what.

629
00:58:21,007 --> 00:58:23,487
He holds a grudge against me.

630
00:58:23,487 --> 00:58:26,317
What kind of grudge?

631
00:58:32,487 --> 00:58:37,387
I do not want you to incur any more grievances.

632
00:58:38,387 --> 00:58:39,757
What does that mean?

633
00:58:39,757 --> 00:58:42,827
It means I don't want you to kill people.

634
00:58:43,917 --> 00:58:45,457
By chance,

635
00:58:46,367 --> 00:58:48,327
do you believe what Prince Seonghyeon said?

636
00:58:48,327 --> 00:58:50,697
Correct me if I'm wrong.

637
00:58:54,747 --> 00:58:57,077
Do you not trust me?
