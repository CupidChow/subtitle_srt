22

31

If it does not open,

152
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:55,127

Should I help you or not?

185
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:26,867
Of course,

186
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,667
you were not a normal kid.

187
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,087
Since I play tricks so often,

188
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:33,587
the mountain spirit trapped me in here.

189
00:14:33,587 --> 00:14:36,957
Thankfully, since my hair
ended up in the pharmacy,

190
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:39,937
I was able to ask you a favor.

191
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:44,997
You keep saying unbelievable things.

192
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,257
I was not so sure,

193
00:14:48,257 --> 00:14:51,287
but you are the first one who fought the tiger

194
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:53,897
sent by the mountain spirit.

195
00:14:53,897 --> 00:14:56,637
I know how to read people.

196
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:03,867
Here.

197
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:12,017
I keep my promises.

198
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:15,287
That is very rare stuff.

199
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:19,347
It is for a woman you love, right?

200
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:23,457
As you said,

201
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:26,557
I am not just a normal kid.

202
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:34,427
Are you on your way to play another trick?

203
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:41,537
I'm going to the village to find a way
to play tricks without getting caught.

204
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:45,527
Let us say hello happily
if we meet again, Ahjussi.

205
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:19,697
It was a spectacular night.

206
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:21,507
I cannot believe I fainted.

207
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:23,987
But how could I have not?

208
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:26,837
To live or to get married.

209
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:29,787
That is the question.

210
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:33,647
Can you not just get married?

211
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:34,917
What?

212
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:39,477
To be honest, I do not know why you try so hard.

213
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:41,517
You ran away, had a spending spree,
and even joined a temple.

214
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:42,677
You tried everything,

215
00:16:42,677 --> 00:16:44,977
but Prince Gyeongseong does not mind.

216
00:16:44,977 --> 00:16:47,827
He says it still has to be you.

217
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:49,597
It's...

218
00:16:49,597 --> 00:16:51,827
because that place doesn't belong to me.

219
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:54,057
It belongs to whoever takes it first.

220
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:56,637
There is no one entitled to it.

221
00:16:58,137 --> 00:17:00,897
<i>You can't go after someone else's man.</i>

222
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:02,807
<i>No matter how much you want him,</i>

223
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:06,127
<i>you can't go after someone else's man.</i>

224
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:11,887
Are you feeling ill, My Lady?

225
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:15,297
I just remembered a bad memory.

226
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:21,967
P-Prince Gyeongseong?

227
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:34,127
I am glad you woke up.

228
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:40,647
Here.

229
00:17:40,647 --> 00:17:42,517
What is this?

230
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:44,117
It is a medicinal herb.

231
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:50,657
But what is it for...

232
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:54,397
It apparently cures any illnesses.

233
00:18:00,837 --> 00:18:03,177
Make sure to prepare it for her

234
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:04,637
without skipping a day.

235
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:06,337
Yes, My Lord.

236
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,607
By chance, did you get hurt?

237
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:21,197
Are you worried about me?

238
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:23,967
No, it's not that.

239
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:27,437
You'd worry when even
a neighbor's dog got injured.

240
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:29,907
Everyone feels pain when they're hurt.

241
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:32,987
It might hurt more
if you don't get treated quickly.

242
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,177
You do not have to worry about that.

243
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:37,227
I am okay.

244
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:40,577
Oh...

245
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:46,187
the club Jung Su Gyeom started.

246
00:18:47,197 --> 00:18:49,357
I will let you attend their meeting.

247
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:54,367
I thought you could use a little breather.

248
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,377
Did I hear him correctly?

249
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,107
He said you can attend the Seonmun Club meeting.

250
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:09,607
Did he not?

251
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,947
Did the sun rise from the west today?

252
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:16,047
What's gotten into that obsessive psycho?

253
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:19,417
How did he get this rare herb?

254
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:23,277
I understand this is rarer than wild ginseng.

255
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:25,057
Prince Gyeongseong must have

256
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:28,087
gotten this after going through an ordeal.

257
00:19:28,087 --> 00:19:32,107
You must take it and get rejuvenated, My Lady.

258
00:19:32,107 --> 00:19:35,397
He got this medicinal herb for me?

259
00:19:35,397 --> 00:19:38,407
I think this is truly...

260
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:41,767
the love of the century.

261
00:19:45,757 --> 00:19:47,617
Love?

262
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:51,137
I don't think I should get involved with him more.

263
00:19:57,427 --> 00:19:58,857
<i>Here.</i>

264
00:20:02,187 --> 00:20:04,327
To begin with, this doesn't belong to me.

265
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:07,287
Is it okay to take it?

266
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:16,027
Beon, where have you been...

267
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,977
What happened to your face?

268
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:38,297
- My Lady.
- Oh, my gosh!

269
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:41,197
What are you thinking about so intently?

270
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:43,127
It's nothing. What is it?

271
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:46,207
It is a letter from Lady Eun Ae.

272
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,087
Lady Eun Ae?

273
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:54,717
<i>Lady Sun Chaek,</i>

274
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:57,917
<i>my sudden letter might have surprised you.</i>

275
00:20:57,917 --> 00:20:59,957
<i>But since I wanted to get to know you,</i>

276
00:20:59,957 --> 00:21:02,347
<i>I worked up my courage.</i>

277
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:05,407
<i>If you are free tomorrow,</i>

278
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,387
<i>I would love for you to come by</i>

279
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:09,617
<i>and try our shop's new dessert.</i>

280
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:12,567
She wants me to come to her merchandise store?

281
00:21:13,677 --> 00:21:15,227
No, no, no.

282
00:21:15,227 --> 00:21:17,037
I'll do nothing from now on.

283
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:20,237
<i>I will not worry about the male or female lead.</i>

284
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,157
<i>Of course, you can say no.</i>

285
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:25,317
<i>That will not bother me at all.</i>

286
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,977
<i>I was born an orphan</i>

287
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:29,657
<i>and I am nothing but
a merchant's adoptive daughter.</i>

288
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:34,597
<i>I have been doing fine on my own.</i>

289
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:38,547
You haven't been doing fine alone.

290
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:51,597
What is her deal?

291
00:21:51,597 --> 00:21:53,107
- Bang Wool.
- Yes?

292
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:56,767
I think I came up with a brilliant idea.

293
00:22:11,427 --> 00:22:14,817
Will you really not tell me what happened?

294
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:17,167
Will anyone believe me if I did?

295
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,337
Just tell me first.

296
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,117
I will decide to believe it or not then.

297
00:22:20,197 --> 00:22:22,497
If you will not believe me anyway,
I have no reason to tell you.

298
00:22:22,537 --> 00:22:24,397
I wish I knew what this was about.

299
00:22:24,397 --> 00:22:26,297
You really are so frustrating sometimes.

300
00:22:26,297 --> 00:22:27,087
Frustrating?

301
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:28,937
You suddenly banned club meetings in Hanyang.

302
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:30,287
The youth have nowhere

303
00:22:30,287 --> 00:22:33,177
to go or nothing to do in this desolate world.

304
00:22:36,597 --> 00:22:38,937
I will make an exception...

305
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:41,007
and allow that club meeting.

306
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:42,907
Was it the Jeongmun Club?

307
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:44,447
Do you mean it?

308
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,827
You certainly are my friend, Beon.

309
00:22:47,827 --> 00:22:50,887
You still need to know the name
before you allow it.

310
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:52,367
It is the Seonmun Club.

311
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:54,187
The young men and women of Hanyang

312
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:55,997
gather to study the moon and stars

313
00:22:55,997 --> 00:22:58,127
and talk about poetry and paintings.

314
00:23:00,957 --> 00:23:02,977
But I have a request.

315
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:06,167
I need to join that club, too.

316
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:08,067
You, Beon?

317
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,049
With the prolonged drought,

318
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:22,629
the people are impoverished.

319
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:24,219
I think we should open the grain storage

320
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:27,239
and share with the ones in need.

321
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,969
Yes, Madam. I will participate.

322
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:32,109
We will also participate.

323
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:34,099
My family will give away 100 seok of

324
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:36,239
white rice to set an example.

325
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:38,949
The rest of you can give what you can-

326
00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:42,339
We will give away 150 seok this time.

327
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,169
150 seok?

328
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:46,969
You do not have to overdo it.

329
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:48,469
The thing is,

330
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:51,609
our youngest son is getting married.

331
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:53,549
- Another wedding?
- Oh, my!

332
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:56,439
I want to share more to celebrate.

333
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:58,129
Your youngest was studying for the state exam.

334
00:23:58,129 --> 00:24:01,299
He is already getting married?

335
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:04,849
Your eldest got married just a few months ago.

336
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:07,499
It just happened so.

337
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:11,209
I guess he wanted to get married
more than to pass the exam.

338
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:14,529
He wins first place in rushing into marriage.

339
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:15,829
Yes.

340
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:25,479
Madam Jeong.

341
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:29,159
- Yes.
- Congratulations on the wedding.

342
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,569
If you need help for the wedding,

343
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,459
I will send you our servants.

344
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:34,999
Feel free to ask me anytime.

345
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:38,999
I appreciate the gesture alone.

346
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:49,579
Mother, did you have a nice gathering?

347
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:51,569
Yes.

348
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:53,699
We were debating the connection between

349
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:55,769
cotton seeds and the Moon family in the room-

350
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,939
I will dismiss you now.

351
00:24:57,939 --> 00:25:00,349
Take care, then.

352
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:16,419
You must want a daughter-in-law.

353
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:19,179
Of course I do.

354
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:20,589
They are old enough to marry.

355
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:23,599
But none of them seem interested.

356
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:25,769
Seeing them up close,

357
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:27,989
they are all handsome and perfectly fine.

358
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:29,609
Why should you worry?

359
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:32,779
You became better at flattery.

360
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:34,259
They are not fine.

361
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:37,569
They cannot get married because they are not.

362
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:41,039
I worry the family bloodline
will end at this rate.

363
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,809
Well,

364
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:48,849
I know someone who specializes in this.

365
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:51,459
Would you like to visit them?

366
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,719
Is Beon drunk?

367
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,959
Or did he really mean it?

368
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:04,429
Who are you?

369
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:08,199
Sir Su Gyeom, it is me.

370
00:26:08,229 --> 00:26:12,129
Maiden, did you wait for me, by chance?

371
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:14,579
You must not be feeling well, though.

372
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:16,599
I am okay now.

373
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,139
Well,

374
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:22,199
is your invitation to Seonmun Club still valid?

375
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:24,519
Seonmun Club is suddenly so popular.

376
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:27,059
Of course. You are welcome anytime.

377
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:31,669
I have a small request, by the way.

378
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:35,359
There's a friend I want to invite.

379
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,259
Can we join together?

380
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:39,319
It's Lady Cho Eun Ae.

381
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,509
The name sounds familiar.

382
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:44,769
That is your request?

383
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,649
Feel free to bring her.

384
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:49,689
Making requests must be a trend in Hanyang.

385
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:50,779
Pardon?

386
00:26:51,449 --> 00:26:54,249
It is nothing. Seonmun Club was just approved.

387
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:57,379
I am planning to have a meeting tonight.

388
00:26:57,379 --> 00:27:02,149
Did Prince Gyeongseong give that approval?

389
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:03,379
Yes.

390
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:06,589
- Since we are on the topic-
- Since we are on the topic-

391
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,219
- How about we invite Prince Gyeongseong?
- Can I invite Prince Gyeongseong?

392
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,599
Prince Gyeongseong is coming?

393
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,489
Is it okay if he comes?

394
00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:19,629
<i>I knew it.</i>

395
00:27:19,629 --> 00:27:22,229
<i>That's why he allowed it so willingly.</i>

396
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:26,119
<i>We're on the same page for once.</i>

397
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:28,739
If you feel uncomfortable around him-

398
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:30,049
No, no.

399
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:31,649
Not uncomfortable at all.

400
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,319
He's coming, then. Right?

401
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,549
I suppose he is.

402
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:38,339
Any young people should be allowed.

403
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:41,209
We can't discriminate against those
with a bad temper.

404
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:46,759
Your kindhearted gesture is
so beautiful, Maiden Sun Chaek.

405
00:27:57,899 --> 00:27:59,949
I understand.

406
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:03,079
I am tired today.

407
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:05,299
You can leave now.

408
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:11,369
Your Majesty,

409
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:13,819
In Pyeongan-do, snow and hail fell

410
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:16,859
and frost fell until two months ago.

411
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:19,399
The seeds they sowed died

412
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:22,589
and the fields dried out
due to the recent drought.

413
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:27,259
They cannot even harvest wheat
and barley right now.

414
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:29,689
I am aware.

415
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:33,609
The people have been living off crops

416
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:36,499
and they are in danger now.

417
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:43,279
Ever since I took the throne,

418
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,649
natural disasters and crises have
been emerging every month

419
00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:48,839
and we have had droughts and floods every year.

420
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:52,099
This is because of my lack of virtue.

421
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:53,959
Well...

422
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:57,179
do you agree with me, Chief State Minister?

423
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:59,939
It is not that, Your Majesty.

424
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:02,409
Please establish the Ministry of Aid quickly

425
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:03,959
and help the people-

426
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,599
Right State Minister,

427
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,679
you have been looking upset.

428
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:11,799
What are you so unhappy about?

429
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:15,819
How could I be, Your Majesty?

430
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:17,999
You speak up, too.

431
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:21,669
Do you think my lack of virtue is to blame?

432
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:30,839
How can your humble subject judge Your Majesty?

433
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:35,659
Is not showing emotion

434
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:38,079
your family's characteristic?

435
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,939
As expected of the Queen Mother's relative,

436
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:42,679
you are very skilled at avoiding

437
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:44,569
trouble discreetly.

438
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:47,369
- Your Majesty...
- I heard enough.

439
00:29:48,249 --> 00:29:50,609
You can leave now.

440
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,909
I am worried something might

441
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:04,779
happen to you by upsetting His Majesty.

442
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:07,439
You said he has been sensitive

443
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:10,039
due to his worsening of insomnia.

444
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:13,519
I still need to say what I need to say.

445
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,999
We cannot delay establishing the Relief Agency.

446
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,499
Prince Gyeongseong is the only one
His Majesty keeps close.

447
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:23,969
I am worried about the nation's security.

448
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:27,139
How could a single royal family member

449
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:29,879
falter His Majesty's judgment?

450
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:32,089
Lower your voice.

451
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:35,139
If Prince Gyeongseong hears you,

452
00:30:35,139 --> 00:30:36,649
you do not know what he might do to you.

453
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:38,659
Yes, for the past 12 years,

454
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:42,029
countless people were dragged out
by Prince Gyeongseong.

455
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:44,599
Perhaps from now on,

456
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:48,439
the hunting dog might go hunting himself.

457
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:51,229
If the dog goes crazy, it bites its owner.

458
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:52,529
Come on.

459
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:54,769
What are you saying?

460
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:57,779
All right, we need to stay alive

461
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:01,259
in order to convince His Majesty again
in the future.

462
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,049
Let us leave.

463
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,839
My Lady,

464
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,009
you clearly said you will not do
anything yesterday.

465
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:21,279
You saw it, too.

466
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,729
After reading Eun Ae's letter
yesterday, ignoring it

467
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:25,769
would be not right.

468
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:28,479
Bang Wool,

469
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:31,169
you are colder than you seem, aren't you?

470
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:34,059
Yes, my hands and feet are cold by nature.

471
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,669
I am cold deep inside my bones, too.

472
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,489
My Lady.

473
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:46,329
You really came.

474
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:48,919
I feel like I am dreaming.

475
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:51,469
I have a friend now.

476
00:31:51,469 --> 00:31:53,159
Please come inside now.

477
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:54,949
Hold on, Lady Eun Ae.

478
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:56,619
I want to do something with you

479
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:58,639
to celebrate our becoming friends.

480
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:01,089
Do something together?

481
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,289
With me, do you mean?

482
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,599
Yes.

483
00:32:11,489 --> 00:32:14,699
<i>I do not know. I have no idea.</i>

484
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:18,159
I thought he was out.

485
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:22,659
What do I do?

486
00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:28,849
My Lord,

487
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:30,999
what is going on?

488
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:33,079
I have no idea.

489
00:32:33,989 --> 00:32:37,049
What are you talking about?

490
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:40,459
Goodness...

491
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:48,729
I am not sure what to do.

492
00:32:50,489 --> 00:32:53,219
My Lord, if you do not mind,

493
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:56,349
can I step in today?

494
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:10,509
Lady Eun Ae.

495
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:13,289
I am late, am I not?

496
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:15,089
I am sorry, My Lady.

497
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,789
You look so pretty today.

498
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:20,899
You asked me to look presentable.

499
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,369
You also...

500
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:25,329
- look pretty.
- Gosh...

501
00:33:26,189 --> 00:33:29,159
<i>Eun Ae needs to shine today.</i>

502
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:31,269
So, this is Seolhwajae.

503
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:33,279
The annex His Majesty built

504
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,989
before the Princess got married.

505
00:33:35,989 --> 00:33:38,299
The Princess also met her current husband

506
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:40,079
and married him here, too.

507
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,409
The Seonmun Club meeting
is happening here tonight.

508
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:47,769
I hear there is a pond for boats over there.

509
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:50,149
I cannot believe I got to come here.

510
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:52,839
It is all thanks to you.

511
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,369
Thank you so much.

512
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:55,729
Don't thank me.

513
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,419
I'm thankful that you joined me.

514
00:33:59,629 --> 00:34:01,929
<i>Why did I realize this now?</i>

515
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:03,119
<i>Instead of running away,</i>

516
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,009
<i>I just need to let Eun Ae and Yi Beon connect.</i>

517
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:09,119
<i>I'll ignite new sparks.</i>

518
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,069
<i>I'll do that myself.</i>

519
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:12,419
Are you okay, My Lady?

520
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:15,269
Yes, of course. I'm fine.

521
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:21,669
<i>He should be here by now.</i>

522
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:22,929
Over here, My Lord.

523
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,689
Maiden Sun Chaek.

524
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,799
This is Merchant Cho Byeong Mu's daughter,

525
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:32,289
Lady Cho Eun Ae.

526
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:34,819
And this is Sir Jung Su Gyeom,

527
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:37,189
an official of Hongmungwan.

528
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:42,059
I have often heard about you, Maiden Eun Ae.

529
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:44,569
I hear you do a lot of good things.

530
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:45,729
Nice to meet you.

531
00:34:45,729 --> 00:34:49,039
People know me because of my father.

532
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,959
Thank you for allowing me to join Seonmun Club.

533
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,359
Allow?

534
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:59,129
Any romantic young men and women of Hanyang

535
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:01,299
are always welcome.

536
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:04,339
Please come inside.

537
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:05,799
Let's go.

538
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:09,719
You look beautiful.

539
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:12,999
Have you been well?

540
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:19,139
All right.

541
00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:21,869
The night of Seonmun Club

542
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,149
you have been waiting

543
00:35:24,149 --> 00:35:26,499
is finally here!

544
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:42,309
Let me introduce the new members.

545
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:45,019
The daughter of the Chief State Minister,

546
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:47,459
Maiden Cha Sun Chaek.

547
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:51,859
And Merchant Cho Byeong Mu's adopted daughter,

548
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,039
Maiden Cho Eun Ae.

549
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:57,409
A big round of applause, please.

550
00:35:57,409 --> 00:35:59,759
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

551
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:02,859
Thank you for welcoming us.

552
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:06,029
I am in your care going forward.

553
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:08,069
Applause!

554
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,999
<i>Is Prince Gyeongseong not here yet?</i>

555
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:03,229
My heart.

556
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:06,229
Are you okay, Maiden Sun Chaek?

557
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,739
Yes.

558
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:11,699
You two...

559
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:14,009
seem very close.

560
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,659
Beon, I was waiting for you.

561
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:21,199
It is the last newcomer of the Seonmun Club,

562
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:23,359
Prince Gyeongseong.

563
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,579
I am sure he needs no introduction...

564
00:37:32,229 --> 00:37:35,029
He is also a young man of Joseon.

565
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:38,069
How long will you keep holding hands?

566
00:37:39,379 --> 00:37:42,459
I was worried Maiden Sun Chaek would faint again.

567
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:44,619
That is why I was holding her.

568
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:50,789
<i>Is this an obvious plot where
he misunderstands and gets jealous?</i>

569
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:52,659
<i>It can't be.</i>

570
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:58,859
Hello.

571
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,779
I am the third son of the Choi family of Hwasun-

572
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:14,049
Nothing is more useless than an introduction.

573
00:38:14,129 --> 00:38:17,329
But I still need to know his name.

574
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,519
What is the point of learning his name?

575
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:21,489
By chance,

576
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:23,949
will you call each other's names sweetly

577
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:26,569
and become close?

578
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:28,439
Not at all.

579
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:33,069
Why are you doing this here?

580
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:35,429
All right, all right.

581
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:38,249
Let us introduce each other later.

582
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:41,609
Since all three new members are here,

583
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:44,839
let us start the meeting now.

584
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:48,519
Shall we?

585
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:51,689
Shall we?

586
00:38:51,689 --> 00:38:53,299
Yes!

587
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:03,549
Here are the sweets...

588
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,699
the new member, Maiden Cho Eun Ae, brought.

589
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:08,069
Let us taste them.

590
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:11,629
She prepared so much for the Seonmun Club.

591
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:15,829
Isn't Lady Eun Ae as beautiful
inside as she is outside?

592
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:19,549
I heard Merchant Cho Byeong Mu's
sweets are very famous.

593
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:22,489
This is my first time trying them.

594
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:25,189
You are too kind.

595
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:27,749
It is not much, but please enjoy.

596
00:39:27,749 --> 00:39:29,619
When the moon reaches the top of the gazebo,

597
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:32,129
I will start pouring drinks.

598
00:39:32,129 --> 00:39:33,629
It is nice to drink,

599
00:39:33,629 --> 00:39:37,219
but the warm tea and sweets will help you digest.

600
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:38,779
Did you know this?

601
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:43,329
I heard Lady Eun Ae brews
the best of the best tea.

602
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,969
Even the envoys from China line up.

603
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:51,889
This is why she is thought of
as the finest young lady of our time.

604
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,339
<i>Step 1.</i>

605
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:55,629
<i>First impression is everything in high society.</i>

606
00:39:55,629 --> 00:39:57,029
<i>Compliments don't just move whales.</i>

607
00:39:57,029 --> 00:39:58,779
<i>They move the high society.</i>

608
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:00,159
<i>Compliment attack.</i>

609
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,979
You are too kind.

610
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:04,699
This tea's scent spreads over 100 ri...

611
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:07,409
- so it is called Baekrimun-
- It also makes one confess.

612
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:10,079
How did you know?

613
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,479
I have never met anyone who knows that.

614
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:14,599
My gosh.

615
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:17,489
You already have so much in common.

616
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:22,329
I can't believe you two have never met before.

617
00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:27,169
Is this what they mean by
"Finishing each other's sentences"?

618
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:29,959
I have heard a lot about you, Prince Gyeongseong.

619
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:33,429
You've heard of her, too.
Haven't you, Prince Gyeongseong?

620
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:35,339
This is my first time.

621
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:38,509
Of course.

622
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:41,399
Why would you have heard of my name?

623
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:42,979
<i>Moving on to Step 2.</i>

624
00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:45,859
<i>Sweetness heightens one's interest in another.</i>

625
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:47,269
<i>Sweetness attack.</i>

626
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:48,989
Everyone,

627
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:55,729
Lady Eun Ae made these juak* from scratch.
(Sweet rice cake)

628
00:40:55,729 --> 00:40:59,059
They smell so sweet.

629
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:00,759
Let's all try a bite.

630
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:02,449
Thank you.

631
00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:05,179
So tasty.

632
00:41:13,749 --> 00:41:15,459
Why aren't you eating, Prince Gyeongseong?

633
00:41:15,459 --> 00:41:17,309
I am not craving them.

634
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:20,479
They're really delicious, I'm telling you.

635
00:41:23,729 --> 00:41:28,229
If you don't eat one, you'll definitely regret it.

636
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:36,039
You do not have to force him...

637
00:41:44,189 --> 00:41:45,449
It's tasty, right?

638
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:47,039
Isn't it the best?

639
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,559
Its taste dulls one's mind.

640
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,269
Dulls one's mind?

641
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:52,849
He means...

642
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:54,789
that's how tasty it is.

643
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:56,909
No, what I meant is-

644
00:42:08,129 --> 00:42:11,369
Wow. Even a man like me finds them tasty.

645
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:14,009
I am sure they will sell well.

646
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:17,549
Gosh, that's exactly what I thought.

647
00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:20,059
I thought so, too.

648
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:23,769
I will give you plenty more to take home, then.

649
00:42:23,769 --> 00:42:25,609
Yes, thank you.

650
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,369
I do not need any.

651
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:31,279
<i>Sweetness doesn't work with him.</i>

652
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:34,349
<i>He's as bitter as poison.</i>

653
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:36,749
<i>Let's move on to the next step.</i>

654
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:40,279
Didn't you say there's a special event

655
00:42:40,279 --> 00:42:43,509
for the new members tonight?

656
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:46,179
Yes, that is correct.

657
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:49,549
To celebrate three new members
joining the Seonmu Club,

658
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:52,719
I hid notes with poems written on them

659
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:55,029
all over Seolhwajae.

660
00:42:55,029 --> 00:42:59,429
The one who finds one first
and finishes the poem...

661
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:03,269
will be awarded.

662
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:05,359
One of these notes...

663
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,779
have a gold ring inside it.

664
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:11,599
The one who finds it will keep it.

665
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,999
It is a real gold ring, right?

666
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:16,329
He said there is one. I will find it first.

667
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:17,719
Let us go, too. Let us.

668
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:20,709
You have until nine o'clock.

669
00:43:20,709 --> 00:43:23,349
Find the hidden treasures, and we will regroup.

670
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:27,769
Gosh, I should go find the treasure.

671
00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:29,549
Come with me, My Lady.

672
00:43:29,549 --> 00:43:31,099
Okay.

673
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:39,729
Beon,

674
00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:41,709
are you not going?

675
00:43:41,709 --> 00:43:44,139
I do not need treasure.

676
00:43:44,139 --> 00:43:45,969
Because recently,

677
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:48,889
I acquired the biggest treasure.

678
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:51,519
If you do not follow the rules,

679
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:54,979
I will F.R. you from the club as a leader.

680
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:56,279
F.R.?

681
00:43:56,279 --> 00:43:59,499
Forcibly remove.

682
00:43:59,499 --> 00:44:03,879
- You will do that to me?
- Why do you not go ahead and try me?

683
00:44:14,128 --> 00:44:17,688
Where are the notes hidden, anyway?

684
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,838
It is too dark.

685
00:44:20,768 --> 00:44:23,848
I think I heard it's in the garden toward

686
00:44:23,848 --> 00:44:26,118
the end of the pond over there.

687
00:44:26,118 --> 00:44:28,258
Let us go there together, then.

688
00:44:30,628 --> 00:44:32,478
My stomach...

689
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:34,958
My lower stomach is churning.

690
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:36,928
Are you okay, My Lady?

691
00:44:36,928 --> 00:44:39,838
I think I need to go to the outhouse.

692
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:41,818
I'll join you after I'm done.

693
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:44,118
Hurry before other people find it.

694
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:46,428
Hurry, hurry. Get going.

695
00:44:46,428 --> 00:44:47,818
Go.

696
00:44:49,508 --> 00:44:51,138
Go.

697
00:45:01,528 --> 00:45:03,718
Where could it be?

698
00:45:03,718 --> 00:45:05,408
Have you been to the garden over there?

699
00:45:05,408 --> 00:45:07,328
- Not yet.
- Shall we go?

700
00:45:07,328 --> 00:45:09,098
I already went there.

701
00:45:09,098 --> 00:45:11,738
I didn't see anything there.

702
00:45:11,738 --> 00:45:12,808
Is that so?

703
00:45:12,808 --> 00:45:14,428
I only got dirt on my hands.

704
00:45:14,428 --> 00:45:17,648
It was such a waste of time.

705
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,758
As I heard,

706
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:24,748
the book storage over there has a ton of notes.

707
00:45:24,798 --> 00:45:27,618
I'm sharing this only with you.

708
00:45:27,618 --> 00:45:28,898
Thank you, My Lady.

709
00:45:28,898 --> 00:45:30,648
Let us go.

710
00:45:36,198 --> 00:45:38,498
I barely managed to distract them.

711
00:45:38,498 --> 00:45:41,968
You cannot cheat like that.

712
00:45:41,968 --> 00:45:44,968
Gosh, Sir Su Gyeom.

713
00:45:45,788 --> 00:45:48,028
You were there.

714
00:45:48,048 --> 00:45:51,208
- It's not that. I-
- I was kidding.

715
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:54,168
It was a little awkward when

716
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,678
Prince Gyeongseong showed up earlier.

717
00:45:56,678 --> 00:45:59,478
But thanks to you, things became lively.

718
00:45:59,478 --> 00:46:01,448
I feel so relieved.

719
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:04,348
You accepted my suggestion to do a treasure hunt.

720
00:46:04,348 --> 00:46:09,278
Just as the novel said,
you're sweet and sensitive-

721
00:46:10,148 --> 00:46:12,148
Aigoo. N-Never mind.

722
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:14,458
The moment I met you,

723
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:17,468
I noticed how unique and fun you are.

724
00:46:17,468 --> 00:46:20,608
Thanks to you, the members are
having fun like children.

725
00:46:20,608 --> 00:46:22,938
It makes me feel happy.

726
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:28,558
On a night where young men
and women have gathered,

727
00:46:28,558 --> 00:46:31,618
anything could happen, right?

728
00:46:31,618 --> 00:46:33,308
Of course.

729
00:46:34,988 --> 00:46:38,878
Looks like you are awaiting something more fun.

730
00:46:41,588 --> 00:46:43,998
I will rest in the garden

731
00:46:43,998 --> 00:46:46,028
until they find the treasures.

732
00:46:46,028 --> 00:46:48,208
You can't.

733
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,228
Pardon?

734
00:46:49,228 --> 00:46:52,428
You need to stay with me.

735
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:14,238
Is it not here, either?

736
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,288
Prince Gyeongseong.

737
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:48,808
Where are these petals coming from?

738
00:47:48,808 --> 00:47:51,858
<i>When Eun Ae enters the garden
and runs into Prince Gyeongseong,</i>

739
00:47:51,858 --> 00:47:54,258
<i>scatter petals on them.</i>

740
00:47:54,258 --> 00:47:57,718
<i>Why should I be doing this here?</i>

741
00:47:59,488 --> 00:48:03,208
<i>Recreating the serendipitous first
encounter from the novel.</i>

742
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:07,738
<i>You two fell in love right at this moment.</i>

743
00:48:07,738 --> 00:48:10,278
<i>All right. It's time to focus.</i>

744
00:48:10,278 --> 00:48:12,448
<i>Ready, go.</i>

745
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:16,758
How beautiful is this?

746
00:48:29,758 --> 00:48:32,908
Petals make my nose itchy.

747
00:48:32,908 --> 00:48:34,028
I hate it.

748
00:48:34,028 --> 00:48:36,028
Oh, I see.

749
00:48:36,028 --> 00:48:38,808
Excuse me, Maiden Do Hwa Seon.

750
00:48:38,808 --> 00:48:40,228
Pardon?

751
00:48:41,528 --> 00:48:45,248
My name is not Do Hwa Seon.

752
00:48:45,248 --> 00:48:47,048
My name is Cho Eun Ae.

753
00:48:47,048 --> 00:48:48,608
Was it?

754
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:50,438
I was mistaken.

755
00:48:50,438 --> 00:48:53,738
Why that name out of all names?

756
00:48:55,378 --> 00:48:58,878
<i>If my plan happens to go awry,</i>

757
00:48:58,878 --> 00:49:00,768
<i>release that thing.</i>

758
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:10,628
It's too shaky, Sir.

759
00:49:10,628 --> 00:49:12,618
Could you stand straight?

760
00:49:12,618 --> 00:49:14,518
I am fine, Maiden Sun Chaek.

761
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:16,588
Please relax as you look.

762
00:49:25,718 --> 00:49:28,768
<i>Things did go the way I wanted.</i>

763
00:49:28,768 --> 00:49:31,788
<i>Why do I feel so melancholy?</i>

764
00:50:21,228 --> 00:50:23,008
I was avoiding a rat.

765
00:50:23,008 --> 00:50:24,968
My apologies.

766
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:27,818
Of course, you should apologize.

767
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:29,718
You do not know how precious this sword is.

768
00:50:29,718 --> 00:50:31,948
It is because I was caught off guard.

769
00:50:32,668 --> 00:50:34,168
How much does it cost?

770
00:50:34,168 --> 00:50:37,238
I will compensate you if it is damaged.

771
00:50:40,578 --> 00:50:42,258
Compensate?

772
00:50:43,438 --> 00:50:46,468
No money in this world can buy this sword.

773
00:50:46,468 --> 00:50:48,088
I-I did not know.

774
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:50,108
My apologies.

775
00:50:52,618 --> 00:50:53,988
You had better not.

776
00:50:53,988 --> 00:50:55,928
If you knew,

777
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,268
you would not be alive now.

778
00:51:06,038 --> 00:51:07,678
Sword?

779
00:51:54,098 --> 00:51:56,858
I knew a noblewoman would come today.

780
00:52:05,698 --> 00:52:08,328
What are you here to ask about?

781
00:52:09,528 --> 00:52:11,538
Well...

782
00:52:11,538 --> 00:52:14,428
these are my sons' fortune readings.

783
00:52:14,428 --> 00:52:17,458
Would any of them get married this year?

784
00:52:40,438 --> 00:52:42,768
It will not be easy!

785
00:52:46,268 --> 00:52:50,318
Can even one of them get married?

786
00:52:54,218 --> 00:52:56,438
You are not showing enough effort.

787
00:52:56,438 --> 00:52:57,988
This is about finding the love of one's life.

788
00:52:57,988 --> 00:53:01,388
You cannot expect it for free.

789
00:53:18,978 --> 00:53:22,658
She is young, but all she wants is money.

790
00:53:32,968 --> 00:53:36,888
Gosh, he is finally here.

791
00:53:40,978 --> 00:53:42,888
Everything is okay now.

792
00:53:44,748 --> 00:53:45,838
Okay.

793
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:47,558
Do not worry.

794
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:50,218
Your family will have a celebration soon.

795
00:53:50,218 --> 00:53:52,878
- Celebration?
- There will be a wedding.

796
00:53:52,878 --> 00:53:55,348
Is that true?

797
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:57,898
Would that be possible?

798
00:53:57,898 --> 00:53:59,728
I am telling you.

799
00:53:59,728 --> 00:54:01,688
Finally.

800
00:54:01,688 --> 00:54:03,568
Finally, my Jang Ho...

801
00:54:03,568 --> 00:54:05,598
My eldest son Jang Ho is finally...

802
00:54:05,598 --> 00:54:08,038
I do not know who it will be yet.

803
00:54:10,118 --> 00:54:13,148
But it is definitely just one of them.

804
00:54:13,148 --> 00:54:15,058
Do not ask for more.

805
00:54:15,058 --> 00:54:17,098
You will get hurt, then.

806
00:54:23,918 --> 00:54:26,888
The flowers that look like azaleas

807
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:30,138
blossomed and turned red overnight.

808
00:54:37,498 --> 00:54:39,598
Raise the glasses...

809
00:54:39,598 --> 00:54:41,338
and face the bright moon.

810
00:54:41,338 --> 00:54:43,208
<i>Things seemed to be going well.</i>

811
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:46,758
<i>What happened in that nick of time?</i>

812
00:54:46,758 --> 00:54:49,048
<i>Eun Ae dressed prettily today.</i>

813
00:54:49,048 --> 00:54:50,748
<i>She's like a wet mouse now.</i>

814
00:54:50,748 --> 00:54:52,928
Hug the wine jar...

815
00:54:52,928 --> 00:54:56,378
and face the fresh wind.

816
00:55:08,878 --> 00:55:10,638
None of us here...

817
00:55:10,638 --> 00:55:14,488
can get drunk on alcohol or poetry.

818
00:55:14,488 --> 00:55:16,158
I think we should call it a night-

819
00:55:16,158 --> 00:55:17,788
We can't!

820
00:55:18,788 --> 00:55:21,148
No one can leave.

821
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:28,838
I did not come to this meeting

822
00:55:28,838 --> 00:55:32,048
to let it end so unceremoniously.

823
00:55:32,048 --> 00:55:34,708
I was going to save this one, but...

824
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:38,858
To be honest, I'm not a good poet.

825
00:55:38,858 --> 00:55:41,708
But for our first meeting,

826
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:45,828
I'm thinking of showing off
another talent of mine.

827
00:55:45,828 --> 00:55:48,928
Some of you might've heard about it.

828
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:52,478
I'm thinking of making cocktails.

829
00:56:18,168 --> 00:56:22,218
She must have been a fish in her previous life.

830
00:56:29,668 --> 00:56:33,188
Take the penalty drink.

831
00:56:33,188 --> 00:56:36,428
Maiden Sun Chaek!

832
00:56:36,428 --> 00:56:38,898
Forgive me just once.

833
00:56:40,578 --> 00:56:43,078
If you were going to say no like this,

834
00:56:43,078 --> 00:56:46,898
why did you ask me how to make cocktails?

835
00:56:46,898 --> 00:56:51,218
I am so disappointed.

836
00:56:51,218 --> 00:56:53,438
My goodness.

837
00:56:54,388 --> 00:56:56,328
Okay, then.

838
00:57:00,768 --> 00:57:02,738
Goodness.

839
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:06,288
Do you mind...

840
00:57:06,288 --> 00:57:09,098
if I drink the penalty drink for you?

841
00:57:10,188 --> 00:57:11,528
Lady Eun Ae?

842
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:15,258
I cannot let a woman drink something so strong...

843
00:57:15,258 --> 00:57:16,688
Geez. Come on.

844
00:57:16,688 --> 00:57:18,828
Can I not?

845
00:57:18,828 --> 00:57:22,408
In the world of drinking games,

846
00:57:22,408 --> 00:57:23,778
a substitute...

847
00:57:23,778 --> 00:57:28,168
I mean, having a stand-in is allowed.

848
00:57:28,168 --> 00:57:30,488
But Sir Su Gyeom later

849
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:34,798
has to grant Lady Eun Ae's wish.

850
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,888
I will tell you my wish later.

851
00:57:55,888 --> 00:57:57,648
Okay.

852
00:57:57,648 --> 00:57:59,288
Thank you, Maiden Eun Ae.

853
00:57:59,288 --> 00:58:02,918
Lady Eun Ae, were you always a good drinker?

854
00:58:02,918 --> 00:58:04,738
I am feeling thirsty and...

855
00:58:04,738 --> 00:58:07,198
craving alcohol tonight.

856
00:58:07,198 --> 00:58:09,218
Did something bad happen?

857
00:58:09,218 --> 00:58:10,618
I was wondering, too.

858
00:58:10,618 --> 00:58:12,708
You look a bit upset.

859
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:15,088
It is nothing. I just...

860
00:58:15,088 --> 00:58:18,688
feel kind of sad.

861
00:58:18,688 --> 00:58:21,848
The female lead can't feel down.

862
00:58:25,148 --> 00:58:26,738
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

863
00:58:26,738 --> 00:58:30,218
<i>some couples start off by hating each other.</i>

864
00:58:30,218 --> 00:58:33,098
<i>Let's lighten up the mood somehow.</i>

865
00:58:47,748 --> 00:58:52,048
Tonight, to your love and romance.

866
00:58:52,108 --> 00:58:55,208
Cheers to your beautiful eyes.

867
00:58:55,208 --> 00:58:57,858
<i>Nuts to that.</i>

868
00:58:59,788 --> 00:59:03,698
<i>I wondered why I was suddenly feeling hot.</i>

869
00:59:09,268 --> 00:59:11,358
Fire, fire, fire!

870
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:12,908
- Maiden Sun Chaek!
- Fire!

871
00:59:12,908 --> 00:59:15,318
Get out, get out!

872
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,318
Hurry, hurry!

873
00:59:17,318 --> 00:59:19,128
Hurry!

874
00:59:25,378 --> 00:59:27,148
<i>My bomb shots...</i>

875
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:31,108
<i>became actual bombs.</i>

876
00:59:31,108 --> 00:59:33,118
Run away!

877
00:59:34,448 --> 00:59:36,578
Fire! Fire!

878
00:59:36,578 --> 00:59:38,308
Run! Get some water!

879
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:41,158
Fire! Fire!

01:02:07,878 --> 01:02:10,998
<i>♫ Twilight is about to start ♫</i>

913
01:02:10,998 --> 01:02:14,308
<i>♫ The touch seeped deep inside my heart ♫</i>

914
01:02:14,308 --> 01:02:18,708
<i>♫ You got me with that under the moonlight ♫</i>

915
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:21,778
<i>♫ I miss you tonight, tonight, tonight ♫</i>

916
01:02:21,778 --> 01:02:24,798
<i>♫ The explosive feelings,
tonight, tonight, tonight ♫</i>

917
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:27,118
<i>♫ All night long, I need you right now ♫</i>

918
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,818
<i>♫ I'm heading toward you, falling into you ♫</i>

919
01:02:29,818 --> 01:02:32,348
<i>My daughter is not ready to get married.</i>

920
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:34,208
<i>She cannot be forced to get married.</i>

921
01:02:34,248 --> 01:02:37,348
<i>The three of us surely can fight
Prince Gyeongseong!</i>

922
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,278
<i>Men are all about their looks.</i>

923
01:02:39,278 --> 01:02:41,828
<i>You might find this uncomfortable, but...</i>

924
01:02:41,828 --> 01:02:43,738
<i>Is he confessing his love?</i>

925
01:02:44,548 --> 01:02:49,348
<i>I want Prince Gyeongseong's wedding
to go through a selection process.</i>

926
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:53,698
<i>My Lady got the plague.</i>

927
01:02:53,698 --> 01:02:56,128
<i>I will cut your head off if you do not move.</i>

928
01:02:56,128 --> 01:02:57,608
<i>Am I dying?</i>

929
01:02:57,608 --> 01:02:59,338
<i>Try if you can.</i>

930
01:02:59,338 --> 01:03:01,988
<i>I will follow you to the end.</i>
