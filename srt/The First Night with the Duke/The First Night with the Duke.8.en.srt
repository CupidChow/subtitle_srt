1
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,870
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,970
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,990
Wow, look who is here.

4
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,510
It is Prince Gyeongseong.

5
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,100
<i>Do they know each other?</i>

6
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,680
Did you forget how to greet, by chance?

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,000
Of course not.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,580
Greet even your sworn enemy politely.

9
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,820
That is what my parents taught me to do.

10
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,760
Have you been well?

11
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,290
You cannot suddenly appear
and behave so rudely toward her.

12
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,330
She is my fiancée.

13
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,650
My goodness.

14
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,730
I made a mistake.

15
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,870
Anyway, thank you for helping me today, Sun Chaek.

16
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,880
How dare you call my fiancée's name like that?

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,140
You still know to cross the line.

18
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,100
Sun Chaek and I share childhood

19
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,900
memories you are not aware of.

20
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,020
She helped me when I was in trouble.

21
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,980
Do not tell me I need your approval

22
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,940
for every little thing like this.

23
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,310
Enjoy your time together, then.

24
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,500
See you again, Sun Chaek.

25
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,280
This concludes our outing today.

26
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,830
Let us go home.

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,060
Are you upset about earlier, by chance?

28
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,610
Not at all.

29
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,210
Don't get the wrong idea.

30
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,110
- What happened earlier-
- I do not want to know.

31
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,500
By the way, how do you know Prince Seonghyeon?

32
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,820
Our time together is precious enough.

33
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,980
I do not want to waste time talking about him.

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,820
Here.

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,660
You're right.

36
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,630
Let's only focus on our future from now on.

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,110
We're already here.

38
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,350
Oh, right.

39
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,090
Ta-da.

40
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,680
- What are they?
- In any situation,

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,230
these bracelets will connect us together.

42
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,140
Consider it a token of my affection
before the wedding.

43
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,450
A man cannot wear such a thing.

44
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,980
It suits you well.

45
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,890
You need to remember something as my lover, then.

46
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,980
You cannot dare to be in another man's arms.

47
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,950
Got it. I'll keep that in mind, Prince Gyeongseong.

48
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,760
Cha Seon Chaek!

49
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,780
F-Father.

50
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,480
[Episode 8: Return of the shadow]

51
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,580
Sun Chaek is Prince Gyeongseong's fiancée?

52
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,260
Are you okay?

53
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,000
I am not okay.

54
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,790
What if I cannot get married because of it?

55
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,800
I will take responsibility, then.

56
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,530
Are you not using this as an excuse

57
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,100
because you want to marry me?

58
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,970
I am not, okay?

59
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,310
Unless you become handsome when you grow up.

60
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,170
Do not obsess over me because I got too handsome.

61
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,880
That will never happen.

62
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,460
I am a self-respecting woman.

63
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,840
Remember.

64
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,020
You had your first kiss with me.

65
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,380
<i>My Lady! Young Master! Where are you?</i>

66
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,620
Marry me if you are upset about it.

67
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,410
<i>She is my fiancée.</i>

68
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,870
<i>Prince Gyeongseong.</i>

69
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,940
You have someone you do not deserve.

70
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,560
What's going on?

71
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,930
Did I really get locked up?

72
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,680
Father! Bang Wool!

73
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,040
Please open the door!

74
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,010
Fire!

75
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,810
I coddled you too much.

76
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,320
- Father.
- That is how we ended up here.

77
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,150
I can no longer maintain civility.

78
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,340
Your Excellency, do you have to do this?

79
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,090
You also look down on me
because I did not do anything.

80
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,220
I am planning to be a strict father from now on.

81
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,160
No one is allowed to...

82
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,990
open this door until I tell you to.

83
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,860
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

84
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,310
Do not do this. Please go now.

85
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,030
His Excellency is furious.

86
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,510
Is My Lady okay?

87
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,340
She ended up getting locked up.

88
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,370
She should have behaved better.

89
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,180
I need to see the Chief State Minister.

90
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,400
Notify him now.

91
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,080
He is not in the mood for that now.

92
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,460
If I upset him now,

93
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,770
you may never be able to see her again.

94
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,910
I will close the door.

95
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,480
Not a chance this time!

96
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,680
I am sorry, My Lady.

97
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,480
Bang Wool!

98
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,350
What's this?
[Sealed]

99
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,880
[Sealed]

100
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,230
Have you been well, Your Majesty?

101
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,070
You wish the killer of your parents well?

102
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,880
Are you being sincere?

103
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,630
Please do not say that.

104
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,020
It cannot be easy for you to face me.

105
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,020
I moved on from my past
while traveling to other countries.

106
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,110
I do not even remember anymore.

107
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,130
I do not believe what people say.

108
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,940
I heard you were traveling.

109
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,970
What made you suddenly return?

110
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,620
Not for a particular reason.

111
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,090
I grew tired of wandering for a long time,

112
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,480
and I just missed my homeland.

113
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,600
Are you sure that is all?

114
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,700
It is impossible to fool you.

115
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,490
Actually, my friends got me to
gamble, and I lost my fortune.

116
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,690
I am left with nothing.

117
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,460
But I guess that was not the end of me.

118
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,640
In the last round,

119
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,940
I acquired something more valuable than money.

120
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,460
What is this?

121
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,060
It is a rare medicine even the
Chinese Emperor covets.

122
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,300
It will restore your energy effectively.

123
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,310
I appreciate the gesture.

124
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,150
You must know the Chinese
envoys well, as they say.

125
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,490
So, how are things in China these days?

126
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,280
As you know,

127
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,330
I am a good-for-nothing
who is not interested in politics.

128
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,640
But I will share what I overheard

129
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,130
with you from time to time, Your Majesty.

130
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,220
Yes. That is not a bad idea.

131
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,160
There will be a royal family gyeokgu* event soon.
(A sport similar to polo)

132
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,320
Feel free to participate if you wish.

133
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,120
It will be my honor, Your Majesty.

134
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,540
Prince Seonghyeon suddenly returned.

135
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,240
What is he thinking?

136
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,890
Since he returned to Hanyang,

137
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,840
he has not done anything in particular yet.

138
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,090
If Prince Gyeongseong is a hunting dog,

139
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,540
is Prince Seonghyeon more like a wild dog?

140
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,830
I shall make those two dogs have
a match this time around.

141
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,310
He looks very familiar.

142
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,920
Is that a new robe?

143
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,610
How pretty.

144
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,330
Is that... P-Prince Seonghyeon?

145
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,520
My Lady, time to eat.

146
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,680
How's Prince Gyeongseong? He must be shocked.

147
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,610
He came here first thing in the morning,

148
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,400
and he is camping outside the gate.

149
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,830
He must be freezing.

150
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,160
Could there be a solution?

151
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,530
There is none until you change
His Excellency's mind.

152
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,060
Because I'm trapped here,

153
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,270
I can't meet him or talk to him.

154
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,520
What do I do?

155
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,910
Bang Wool, get me paper and thread right now.

156
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,980
I need a whole bunch of threads.

157
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,090
A bunch? All right. I will bring them.

158
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,540
I forgot.

159
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,160
I will be right back.

160
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,550
A little more. A little more.

161
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,000
Good.

162
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,480
Communication device installed.

163
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,750
Bang Wool, take this to Prince Gyeongseong.

164
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,870
My Lord!

165
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,850
<i>Prince Gyeongseong, can you hear me?</i>

166
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,420
I miss you, Prince Gyeongseong.

167
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,020
I need to settle this matter.

168
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,390
Trust me, and wait a bit.

169
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,720
Settle this matter?

170
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,620
I have a few ideas, too.

171
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,870
What do you think?

172
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,840
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

173
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,820
<i>Prince Gyeongseong.</i>

174
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,790
<i>H-Hello?</i>

175
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,280
H-Hello?

176
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,350
Prince Gyeongseong!

177
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,200
I need to talk to you fellows.

178
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:23,110
Why are you pouring us drinks?

179
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,240
I would like your advice.

180
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,960
Advice? From us?

181
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,210
Do you have an idea for me
to win your father's heart?

182
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,800
I mean, do you think we are so easy?

183
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,580
I could never tell you.

184
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,080
<i>Coax the supporters.</i>

185
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,770
<i>My brothers can't resist gifts.</i>

186
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,410
Hyungnim. Hyungnim.

187
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,670
Wine. Our father loves wine.

188
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,290
Come on, Se Ho.

189
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,520
He has been drinking more these days.

190
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,920
Mountain ginseng!

191
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,370
Father likes mountain ginseng, too.

192
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,060
W-Watch yourselves.

193
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,350
Do you not have any self-respect at all?

194
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,820
- No.
- No.

195
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,810
I am not drunk yet.

196
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,320
I will not fall for something like this.

197
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,900
Have a glass,

198
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,620
Big Brother.

199
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,850
Big Brother?

200
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,710
<i>Brother-in-law!</i>

201
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,450
Brother-in-law...

202
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,800
<i>Brother-in-law!</i>

203
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,710
Prince Gyeongseong is my brother-in-law!

204
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,730
<i>Brother-in-law!</i>

205
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,520
Can't believe he'll be our brother-in-law...

206
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,550
It is a 30-year-old mountain ginseng wine.

207
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,070
Prince Gyeongseong,

208
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,830
this is not mountain ginseng.

209
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,070
It is farmed ginseng.

210
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,860
I hope you are not mocking me.

211
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,250
I am disappointed, Prince Gyeongseong.

212
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,170
Until you approve us,

213
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,690
I will not take even a step away from here.

214
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:16,952
My Lady, time to eat.

215
00:21:17,718 --> 00:21:19,908
Lady Sun Chaek.

216
00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:25,454
My Lady.

217
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:30,584
My Lady.

218
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:32,184
Bang Wool.

219
00:21:33,304 --> 00:21:34,924
What happened to Prince Gyeongseong?

220
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:36,174
Will Father let us get married?

221
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:37,914
It is not that.

222
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:41,164
Prince Gyeongseong is still
kneeling in the front yard

223
00:21:41,164 --> 00:21:44,564
and His Excellency continues to ignore him.

224
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:46,194
- I need to go. I need to go.
- No!

225
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:50,664
You will only make it worse by going there now!

226
00:21:57,634 --> 00:22:00,684
I'm so frustrated.

227
00:22:00,684 --> 00:22:04,724
- My Lady.
- What should I do?

228
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:10,014
There is nothing I can do.

229
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,184
My Lady.

230
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:19,894
This is not good.

231
00:22:24,554 --> 00:22:27,884
My Lady, I have no choice.

232
00:22:27,884 --> 00:22:29,654
Whether you are grounded or not,

233
00:22:29,654 --> 00:22:32,154
I need to save you first.

234
00:22:32,154 --> 00:22:33,814
Let us go.

235
00:22:35,884 --> 00:22:37,584
Really?

236
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,304
Please get up now.

237
00:22:47,304 --> 00:22:51,634
I cannot get up until you give your approval.

238
00:22:51,634 --> 00:22:54,154
If kneeling would have resolved this,

239
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:58,324
what would be impossible in this world?

240
00:22:58,324 --> 00:23:00,864
Please come inside for now.

241
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,224
Hand me that.

242
00:23:09,124 --> 00:23:10,684
Goodness.

243
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:13,724
You got covered in snow.

244
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:16,364
You must have been so cold.

245
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:30,804
I understand how determined you are now, but-

246
00:23:30,804 --> 00:23:33,684
Do you mean you still cannot approve us?

247
00:23:33,684 --> 00:23:36,834
Any father would want their
daughters to get married

248
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:40,054
and live happily and healthy for a long time.

249
00:23:40,054 --> 00:23:42,184
I will make her happier than anyone.

250
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:45,914
You have had blood on your hands for His Majesty

251
00:23:45,914 --> 00:23:48,624
for over a decade now.

252
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:52,544
It must mean there are that many people

253
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:55,464
who want you to see your blood.

254
00:23:55,464 --> 00:23:57,504
If you get married and have children,

255
00:23:57,504 --> 00:24:00,524
they will be the targets
for those who are after you

256
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:04,414
and they will become your weakness.

257
00:24:10,994 --> 00:24:13,224
However...

258
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:16,534
a grown man and woman love each other.

259
00:24:16,534 --> 00:24:20,844
I cannot follow you around and stop you forever.

260
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:27,884
I wonder if you really have the character
and the spirit to protect my daughter.

261
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:31,884
I would like to test your potential.

262
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:35,594
Please promise me one thing.

263
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:45,284
For our family and Sun Chaek's reputation,

264
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:48,734
I will let you see each other, but

265
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:53,894
I hope you refrain from her staying out overnight.

266
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:57,144
Please protect Sun Chaek.

267
00:24:57,144 --> 00:25:01,404
I will make sure to keep that promise.

268
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:05,534
If so, I will count on you.

269
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:07,284
Wife.

270
00:25:09,094 --> 00:25:14,014
I will allow Sun Chaek to come out now.

271
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,524
Yes.

272
00:25:23,604 --> 00:25:27,154
Sun Chaek, your father finally-

273
00:25:44,324 --> 00:25:45,874
My Lady.

274
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:48,064
Long time no see.

275
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:53,354
I thought you forgot about me.

276
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:58,204
I've been so out of it.

277
00:25:59,664 --> 00:26:02,864
Was the solution you got from here last time

278
00:26:02,864 --> 00:26:04,834
effective at all?

279
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:06,914
The solution?

280
00:26:09,724 --> 00:26:13,284
The thing you purchased from here, My Lady.

281
00:26:16,894 --> 00:26:20,724
Y-Yes, yes. I suppose so...

282
00:26:20,724 --> 00:26:25,264
What concern brought you here today, then?

283
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:27,684
Well, the thing is...

284
00:26:28,784 --> 00:26:31,074
There is an obstacle to your love.

285
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:34,934
How perilous. You might never be able to marry.

286
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:36,544
Your feet were tied, and the thread was cut off.

287
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:38,034
You are so frustrated right now.

288
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:40,524
How did you know that?

289
00:26:44,514 --> 00:26:46,324
Love, reunion, and popularity talismans.

290
00:26:46,324 --> 00:26:49,724
They are my special talismans,
approved by reviews.

291
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:51,764
Talismans?

292
00:26:58,154 --> 00:27:02,154
Aigoo. It knows who it belongs to.

293
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:07,824
Hide this in the man's bedding.

294
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:12,514
It will get rid of everyone
who interferes with your marriage.

295
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:16,394
Since you are a regular, I will
give you a special discount.

296
00:27:16,394 --> 00:27:18,104
Should I buy this?

297
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,174
I think I should buy it.

298
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,124
There you are again.

299
00:27:24,124 --> 00:27:25,764
Let me run my business.

300
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:28,674
I am trying to make a living. How could you-

301
00:27:40,304 --> 00:27:42,884
Where is the real one?

302
00:27:42,884 --> 00:27:45,324
The wrong girl is sitting here instead.

303
00:27:45,324 --> 00:27:47,314
Looking at you,

304
00:27:47,314 --> 00:27:50,254
I can tell things are not going your way.

305
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:53,104
I could even say stuff like that.

306
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:00,614
I don't like this...

307
00:28:03,394 --> 00:28:05,724
You are at a crossroads.

308
00:28:05,724 --> 00:28:08,494
You had better choose wisely.

309
00:28:08,494 --> 00:28:10,614
Crossroads?

310
00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:15,744
The only thing you can do freely
in life is to make choices.

311
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:18,654
Just wait and see.

312
00:28:18,654 --> 00:28:22,734
You will be at the crossroads
where you have to decide soon.

313
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,724
Of course, no one knows
the results of the decisions.

314
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:27,884
That includes me, a deity.

315
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:35,554
That makes life and stories
more interesting, right?

316
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:41,444
You ended up buying that.

317
00:28:41,444 --> 00:28:43,834
You are so gullible, My Lady.

318
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:47,664
<i>Does she really know something about me?</i>

319
00:28:47,664 --> 00:28:49,924
It feels strange.

320
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:51,994
Did she really say that knowingly?

321
00:28:51,994 --> 00:28:54,404
I do not believe in that stuff,

322
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:57,214
but she sounded kind of believable today.

323
00:28:57,214 --> 00:28:59,644
Did you think so, too?

324
00:28:59,644 --> 00:29:02,354
Might as well test it now.

325
00:29:02,354 --> 00:29:06,364
You paid money for it. Try something with it.

326
00:29:13,324 --> 00:29:16,584
What brings you here so late?

327
00:29:16,584 --> 00:29:19,034
Are you celebrating your freedom?

328
00:29:19,034 --> 00:29:20,894
Am I no longer grounded?

329
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:22,974
Did you and Father come to an agreement?

330
00:29:22,974 --> 00:29:24,874
So, you were not freed.

331
00:29:24,874 --> 00:29:26,114
You ran away.

332
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:29,804
Come on. That's not important.

333
00:29:29,804 --> 00:29:33,654
The fact that we're together now is important.

334
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:38,024
I missed you, Prince Gyeongseong.

335
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:45,704
It's cold tonight.

336
00:29:45,704 --> 00:29:48,394
Can I come in for a moment?

337
00:29:52,644 --> 00:29:54,724
You cannot come in.

338
00:29:54,724 --> 00:29:57,424
Until your father approves our marriage,

339
00:29:57,424 --> 00:30:00,734
I promised not to lay a finger
on his precious daughter.

340
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:05,214
If he hears I brought you into
the men's quarters right away,

341
00:30:05,214 --> 00:30:07,184
I would be in trouble.

342
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:16,784
But there seems to be no one around.

343
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:21,114
I think I could just sneak in.

344
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:22,764
If I were to break the promise so easily,

345
00:30:22,764 --> 00:30:25,124
I would not have made the
promise in the first place.

346
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:29,134
Do you think lightly of a man's promise?

347
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:35,784
Do you care more about that promise than me?

348
00:30:35,784 --> 00:30:38,764
I suppose you didn't miss me.

349
00:30:50,124 --> 00:30:54,084
If you tempt me with a face like that...

350
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:05,114
it would be difficult for me.

351
00:31:06,084 --> 00:31:10,924
Could you please leave now, Maiden Cha Sun Chaek?

352
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:28,894
How could you, Prince Gyeongseong?

353
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,274
[How dare you expect to be happy]

354
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,084
[sitting on top of someone's blood?]

355
00:31:50,084 --> 00:31:53,644
[How despicable. Not only you but your people]

356
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:59,604
[and everyone around you will not be safe]

357
00:32:04,804 --> 00:32:07,024
How could he do this to me?

358
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:09,654
How could you, Prince Gyeongseong!

359
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,584
Sun Chaek.

360
00:32:15,944 --> 00:32:17,924
Jang Ho.

361
00:32:18,764 --> 00:32:23,514
Where did you go as soon as you were freed?

362
00:32:25,564 --> 00:32:28,554
You must have been frustrated. I am sorry.

363
00:32:28,554 --> 00:32:32,994
But Father still hasn't approved
the marriage yet. I'm worried.

364
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,924
He said he would keep an eye on things,

365
00:32:34,924 --> 00:32:38,414
but this is a huge improvement.

366
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:42,384
Please, all of you, convince
Father and help me out.

367
00:32:42,384 --> 00:32:44,954
A-All right.

368
00:32:44,954 --> 00:32:49,564
I could see Prince Gyeongseong's
good qualities up close.

369
00:32:49,564 --> 00:32:52,004
- I know, right?
- Yes.

370
00:32:52,924 --> 00:32:55,764
Well, by the way...

371
00:32:55,764 --> 00:32:58,584
Do you have something else to say?

372
00:32:58,584 --> 00:33:01,154
By chance, did you know?

373
00:33:01,154 --> 00:33:02,234
Know what?

374
00:33:02,234 --> 00:33:04,744
I think Prince Seonghyeon is back.

375
00:33:06,154 --> 00:33:07,764
After he returned from his exile,

376
00:33:07,764 --> 00:33:09,534
he disappeared and...

377
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:11,484
grew apart from our family.

378
00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:15,874
Exile? Isn't that for criminals?

379
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:19,594
I am talking about the killings among royals that

380
00:33:19,594 --> 00:33:22,344
took place when the current King began ruling.

381
00:33:22,344 --> 00:33:25,744
Prince Seonghyeon lost his parents then.

382
00:33:25,744 --> 00:33:30,554
In that process, he grew apart from
Prince Gyeongseong, who sided with the King.

383
00:33:30,554 --> 00:33:34,534
<i>They had that kind of a history?</i>

384
00:33:36,504 --> 00:33:39,214
[Invitation]

385
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:46,884
Gyeokgu competition, huh?

386
00:33:46,884 --> 00:33:49,294
Since the game is set up,

387
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:51,894
I will go ahead and play.

388
00:34:13,314 --> 00:34:17,634
<i>- It has been a while.
- I know. This would be a lot of fun.</i>

389
00:34:18,654 --> 00:34:20,594
<i>- Prince Gyeongseong...
- What a great weather.</i>

390
00:34:20,594 --> 00:34:24,984
Here comes His Majesty!

391
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:56,244
Players, come in!

392
00:35:28,154 --> 00:35:30,514
You have not seen each other in a while.

393
00:35:30,514 --> 00:35:35,074
Gyeokgu is a perfect way to catch up.

394
00:35:35,074 --> 00:35:36,534
Do you not think so?

395
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,604
Thanks to your thoughtfulness,

396
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:42,814
I seem to have regained my energy.

397
00:35:45,824 --> 00:35:47,224
Yes.

398
00:35:47,224 --> 00:35:49,614
That is great.

399
00:35:54,724 --> 00:36:00,054
All right. Do your best to make me happy.

400
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:02,354
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

401
00:37:10,904 --> 00:37:13,194
Beon!

402
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:37,824
Let us go!

403
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,444
Take this!

404
00:37:48,864 --> 00:37:51,354
Beon, Beon! Over here!

405
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,144
That is right!

406
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:14,514
Beon! Beon!

407
00:38:50,114 --> 00:38:51,224
[2:0]

408
00:39:02,414 --> 00:39:04,464
I just cannot do it.

409
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,944
Go, go, go!

410
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:18,174
Beon! Beon! Over here! Over here!

411
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:23,284
It went in! Did you see it? Beon!

412
00:39:23,284 --> 00:39:25,404
Did you see it?

413
00:39:26,294 --> 00:39:28,014
Beon.

414
00:39:30,664 --> 00:39:32,184
[3:0]

415
00:39:34,814 --> 00:39:36,264
Beon!

416
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:50,074
Score!

417
00:39:50,074 --> 00:39:51,744
Beon!

418
00:39:53,714 --> 00:39:54,914
Beon!

419
00:40:24,384 --> 00:40:26,484
What are you, kids?

420
00:40:27,434 --> 00:40:29,224
Do it right!

421
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:32,484
Get it together!

422
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:39,294
Foul! Foul!

423
00:40:39,294 --> 00:40:40,974
Can you not hear me?

424
00:40:40,974 --> 00:40:43,094
Foul, I said!

425
00:41:10,794 --> 00:41:12,884
[4:1]

426
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:14,874
[1]

427
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:44,614
The wild dog bit the hunting dog.

428
00:42:32,554 --> 00:42:34,944
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

429
00:42:37,234 --> 00:42:41,554
<i>- Your Majesty!</i>
- Yes.

430
00:42:42,554 --> 00:42:44,574
I am completely fine.

431
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:51,084
My apologies, Your Majesty!

432
00:42:51,084 --> 00:42:53,414
I committed a grave sin.

433
00:42:53,444 --> 00:42:55,254
Well...

434
00:42:55,254 --> 00:42:58,454
it happened during the game.

435
00:43:00,784 --> 00:43:01,864
I deserve to die!

436
00:43:01,864 --> 00:43:04,534
It is okay, I said.

437
00:43:12,584 --> 00:43:16,254
Things are heating up too much.

438
00:43:16,254 --> 00:43:18,524
Let us end the game now.

439
00:43:19,524 --> 00:43:22,014
I am heading to the King's Palace.

440
00:43:37,734 --> 00:43:39,144
Beon,

441
00:43:39,974 --> 00:43:42,094
it is my fault.

442
00:43:42,094 --> 00:43:43,404
I am sorry.

443
00:43:43,404 --> 00:43:44,904
It is okay.

444
00:43:45,714 --> 00:43:49,374
Wow, the rumors were right.

445
00:43:50,164 --> 00:43:52,394
You are just as good as ever.

446
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:58,084
But even seemingly perfect things have flaws.

447
00:43:58,084 --> 00:44:02,364
Gosh, do not get too worked up.

448
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:05,534
It means I learned something from you again today.

449
00:44:06,534 --> 00:44:08,014
Let us go.

450
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:12,724
By the way,

451
00:44:13,794 --> 00:44:16,534
did you receive the letter I sent?

452
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:27,579
What happened? They were fine.

453
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:29,329
While leaving a brothel the other day,

454
00:44:29,329 --> 00:44:32,529
they got attacked by an assailant.

455
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:33,899
Who did they upset?

456
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:36,189
They look pretty bad.

457
00:44:36,189 --> 00:44:39,609
Gosh, they look terrible.

458
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:41,219
Aigoo, I am sorry.

459
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:44,319
It is because I cannot see well.*
(It also means 'fearless')

460
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,819
Anyway, it would be tough
to function properly in the future.

461
00:45:09,859 --> 00:45:13,589
What was that chilling, murderous energy?

462
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,549
So cold.

463
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:30,959
How many days has it been now?

464
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:34,139
I just need to avoid staying out all night.

465
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:36,649
This is so unfair.

466
00:45:41,389 --> 00:45:44,489
What a master of self-control.

467
00:45:50,229 --> 00:45:53,229
Is it because I didn't get to give this to him?

468
00:45:55,409 --> 00:45:56,949
But if I go to him to give it to him,

469
00:45:56,949 --> 00:45:59,909
he'll obviously make me leave.

470
00:46:03,249 --> 00:46:05,579
<i>You are at a crossroads.</i>

471
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:07,799
<i>You had better choose wisely.</i>

472
00:46:09,499 --> 00:46:11,769
Crossroads.

473
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:16,139
Why does that word bother me so much?

474
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:24,969
Watch Prince Seonghyeon closely from now on.

475
00:46:24,969 --> 00:46:27,589
Report to me if you notice anything suspicious.

476
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:31,509
Is Prince Seonghyeon someone dangerous?

477
00:46:31,509 --> 00:46:34,019
Something has been bothering me.

478
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:35,959
Watch him for now.

479
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,539
Yes, My Lord.

480
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:54,579
What is it?

481
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:58,589
The object you ordered is ready.

482
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:05,069
As you requested,

483
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:07,589
I split the ring Madam Seol left you

484
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:11,109
into two rings.

485
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:15,359
You are planning to give
these to Lady Cha, correct?

486
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:21,249
Lady Cha will love them.

487
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:33,999
Sir.

488
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:35,599
Maiden.

489
00:47:43,249 --> 00:47:47,549
You must have been taken aback
that I suddenly disappeared that day.

490
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:55,089
Could you accept these flowers

491
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:58,829
and forgive me for my rude behavior?

492
00:48:11,919 --> 00:48:15,099
Just the fact that you came to see me today

493
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:18,089
made me feel completely fine.

494
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:26,619
<i>The flowers are very pretty.</i>

495
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:30,329
I think it is my first time being given flowers.

496
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:34,039
I should visit you with flowers often.

497
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:40,319
Maiden Eun Ae,

498
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:44,699
to be honest, that day, I...

499
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,579
You do not have to tell me.

500
00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:00,239
Everyone has a situation they cannot explain.

501
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:03,449
Of course, I have a good eye for people.

502
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:07,189
If so, Maiden Eun Ae,

503
00:49:08,249 --> 00:49:11,379
could you give me another chance to eat

504
00:49:11,379 --> 00:49:13,299
the gukbap I missed out on that day?

505
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:15,289
I would be happy to.

506
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:28,129
Has the world always been this beautiful?

507
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:34,679
"Everyone has a situation."

508
00:49:38,329 --> 00:49:40,759
Goodness, Maiden Eun Ae.

509
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:45,049
Right, the handkerchief.

510
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:52,809
I could use this as an excuse to see her again.

511
00:49:55,879 --> 00:49:58,099
- Beon.
- Watch where you are going.

512
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:01,959
Since you are always watching
straight ahead, I will...

513
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:04,489
watch a bit crookedly.

514
00:50:04,489 --> 00:50:07,059
What is with your neck? It is crooked.

515
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:09,709
It is because I am jealous of the groom-to-be.

516
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:13,879
By the way, where are you headed to?

517
00:50:13,879 --> 00:50:16,369
I have a private life, too.

518
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:19,339
To be honest, I am not at all interested.

519
00:50:19,339 --> 00:50:21,899
You are joking. You must be in a good mood.

520
00:50:21,899 --> 00:50:24,329
Are you on your way to see your fiancée?

521
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:25,769
Yes.

522
00:50:26,779 --> 00:50:29,829
By the way, the mountain ginseng wine...

523
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:33,149
- turned out to be fake.
- Let us go on our way.

524
00:50:36,759 --> 00:50:40,919
I'll let it slide because I'm
in a good mood today, Jung Su Gyeom.

525
00:50:40,919 --> 00:50:44,249
Prince Gyeongseong sent me a letter?

526
00:50:49,609 --> 00:50:51,939
"Come to Cheonggyecheon,

527
00:50:51,939 --> 00:50:54,689
where we first met.

528
00:50:55,689 --> 00:50:57,749
I will be waiting."

529
00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:03,169
If Mother and Bang Wool look for me,

530
00:51:03,169 --> 00:51:05,749
tell them I left urgently
to meet Prince Gyeongseong.

531
00:51:05,749 --> 00:51:07,529
Yes, My Lady.

532
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:02,999
This is where we first met.

533
00:52:22,819 --> 00:52:25,109
Why is he not coming?

534
00:53:40,379 --> 00:53:42,629
<i>What did you say just now?</i>

535
00:53:48,189 --> 00:53:53,009
She received my letter and went out?

536
00:53:54,889 --> 00:53:56,639
I looked everywhere,

537
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:59,289
but she is not at Cheonggyecheon.

538
00:53:59,289 --> 00:54:02,449
I was away running an errand for Madam.

539
00:54:05,169 --> 00:54:07,559
<i>The leader is here.</i>

540
00:54:48,129 --> 00:54:51,389
Should you not receive treatment soon?

541
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,769
I will not be treated.

542
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:56,079
But why...

543
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,979
Whenever I am starting to forget
the past, I see my blood

544
00:54:58,979 --> 00:55:03,769
and am reminded of my family's
blood and screams clearly.

545
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:10,209
Compared to their pain,

546
00:55:12,129 --> 00:55:14,619
this is nothing.

547
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:23,049
Now is the time for everything
to get back into place.

548
00:55:53,899 --> 00:55:56,449
Where am I?

549
00:56:03,979 --> 00:56:06,189
This place is...

550
00:56:06,189 --> 00:56:08,239
your grave.

551
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:39,829
Make sure to take care of it tonight.

552
00:56:54,589 --> 00:56:56,659
Spare me.

553
00:56:56,659 --> 00:56:58,959
Spare me! Spare me!

554
00:56:58,959 --> 00:57:01,299
There is no use.

555
00:57:01,299 --> 00:57:03,869
No one will hear you and come.

556
00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:05,849
What do you want from me?

557
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:07,709
Why are you doing this?

558
00:57:07,709 --> 00:57:10,989
Die very painfully.

559
00:57:10,989 --> 00:57:13,539
That is what that person wants.

560
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:31,449
[Someone's loss is another person's gain]

561
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:33,179
[The lead character's death
could allow someone else to live]

562
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:35,209
[Yi Beon and Sun Chaek are
at the crossroads of life and death]

563
00:57:35,209 --> 00:57:36,679
[and on the verge of breaking up]

564
00:57:36,689 --> 00:57:39,439
[Yi Beon and Sun Chaek are
at the crossroads of life and death]

565
00:57:39,439 --> 00:57:41,239
[and on the verge of breaking up]

566
00:57:42,289 --> 00:57:44,089
[Male lead, come out and save the female lead!]

567
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:45,669
[Be suspicious when everyone's too happy]

568
00:57:45,669 --> 00:57:48,219
What's the plan, exactly?

569
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:52,019
This will get resolved again somehow.

570
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:54,019
Because she's the main character.

571
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,749
Worrying makes me look ugly.

572
00:58:00,749 --> 00:58:02,489
No, no.

573
00:58:23,289 --> 00:58:27,559
Disappear, wrinkles, and worries.

574
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:33,639
It's already looking soft and shiny.

575
00:58:35,739 --> 00:58:38,139
This world is amazing.

576
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,319
I'll use it again tomorrow.

577
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:45,679
[Epilogue]
<i>A letter of promises.</i>

578
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:49,069
<i>Prince Gyeongseong promises the following.</i>

579

<i>One.</i>

580
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:52,729
<i>In my relationship with Your Excellency's daughter,</i>

581
00:59:52,729 --> 00:59:55,109
<i>I will maintain dignity and civility.</i>

582
00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:58,129
<i>I will never let her stay out overnight.</i>

583
00:59:58,129 --> 01:00:02,879
<i>Two. I will not behave in a way
to hurt the Cha family's reputation.</i>

584
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:07,279
<i>I will follow your words rather
than my personal emotions.</i>

585
01:00:07,279 --> 01:00:11,589
<i>Three. I will make sure to protect your daughter</i>

586
01:00:11,589 --> 01:00:13,669
<i>and keep her safe.</i>

587
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:18,879
<i>Prince Gyeongseong, Yi Beon.</i>

[The First Night with the Duke]

589
01:00:51,879 --> 01:00:56,079
<i>♫ You came into my heart ♫</i>

590
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:03,179
<i>♫ Because you let me smile again ♫</i>

591
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:10,849
<i>♫ Like the moonlight that is
absorbing into you right now ♫</i>

592
01:01:10,849 --> 01:01:16,319
<i>♫ It illuminates your heart ♫</i>

593
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,179
<i>Because his fiancée is missing,</i>

594
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:20,689
<i>he brought chaos to the capital.</i>

595
01:01:20,689 --> 01:01:23,899
<i>- Sun Chaek!
- How touching your affection is for her.</i>

596
01:01:23,899 --> 01:01:26,489
<i>I'm certain Prince Gyeongseong will find me.</i>

597
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:30,009
<i>Someone copied my handwriting very well.</i>

598
01:01:30,009 --> 01:01:32,669
<i>They must know me very well.</i>

599
01:01:32,669 --> 01:01:34,399
<i>We share the same goal.</i>

600
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,099
<i>Do you not want to change the world, too?</i>

601
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:38,499
<i>Cha Sun Chaek!</i>

602
01:01:38,499 --> 01:01:40,659
<i>Prince Gyeongseong...</i>

603
01:01:40,659 --> 01:01:42,419
<i>Cha Sun Chaek!</i>

604
01:01:42,419 --> 01:01:46,229
<i>♫ I look for you ♫</i>
