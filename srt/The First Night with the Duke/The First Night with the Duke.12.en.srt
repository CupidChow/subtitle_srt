1
00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:06,807
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,607
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:18,687
What I fear is...

4
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:22,077
the sadness my lover will feel

5
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:25,567
after hearing about my death.

6
00:00:26,637 --> 00:00:28,337
<i>In any situation,</i>

7
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:30,937
<i>these bracelets will connect us together.</i>

8
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:35,077
<i>Consider it a token of my affection
before the wedding.</i>

9
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:43,567
W-Why are you not killing me?

10
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,197
This is humiliating.

11
00:01:45,197 --> 00:01:47,767
Just kill me!

12
00:01:50,097 --> 00:01:52,287
Because...

13
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:56,547
I promised not to take anyone's life

14
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:00,967
with this sword.

15
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:51,797
<i>Because we weren't destined to be apart yet,</i>

16
00:02:52,987 --> 00:02:55,947
<i>the moment the sun and the moon become one,</i>

17
00:02:55,947 --> 00:02:58,847
<i>Inyeonok's miracle happened.</i>

18
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:04,947
[Episode 12: The reencounter with the world]

19
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:16,527
We took care of the Chief State Minister,

20
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:18,577
but until the abdication process is completed,

21
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:21,597
we cannot ignore the opposition's movement.

22
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:25,027
Are you suggesting using the military force?

23
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:27,967
It was Prince Seonghyeon's idea, not mine.

24
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:31,337
Shedding more blood when we achieved our goal

25
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:35,017
is no different than what
His Majesty did a decade ago.

26
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:39,297
I thought our great cause was
to create a different world.

27
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:41,987
What a dangerous comment.

28
00:03:41,987 --> 00:03:45,047
We do not have time to get sentimental.

29
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:49,247
We must eliminate potential resistance,
as Prince Seonghyeon ordered.

30
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:55,907
With the Hongmungwan official
Jung Su Gyeom's lead,

31
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:57,767
the officials of three ministries and

32
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:00,567
Confucian scholars are heading
to the King's Palace.

33
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:05,547
Jung Su Gyeom, you said?

34
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:07,977
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

35
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:11,717
Please withdraw your abdication!

36
00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:16,247
Your Majesty, the abdication was
planned by an evil force

37
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:19,337
that is trying to shake the country's foundation.

38
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:23,927
Why do you play ignorant
of Prince Seonghyeon's impure ambition?

39
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:26,717
Please listen to our plea, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:30,797
<i>Please listen to our plea, Your Majesty.</i>

41
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:57,737
Catch her!

42
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:36,837
But your foolish decision is...

43
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,407
hastening your death in the end.

44
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,377
It is finally time to go, Sun Chaek.

45
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,077
It is Prince Gyeongseong.

46
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:47,517
Catch that bastard.

47
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:52,037
Catch him, I said!

48
00:06:57,327 --> 00:06:59,357
If you want to live,

49
00:06:59,357 --> 00:07:02,457
drop the sword and step aside now!

50
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,597
Prince Gyeongseong,

51
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:08,047
how are you back here?

52
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:20,207
How dare you bandits...

53
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:22,727
come inside the Palace?

54
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:25,227
We were ordered to kill anyone

55
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:28,227
who goes against the King.

56
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:33,657
Is this...

57
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:37,297
truly what His Majesty wants?

58
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:42,157
Step back if you do not want to get hurt.

59
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,237
Stop!

60
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:59,537
Are you all right, Sir?

61
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:00,947
What are you doing here?

62
00:09:00,947 --> 00:09:02,517
It was Prince Gyeongseong's order.

63
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:06,357
Prince Gyeongseong has returned.

64
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:08,387
Prince Gyeongseong...

65
00:09:19,387 --> 00:09:22,397
What is taking him so long?

66
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:29,107
I will stop by somewhere briefly.

67
00:09:29,107 --> 00:09:31,827
Prince Seonghyeon will be here soon.

68
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:33,187
Where are you going?

69
00:09:33,187 --> 00:09:36,127
Because your son is facing trouble,

70
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:39,147
you are not going to him, are you?

71
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:43,527
The Chief Secretary cannot even handle his son.

72
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:46,947
If Prince Seonghyeon found out,
he will not be able to live

73
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:48,887
even if he is the Chief Secretary's son.

74
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:50,647
Say that again!

75
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:52,177
Your Excellency.

76
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:56,037
I think he is here.

77
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:02,917
Arrest everyone!

78
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:19,387
Thanks to you, I took a nice trip to the border.

79
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:20,817
What the hell are you saying?

80
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:22,907
You said even sworn enemies

81
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:26,387
should greet each other properly.

82
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:31,087
Are you mocking me right now?

83
00:10:35,497 --> 00:10:40,247
I no longer have any guilt or empathy

84
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:44,157
for you because of the past.

85
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:48,537
Soldiers!

86
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:56,027
Take this traitor away!

87
00:10:56,027 --> 00:10:57,707
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

88
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:59,137
Let go.

89
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:01,267
Let go. Let go of me.

90
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,067
How dare you!

91
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:04,607
Prince Gyeongseong, you bastard.

92
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:07,097
Let go! Let go of me!

93
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:08,687
Let go!

94
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:10,807
Let go, you bastards!

95
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:13,287
Let go. Let go!

96
00:11:21,337 --> 00:11:23,387
Prince Gyeongseong...

97
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,387
It really is you, right?

98
00:11:34,337 --> 00:11:36,557
This isn't a dream, right?

99
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:48,547
I came to believe in miracles.

100
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:50,997
I knew you'd come back.

101
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:55,627
Thank you for staying alive.

102
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:06,277
What took you so long?

103
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:14,457
It is not fun if the male lead
comes back too easily.

104
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:22,127
<i>♫ Like the moonlight that is
absorbing into you right now ♫</i>

105
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:33,157
<i>♫ I will become someone
who illuminates your heart ♫</i>

106
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:35,197
Father, Mother!

107
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:36,567
- Sun Chaek!
- Sun Chaek!

108
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,777
- Sun Chaek!
- Brothers!

109
00:12:38,777 --> 00:12:41,147
- Sun Chaek!
- I thought I would never see you.

110
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:43,747
We are okay now.

111
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:51,577
You went through a lot because
of your foolish father.

112
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:54,937
Thank you.

113
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:56,877
I am sorry about what you went through.

114
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,687
Are you all right?

115
00:12:58,687 --> 00:13:03,437
I am so happy to see that everyone is all right.

116
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:06,247
We are basically a family now.

117
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:08,307
That is right. Yes.

118
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:12,737
Let us have you return home.

119
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:14,517
Home... Home...

120
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:16,557
Let us go.

121
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:21,007
Go home and wait for me.

122
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:23,107
Where are you going now?

123
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:25,047
I need to stop by somewhere.

124
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:28,747
I need to see this through.

125
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:42,697
Your Majesty.

126
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:46,237
Bring a physician!

127
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,327
Will he recover?

128
00:13:59,327 --> 00:14:03,777
He was exposed to highly toxic
incense for a long time.

129
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:08,327
It will take a long time for him
to detox completely.

130
00:14:10,227 --> 00:14:11,887
Your Majesty.

131
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:16,397
Are you awake?

132
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:23,287
I am sure they said you were dead.

133
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:26,107
Are you back as a ghost?

134
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:29,867
I almost died, but I made it back alive.

135
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:37,527
I cannot believe it. I cannot.

136
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:42,157
You resented me in the past.

137
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:47,787
That is why you are visiting me
even after your death. You!

138
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,427
Your Majesty.

139
00:14:58,257 --> 00:15:01,057
Your Majesty.

140
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,557
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

141
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,747
I am sorry.

142
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,227
I am sorry.

143
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:16,697
I-I am sorry.

144
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:19,817
I... I...

145
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:25,267
I took your mother's life away

146
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:27,897
and I put...

147
00:15:27,897 --> 00:15:31,127
blood on your hands. I did.

148
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:32,827
I am sorry.

149
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:36,157
Please... Please spare me this once.

150
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:38,827
P-Please spare me this once.

151
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:41,397
T-This once.

152
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:43,017
Prince Gyeongseong.

153
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:46,037
<i>Spare him.</i>

154
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:48,687
<i>I will do anything you want me to do, Uncle.</i>

155
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:52,337
<i>Please. Please spare him this once.</i>

156
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:55,507
Spare me this once, Prince Gyeongseong.

157
00:15:55,507 --> 00:16:00,027
This once. Spare me this once.

158
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:18,867
Where are you going in such a hurry?

159
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:22,297
Are you running away by chance?

160
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,827
What are you saying?

161
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:30,237
What else could I be saying?

162
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:42,927
- Arrest her.
- Yes, sir.

163
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:47,467
Let go of me! Let go of me!

164
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:48,947
Let go! Let go!

165
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:51,557
Do Hwa Seon! Do Hwa Seon!

166
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:55,097
Let go of me! I did nothing wrong!

167
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,147
Let go of me!

168
00:16:57,157 --> 00:17:00,857
- Do Hwa Seon, you...
- She's still talking down to me.

169
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:02,467
Bye.

170
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:04,357
Let go!

171
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,857
I-I think there is a misunderstanding.

172
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:18,757
This is a misunderstanding!

173
00:17:18,757 --> 00:17:22,957
Prince Seonghyeon. Please bring Prince Seonghyeon!

174
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:48,957
Because of old grudges from the past,

175
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:52,267
I also have not been able to look
upon the King favorably.

176
00:17:53,297 --> 00:17:57,397
I have no choice, even if you call me
an old lady in the back room.

177
00:17:57,397 --> 00:18:00,147
But seeing the bloodshed in the Palace again,

178
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:03,547
I need to make a decision.

179
00:18:05,757 --> 00:18:09,117
For the sake of the country in crisis...

180
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:12,397
and the faltering King,

181
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,907
I want you to step up, Prince Gyeongseong.

182
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:26,487
I will also contribute the support
needed for that process.

183
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:53,027
<i>Can I dare ask you to be my friend?</i>

184
00:18:53,027 --> 00:18:55,387
<i>I would like to see you often.</i>

185
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:57,677
<i>It feels like a dream.</i>

186
00:18:57,677 --> 00:19:00,287
<i>I have a friend now.</i>

187
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:24,397
Make it quick if you have something to say.

188
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,887
For a very long time,

189
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:31,267
I've been fond of you.

190
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:33,667
Because...

191
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,887
you were my shining female lead.

192
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:42,207
<i>I thought I had no one,</i>

193
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,747
<i>but I had made a true friend.</i>

194
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,247
So, I was happy.

195
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:55,307
You are determined to turn me into a bad person.

196
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:02,847
That is your problem, My Lady.

197
00:20:02,847 --> 00:20:06,787
You only care about your feelings,
and you cannot read the air.

198
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:11,057
Yes, because I can't read the air,

199
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:15,027
I really believed you wanted to be my friend.

200
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:17,707
I was happy and...

201
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:21,177
I had opened up to you about things
I couldn't with no one else.

202
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,517
And I was nosy for no reason.

203
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,107
And then...

204
00:20:29,237 --> 00:20:31,807
I almost drowned to death.

205
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:36,427
I thought someone else was the culprit

206
00:20:38,627 --> 00:20:41,547
and got kidnapped without anyone
knowing and almost died.

207
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:45,037
You kept surviving amazingly every time.

208
00:20:48,787 --> 00:20:50,597
Since when...

209
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:53,607
did you change so much?

210
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:56,487
You haven't always been like this.

211
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:59,647
I never changed.

212
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:03,047
I have always been the same. But...

213
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:07,557
I changed things up since you barged into my life.

214
00:21:09,187 --> 00:21:11,687
It was my fault in the end.

215
00:21:14,177 --> 00:21:16,177
I'm sorry...

216
00:21:16,177 --> 00:21:18,817
for barging into your story.

217
00:21:21,437 --> 00:21:27,557
But hurting others is never acceptable
under any circumstances.

218
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:31,707
Please admit your wrongdoing and stop now.

219
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,097
Why should I stop?

220
00:21:35,097 --> 00:21:39,537
As I watched you easily achieve
something that requires a lifetime effort

221
00:21:39,537 --> 00:21:41,877
with a smile,

222
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:44,757
do you know how miserable I felt?

223
00:21:44,757 --> 00:21:48,997
You're wrong. Not a single moment was easy for me.

224
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:52,917
Do you only pity yourself and
think others have it easy?

225
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:54,547
Do not try to lecture me.

226
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:58,147
Someone who tries to hurt others out of envy

227
00:21:59,147 --> 00:22:01,977
doesn't deserve to be the lead character.

228
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:11,167
Because you'll no longer be
cheered on by the people you love.

229
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:25,367
Why do you...

230
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,457
Why do you keep...

231
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:31,317
saying such strange things?

232
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:34,577
Might as well strangle me or kill me.

233
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:37,397
Just make up your mind!

234
00:23:04,705 --> 00:23:07,045
Confess what you tried to do

235
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:10,845
by forming the Heuksa Clan!

236
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:13,075
Heuksa Clan?

237
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:15,345
What are you talking about?

238
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:20,995
You are the one who mocked
and deceived His Majesty!

239
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:36,475
Ever so kindly, this man whom you sent

240
00:23:36,475 --> 00:23:38,485
confessed to everything.

241
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,625
My Lord,

242
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,425
my apologies.

243
00:23:42,425 --> 00:23:44,295
I do not know him.

244
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:46,055
My Lord.

245
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:48,155
Come on.

246
00:23:48,155 --> 00:23:51,125
Why are you trying to frame me like this?

247
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,775
You dare cast out a man who
sacrificed himself for your cause?

248
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:57,515
What right do you have
to stand up there and ask?

249
00:23:57,515 --> 00:24:00,075
<i>I told him to do it.</i>

250
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:24,805
This is why you tried to cover my eyes and ears.

251
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:27,485
The ones who had a deep and dark desire

252
00:24:27,555 --> 00:24:32,155
to betray me by my side for a long time were...

253
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:34,955
You bastards were the ones.

254
00:24:37,905 --> 00:24:42,995
However, if you confess to your crime now,

255
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:46,615
for the first and last time,

256
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:49,465
I will spare your life.

257
00:24:49,465 --> 00:24:55,025
I will not punish your children, either.

258
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:01,695
Your Majesty,

259
00:25:01,695 --> 00:25:03,935
I fell for Prince Seonghyeon's sweet talk

260
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,985
and committed an unforgivable sin.

261
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:09,785
Please kill me.

262
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:14,865
I also foolishly participated
in achieving the wrong cause.

263
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:19,865
Prince Seonghyeon also framed
the Chief State Minister for treason.

264
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:21,775
He is right.

265
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:24,025
He tried to cut out Your Majesty's

266
00:25:24,025 --> 00:25:27,925
eyes, ears, hands, and feet.

267
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:30,745
Please kill me.

268
00:25:30,745 --> 00:25:34,175
<i>Please kill us.</i>

269
00:25:34,175 --> 00:25:38,995
I should behead all of you

270
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,415
and destroy three generations of your families,

271
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,015
but since the leader was revealed,

272
00:25:45,015 --> 00:25:47,025
I will keep my promise.

273
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:52,005
However, other than your lives being spared,

274
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:56,995
do not expect to be forgiven in other ways.

275
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,245
How despicable.

276
00:26:03,255 --> 00:26:06,195
Who is forgiving whom?

277
00:26:06,995 --> 00:26:10,335
You took the throne by killing your family.

278
00:26:10,355 --> 00:26:13,075
Did you expect to become a sage king?

279
00:26:13,925 --> 00:26:18,205
You are not a king. You are an animal!

280
00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:20,985
You bastard!

281
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:33,075
This bastard...

282
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:35,175
Cut his head off immediately.

283
00:26:35,175 --> 00:26:36,875
Right now!

284
00:26:40,595 --> 00:26:42,495
What are you doing?

285
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:51,875
I cannot follow that order, Your Majesty.

286
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,495
What?

287
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:58,555
Please do not repeat the same wrongdoing.

288
00:26:58,555 --> 00:27:01,175
One's nature never changes.

289
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:04,355
You expect an animal to forgive?

290
00:27:04,355 --> 00:27:07,775
A dog passing by would laugh.

291
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,165
You bastard. You bastard!

292
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:21,115
You cannot, Your Majesty! You cannot.

293
00:27:21,115 --> 00:27:23,085
Get out of the way!

294
00:27:23,085 --> 00:27:25,715
Move. I will kill that bastard-

295
00:27:25,715 --> 00:27:28,065
After you took the throne that way,

296
00:27:28,965 --> 00:27:32,045
have you felt at peace even for a day?

297
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,855
Once your life is stained in blood,

298
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:43,065
you cannot go back. I know it better than anyone.

299
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:47,595
Even if you struggle your whole life,

300
00:27:47,595 --> 00:27:50,745
it's a shackle you cannot escape!

301
00:27:54,035 --> 00:27:58,935
It will create another grudge that
will come back to haunt you.

302
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:09,415
Please end the cycle now

303
00:28:09,415 --> 00:28:12,055
and only look ahead, Your Majesty.

304
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:17,385
Please sleep soundly, even for a day, Your Majesty!

305
00:28:38,705 --> 00:28:40,805
Take care of the rest...

306
00:28:41,935 --> 00:28:44,185
however you want, Prince Gyeongseong.

307
00:28:56,855 --> 00:28:59,465
Where are you running off to?

308
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:01,405
I am not done talking!

309
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:02,975
You bastard!

310
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:06,925
I will rip him apart and kill him...

311
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:09,235
Let go. Let go of me.

312
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:10,685
Stop right there!

313
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:14,695
I need to tear that bastard apart.

314
00:29:14,695 --> 00:29:17,325
Everything is over.

315
00:29:17,325 --> 00:29:22,375
Do you want to live and die as his hunting dog?

316
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:26,795
That is what I chose to do.

317
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:33,565
You must pay for your choice as well.

318
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:35,405
It is unfair.

319
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:38,995
How could this world be like this?

320
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:41,935
I will rip all of you apart!

321
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:45,585
Let go! Let go! You bastards!

322
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,495
Let go! You bastards...

323
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:19,325
Go on and walk by.

324
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:23,005
Take me away now!

325
00:30:25,235 --> 00:30:27,755
Someone told me...

326
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:30,065
that revenge is...

327
00:30:30,065 --> 00:30:33,445
for the ones who cannot go back.

328
00:30:35,405 --> 00:30:39,405
That means you have a chance.

329
00:30:40,245 --> 00:30:43,795
A chance to turn your life around again.

330
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:48,385
I thought...

331
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:51,865
I should tell you this.

332
00:31:12,085 --> 00:31:14,115
Hold on.

333
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:19,145
I came to tell you something.

334
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:27,175
Please tell Prince Seonghyeon this.

335
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:32,835
"I understand your resentment.

336
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:38,205
But do not become like the one you hate."

337
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:41,695
I want you to move on from the past

338
00:31:41,695 --> 00:31:44,475
and find a new life.

339
00:31:46,215 --> 00:31:49,105
I hope my sincerity reaches you.

340
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:55,315
At least, I can tell you do not mean it.

341
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,385
"Gumaengjusan."

342
00:31:58,385 --> 00:32:01,275
I did not say that saying to you.

343
00:32:02,235 --> 00:32:04,735
You said it to me.

344
00:32:06,355 --> 00:32:09,655
Tell the actual person who told me that.

345
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:13,435
"This is not the end of me.

346
00:32:14,405 --> 00:32:16,875
I will make sure to come back."

347
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:19,895
Tell her that.

348
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:54,015
What a nice day,

349
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:55,985
Lady Sun Chaek.

350
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:14,315
You proved yourself to be a true fan.

351
00:33:14,315 --> 00:33:15,795
I admit it.

352
00:33:15,795 --> 00:33:18,435
Thank you for giving me the chance.

353
00:33:18,435 --> 00:33:23,645
Are you sure you won't regret staying here?

354
00:33:23,645 --> 00:33:26,165
Even if you reach the ending

355
00:33:26,165 --> 00:33:28,685
and this world ends?

356
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:09,555
What do you think?

357
00:34:09,555 --> 00:34:11,355
Do you like it?

358
00:34:13,525 --> 00:34:17,955
It seems like spring has arrived
in Hoseondang, Wife.

359
00:34:18,895 --> 00:34:21,475
Why do you talk like that?

360
00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:26,565
And "Wife"? Calling me that...

361
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:31,275
I love it so much,

362
00:34:31,275 --> 00:34:33,325
Dear Husband.

363
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:45,195
We should have a wedding before spring comes.

364
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:47,575
- Wedding?
- Yes.

365
00:34:47,575 --> 00:34:51,315
We need to announce that
we are officially married.

366
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:54,855
- If we rush it, we can-
- Hold on.

367
00:34:54,855 --> 00:35:00,295
Don't you think the wedding could wait?

368
00:35:00,295 --> 00:35:03,025
Is there an issue?

369
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:05,265
<i>The ending.</i>

370
00:35:05,265 --> 00:35:07,505
<i>Everything concludes...</i>

371
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,875
<i>when you reach the ending.</i>

372
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:12,995
To be honest,

373
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:15,935
there's something I didn't get to tell you.

374
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:18,165
Do you have a secret lover?

375
00:35:18,165 --> 00:35:21,595
Or a secret child?

376
00:35:21,595 --> 00:35:23,365
I do not care about things like that.

377
00:35:23,365 --> 00:35:26,615
N-No, it's not like that.

378
00:35:29,815 --> 00:35:33,105
It's something even more unbelievable.

379
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:46,945
What is it, Father?

380
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:05,255
You will be repenting your
wrongdoings starting now.

381
00:36:05,255 --> 00:36:07,885
Please straighten your back.

382
00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:13,955
- Gosh...
- Father, do it properly.

383
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:18,775
You know I have a bad back.

384
00:36:18,775 --> 00:36:23,895
You will start the silence training, too.

385
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,825
You are being too harsh to your father.

386
00:36:27,825 --> 00:36:30,805
Who do you think I take after?

387
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:34,695
You lost your composure. We will start all over.

388
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,845
[Do not enter

389
00:36:51,035 --> 00:36:55,955
I am back to being alone with nothing.

390
00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:15,325
I hope we catch 10 sea bream.

391
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:19,645
Sea bream is not in season.

392
00:37:20,485 --> 00:37:22,745
I-Is that so?

393
00:37:22,745 --> 00:37:26,965
What would you like to catch, then?

394
00:37:28,565 --> 00:37:32,215
I want to catch crayfish and cry.

395
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:38,455
Cray. Cry.

396
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:16,705
<i>So, we are inside a novel,</i>

397
00:38:24,545 --> 00:38:27,705
you came from a different world,

398
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,325
and if this story ends,

399
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:32,795
this world will disappear?

400
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,395
Yes.

401
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:39,475
And romance novels like this...

402
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:42,065
usually end when the lead characters marry.

403
00:38:42,065 --> 00:38:45,865
That is the reason you want to delay the wedding?

404
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,025
To prevent this world from disappearing?

405
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:02,395
Do you expect me to believe that?

406
00:39:05,365 --> 00:39:08,135
I know it's hard to believe.

407
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:10,405
But it's true.

408
00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:14,925
I want to be with you forever.

409
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:18,385
But I'm afraid that decision will result

410
00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:22,465
in this world disappearing and tear us apart.

411
00:39:39,185 --> 00:39:42,445
Whether you are the real Cha Sun Chaek or not,

412
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:45,685
I do not care.

413
00:39:49,915 --> 00:39:52,805
<i>Because you captured my heart</i>

414
00:39:52,805 --> 00:39:55,615
<i>by being audacious like no one else,</i>

415
00:39:55,615 --> 00:39:59,095
<i>my life completely changed.</i>

416
00:39:59,915 --> 00:40:03,225
<i>Through you, I realized fate is</i>

417
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:05,935
<i>a miracle created by strong desires.</i>

418
00:40:06,815 --> 00:40:09,975
<i>- No!
- Move!</i>

419
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:13,615
<i>I put my life that felt like
a punishment behind me</i>

420
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:18,255
<i>and started to dream of my future with you.</i>

421
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:25,495
<i>All of this was possible because you came to me.</i>

422
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:28,865
<i>You saved me...</i>

423
00:40:30,035 --> 00:40:32,035
<i>and changed me.</i>

424
00:40:37,555 --> 00:40:39,765
So, from now on,

425
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:42,115
my trust and common sense

426
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:46,095
only dwell with you standing in front of me.

427
00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:49,255
Prince Gyeongseong.

428
00:40:49,255 --> 00:40:51,885
Even if this world disappears,

429
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:56,855
I choose to be with you.

430
00:40:56,855 --> 00:41:00,975
If I can be with you,

431
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:04,695
I won't be afraid even if everything ends.

432
00:41:06,075 --> 00:41:08,255
At this very moment,

433
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:13,865
I'll only look at you, my most precious one.

Aigoo, no one here wants to buy a wedding gift.

439

We have some hot meat and delicious wine.

444
00:41:59,515 --> 00:42:03,335
I already had plenty of meat and wine.

00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:04,925
What are you doing?

446
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:06,715
Lay out the straw mat.

00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:08,325
Yes.

448
00:42:10,505 --> 00:42:14,235
All right, all right. Since we want to digest,

449
00:42:14,235 --> 00:42:17,415
let us lie down here

450
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:19,665
and rest a bit.

451
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:22,145
Aigoo, sit down, sit down.

452
00:42:23,175 --> 00:42:25,555
Come on now.

453
00:42:25,555 --> 00:42:28,665
It is better to lie down inside.

454
00:42:29,865 --> 00:42:31,615
Gosh, brothers!

455
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:34,165
Please use your muscles.

456
00:42:34,165 --> 00:42:35,525
I know.

457
00:42:35,525 --> 00:42:38,065
Use your head if you do not have muscles.

458
00:42:38,065 --> 00:42:41,275
What if I can't get married
because of my brothers?

459
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:42,545
That cannot be.

460
00:42:42,545 --> 00:42:43,965
Father, Father.

461
00:42:43,965 --> 00:42:46,405
The gift carrier needs to come in.

462
00:42:46,405 --> 00:42:49,585
This will take all night at this rate.

463
00:42:49,585 --> 00:42:51,045
Father.

464
00:42:51,045 --> 00:42:53,985
We need our secret weapon.

465
00:42:53,985 --> 00:42:56,175
Secret weapon?

466
00:42:58,155 --> 00:42:59,945
No, no...

467
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,505
Father.

468
00:43:04,355 --> 00:43:05,965
Please.

469
00:43:12,415 --> 00:43:15,725
Come inside now.

470
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:20,165
The Cha family had this wine for generations.

471
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:25,125
It is a 30-year-old mountain ginseng wine.

472
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:29,535
M-Mountain ginseng...

473
00:43:33,855 --> 00:43:38,615
W-We will not be tricked
by a mountain ginseng wine.

474
00:43:42,645 --> 00:43:43,795
How about...

475
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:49,325
a cocktail made with mountain ginseng wine?

476
00:43:49,325 --> 00:43:50,465
Cocktail?

477
00:43:50,555 --> 00:43:54,755
If you come inside, you will be able to try

478
00:43:54,785 --> 00:43:58,915
the famous cocktail immediately.

479
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:05,805
C-Cocktail? M-Me?

480
00:44:07,265 --> 00:44:11,225
Yes, yes. I-I am coming. Cocktail...

481
00:44:11,225 --> 00:44:14,635
Yes, let us go in. Let us go.

482
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:16,915
Come on in.

483
00:44:20,315 --> 00:44:24,035
For Prince Gyeongseong and
Cha Sun Chaek to live happily ever after

484
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:27,035
and for everyone's longevity.

485
00:44:27,035 --> 00:44:28,705
Cheers!

486
00:44:28,705 --> 00:44:31,735
<i>Cheers!</i>

487
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:35,765
We will create a wave starting from the right.

488
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:39,145
If anyone refuses to do it,

489
00:44:39,145 --> 00:44:41,635
we will start from the top.

490
00:44:41,635 --> 00:44:44,495
All right. Start.

491
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:11,955
<i>♫ I thought I was dreaming,

<i>♫ Daydream is like a fairytale ♫</i>

493
00:45:14,485 --> 00:45:17,385
All right. Let us start.

494
00:45:19,695 --> 00:45:22,355
Brother-in-law, I have no ill feelings.

495
00:45:22,355 --> 00:45:25,735
This is good for your vitality.

496
00:45:25,735 --> 00:45:27,195
First beating!

497
00:45:27,195 --> 00:45:29,255
First beating!

498
00:45:30,255 --> 00:45:34,705
This is good for blood circulation.

499
00:45:34,705 --> 00:45:36,345
Second beating!

500
00:45:36,345 --> 00:45:37,655
No...

501
00:45:37,655 --> 00:45:39,695
- Gosh.
- Go easy. Easy.

502
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,915
This opens your eyes wide.

503
00:45:42,915 --> 00:45:44,385
Third beating!

504
00:45:44,385 --> 00:45:47,375
Third beating!

505
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:50,805
We will beat you as much as we love you.

506
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:05,315
Stop beating him, brothers!

507
00:46:05,315 --> 00:46:07,105
He barely managed to make it back alive.

508
00:46:07,105 --> 00:46:10,145
What if he dies again?

509
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:13,385
Sun Chaek, sit back just for today.

510
00:46:13,385 --> 00:46:14,755
Yes, Sun Chaek.

511
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:18,555
This is good for your husband.

512
00:46:18,555 --> 00:46:21,865
Sun Chaek, people do not die so easily.

513
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:24,605
Do you really think so?

514
00:46:25,605 --> 00:46:29,285
You beat me 35 times in total so far.

515
00:46:29,285 --> 00:46:33,055
Have you been keeping count?

516
00:46:33,055 --> 00:46:35,215
The more you hit me,

517
00:46:35,215 --> 00:46:39,165
the more you will see me privately.

518
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:44,585
I plan to live a long life, thanks to you.

519
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:49,585
Let us meet up often... often...

520
00:46:49,585 --> 00:46:53,445
often for a long time.

521
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,025
What are you doing? Put him down.

522
00:46:58,765 --> 00:47:00,815
Does it hurt a lot?

523
00:47:07,808 --> 00:47:10,048
You know, Prince Seonghyeon.

524
00:47:12,078 --> 00:47:14,988
I heard the boat he was on

525
00:47:14,988 --> 00:47:19,098
headed for exile caught in a storm and sank.

526
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:28,088
That also...

527
00:47:28,088 --> 00:47:31,218
must be the ending Prince Seonghyeon chose.

528
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:37,938
What do you think my ending would be like, then?

529
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:42,498
After seeing how you made a big
decision regarding Prince Seonghyeon,

530
00:47:43,478 --> 00:47:48,688
I became curious about the world you will create.

531
00:48:19,738 --> 00:48:21,868
However...

532
00:48:21,868 --> 00:48:25,268
I will put down that sword...

533
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:27,498
going forward.

534
00:48:37,278 --> 00:48:42,358
I am not sure if I have told you this before.

535
00:48:46,618 --> 00:48:52,988
I inflicted an unbearable wound on you as a child.

536
00:48:52,988 --> 00:48:55,138
I am truly sorry.

537
00:48:56,178 --> 00:48:58,748
This is my apology as your uncle.

538
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:53,848
So pretty.

539
00:49:53,848 --> 00:49:55,198
My Lady!

540
00:49:55,198 --> 00:49:58,048
My Lady is so pretty.

541
00:50:04,228 --> 00:50:06,278
So pretty.

542
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:17,098
So beautiful!

543
00:50:30,408 --> 00:50:32,138
So handsome...

544
