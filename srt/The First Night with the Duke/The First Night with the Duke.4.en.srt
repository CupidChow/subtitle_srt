1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,890
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,590
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,990
[Episode 4: We need Cha Sun Chaek.*]
(Means "Plan B")

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,850
[Two hours before the fire]

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,890
<i>- Bottoms up!
- Drink!</i>

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,730
Here's the penalty drink. The penalty drink.

7
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,410
Please pass this on.

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,760
- Drink it.
- I drank too much.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,760
<i>♫ Here comes the alcohol ♫</i>

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,240
<i>♫ Here comes the alcohol ♫</i>

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,800
<i>♫ Drink up, drink up, drink up ♫</i>

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,800
<i>♫ How long will you make me dance? ♫</i>

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,550
<i>♫ Look at my shoulders ♫</i>

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,260
<i>I'm drunk, but I can feel it.</i>

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,400
<i>Prince Gyeongseong is so embarrassed of me.</i>

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,250
<i>No men would like it</i>

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,290
<i>when his fiancée acts like this.</i>

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,580
Well done.

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,080
What is that?

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,770
- What is that?
- What is that?

21
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,380
This is a new game that I created

22
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,640
just for the Seonmun Club.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,630
Removing a wooden block...

24
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,830
without making the tower fall

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,570
is the first rule.

26
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,640
And ask the question that's written on the back

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,780
of the block to the person who's on your right.

28
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,280
The one who was asked the question
will have to give an answer.

29
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,540
My Lady, I am about to lose my arm.

30
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,850
What will you do with all these?

31
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,210
It's too many for the Yoot game.

32
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,000
This is a game device that's as groundbreaking

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,930
as my cocktail-making skills.

34
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,070
Looks like you are all
about entertainment these days.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,910
Gosh, how vulgar.

36
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,980
What is with all these questions?

37
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,850
Considering they are Confucians,
I'm going easy on them.

38
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,300
What happens if one cannot

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,540
answer the question?

40
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,800
There is a penalty drink.

41
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,300
The penalty drink is made with

42
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,750
the notoriously strong hongsoju.

43
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,280
It's more than just a penalty drink.

44
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,050
It's basically a poison.

45
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,920
You will have to answer, then.

46
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,410
That makes this game...

47
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,430
This... merriment...

48
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,280
so entertaining.

49
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,780
Okay, let's decide on the order, then.

50
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,820
Gosh.

51
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,610
Lady Eun Ae, please start.

52
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,250
It's not hard. Don't be nervous.

53
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,740
Okay.

54
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,030
What is the question?

55
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,360
"Your lover...

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,090
turned into a bug.

57
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,680
Would you save it or kill it?"

58
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,090
<i>Prince Gyeongseong ended up with that question.</i>

59
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,980
Prince Gyeongseong, please answer.

60
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,330
My lover turned into a bug.

61
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,380
That would never happen.

62
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,010
It is just imagination.

63
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,430
How pathetic.

64
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,040
I am only reading the question.

65
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,210
I have no reason to answer such a useless question.

66
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,510
I think the questions in this merriment

67
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,480
- start with, "What if"-
- There is no what if.

68
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,210
Because my lover will never turn into a bug.

69
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,500
You have to drink the penalty drink, then.

70
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,860
Are you giving me an order now?

71
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,770
Gosh, I shouldn't have prepared this.

72
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,310
I will drink this penalty drink.

73
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,540
Are you okay, Maiden Sun Chaek?

74
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,400
Come on now.

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,320
It's just a merriment.

76
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,110
I think we should stop now.

77
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,880
I did not say I will not participate.

78
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,540
[What is the color
of the underwear you are wearing?]

79
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,690
<i>So cold.</i>

80
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,970
<i>Something as sharp as ice in a highball</i>

81
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,650
<i>flew and pierced me.</i>

82
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,330
When was your last kiss?

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,830
<i>Was there a question like that?</i>

84
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,460
<i>Did Bang Wool write that?</i>

85
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,740
Are you not ready to answer?

86
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,930
Are you refusing to answer

87
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,110
or can you not?

88
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,150
What do you mean I cannot answer?

89
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,150
I will answer.

90
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,850
I...

91
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,800
have never kissed anyone
since the moment I was born.

92
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,880
How could a daughter of a nobleman

93
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,880
dare to make my lips available?

94
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,880
- What was that, then?
- Pardon?

95
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,580
The thing we did together the other night-

96
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,490
What nonsense are you spewing right now?

97
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,820
Nonsense?

98
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
What are you imagining?

99
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,250
I just...

100
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,000
wanted to talk about the promise
we made the other night.

101
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,290
There will be a wedding soon?

102
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,520
Mother!

103
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,910
Why are you making a fuss at this late hour?

104
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,450
Something terrible happened.

105
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,320
- Something terrible?
- We received...

106
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,930
a wedding proposal at our house.

107
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,700
What are you saying out of the blue?

108
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,080
To avoid misunderstanding,

109
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,040
I will make something clear now.

110
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,130
I, Prince Gyeongseong, Yi Beon...

111
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,380
am planning to...

112
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,530
marry Maiden Cha Sun Chaek.

113
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,030
Maiden, what is he talking about?

114
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,030
T-That's not it...

115
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,800
Lady Eun Ae.

116
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,320
Give me water...

117
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,980
- Water. Water.
- Water, please.

118
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,350
Water. Water.

119
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,120
Maiden Eun Ae.

120
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,480
<i>I brought that to make a peach cocktail.</i>

121
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,550
<i>Is she allergic to peach, by chance?</i>

122
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,530
What a splendid hazing ceremony.

123
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,640
You surely are qualified to be my bride.

124
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,740
You...

125
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,640
must be crazy.

126
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,010
I am crazy...

127
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,920
for Cha Sun Chaek.

128
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,120
<i>This can never happen.</i>

129
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,110
I want to hear a good reason.

130
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,760
My daughter is not ready to get married yet.

131
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,100
<i>What a twist.</i>

132
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,090
<i>I didn't expect a response like this.</i>

133
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,570
I said she already took my virginity away.

134
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,210
She can live with me for the rest of her life, then.

135
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,680
It sounds like you do not care if she

136
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,850
remains unwed for the rest of her life.

137
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,580
<i>He's so blindly obsessed.</i>

138
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,790
Not just one but three of Sun Chaek's
older brothers have not married.

139
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,400
They need to get married first.

140
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,290
I do not think

141
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,990
it would be too late for her
to get married afterward.

142
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,610
<i>I didn't think my brothers could be my shield.</i>

143
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,250
But do you not think...

144
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,780
her opinion matters the most?

145
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,300
Yes, Sun Chaek. You tell me.

146
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,660
Do you really want to marry him, too?

147
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,530
I...

148
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,020
<i>Say you don't want to.</i>

149
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,560
<i>Why are you hesitating?</i>

150
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,070
<i>Are you wavering, by chance?</i>

151
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,680
<i>Even so, I can't get married now.</i>

152
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
Sun Chaek.

153
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,700
I will just...

154
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,870
do what you want me to do, Father.

155
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,340
I do not know how My Lord has come to

156
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,510
hold something over my daughter's head-

157
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,740
Hold something over her head?

158
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,420
I think you are very mistaken.

159
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,510
She is the one who holds something over my head.

160
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,990
What do you mean by that?

161
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,030
The one who kissed me first that night

162
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,130
was your daughter.

163
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,260
Sun Chaek...

164
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,740
Hyungnim, you need to stay alert.

165
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,000
Do you want to hear more?

166
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,630
Stop!

167
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,180
Please stop.

168
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,890
What are you saying in front of my parents?

169
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,390
I want to ask if you still oppose it.

170
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,790
Actually, the biggest reason for me...

171
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,920
is something else.

172
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,310
I do not...

173
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,670
want my daughter to join the royal family.

174
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,030
I want my Sun Chaek...

175
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,250
to marry into a very ordinary family.

176
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:16,220
Since I made myself clear to you,

177
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,410
I will go back inside.

178
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,050
You should go inside, too.

179
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,500
Yes.

180
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,480
My Lady, let's go.

181
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,570
Talk to me for a moment.

182
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,300
Spare us.

183
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,450
It is not that we did not want to get married.

184
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,680
T-That is right. It is rather we could not...

185
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,910
You must be so proud.

186
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,070
- H-Hyungnim.
- Calm down. It is okay.

187
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,440
I do not think...

188
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,390
it is right for you to get involved...

189
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,870
in our family business.

190
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,060
You are the biggest problem.

191
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,260
This is what is wrong with the scholars.

192
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,950
They get absorbed in their studies
and avoid reality.

193
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,670
Do not get in the way of your sister's future

194
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,980
and be gone now.

195
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,950
Spare me!

196
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,700
Spare me.

197
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,560
I will generously give you two months.

198
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,310
Find your marriage prospects within that time

199
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,000
and get married.

200
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,980
We could not do it our whole lives.
How could we suddenly-

201
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,520
I am being as patient as I can be.

202
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,820
After that,

203
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,970
even I do not know how I would get rid of you.

204
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,580
I noticed you have been strange lately.

205
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,710
What do I do with you?

206
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,910
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,750
Bring me a knife.

208
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,060
- Madam.
- Hurry.

209
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,520
<i>Yes. I can't get married with a shaved head.</i>

210
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,400
<i>Nice.</i>

211
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,460
I will do what you want me to do, Mother.

212
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,450
Mother.

213
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,520
I will let you cut it if you want.

214
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,020
It is okay.

215
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,400
To be honest, I am on board.

216
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,830
Pardon?

217
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,900
I want Prince Gyeongseong as my son-in-law.

218
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,480
There are scary rumors about him

219
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,830
and as Father said, my brothers
should take time to get married

220
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:20,340
and I should marry into an ordinary family.

221
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,190
Wouldn't that make me happy?

222
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,790
According to my life experience,

223
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,710
men are all about their looks.

224
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,000
It is possible to lose power and wealth.

225
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,910
But one's appearance does not change.

226
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,090
They say if you live with a handsome man,

227
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,530
your anger naturally goes away.

228
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,790
I could not have one myself,

229
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,130
but I hope you do.

230
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,200
M-Mother.

231
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,880
And I think this is a great chance to get

232
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,490
your brothers married at once, too.

233
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,060
<i>Has she always been like this?</i>

234
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,870
<i>She's nothing like what I expected.</i>

235
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,060
Prince Bokyang's son is a child of a concubine.

236
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,670
That makes Beon the perfect candidate.

237
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,690
To make that happen,

238
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,110
you must step forward.

239
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,430
Be ambitious.

240
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,870
For our Beon's sake.

241
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,190
I married you in order to do this.

242
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,450
But I...

243
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,130
You must strike first.

244
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,150
If you cannot do it,

245
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,450
I will do it.

246
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,640
They say a man and wife are one in body and soul.

247
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,440
Are you on the same page as her, Hyungnim?

248
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,910
You are mistaken.

249
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,280
You know.

250
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,120
I am not interested in the throne at all.

251
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,990
Spare me.

252
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,930
I will go somewhere far away with my son

253
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,080
and become reclusive

254
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,520
so no one sees us. Please.

255
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,430
I am not sure.

256
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,080
I cannot believe what humans say.

257
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,200
No!

258
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,660
S-Spare him.

259
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,730
Please let my father live.

260
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,320
I will do anything you want me to do, Uncle.

261
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,550
Please. Please spare him this once.

262
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,600
Really?

263
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,820
No matter what that might be?

264
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,560
Can you swing that sword for me?

265
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:45,540
<i>I ended up getting blood on my hands.</i>

266
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,670
<i>To survive.</i>

267
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,910
I am sorry.

268
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:05,210
Because I am so weak...

269
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,470
I could not protect you.

270
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,560
I hope...

271
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,850
you will...

272
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,920
no longer...

273
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,180
be in pain.

274
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,790
<i>A life where family point
their swords at each other.</i>

275
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,140
<i>I wanted to put an end to it.</i>

276
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,770
<i>But...</i>

277
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,430
<i>To be honest, I know everything.</i>

278
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,690
<i>The secrets you keep.</i>

279
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,710
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

280
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,430
<i>You did nothing wrong.</i>

281
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,600
If she got to meet her,

282
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,750
she would have liked her a lot.

283
00:23:16,735 --> 00:23:21,115
<i>Your Highness, it is my wish. Please.</i>

284
00:23:23,765 --> 00:23:26,775
Prince Gyeongseong already
has a woman he wants to marry.

285
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:28,675
But he has not married her yet.

286
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:31,045
Do you not have any self-respect?

287
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:32,415
I do not care.

288
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:35,155
I need to have Prince Gyeongseong, no matter what.

289
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:38,055
So, help me. Please?

290
00:23:38,055 --> 00:23:41,115
You are capable of doing so.

291
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:56,735
You have always told me that I resemble you

292
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,495
the most in the family.

293
00:23:59,495 --> 00:24:04,215
I rely on you more than my mother.

294
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:09,145
What is family?

295
00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:11,565
What is bloodline?

296
00:24:11,565 --> 00:24:14,135
Are you granting my request?

297
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:16,465
You are the best, Queen Mother.

298
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:23,125
Let me see.

299
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,905
If so...

300
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:33,855
This just won't come off.

301
00:24:35,255 --> 00:24:37,975
We got into a fight over drinks and even a fire.

302
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:40,365
Even the lead character can't handle

303
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:43,345
a ridiculous plot like this.

304
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:49,985
<i>I am worried about Sun Chaek. Should we go in?</i>

305
00:24:49,985 --> 00:24:51,165
<i>We cannot.</i>

306
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:52,765
<i>She is not feeling so well.</i>

307
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:53,985
<i>It is not a good time.</i>

308
00:24:53,985 --> 00:24:56,295
<i>But still, I am worried. Let us go in.</i>

309
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:58,595
Come on in.

310
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:09,435
We were just worried about you, Sun Chaek.

311
00:25:09,435 --> 00:25:11,695
This is all Prince Gyeongseong's fault.

312
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:15,205
You cannot marry against your will.

313
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:19,055
We will be sure to help you. Do not worry.

314
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:21,445
Even if P-Prince Gyeongseong barged in,

315
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:23,635
w-we will protect you.

316
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:25,505
T-The three of us...

317
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:28,755
can surely fight Prince Gyeongseong!

318
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:41,935
You are incredibly reassuring.

319
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:46,685
With all that ruckus yesterday,

320
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:48,375
take care of yourself first.

321
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:51,835
Yes. I heard everyone who was there is not well.

322
00:25:51,835 --> 00:25:54,755
<i>Right. Eun Ae.</i>

323
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:56,965
<i>I somehow feel bad.</i>

324
00:25:56,965 --> 00:25:59,275
<i>I wonder if she's okay.</i>

325
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:01,155
Brothers,

326
00:26:01,155 --> 00:26:04,775
I think I need to rest a bit.

327
00:26:17,265 --> 00:26:18,715
Are you ready to start the day, Father?

328
00:26:18,715 --> 00:26:20,585
Are you leaving now?

329
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:23,335
I went to bed late while reading last night.

330
00:26:23,335 --> 00:26:25,955
I heard there was a big fire last night.

331
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:29,535
They say the fire started where you
had your club meeting.

332
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:31,535
Am I misinformed?

333
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:35,165
I did not tell you in case you'd worry.

334
00:26:35,165 --> 00:26:38,455
- My apologies.
- You should behave differently in your position.

335
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:41,115
How much longer will you play around?

336
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:44,755
If I hear something shameful like this again,

337
00:26:44,755 --> 00:26:47,545
I will no longer ignore it.

338
00:26:47,545 --> 00:26:49,355
Do you understand?

339
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:54,435
I will be careful...

340
00:26:54,435 --> 00:26:58,095
as much as I can, so as not to worry you, Father.

341
00:26:58,095 --> 00:27:00,015
[Prince Gyeongseong is getting married? / What? ]

342
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:01,495
[With whom? / Is it true someone
holds something over him?]

343
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:02,565
[That is just ridiculous!]

344
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:03,755
[Will his wedding be a royal event? / It's a lie]

345
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,465
[How vulgar / I heard there's a reason]

346
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,685
That is her. That is her.

347
00:27:11,685 --> 00:27:13,185
Is that not the Chief State Minister's daughter?

348
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:14,915
They are getting married.

349
00:27:14,915 --> 00:27:16,835
<i>I'm jealous.</i>

350
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:19,925
I'm sorry!

351
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:21,265
My gosh.

352
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,485
Are you okay?

353
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:25,635
Did I hit him hard?

354
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:29,535
A foreigner?

355
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:31,155
Help...

356
00:27:31,155 --> 00:27:33,145
W-What did you say?

357
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:35,875
Help me...

358
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:38,275
Help!

359
00:27:39,385 --> 00:27:40,645
Help!

360
00:27:40,645 --> 00:27:44,265
Someone fell! Please help!

361
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:49,845
I'll use the CPR techniques
I learned in high school.

362
00:27:49,845 --> 00:27:51,425
Like this...

363
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:59,005
I'm hungry.

364
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:02,625
My stomach hurts.

365
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,235
Y-You're hungry?

366
00:28:04,235 --> 00:28:06,515
I'm hungry.

367
00:28:06,515 --> 00:28:09,425
Oh, you're hungry?

368
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:16,185
Delicious?

369
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:17,755
Korean soup.

370
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:19,025
So good.

371
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:20,665
I'm glad.

372
00:28:21,555 --> 00:28:22,775
- Ma'am!
- Yes.

373
00:28:22,775 --> 00:28:24,235
Another bowl, please.

374
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,515
Same order?

375
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:26,895
Yes.

376
00:28:31,255 --> 00:28:34,145
So, you got stranded because of a storm

377
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,355
and ended up here?

378
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:39,155
Yes. I had to go to Japan...

379
00:28:39,155 --> 00:28:42,025
but the ship I sailed on and the wave...

380
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:46,265
I see.

381
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:48,755
I'm so sorry, man.

382
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:52,165
What is your name?

383
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:54,895
My name is Mark. Mark.

384
00:28:54,895 --> 00:28:57,135
Mark. Mark?

385
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,585
I'm Sun Chaek.

386
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:00,895
Sun Chaek.

387
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:03,165
- Sun Chaek.
- Yes.

388
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:11,275
Sorry, you're having trouble ending up here.

389
00:29:11,275 --> 00:29:13,105
I was like that at first, too.

390
00:29:13,105 --> 00:29:16,475
"Where am I? Who am I?"

391
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,075
Mark, this must be meant to be.

392
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:24,105
I will buy you clothes.

393
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:26,165
- Really?
- Yes.

394
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,085
Lady Sun Chaek.

395
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:33,305
- Long time no see.
- Yes.

396
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:36,415
Are you looking for silk garments for your wedding

397
00:29:36,415 --> 00:29:37,735
with Prince Gyeongseong?

398
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,135
Pardon? Wedding?

399
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:40,585
Everyone in the capital is

400
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:45,415
saying you are Prince Gyeongseong's
fiancée right now.

401
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:47,965
For your wedding,

402
00:29:47,965 --> 00:29:50,455
please let me make your garments.

403
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,075
I will make you the best one.

404
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:58,515
I'm not shopping for myself today.

405
00:29:58,515 --> 00:30:02,495
M-Mark! Over here. Here, here.

406
00:30:03,495 --> 00:30:06,395
He's the one who needs clothes.

407
00:30:08,455 --> 00:30:09,955
What's wrong?

408
00:30:09,955 --> 00:30:13,545
I am a bit afraid of Westerners.

409
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:18,755
They say you can get an unknown disease, too.

410
00:30:18,755 --> 00:30:20,295
My gosh!

411
00:30:20,295 --> 00:30:23,685
They just look a bit different than us.

412
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:25,535
Have pity on him.

413
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:28,585
I'll be responsible if anything happens.

414
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:33,075
So, don't worry and make him one outfit.

415
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:35,845
Since it is your request,

416
00:30:35,845 --> 00:30:37,985
I will make an outfit, I suppose.

417
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:42,855
And could you find him a place to stay?

418
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:47,075
Yes, I will.

419
00:30:47,075 --> 00:30:48,655
Thank you.

420
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:52,615
Well, follow me. Follow me.

421
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,195
Thank you, Sun Chaek.

422
00:30:56,195 --> 00:30:58,015
You're welcome.

423
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:01,575
Yes, come on in.

424
00:31:01,575 --> 00:31:04,215
Now, I should get to it.

425
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:12,695
You came, Lady Sun Chaek.

426
00:31:12,695 --> 00:31:14,595
Is Lady Eun Ae inside?

427
00:31:14,595 --> 00:31:15,865
I am sorry.

428
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:18,235
My Lady is not home right now.

429
00:31:18,235 --> 00:31:20,975
Oh, I see.

430
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:23,055
How's she feeling, by the way?

431
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:26,865
She is better since she took medicine.

432
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:28,265
That's a relief.

433
00:31:28,265 --> 00:31:31,545
I will let her know you stopped by.

434
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,585
Okay.

435
00:31:56,895 --> 00:32:00,085
Are you His Excellency Cha's daughter, by chance?

436
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,645
Do you know me?

437
00:32:01,645 --> 00:32:02,835
It is you.

438
00:32:02,835 --> 00:32:04,415
Eun Ae told me a lot about you.

439
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:08,475
I am her father, Cho Byeong Mu.

440
00:32:08,475 --> 00:32:11,225
Yes, hello.

441
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:13,245
Nice to meet you.

442
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,165
You look way younger than I thought-

443
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:19,615
I-It's nothing.

444
00:32:19,615 --> 00:32:24,435
I was curious if Lady Eun Ae was feeling better.

445
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:27,125
That is why I stopped by briefly.

446
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:30,145
I was there when the fire started last night.

447
00:32:30,145 --> 00:32:32,525
Oh, I see.

448
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:37,235
You are a noblewoman,
but you care about my daughter.

449
00:32:37,235 --> 00:32:38,915
Thank you.

450
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,875
Of course, I should. She's my friend.

451
00:32:45,245 --> 00:32:49,755
You are pure, as if you grew up without any worries

452
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:52,155
your whole life.

453
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:53,365
Thank you.

454
00:32:53,365 --> 00:32:58,185
I hope Eun Ae turns out like you, Lady Sun Chaek.

455
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,715
She is in...

456
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:04,895
your care from now on, My Lady.

457
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:06,905
Of course.

458
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:10,045
I'll get going now.

459
00:33:41,435 --> 00:33:44,065
My Lady, drink your medicine.

460
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:48,315
What medicine is this?

461
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:50,895
It is a medicine made with chamberbitter

462
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,945
Prince Gyeongseong brought himself.

463
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:56,475
Oh, right.

464
00:33:58,655 --> 00:34:01,675
I feel bad that he's been doing stuff for me.

465
00:34:02,885 --> 00:34:05,185
I wonder if he's feeling okay.

466
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:13,265
Why am I thinking of him?

467
00:34:13,265 --> 00:34:15,655
Why do I worry about him?

468
00:34:15,655 --> 00:34:18,155
Whatever. Don't get sucked in.

469
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,515
Don't read into things.

470
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,445
How dare you worry about him?

471
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:25,765
Worry about yourself.

472
00:34:25,765 --> 00:34:27,825
If I didn't do it,

473
00:34:27,825 --> 00:34:30,935
Eun Ae would've done it.

474
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,585
My Lady?

475
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:34,015
What are you doing?

476
00:34:34,015 --> 00:34:35,795
Huh? It's nothing.

477
00:34:35,795 --> 00:34:37,345
Go ahead and drink the medicine.

478
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:39,635
The precious stuff is getting cold.

479
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,025
I can't stand anything bitter.

480
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,995
What was that? Am I hearing things?

481
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:09,875
I heard it, too.

482
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:13,875
It sounded like a stone hitting the window.

483
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,585
Gosh, hurry.

484
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:28,665
My gosh.

485
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:37,905
Sir Su Gyeom.

486
00:35:45,455 --> 00:35:47,925
I wanted to see you,

487
00:35:47,925 --> 00:35:50,685
but it was late, and I felt impatient...

488
00:35:51,445 --> 00:35:54,345
This was the only way to see you.

489
00:35:54,345 --> 00:35:56,715
<i>It is okay.</i>

490
00:35:56,715 --> 00:36:00,975
<i>I must've scared you at the last meeting.</i>

491
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:04,285
I am so relieved that...

492
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:06,605
you did not get hurt.

493
00:36:07,595 --> 00:36:12,115
Did you come here because
you were worried about me?

494
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:16,655
There is something I need to tell you.

495
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:20,775
I-If you heard about me
marrying Prince Gyeongseong-

496
00:36:20,775 --> 00:36:23,015
<i>Well...</i>

497
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,545
The thing is...

498
00:36:24,545 --> 00:36:27,185
<i>This atmosphere. This reaction.</i>

499
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,085
<i>This situation is...</i>

500
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:31,445
<i>Is he confessing his love by chance?</i>

501
00:36:31,445 --> 00:36:34,495
<i>I think he's here to confirm if it's true</i>

502
00:36:34,495 --> 00:36:36,845
<i>I'm with Prince Gyeongseong.</i>

503
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:41,425
<i>What's the deal?
Did Jung Su Gyeom fall for me, too?</i>

504
00:36:41,425 --> 00:36:44,685
<i>You might find this to be a burden, but...</i>

505
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:47,965
<i>His voice says he's suppressing jealousy.</i>

506
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:51,625
<i>Because our bodies touched in front of the wall,</i>

507
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:54,675
<i>he's getting fired up.</i>

508
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:57,365
<i>Gosh, is this my fate?</i>

509
00:36:57,365 --> 00:37:00,185
<i>I try to deny it, but I can't.</i>

510
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:04,585
<i>You seduced me on purpose
and took my virginity away.</i>

511
00:37:04,585 --> 00:37:07,875
<i>This is treason.</i>

512
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:11,645
You might have noticed it already,

513
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:13,485
but Maiden Sun Chaek,

514
00:37:13,485 --> 00:37:14,775
I-

515
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,655
<i>No! You can't!</i>

516
00:37:16,655 --> 00:37:18,715
- I love...
<i>- You can't love me-</i>

517
00:37:18,715 --> 00:37:21,425
<i>- You cannot!</i>
- I love Lady Eun Ae.

518
00:37:52,485 --> 00:37:54,895
Not me...

519
00:37:54,895 --> 00:37:57,195
but Lady Eun Ae?

520
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:04,315
Of course, you are an exceptional woman

521
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,585
who is not lacking in any way.

522
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:12,105
But I fell for Lady Eun Ae when she bravely

523
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:15,575
<i>took the penalty drink for me as a weak vessel.</i>

524
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:20,055
Was that really enough...

525
00:38:20,055 --> 00:38:23,805
for you to fall in love with Lady Eun Ae?

526
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:30,645
I have been looking for someone

527
00:38:31,595 --> 00:38:33,745
who is gentle and strong like her.

528
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,665
But...

529
00:38:35,665 --> 00:38:40,745
why are you telling me this?

530
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:45,475
I could not tell her how I feel yet.

531
00:38:45,475 --> 00:38:47,815
Even I am flustered by how I feel.

532
00:38:47,815 --> 00:38:52,045
I have no idea what she would think of it.

533
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:53,485
<i>Right.</i>

534
00:38:53,485 --> 00:38:57,785
<i>In the book, Eun Ae briefly met Su Gyeom,</i>

535
00:38:57,785 --> 00:39:00,825
<i>but she ended up with Yi Beon.</i>

536
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:05,185
So...

537
00:39:05,185 --> 00:39:11,285
are you asking me to help you end up together?

538
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:14,195
That is right, Maiden Sun Chaek.

539
00:39:14,195 --> 00:39:18,345
I knew you would understand how I feel.

540
00:39:20,055 --> 00:39:24,505
I know I am asking a lot, but I would

541
00:39:24,505 --> 00:39:27,505
find your advice very helpful.

542
00:39:27,505 --> 00:39:29,095
<i>Hold on.</i>

543
00:39:29,095 --> 00:39:32,705
<i>Eun Ae needs to end up with Yi Beon.</i>

544
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:35,225
<i>If I help him now...</i>

545
00:39:37,385 --> 00:39:41,485
I knew it was too much to ask.

546
00:39:41,485 --> 00:39:44,555
You must be busy with the goings on at home.

547
00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:49,095
Wait...

548
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:54,165
Could you give me some time to think?

549
00:39:54,165 --> 00:39:59,955
I want to try talking to Lady Eun Ae, too.

550

Do you mean it, Maiden Sun Chaek?

551
00:40:05,135 --> 00:40:08,815

a thousand soldiers and horses.

552
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:27,335
I am planning to get married.

553

556
00:42:20,892 --> 00:42:23,172
Not only that but the clan and its movement

557
00:42:23,172 --> 00:42:27,012

Come. Come closer.
