1
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:06,993
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

2
00:00:06,993 --> 00:00:08,633
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

3
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:32,215
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,785
Just marry Maiden Sun Chaek already.

5
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:42,355
Why did you have to do this?

6
00:00:42,355 --> 00:00:44,435
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:45,875
Maiden Eun Ae...

8
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:49,535
She participated in the selection to marry you.

9
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:50,715
So?

10
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:52,835
Do you...

11
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:57,185
Do you really not know how I feel?

12
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:01,095
How am I supposed to know how you feel?

13
00:01:06,145 --> 00:01:10,235
I love Maiden Eun Ae.

14
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:14,825
If she ends up getting selected,

15
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,605
what am I supposed to do?

16
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:20,885
You scared me for that reason?

17
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:25,485
Do not belittle this matter.

18
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,135
My life depends on it.

19
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,655
My Lord.

20
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:35,895
I caught him as he was running away.

21
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,875
Where is he?

22
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,695
This way.

23
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:45,395
I am not done yet-

24
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:47,985
Beon!

25
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:05,725
Just kill me.

26
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:11,315
You must know about this

27
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:14,515
filthy object better than anyone.

28
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:17,555
Did the Do family hire you?

29
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:24,845
Why did you approach Cha Sun Chaek?

30
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:38,995
You did such a thing without being

31
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:41,345
prepared to go through this?

32
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:45,995
Compared to the pain my woman had to endure,

33
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:48,485
it is not even close.

34
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:10,125
Just make sure he does not die.

35
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,555
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:16,685
Did you say he got off the ship
that belongs to the Do family?

37
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:18,605
Yes, as soon as he got off,

38
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:23,415
I confirmed that he went to
the Right State Minister's house.

39
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:25,635
Do Hwa Seon will be the key to this.

40
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:27,635
What are you planning to do?

41
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:31,415
I need to find evidence from her directly.

42
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:33,295
Directly?

43
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:37,965
You will not seduce her, will you?

44
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:45,915
It might look suspicious.

45
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:47,795
Do not tell anyone.

46
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:50,725
Not even Lady Sun Chaek?

47
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:56,625
She might end up in danger.

48
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:05,295
In the pouches, there are 10 nyang worth of coins.

49
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:11,425
Increase the worth of 10 nyang in two days.

50
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:17,625
That is the task I am giving you.

51
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:25,855
[Episode 6: Fishing ground and disguise]

52
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:31,145
It's such a difficult task.

53
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:35,505
It's a task suited for the Queen.

54
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:40,825
You have an advantage
since you've run a merchant store.

55
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:43,425
I really can't think of anything.

56
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:48,235
I think it is about wisdom
rather than business skills.

57
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:50,905
That's even harder.

58
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:57,175
My Lady!

59
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:09,345
Bang Wool, do you have any good ideas?

60
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:11,385
How would I know anything?

61
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:15,725
I should've learned
about investing if I had known.

62
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:19,645
- My Lady.
- Yes?

63
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:24,125
I am certain someone is following you.

64
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,745
Again?

65
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:32,895
Why don't you stop and come out now?

66
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:37,365
Otherwise, I'll tell Prince Gyengseong that

67
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:40,645
you followed me so obviously.

68
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:55,745
How did you know?

69
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:59,085
I knew you were Ma Yun
from the way you were acting.

70
00:05:59,085 --> 00:06:01,185
How do you know my name?

71
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:03,625
I know a lot more

72
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,475
about this place than you think I do.

73
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:10,575
<i>Still, why did you follow me so obviously?</i>

74
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:12,015
<i>I feel so uncomfortable.</i>

75
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:13,445
<i>My Lord ordered me to</i>

76
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:17,095
<i>protect you during the selection.</i>

77
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:20,095
Tell him to protect me himself if he's so worried.

78
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:23,125
He is not able to come himself.

79
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,155
Why not?

80
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:26,415
I cannot tell you just yet.

81
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:28,225
Don't follow me around, then.

82
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:31,385
I cannot go against his order.

83
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:34,625
Both you and your lord won't listen.

84
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,415
From now on,

85
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:40,605
I will protect you discreetly.

86
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:50,515
Gosh, seriously!

87
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:53,395
What the hell are you doing?

88
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:57,315
I-I am sorry.

89
00:06:57,315 --> 00:06:59,095
How will you compensate for all this?

90
00:06:59,095 --> 00:07:00,715
Gosh, seriously.

91
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:02,095
Geez.

92
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:03,965
I will compensate you.

93
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,245
How much will it be?

94
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:06,875
Because of the bad crops this year,

95
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,865
rice is impossible to get right now.

96
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:13,875
Rice is more precious than any treasure nowadays.

97
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,055
Even a nobleman's daughter

98
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:19,835
will not be able to compensate me for this.

99
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:21,845
Geez.

100
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:26,365
- Do not do it, My Lady.
- It's okay. Do it together.

101
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:28,755
Your hands will get dirty.

102
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:30,865
Seriously.

103
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:33,415
How upsetting.

104
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:35,015
Geez.

105
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:40,795
Is that all you can do with 10 nyang?

106
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,835
Your heads are good for nothing, are they not?

107
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:48,985
If your head is good for nothing,

108
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:51,165
why is it so big?

109
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:53,775
I suppose.

110
00:07:55,095 --> 00:07:57,585
What do I expect from you people?

111
00:07:57,585 --> 00:08:00,135
You are so useless.

112
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:03,635
I cannot stand you. Be gone!

113
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,225
Queen Mother acted like she would help me.

114
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:16,415
But she did not give me any hint.

115
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:21,345
B-By chance, is she trying to test me, too?

116
00:08:21,345 --> 00:08:24,555
I do not know what she is thinking.

117
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:26,545
If only he did not mess up,

118
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:29,055
Prince Gyeongseong would have been mine.

119
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:32,305
Now, he is nowhere to be seen.

120
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:34,555
What a bastard.

121
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:37,225
Whatever.

122
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,855
Eating tasty food will give me an idea, right?

123
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:40,545
Right.

124
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:47,085
Prince Gyeongseong!

125
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:58,735
Prince Gyeongseong...

126
00:08:58,735 --> 00:09:02,065
Prince Gyeongseong! Prince Gyeongseong...

127
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:06,085
Huh? What's going on? Was I mistaken?

128
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:08,885
I don't think so.

129
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:22,875
Watch where you are going!

130
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:30,025
Prince Gyeongseong.

131
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:31,775
I ran into you again.

132
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:33,835
Is this fate, too?

133
00:09:57,225 --> 00:10:00,775
I wanted to say hello to the maidens
participating in the selection.

134
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:01,995
I am glad I ran into you.

135
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:03,555
It is my mistake,

136
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:07,665
but I am not sure if I can let a man inside.

137
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,085
I could become your husband in the future.

138
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:12,795
My gosh.

139
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:15,835
I would like to get changed.

140
00:10:15,835 --> 00:10:17,765
Oh, come this way.

141
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:19,465
And...

142
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:21,295
I am a bit thirsty, too.

143
00:10:21,295 --> 00:10:22,555
I will get you something.

144
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,585
Please wait inside.

145
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:31,835
You had better not go anywhere.

146
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:39,215
Would you like cold or warm water...

147
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:40,455
Oh, gosh!

148
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:43,265
I felt stuffy, so...

149
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:49,535
<i>You can take off more.</i>

150
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:51,735
I got you water.

151
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:02,825
I prefer tea over water.

152
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:04,285
Tea is nice.

153
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:07,165
I will brew you a strong one.

154
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:12,785
I would like you to brew it as long as you can.

155
00:12:12,785 --> 00:12:16,215
Yes. I will get it for you.

156
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:33,855
What is the point of working so hard?

157
00:12:33,855 --> 00:12:37,055
It is indeed a bad year of harvest.

158
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:39,645
The nobles do not know.

159
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:42,235
It has been like this for a while.

160
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,895
<i>We are screwed.</i>

161
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,765
<i>The ground looks good, though.</i>

162
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:55,275
Excuse me.

163
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,025
Are you the owner of this field?

164
00:12:57,025 --> 00:13:00,015
- Why do you ask?
- Can I borrow this place briefly?

165
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:03,165
Will you plant rice in this bad crop year?

166
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:04,955
I'm thinking of growing something else.

167
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:07,555
I will borrow it just for two days.

168
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:11,935
Here.

169
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:14,165
Will this be enough?

170
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:19,085
I wonder if there's one.

171
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:25,645
What? What's this noise?

172
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:30,405
My Lady, look that way.

173
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:44,795
What a shock out of the blue.

174
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:49,375
I am about to lose both a friend and a woman.

175
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,925
I understand how that feels, too.

176
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:57,065
I should step aside now, should I not?

177
00:13:57,065 --> 00:14:02,335
Can you give up on the woman
you love for a friend?

178
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:10,925
How close is he to Prince Gyeongseong?

179
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:13,055
<i>It was not in the book.</i>

180
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:15,495
<i>But I've always been curious.</i>

181
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:36,295
You cannot even kill it.

182
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:46,925
- Should I cut you first?
- Go ahead and try.

183
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:50,535
"Life and death share the same body.

184
00:14:50,535 --> 00:14:53,025
Just as hardship and growth come hand in hand."

185
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:57,435
That is what my late mother said.

186
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:18,635
"Neung" as in despise. "So" as in the sky.

187
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:21,185
No matter how poor the weather is,

188
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:23,795
it blossoms without care.
That is why it is called that.

189
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:25,415
You and I...

190
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:28,625
seem to be going through hardship.

191
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:32,775
Let us hang in there like this flower and blossom.

192
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:35,125
All right?

193
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:49,035
<i>I am Beon's only friend.</i>

194
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,595
<i>But how could I...</i>

195
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:55,015
possibly betray him?

196
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:59,725
But don't be so sad.

197
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,945
Lady Eun Ae didn't want to participate, either.

198
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:04,455
I-Is that true?

199
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:06,715
According to her, she had no choice

200
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,415
but to participate because of her father.

201
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:13,245
If so, I still have a chance. Do I not?

202
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:16,125
I should tell her how I feel right now, then.

203
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,475
Gosh, hold on.

204
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:20,375
There is no time. I need to run to her house and-

205
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,175
I mean,

206
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:24,155
if you suddenly visit her,

207
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:26,825
Lady Eun Ae would be so flustered.

208
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,895
If then,

209
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:32,675
how can I win her heart?

210
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:34,865
Sir Su Gyeom,

211
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:39,415
don't say you've never courted a woman before...

212
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:49,215
I didn't know Jung Su Gyeom
was such a dating rookie.

213
00:16:49,215 --> 00:16:52,375
The ones who look normal on the outside

214
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,335
usually have hidden flaws.

215
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:56,525
My Lady.

216
00:16:59,305 --> 00:17:02,125
Please buy one.

217
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:08,865
What's all this?

218
00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:11,295
They are jewelry I made.

219
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:13,145
They bring good luck.

220
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:15,455
Come on.

221
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:17,795
It is true.

222
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:21,595
I am taking a very important test right now.

223
00:17:21,595 --> 00:17:24,565
Is there one that would let me pass?

224
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:27,045
This one.

225
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:30,285
You will definitely pass with this.

226
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:32,635
Really?

227
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,625
This looks prettier to me.

228
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:38,515
That is called Hoshinok.

229
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,795
It protects you and prolongs your lifespan.

230
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:43,305
Oh, I see.

231
00:17:43,305 --> 00:17:46,125
How about this one, then?

232
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,145
That is called Inyeonok.

233
00:17:48,145 --> 00:17:50,825
It connects you with the one you love

234
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:54,185
and it lets you two overcome hardship together.

235
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:57,615
Oh, wow...

236
00:17:57,615 --> 00:18:00,525
You have a lot of impressive stuff.

237
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:04,475
Inyeonok needs to be purchased as a pair.

238
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:06,785
It costs twice as much.

239
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,385
Which one would you like?

240
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:26,075
How do you like the tea?

241
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:30,605
It is unique.

242
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:32,035
You cannot get it in this country.

243
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:34,865
It is a very rare tea from the Middle East.

244
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:38,625
Even Merchant Cho probably cannot get this.

245
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:43,625
Does the Do family get a lot
of things from overseas?

246
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,755
Since we have been diplomats for generations,

247
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:47,435
we have a lot of connections overseas.

248
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:49,095
Once you start looking outside this country,

249
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,275
you find so many fun things all over.

250
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:53,605
Fun things, huh?

251
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:57,845
I would like to know what those things are.

252
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:03,295
Should I show you something fun?

253
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:11,545
I am only showing this to you.

254
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:15,805
Of course, if we become a family,

255
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:18,965
all of this will become yours.

256
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:38,885
What a unique symbol.

257
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:42,225
Those are rare objects from England.

258
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:47,055
I am sure only we own objects with that symbol.

259
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:41,205
That is perfect for you.

260
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:44,615
Do you pull the trigger like this?

261
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:52,845
Pull it.

262
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:55,805
Pull the trigger of your heart.

263
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:01,185
I am willing to take your bullet.

264
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:29,595
I had fun browsing.

265
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:31,845
I will leave, then.

266
00:21:31,845 --> 00:21:33,695
My Lord.

267
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:40,015
There is something I want to tell you.

268
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:54,225
I want to give this to him quickly.

269
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,095
Burn these clothes immediately.

270
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:12,555
Burn these valuable clothes?

271
00:22:12,555 --> 00:22:15,135
They are just pieces of fabric

272
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:17,345
<i>touched by an awful person.</i>

273
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:20,585
Oh, yes.

274
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:22,905
I will follow your order.

275
00:22:32,335 --> 00:22:37,625
<i>I do not know how that vixen
Cha Sun Chaek stole your heart,</i>

276
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,725
but I thought you should know her true side.

277
00:22:42,655 --> 00:22:45,075
True side?

278
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:48,885
The thing is...

279
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:54,185
To be honest, you are not the only man

280
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:57,425
who were intimate with her.

281
00:22:57,425 --> 00:22:59,345
I heard a Westerner who came to the capital

282
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:01,905
recently was intimate with her.

283
00:23:01,905 --> 00:23:05,735
I heard she even promised
to run away overseas with him.

284
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:08,875
She said this country does not
suit her, and it suffocates her.

285
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:13,115
She asked him to help her leave
as soon as possible.

286
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:15,765
And I can't believe she
participated in the selection.

287
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:17,935
Is she not so devious?

288
00:23:17,935 --> 00:23:22,385
The Cha family has kept her inside for a reason.

289
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:24,465
By the way,

290
00:23:24,465 --> 00:23:26,445
how do you know about that?

291
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:29,835
- Pardon?
- You speak as if

292
00:23:29,835 --> 00:23:34,235
you saw and heard it yourself.

293
00:23:49,285 --> 00:23:52,985
<i>Actually, that Westerner is from England.</i>

294
00:23:52,985 --> 00:23:54,805
<i>He told me himself.</i>

295
00:23:54,805 --> 00:23:57,025
<i>That is how I know for certain.</i>

296
00:23:57,025 --> 00:23:58,555
[Westerner]

297
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:06,055
[Cha Sun Chaek]

298
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:11,165
[Cha Sun Chaek]

299
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:30,275
<i>She said this country does not
suit her, and it suffocates her.</i>

300
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:34,335
<i>She asked him to help her leave
as soon as possible.</i>

301
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:38,095
Beautiful day, right?

302
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:39,765
Yes.

303
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:57,955
How dare she try to frame

304
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,045
my woman with such nonsense?

305
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:14,584
I feel much better.

306
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,014
Is there something on my face?

307
00:25:21,014 --> 00:25:22,334
Yes.

308
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:24,814
I see emotions in it.

309
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,804
I have not seen them

310
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:29,694
on your face for a long time.

311
00:25:34,044 --> 00:25:37,044
It is not a bad thing.

312
00:25:37,044 --> 00:25:41,734
Thanks to Lady Sun Chaek, you have
found different emotions of life again.

313
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:44,914
I feel so relieved.

314
00:25:44,914 --> 00:25:47,264
Don't be silly.

315
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:52,354
I will finish things up here. Go in and rest.

316
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:54,894
Have a good night.

317
00:26:01,564 --> 00:26:04,124
<i>Have a good night.</i>

318
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:15,284
Good night?

319
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:17,834
No such a thing for me...

320
00:26:25,674 --> 00:26:27,434
I guess I have.

321
00:26:38,144 --> 00:26:46,204
<i>♫ Just like the moment I first met you ♫</i>

322
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:50,164

00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:22,384

<i>♫ You looked at me with a shy smile ♫</i>

340
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:11,854
Cha Sun Chaek,

341
00:28:16,204 --> 00:28:17,814
why...

342
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:22,024
did you want to meet me?

343
00:28:22,024 --> 00:28:24,944
Because I like you.

344
00:28:24,944 --> 00:28:28,074
I've always wanted to fall in love

345
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:32,064
with a man like you for once in my life.

346
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:35,904
<i>♫ I love you forever ♫</i>

347
00:28:35,904 --> 00:28:38,454
<i>♫ Don't hide it anymore ♫</i>

348
00:28:38,454 --> 00:28:43,704
<i>♫ I will show you who I am ♫</i>

349
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:47,964
<i>♫ Shall we begin? ♫</i>

350
00:29:04,904 --> 00:29:08,784
<i>Up until recently,</i>

351
00:29:08,784 --> 00:29:11,954
<i>she was just one of the women
I crossed paths with.</i>

352
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:16,134
<i>But I cannot let her go.</i>

353
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:18,664
I must have you.

354
00:29:18,664 --> 00:29:20,254
No.

355
00:29:21,254 --> 00:29:23,354
I will have you.

356
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:31,674
<i>I will spend my first night with you.</i>

357
00:30:08,964 --> 00:30:11,174
<i>Even if she got sober</i>

358
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:14,134
<i>and does not remember tonight,</i>

359
00:30:14,994 --> 00:30:19,994
<i>I just need to make her keep falling for me.</i>

360
00:30:19,994 --> 00:30:25,814
<i>I will devote my last moment to you as well.</i>

361
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:30,914
Since that night,

362
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:35,284
my nights have been different
than the ones before.

363
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:47,324
Prince Gyeongseong!

364
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:53,054
Prince Gyeongseong!

365
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:54,814
Prince Gyeongseong...

366
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:57,674
Huh? Was I mistaken?

367
00:30:58,664 --> 00:31:00,414
I don't think so.

368
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,864
I miss her.

369
00:31:18,284 --> 00:31:23,294
Did you find the answer
to the Queen Mother's question?

370
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:24,604
<i>Yes.</i>

371
00:31:24,604 --> 00:31:28,964
Starting with Suk Gyeong of the Jeong family,
the daughter of the royal secretary,

372
00:31:28,964 --> 00:31:32,654
give the answer you prepared.

373
00:31:32,654 --> 00:31:36,354
I bought rice seedlings with 10 nyang.

374
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,244
What would you do...

375
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:42,084
if it does not rain after you
planted the seedlings?

376
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:48,524
I offered 10 nyang to a temple

377
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:51,534
and prayed for the country's well-being.

378
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:55,664
Since I prayed and offered with a sincere heart,

379
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,544
- it is worth more than 10 nyang-
- Next.

380
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:04,794
I bravely went to a gambling house with 10 nyang,

381
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:08,754
but I lost all of it.

382
00:32:08,754 --> 00:32:13,564
So, I learned that I should never gamble

383
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,214
with 10 nyang from now on.

384
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,334
She's so proud.

385
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:20,514
Next.

386
00:32:20,514 --> 00:32:23,704
I decided to melt the 10 nyang

387
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,004
you gave to me.

388
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:30,744
With the copper from the melted coins,

389
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:34,794
I created a one-of-a-kind ring.

390
00:32:34,794 --> 00:32:37,474
The ring will be handed down over generations.

391
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:39,594
I will cherish Queen Mother's

392
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:44,324
virtuousness without forgetting
the value of 10 nyang.

393
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:50,874
What a sweet gesture.

394
00:32:53,364 --> 00:32:54,734
Next.

395
00:32:55,744 --> 00:33:01,744
With 10 nyang, I gave orphans
food and a brush each.

396
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:05,924
I think nurturing the talents
of the future is a guaranteed way

397
00:33:05,924 --> 00:33:10,024
to enrich the country and secure its well-being.

398
00:33:10,024 --> 00:33:11,664
However,

399
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:16,344
can you guarantee the children
would turn out the way you want?

400
00:33:19,224 --> 00:33:20,844
Next.

401
00:33:20,844 --> 00:33:24,394
Using the 10 nyang you gave me,

402
00:33:24,394 --> 00:33:26,284
I borrowed an unused paddy field

403
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:29,414
and put catfish and loaches there.

404
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:33,064
What kind of nonsense is that?

405
00:33:35,504 --> 00:33:38,344
<i>Catfish and loaches are natural enemies.</i>

406
00:33:38,344 --> 00:33:40,154
<i>If you put enemies together,</i>

407
00:33:40,154 --> 00:33:42,394
<i>their survival instinct strengthens</i>

408
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:47,234
<i>and they naturally reproduce
more and get stronger.</i>

409
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:51,154
Using that fact, I turned 10 nyang

410
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,944
into this much.

411
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,904
By selling catfish and loaches to
paddy fields with poor harvests,

412
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:04,274
I was able to make a lot in a short period of time.

413
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:06,514
Some people lament the drought,

414
00:34:06,514 --> 00:34:09,954
but I wanted to find a new solution
in the midst of that.

415
00:34:09,954 --> 00:34:12,204
Even empty fields with poor harvests

416
00:34:12,204 --> 00:34:15,234
can be lucrative if you change your thinking.

417
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:20,064
Crises can always be turned into
opportunities. Do you not think so?

418
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,244
I will announce the final three maidens

419
00:34:25,244 --> 00:34:28,474
who will advance to the final round.

420
00:34:29,864 --> 00:34:32,384
The first maiden.

421
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:35,234
Right State Minister Do Bae Myeong's daughter,

422
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:38,414
Hwa Seon of the Do family.

423
00:34:42,634 --> 00:34:44,544
Congratulations.

424
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,944
The next is...

425
00:34:52,944 --> 00:34:55,924
Scholar Cho Byeong Mu's daughter,

426
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:58,944
Eun Ae of the Cho family.

427
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:04,574
Good work.

428
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:10,634
And the last one is...

429
00:35:15,104 --> 00:35:17,804
the Chief State Minister Cha Ho Yeol's daughter,

430
00:35:17,804 --> 00:35:21,354
Sun Chaek of the Cha family.

431
00:35:23,494 --> 00:35:27,404
You received the highest score
in the second round.

432
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:30,634
Thank you.

433
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,884
Nonsense.

434
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:35,574
How could she win first place?

435
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:39,614
The final round, Samgantaek,

436
00:35:39,614 --> 00:35:44,904
will be held at the Queen Mother's
Palace in two days.

437
00:35:52,064 --> 00:35:53,834
What's the deal?

438
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:56,604
It's my first time winning first place.

439
00:35:57,694 --> 00:36:01,634
Goodness, I can't believe I used that this way.

440
00:36:07,384 --> 00:36:10,364
Natural enemies. In Korean, it's "cheonjeok."

441
00:36:10,364 --> 00:36:12,864
What happens if you put them together?

442
00:36:12,864 --> 00:36:15,304
You can take catfish and loaches as examples.

443
00:36:15,304 --> 00:36:18,414
In a paddy field, if you put loaches on one side

444
00:36:18,414 --> 00:36:21,714
and catfish on the other side
and grow them together,

445
00:36:21,714 --> 00:36:25,244
the loaches on the catfish side
grow much stronger.

446
00:36:25,244 --> 00:36:26,724
Why is that?

447
00:36:26,724 --> 00:36:29,224
To avoid the natural enemy...

448
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:43,544
Wow! I cannot believe how fun the selection is.

449
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:46,044
The second round was fierce, too.

450
00:36:47,044 --> 00:36:48,994
D-Did the second round result come out?

451
00:36:48,994 --> 00:36:50,184
Yes.

452
00:36:50,184 --> 00:36:52,984
By giving the best answers to the Queen Mother,

453
00:36:52,984 --> 00:36:54,434
the three maidens were selected.

454
00:36:54,434 --> 00:36:58,174
I liked Lady Cho Eun Ae's answer the most.

455
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,784
Yes, her answer was nice.

456
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,894
Which means...

457
00:37:01,894 --> 00:37:05,834
Lady Eun Ae passed the second round?

458
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:20,474
Prince Gyeongseong!

459
00:37:24,264 --> 00:37:25,974
Hello, Lady Sun Chaek.

460
00:37:25,974 --> 00:37:28,934
Hello. I'm here to see Prince Gyeongseong.

461
00:37:28,934 --> 00:37:31,534
He went to bed early.

462
00:37:31,534 --> 00:37:34,044
The sun hasn't even set yet.

463
00:37:35,054 --> 00:37:37,254
I just need a moment. Can't you let me?

464
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:39,274
He'd be thrilled to hear this news.

465
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:42,934
I think you should go back home today.

466
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,874
You did such an amazing job today.

467
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:13,094
But you look so upset.

468
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:17,074
I'm not. I just need to think about something.

469
00:38:17,074 --> 00:38:20,264
By chance, is it about Prince Gyeongseong?

470
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:24,414
What are you talking about?
Never. It's not like that, okay?

471
00:38:24,414 --> 00:38:28,054
What's gotten into you, then?

472
00:38:30,704 --> 00:38:32,614
After running Madam's errand yesterday,

473
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:34,594
I saw Prince Gyeongseong.

474
00:38:34,594 --> 00:38:36,774
Really? Did he seem busy?

475
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:38,804
He looked so tired and mopey, right?

476
00:38:38,804 --> 00:38:41,034
It's not that.

477
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:43,964
Lady Do Hwa Seon and Prince Gyeongseong
were stuck together

478
00:38:43,964 --> 00:38:45,564
and went inside Lady Do's house.

479
00:38:45,564 --> 00:38:47,414
Locking arms, even.

480
00:38:47,414 --> 00:38:49,144
He locked arms with Do Hwa Seon?

481
00:38:49,144 --> 00:38:52,054
Come on. You must've been mistaken.

482
00:38:52,054 --> 00:38:56,184
I can recognize people from even 10 ri away.

483
00:38:56,184 --> 00:38:59,034
I know what I saw.

484
00:38:59,034 --> 00:39:02,304
But I could not chase them inside her house.

485
00:39:02,304 --> 00:39:05,244
So, I am just telling you what I saw.

486
00:39:05,244 --> 00:39:10,034
<i>By chance, was he on his way to see her, too?</i>

487
00:39:15,214 --> 00:39:18,314
No. I'll just ask him.

488
00:39:19,344 --> 00:39:22,344
Bang Wool, go to the Hoseondang now

489
00:39:22,344 --> 00:39:25,624
and tell the servant there that
I will come by early in the morning.

490
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:28,254
So, Prince Gyeongseong must
see me before he leaves.

491
00:39:28,254 --> 00:39:29,434
A-All right...

492
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:31,144
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

493
00:39:36,394 --> 00:39:38,694
Father.

494
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:43,934
Father, please talk to the Queen Mother.

495
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:47,134
I am sure Prince Gyeongseong has feelings for me.

496
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,734
My hard work finally paid off and

497
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:50,714
Prince Gyeongseong opened up to me.

498
00:39:50,714 --> 00:39:53,054
Is that not a relief, then?

499
00:39:53,054 --> 00:39:55,514
Father, things are going so well.

500
00:39:55,514 --> 00:39:58,264
It would be so humiliating
if I failed to be selected.

501
00:39:58,264 --> 00:40:00,194
The final round is still ahead.

502
00:40:00,194 --> 00:40:01,484
Trust the Queen Mother.

503
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:04,934
No. We need to take action while he is interested.

504
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:06,594
We cannot delay this. Please?

505
00:40:06,594 --> 00:40:07,804
Do something, Father.

506
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:09,244
All right, I will.

507
00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:10,544
You mean it, right?

508
00:40:10,544 --> 00:40:12,684
I said I will, did I not?

509
00:40:17,994 --> 00:40:19,624
Maiden Eun Ae.

510
00:40:20,764 --> 00:40:23,784
What brings you here?

511
00:40:23,784 --> 00:40:26,414
I was waiting for you.

512
00:40:42,894 --> 00:40:44,624
Maiden Eun Ae,

513
00:40:45,934 --> 00:40:48,004
It will not be good...

514
00:40:49,084 --> 00:40:51,664
to do this here.

515
00:40:51,664 --> 00:40:53,774
Sir,

516
00:40:53,774 --> 00:40:57,764
you put me in a tricky position
if you come by without notice.

517
00:40:57,764 --> 00:40:59,714
You know I am participating in the selection.

518
00:40:59,714 --> 00:41:01,794
I do, but...

519
00:41:06,644 --> 00:41:08,544
At the Seonmun Club meeting,

520
00:41:08,544 --> 00:41:12,794
you said you would grant me a wish
if I drank your penalty drink for you.

521
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,664
I did.

522
00:41:15,664 --> 00:41:18,464
I will tell you my wish now.

523
00:41:21,144 --> 00:41:24,354
Stay away from me for a while.

524
00:41:25,874 --> 00:41:27,954
What do you mean-

525
00:41:27,954 --> 00:41:31,794
I need to do well in the selection
to obey my father.

526
00:41:31,794 --> 00:41:35,124
Can you not quit the selection?

527
00:41:35,124 --> 00:41:38,064
I cannot go against my father's wish.

528
00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:41,524
If I get caught seeing you privately
during the selection,

529
00:41:41,524 --> 00:41:44,224
things would get very difficult for me.

530
00:41:56,724 --> 00:42:00,474
I do know how you feel, Sir.

531
00:42:00,474 --> 00:42:03,204
If you do not mind,

532
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:06,924
could you wait for me for just a little while?

533
00:42:16,504 --> 00:42:18,364
Gosh, it must be her.

534
00:42:18,364 --> 00:42:20,534
She filled a rice paddy with fish?

535
00:42:20,534 --> 00:42:22,874
Why did I just hear about her?

536
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,074
What a pretty lady.

537
00:42:39,864 --> 00:42:44,044
Oh, yes. It's me.

538
00:42:51,144 --> 00:42:53,624
She has not come in a while.

539
00:42:53,624 --> 00:42:55,934
Did she forget me already?

540
00:42:57,694 --> 00:43:02,054
Anyway, I wonder if her wish came true.

541
00:43:04,294 --> 00:43:06,244
Prince Gyeongseong!

542
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:12,904
You came, My Lady.

543
00:43:12,904 --> 00:43:15,944
Is Prince Gyeongseong up and about?

544
00:43:17,914 --> 00:43:20,074
What is it? Is he not up yet?

545
00:43:20,074 --> 00:43:21,874
No, the thing is...

546
00:43:21,874 --> 00:43:24,504
I relayed your message to him,

547
00:43:24,504 --> 00:43:26,274
but when I went inside a moment ago,

548
00:43:26,274 --> 00:43:28,154
he was already gone.

549
00:43:28,154 --> 00:43:29,944
Where did he go off to?

550
00:43:29,944 --> 00:43:32,324
I do not know, either.

551
00:43:32,324 --> 00:43:34,564
My apologies, My Lady.

552
00:43:37,424 --> 00:43:39,064
What's going on?

553
00:43:39,064 --> 00:43:41,274
Is he treating me like a fish he already caught?

554
00:43:41,274 --> 00:43:42,524
My Lady!

555
00:43:42,524 --> 00:43:44,384
Lady Sun Chaek!

556
00:43:44,384 --> 00:43:48,126
- My Lady, there is no time for this now.
- What is it?

557
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,674
I was told the final round is happening today.

558
00:43:50,674 --> 00:43:52,364
You need to prepare to enter the Palace now.

559
00:43:52,364 --> 00:43:53,904
What?

560
00:43:55,524 --> 00:43:58,484
Bang Wool, make me look the best in Hanyang

561
00:43:58,484 --> 00:44:00,854
so no one looks better than me.

562
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:04,084
I thought you were all about being frugal lately.

563
00:44:04,084 --> 00:44:07,574
No. I no longer need to be frugal.

564
00:44:07,574 --> 00:44:09,274
I'll shine brighter than anyone.

565
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:11,854
Like the female lead.

566
00:44:11,854 --> 00:44:15,334
The final round starts!

567
00:44:19,614 --> 00:44:21,934
The theme of the final round...

568
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:24,004
is virtue.

569
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,580
Do not be so nervous.

570
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,350
You have worked so hard.

571
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:42,600
I will treat you to some tea.

572
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,000
Do you have a flower you want to resemble?

573
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,960
I like peonies.

574
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:23,500
I-I...

575
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,110
like lotus flowers.

576
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:29,940
They grow in the mud,

577
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,600
but they blossom without

578
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,700
getting dirty at all.

579
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,280
I want to be like gossypiums.

580
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,270
No matter how beautiful other flowers are,

581
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,310
they only blossom for a season.

582
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:48,320
But gossypiums become the
people's clothes and blankets.

583
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,440
They are the most beautiful flowers in the world.

584
00:45:55,550 --> 00:46:00,420
To be honest, I was never
so interested in flowers.

585
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,430
But I recently learned about trumpet vine flowers.

586
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,680
I was touched the moment I learned its meaning.

587
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,110
Just like the trumpet vine flowers,
I want to overcome

588
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,710
hardships such as heat and torrential rain

589
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,960
and blossom for everyone to see.

590
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,080
Yes.

591
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,990
Hardships?

592
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:35,350
If your husband faces hardships,

593
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:40,520
what would be your priority as a wife?

594
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,320
I think my priority is to be disciplined

595
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,230
based on the elders' judgment and wisdom

596
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:48,240
when times are tough.

597
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,520
I will believe that I would learn
from the hardship

598
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,230
and quietly endure until it passes.

599
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:01,450
I think not going through hardships is the best.

600
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:07,030
But if you have no choice but to face it,

601
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:11,440
I think physical and financial
strengths are most needed.

602
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,940
Women should step up to overcome, too.

603
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,100
To do that, not only physical strength

604
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,670
but an emergency fund would be needed, too.

605
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,310
I think women should be

606
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:26,570
interested in finances, not just housework.

607
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,700
You say financial strength is important?

608
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,000
Was it Sun Chaek of the Cha family?

609
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,430
Yes, Your Highness.

610
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:47,940
Is that why you dressed so lavishly
while the country is

611
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,560
suffering due to poor harvests?

612
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,460
As if you are showing off your family's wealth?

613
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:59,360
I just wanted to impress you today.

614
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,160
She gets so many silk garments made that

615
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,330
the fabric shop's threshold is wearing out.

616
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:08,130
You're much worse than me-

617
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:16,750
At least, I do not make clothes for some man.

618
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:19,960
A man?

619
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,720
Your Highness, for the dignity
of the royal family,

620
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,920
I need to tell you exactly what I saw and heard.

621
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,330
They say the Chief State Minister's
daughter displayed-

622
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:35,340
I mean, displayed affection
with a Westerner in the streets.

623
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,040
A Westerner?

624
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,340
I hesitate to even speak of it.

625
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,630
I can't believe such an immoral woman
participated in the selection.

626
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,430
Even I feel ashamed of it.

627
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,300
Is that true?

628
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,620
She is slandering me.

629
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,740
I just helped someone in need.

630
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,600
There is a witness.

631
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,100
Witness?

632
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,890
Tell her what you saw and heard.

633
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,700
She brought a Westerner and

634
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,370
asked me to make clothes for him.

635
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:17,030
I wanted to get him new clothes
because his clothes were too worn out.

636
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,450
Tell her more.

637
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:22,040
She held hands with him, hugged him,

638
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:26,920
a-and I think I saw them k-kissing, too.

639
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,340
No way.

640
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,120
Why would you tell such a lie?

641
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,230
She did that in public.

642
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,400
Imagine how devious she must be in private.

643
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,730
Is that not obvious?

644
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,850
Do not speak so rudely.

645
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,860
Your Highness, this is not true.

646
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,770
Can you prove that it is a lie?

647
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,910
You don't think I can?

648
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:45,500
You are disgracing the Queen
Mother's Palace. How shameless.

649
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,240
Stop!

650
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,840
A royal woman has to be faithful and pure.

651
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,580
Chief State Minister Cha Ho Yeol's
daughter, Cha Sun Chaek

652
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,000
will be eliminated from the selection-

653
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,110
<i>No, My Lord! You cannot!</i>

654
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,900
Is this the Westerner you mentioned?

655
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,340
Y-Yes, yes.

656
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:24,950
Prince Gyeongseong.

657
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:27,260
What are you doing right now?

658
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,780
At this man's residence,

659
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,340
I discovered this.

660
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:05,380
This substance he brought from overseas

661
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,070
makes you show the plague symptoms.

662
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:10,100
And...

663
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:15,020
Lady Cha right here experienced those symptoms.

664
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,060
I'm sorry!

665
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,280
- Ma'am!
- Yes.

666
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,800
Another bowl, please.

667
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,030
Same order?

668
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,940
Yes. Add a lot of meat, please.

669
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,060
Okay, got it.

670
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,970
If so,

671
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:38,830
I almost died...

672
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,010
because of this Westerner...

673
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:47,880
I-If so, you should go to the Ministry of Justice.

674
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,370
How dare you cause a scene in front of me?

675
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,600
That Westerner knows the Do family very well.

676
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,480
And the fact that...

677
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,980
your favorite Do Hwa Seon hired the Westerner.

678
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:17,410
Do you want that to be revealed?

679
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:21,000
If you stop the selection process,

680
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,280
I will not reveal who was behind this.

681
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,440
Otherwise, we will have to hear his confession.

682
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,430
Speak and tell the truth yourself.

683
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,250
If so, you might be able to live.

684
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,750
Does this symbol not look familiar?

685
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,650
Your Highness. Your Highness!

686
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:28,250
My gosh! My gosh...

687
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,970
Oh, no...

688
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:32,180
Massage her arms.

689
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,390
Your Highness.

690
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:36,050
Your Highness.

691
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,740
- Your Highness.
- Keep massaging her.

692
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:41,230
Her feet. Her feet.

693
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,750
Your Highness. Your Highness.

694
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,790
Gosh, what is going on?

695
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:52,750
Since the Queen Mother lost consciousness,

696
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,980
His Majesty became furious.

697
00:53:54,980 --> 00:54:00,740
Therefore, he ordered the
selection process to stop.

698
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,740
The Westerner was such a dangerous person.

699
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,800
I can't believe it.

700
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,220
That is why you should not open up to anyone.

701
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:22,370
I will not allow you to eat, walk,
or go sightseeing

702
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:26,190
at all without me.

703
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:30,390
Have you been gone because
you've been chasing the Westerner?

704
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:33,470
I heard you locked arms with Do Hwa Seon, too.

705
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,230
You completely forgot about me, didn't you?

706
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:58,320
I have never let you go, even for a moment.

707
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:12,260
I realized something.

708
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,710
To be honest, I...

709
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:20,510
Prince Gyeongsong!

710
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:26,910
His Majesty wishes to see you.

711
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,970
Do you have to leave again?

712
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:33,350
Yes.

713
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,730
I really hate waiting.

714
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,530
But there's no choice.

715
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:41,680
I'll be waiting patiently.

716
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,300
I will be back soon.

717
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,640
Wait here without going anywhere.

718
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:57,350
Yes, Obsessive Tyrant.

719
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:14,100
Please hurry.

720
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,080
Let us go.

721
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,540
He said he'd be back soon.

722
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:13,160
When is he coming back?

723
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,520
<i>No.</i>

724
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,930
<i>H-Help me.</i>

725
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:26,780
