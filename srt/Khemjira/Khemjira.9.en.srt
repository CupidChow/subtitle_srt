3
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,680
Maybe it's because of her

4
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,520
that our paths crossed again.

5
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,360
Master was right.

6
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,200
He knows Ramphueng.

7
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,920
He'll catch the train early tomorrow
to come to us.

8
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,080
Jet,

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,520
can you try calling Khem?

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
Something feels off.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,200
Here, I made Master some dessert.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,680
You won't make it out alive this time.

13
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,280
Now, have a bite

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,280
and see if it's as good as before.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,800
Sure, it is.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,880
You've been making this for me
since I was little.

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,440
What's wrong, dear?

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,400
You can talk to me.

19
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,960
I've been helping Grandpa
fight off spirits over and over,

20
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,600
yet I still mess up.

21
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,480
I'm really not good, Grandma.

22
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,079
I can't compare to him at all.

23
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,280
You don't need to match him, dear.

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,840
No one's born a master, Paran.

25
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
I'm not a kid anymore.

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,040
Well,

27
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,920
once you become a shaman,

28
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,200
I won't be able to hug you.

29
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,920
Stop that.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,320
You're making me cry.

31
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,560
Just cry if you want to.

32
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,579
With me, you can be weak.

33
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,480
No need to stay strong.

34
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,960
My mom never got to see me
become a shaman.

35
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,680
But I want to make you proud, Grandma.

36
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,800
I'm already very proud of you, dear.

37
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,920
You look troubled,

38
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,800
like you've lost your vital force.

39
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,500
Let me summon it back for you.

40
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:25,280
♫May your vital force come to me♫

41
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,320
♫In my arms, where you should be,♫

42
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,360
♫Come to the one who loves you tenderly♫

43
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,560
♫May your vital force come to me♫

44
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,920
♫Wherever pain hurts you badly,♫

45
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,040
♫Let it be gone completely♫

46
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,800
♫May your vital force come to me,♫

47
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,120
♫The one who loves you endlessly♫

48
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:12,840
♫And won't let you cry in misery♫

49
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:22,680
♫May your vital force come to me♫

50
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:30,080
♫Now it's back where it should be,♫

51
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:40,080
♫May it find its way
back into your body♫

52
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,400
- Master!
- Master!

53
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,040
Master!

54
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,040
What's going on?

55
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,520
- What's happening?
- Master!

56
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,920
Go save Khem.

57
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,640
- But you...
- Save him!

58
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,200
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, Master.

59
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
He's not picking up.

60
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Do you sense something?

61
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
I'm not sure,

62
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,600
but I feel like...

63
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,320
it's all dark around Khem.

64
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,280
Can you give him another call?

65
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,520
Are you Jet?

66
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,280
Monk Kasem?

67
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,320
I took a car instead

68
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,960
as something bad is about to happen.

69
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,400
We need to go there now.

70
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,080
Your final moment has come.

71
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,520
What did you do to Grandma Si?

72
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,840
You'd best worry about yourself.

73
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,400
I shall reveal to you the ignominy

74
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,960
your family and you
have inflicted on me.

75
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,880
Little Mistress...

76
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,640
Little Mistress,

77
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,360
please stay still.

78
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,120
Come now, Little Mistress.

79
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,360
Who?

80
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Who are you?

81
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,320
Come on, Little Mistress.

82
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,000
I suppose I need to get your mother.

83
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,900
What's taking you forever, dear?

84
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,980
- Wait...
- Why not let Iam or Jik help you dress?

85
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,030
Mom?

86
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,370
I do not like wearing
the sabai and necklace, Mother.

87
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,410
They're uncomfortable.

88
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,120
They are not meant for comfort.

89
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,480
Your father wishes to see you,

90
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,200
so you must be properly dressed.

91
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Come,

92
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,320
I shall affix the flower crown for you.

93
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,720
Come here, Krongkwan.

94
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,520
It is already uncomfortable.

95
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,960
Do I need to wear that, too?

96
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,880
Just a few moments of patience,

97
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,400
and Madam will surely be fond of you.

98
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,440
Now that she is expecting,

99
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,120
she will likely be less irritable,
won't she?

100
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
Hush,

101
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
do not mention her like that again.

102
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,320
I never taught you
to speak ill of others.

103
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,640
I would not say such things
before others,

104
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,200
but she is really irritable, Mother.

105
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
Ow!

106
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,960
This little one...

107
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,320
Stay still for once.

108
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,000
[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, 1767]

109
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
So,

110
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,480
this time, is it a boy or a girl?

111
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,440
The night before,

112
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,360
Lady Ketkeaw's natal star
aligned with the fire element,

113
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,240
known for its strength.

114
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,760
It seems you are likely to have a son.

115
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Is that so?

116
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,600
Then your wish is granted, my lord.

117
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,280
I am most delighted.

118
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,080
I'm having a brother, right?

119
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,240
I am so happy for you, Madam.

120
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,600
If there's anything I may assist with,

121
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,040
do let me know at any time.

122
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,600
Thank you, Lady Kakanang.

123
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,120
This being my third pregnancy,

124
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,280
I cannot help but feel some concern.

125
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,160
I do hope
we shall have a strong son this time.

126
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,120
Very well.

127
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,240
Finally,

128
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,680
an heir shall be born
to carry on my lineage.

129
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,560
Indeed.

130
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,320
But that is not it, my lord.

131
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,360
By the chart,

132
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,880
it seems that you shall be blessed
with two sons, my lord.

133
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
What do you mean?

134
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,240
Are we perhaps

135
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,560
having twins?

136
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,160
My lord!

137
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,320
My lord,

138
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,800
there is urgent news.

139
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,000
It is most delightful.

140
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,480
What is it now?

141
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,120
Could there be anything
more delightful than this?

142
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,280
Last night, Mistress Ramphueng
suffered severe vomiting.

143
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,560
At dawn, I summoned the physician,

144
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,100
and it appears that

145
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,560
she may be expecting a child.

146
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,800
Heaven be praised.

147
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,280
Is this what you meant?

148
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,840
Yes, my lord.

149
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,600
When I spoke of two sons,

150
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,840
I meant one from Lady Ketkeaw

151
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,600
and another from Mistress Ramphueng.

152
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,840
I see.

153
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,840
Where is she now?

154
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,480
Take me to her.

155
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,840
This way, my lord.

156
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's wonderful.

157
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,520
I'm having two brothers at once, Mother.

158
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,240
Could you not leave early, my lord?

159
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,400
I wish you could see our son.

160
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,920
This duty is a direct command

161
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,800
from the Somdet Chao Phraya.

162
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,600
I cannot contravene it
for personal matters.

163
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,600
We're ready, my lord.

164
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,800
It seems Ramphueng is suffering badly
from morning sickness

165
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,960
as it's her first pregnancy
at twenty-one.

166
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,160
I suppose she won't make it in time.

167
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,400
Please forgive her, my lord.

168
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
I understand.

169
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,600
Please forgive me.

170
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,160
I thought something had happened to you,

171
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,400
and thus you did not come to see me off.

172
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,280
I apologize for being late, my lord.

173
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,160
I made you a garland with all my heart.

174
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
How wonderful.

175
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,680
I only hope
you succeed in your duty promptly

176
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,760
and return in time
to see both of your sons.

177
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,640
How thoughtful of you.

178
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm sure this little garland

179
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,040
can hasten his success in his duty.

180
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,000
Not at all, ma'am.

181
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,040
I only wish to help him
in any way I can.

182
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,520
My only skills lie in handiwork,

183
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,240
and there's still so much
I must learn from you, ma'am.

184
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,680
How fortunate I am

185
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,760
to have good wives,

186
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,840
who love and support one another.

187
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Take care of yourselves,

188
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,760
both of you,

189
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,800
for you are carrying my cherished sons.

190
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,000
And you?

191
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,760
Do you not want another child?

192
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,160
And you,

193
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,080
would you like another sibling?

194
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,960
I am not strong enough
to bear another child,

195
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,520
yet I swear
I shall care for both of the sons

196
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,360
as if they were my own

197
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,880
in gratitude
to Madam and Ramphueng

198
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,400
for carrying your heirs for me.

199
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,160
Thank you, all three of you.

200
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,840
With you at the house,

201
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,080
my mind is at ease.

202
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,800
I'm leaving now.

203
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,040
- Alright, my lord.
- Alright.

204
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,880
What is it?

205
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,920
Is it severe?

206
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,880
It's just a fever,

207
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,160
which is common in pregnancy.

208
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,600
Last time

209
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,080
you said the same thing

210
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,880
before I lost my child.

211
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,000
Go fetch the physician.

212
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,960
Have her checked just to be sure.

213
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,840
I've already been checked.

214
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,280
Our son is safe, my lord.

215
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,600
This is my third pregnancy.

216
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,480
There is no cause for concern.

217
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,000
I thank you deeply

218
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,520
for carrying my hopes within you,

219
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,840
yet you are no longer young.

220
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,840
Still, you are my first wife,

221
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,920
who has never once
neglected your duties.

222
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,280
Take good care of yourself.

223
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,440
This is to be your last pregnancy.

224
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,290
Do your duties as best you can.

225
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,960
Go and rest now.

226
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,180
It'll be best for our son.

227
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,080
Why not rest here tonight, my lord?

228
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,880
There is still much work
I must attend to.

229
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,320
You should just take a rest.

230
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,120
Is it work,

231
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,040
or that Ramphueng bitch?

232
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,240
[Ubon Ratchathani, 2025]

233
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,640
Master!

234
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,560
Master!

235
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,680
Master, what happened?

236
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,400
Master...

237
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,640
- Master...
- Master!

238
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,800
Master!

239
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,160
- Everyone,
- Master...

240
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,320
move aside.

241
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:08,280
(Casting a spell)

242
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,760
Master...

243
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Master!

244
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
Master...

245
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,860
- Master!
- Master.

246
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,320
What happened?

247
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,480
Where is Khem, Master?

248
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,440
Master...

249
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,520
Khem...

250
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,360
- Khem!
- Khem!

251
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,200
I heard a little thump.

252
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,440
Is the baby alright?

253
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,440
He's just moving,

254
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,920
which means he is very strong

255
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
and excited to meet his sister.

256
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Come out soon, little one.

257
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,200
Why don't you play
with Jik and Iam for a bit

258
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
while I speak with Auntie Ramphueng?

259
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Yes, Mother.

260
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,720
I really wish my son...

261
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,120
were as bright and clever
as your daughter.

262
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,720
If Krongkwan were a boy,

263
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,680
His Lordship
would've cherished him dearly.

264
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,760
It is not her good fortune
to be born a woman.

265
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,440
Rather,

266
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,080
it is mine.

267
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,560
Lady Kakanang,

268
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,120
I understand your concern,

269
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,920
yet I have already assured Madam

270
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,760
that my son shall live
as a servant as I do,

271
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,980
and shall never seek
to rival her son in lineage.

272
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,320
That may be your intention,

273
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,960
but he already carries the bloodline
of His Lordship.

274
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,680
I only wish...

275
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,040
to be with the man I love.

276
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
Ramphueng,

277
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,880
forgive my intrusion.

278
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,560
You are still so young.

279
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,080
His Lordship's care and support

280
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,440
are what you see as love.

281
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,560
What else could it be?

282
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,020
That's more than enough
for a servant like me.

283
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,680
I wish to repay him

284
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,840
by bearing a son,

285
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,520
and it is proper.

286
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,360
It is indeed proper.

287
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,800
I only wish to warn you.

288
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
Consider carefully

289
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,400
what you love more,

290
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,240
His Lordship

291
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,740
or your own life.

292
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,840
You do know

293
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,760
there is someone
who can't stand seeing your son grow.

294
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,480
Think carefully, Ramphueng.

295
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,640
You're only twenty-one.

296
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,680
You have many more years to live.

297
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,080
Lady Kakanang,

298
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
Madam Ketkeaw is about to give birth.

299
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,680
Take a deep breath, ma'am.

300
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,080
- One more time, ma'am.
- One more try, ma'am.

301
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
- Please push.
- Madam...

302
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,320
Please push, ma'am.

303
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,640
The baby's here!

304
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Young Master!

305
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,520
He's here, ma'am.

306
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,800
Young Master is here.

307
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,440
Midwife,

308
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,000
let me see my son.

309
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,360
What are you doing?

310
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,840
What happened?

311
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,160
Why does Young Master make no sound?

312
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,600
Why is that?

313
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,400
He is not breathing, ma'am.

314
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,080
What did you say?

315
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,600
Young Master is not breathing, ma'am.

316
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,000
What do you mean?

317
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,360
It is possible, ma'am.

318
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
No!

319
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,140
That's not true.

320
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,400
- Ma'am...
- My son is breathing!

321
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,120
- Ma'am, stay still.
- He is alive!

322
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,600
You can't move yet, ma'am.

323
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,160
- Please, ma'am.
- No...

324
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
- Let me see him...
- Please don't get up yet, ma'am.

325
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,840
Give me my son!

326
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,600
Why?

327
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,320
Why is fate so cruel?

328
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,080
- Ma'am...
- Stay strong, ma'am.

329
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,080
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

330
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,000
I am sorry.

331
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,560
- Why?
- Ma'am, please stop.

332
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,140
Please don't do that.

333
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,520
Please, ma'am.

334
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Calm down, ma'am.

335
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,040
Why?

336
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,920
Why must it be me?

337
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,840
Why me?

338
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,320
Please stop that, ma'am.

339
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,440
Please don't do that.

340
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,840
Why?

341
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,120
Are you sure, Ramphueng?

342
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,440
What has changed your mind?

343
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,160
I have pondered

344
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,400
the question you asked me,

345
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,200
and my answer is clear now.

346
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,600
It is not that I love His Lordship,

347
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,640
nor that I love myself.

348
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,720
But I love this child deeply

349
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,280
from the very first moment I saw him.

350
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,320
I love him with all my heart.

351
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,920
Then,

352
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,480
I'll have someone await your son

353
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,920
at the grove behind the house,

354
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,360
and let it be known

355
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,640
that your son is dead,
just as Madam's was.

356
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,000
My son,

357
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,480
go live your life,

358
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,760
grow strong,

359
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,400
and be free.

360
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,520
I'm sorry

361
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,640
that my fate

362
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
has granted you so little.

363
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,960
Be careful, please.

364
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,200
Where are you rushing off to?

365
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,840
Madam...

366
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,000
I heard that Ramphueng lost her child.

367
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,880
Aren't you supposed to be with her?

368
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,240
I'm on my way
to fetch the medicine, ma'am.

369
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,040
Who's that behind you?

370
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,880
She's my relative.

371
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,080
I'll have her work in the kitchen.

372
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,360
You think I'm stupid?

373
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,560
Get her.

374
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Yes, ma'am.

375
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,720
- Stop.
- Move, Sai.

376
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,850
- No.
- I said move!

377
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:40,520
No.

378
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,300
- You should move.
- I told you to go away!

379
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,060
Sai!

380
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,220
Ramphueng?

381
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Come!

382
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,040
Your son's alive.

383
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,840
You lied to me

384
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,480
and deceived me, didn't you?

385
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,560
You're trying to impress His Lordship
when he's back, aren't you?

386
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,380
No, ma'am.

387
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,900
Give me your son now.

388
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,200
Give me that boy.

389
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,160
Give me the boy!

390
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,200
Give me! I said...

391
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,640
Go away from me.

392
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,120
No one can take my son from me.

393
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,360
I am the lady of this house.

394
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,120
Whatever I command must be done.

395
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Take the boy.

396
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,320
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,050
- Get the boy.
- Don't take him.

398
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,040
Don't take him away.

399
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,040
My son...

400
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,670
Ma'am...

401
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Ma'am.

402
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,200
Please don't.

403
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,000
Ma'am, please.

404
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,760
Ma'am...

405
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,600
Please don't hurt Young Master, ma'am.

406
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,400
What did you call him?

407
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,480
Young Master, ma'am.

408
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,240
Ma'am...

409
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Ma'am!

410
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,680
Ma'am,

411
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,240
please don't do that.

412
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,260
Ma'am...

413
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,520
What are you trying to do, ma'am?

414
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,040
Ma'am...

415
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,440
Ma'am!

416
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
Let go of me!

417
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,680
He is merely a servant's son.

418
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,040
Only my son
can be the Young Master of this house.

419
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,580
Sai...

420
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,960
Sai...

421
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
Sai!

422
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,680
Why has Ramphueng not arrived?

423
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,240
Could it be that
she has changed her mind?

424
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,680
There she is.

425
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,120
What? What happened, Jik?

426
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,280
Little Mistress...

427
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
She followed you here,

428
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,720
and she's now missing, my lady.

429
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,240
What did you say?

430
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,160
Why should fortune smile upon you?

431
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,800
I have faithfully fulfilled my duties
as a wife for years,

432
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,280
yet you, a mere servant,

433
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,760
dare to take everything from me.

434
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,200
And worse than that,

435
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,840
you're trying to have your son
raised above mine.

436
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,280
That's not true, ma'am.

437
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,679
It is not.

438
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,560
I stand by my word

439
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,320
that my son shall be a servant

440
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,239
and never presume to rival yours.

441
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
You lying bitch!

442
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,040
Ever since the beginning,

443
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,679
your audacity has known no bounds.

444
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,880
Ma'am,

445
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:33,600
you just lost your son.

446
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,840
I'm sure you understand the pain, ma'am.

447
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,159
Please return my baby to me.

448
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,719
I'm begging you, ma'am.

449
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,080
I, too, wish
you could understand my pain.

450
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,199
Since my son was not granted life,

451
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,880
then neither shall yours.

452
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Ma'am...

453
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,920
Ma'am, please.

454
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,440
Ma'am!

455
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,480
Ma'am!

456
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Ma'am...

457
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,520
Ma'am!

458
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
My lady?

459
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,280
My lady...

460
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,580
Lady Kakanang...

461
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,560
Lady Kakanang!

462
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,420
Lock her up

463
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,440
and silence every servant of this house.

464
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,360
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

465
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,960
Go!

466
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,400
Go now.

467
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,860
- I'm not going.
- Go!

468
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,100
No, I'm taking my son back!

469
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,640
Just go.

470
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,240
Come on.

471
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,620
Come.

472
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
Lady Ketkeaw
has informed me of the matter,

473
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,640
yet I shall not heed one side alone.

474
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,360
Tell me, Ramphueng.

475
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,980
Did you really hurl her son
into the river?

476
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,920
Did you tell him that, Ketkeaw?

477
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,360
Do not dare address her
without her proper title!

478
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,560
What actually happened?

479
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,840
Answer me!

480
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,280
My lord, you know very well

481
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,860
the kind of person I am.

482
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,960
How could I be capable
of such a cruel act?

483
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,480
Had it been in former days,

484
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,960
I would have believed that.

485
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,120
Yet I was told that

486
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,520
after she lost her son,

487
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,240
she lost her mind as well,

488
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,520
turning to opium.

489
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,040
And when I conceived

490
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,520
and bore my son,

491
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,480
she came to steal him away to kill.

492
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,400
Liar.

493
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,680
How shamelessly
you spin your lies, Ketkeaw!

494
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
Ramphueng,

495
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,600
mind the words you speak.

496
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,820
You told me

497
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,960
you would not heed one side alone,

498
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,040
didn't you, my lord?

499
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,040
Madam, driven by envy

500
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,600
after her own son died
immediately after birth,

501
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
she attacked me

502
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,800
and took my son...

503
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,320
to kill, my lord.

504
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
So it was your son?

505
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,240
Yes, my lord.

506
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,560
That's not true.

507
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,960
Our son was born in perfect health,

508
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,000
leaving me weak.

509
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,840
Yet it was Ramphueng

510
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,520
who seized the opportunity
to abduct him.

511
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Even Lady Kakanang and Krongkwan
came to visit us.

512
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,320
The servants,
thinking she merely wished to see me,

513
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,720
let her in,

514
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,560
not knowing that

515
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,680
she intended to kill our son.

516
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
That's not true.

517
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,240
Is this true,

518
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
my lady?

519
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,800
Do you remember your two elder sisters?

520
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,340
Those who are
Lady Radamanee's daughters.

521
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,440
They were sent to their grandparents
in Suphan Buri

522
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,080
after their mother fell ill
and passed away.

523
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,440
Do you remember them?

524
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,160
Yes, Mother.

525
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,280
In truth, her death

526
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,800
was caused by Madam.

527
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,800
As long as you stay here,

528
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,080
you must never give her
any cause for displeasure.

529
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,680
Yes, my lord.

530
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,800
My daughter and I...

531
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,600
went to see Madam that night.

532
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,640
That's not true.

533
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,550
It's not true, my lord.

534
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,760
That night, they were there with us.

535
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,600
Both of you

536
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,760
witnessed everything she did,

537
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,640
yet why are you lying?

538
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,440
Little Mistress...

539
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,880
Little Mistress Krongkwan,

540
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,880
you saw it, too, didn't you?

541
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,800
Ramphueng...

542
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,160
You saw it, didn't you?

543
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,920
Please help me, Little Mistress.

544
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,480
Please, Little Mistress. Please help me.

545
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,040
Krongkwan,

546
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,120
come here.

547
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,480
Tell me.

548
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,320
What did you see last night?

549
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,320
Do you understand?

550
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,400
But if I lie,

551
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,680
will Auntie Ramphueng die?

552
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,320
But if you tell the truth,

553
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,240
what will become of Jik and Iam?

554
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,680
Little Mistress...

555
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,360
We may be safe,

556
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,200
protected by our titles,

557
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,760
but our servants

558
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,680
shall surely lose their heads.

559
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,400
I saw Auntie Ramphueng...

560
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,800
hurl the boy into the river.

561
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,920
No.

562
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,840
That's not true.

563
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,760
No, it's not true.

564
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,840
No...

565
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,440
Madam!

566
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,300
The person who delivered opium
to Mistress Ramphueng has been captured.

567
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,080
That's not me.

568
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,560
Not at all.

569
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,080
It has nothing to do with me.

570
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,720
These wretches are accusing me.

571
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,040
They're lying, my lord.

572
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,160
They're framing me.

573
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,320
It's not true, my lord.

574
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,720
- Don't fall for them.
- Take this wretch away

575
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,680
and have her flogged to death!

576
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,240
Don't believe them. Let me go.

577
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,640
- Go.
- Let go of me!

578
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,400
Go away.

579
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,720
All of you are wretches.

580
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,040
You all are!

581
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,680
Every last one of you.

582
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,080
I shall remember all of you,

583
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,560
every single one,

584
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,400
and lay a curse upon you all...

585
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,120
Flog her!

586
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,400
- Now!
- May you all die a violent death.

587
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,280
Just you wait.

588
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,200
You are all cursed to die!

589
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,880
You filthy bitch!

590
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,520
You damned wretch!

591
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,800
Look.

592
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,920
See it.

593
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,360
See what I had to go through.

594
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,800
I place my curse upon you all.

595
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,720
May your line

596
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,240
be struck with misfortune,

597
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,640
with no sons to carry your name.

598
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,280
If you die,

599
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,640
may you be reborn,

600
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,680
and I shall claim my vengeance.

601
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,240
Should you be reborn as a woman,

602
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,080
may you...

603
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,400
suffer separation from your beloved,

604
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,920
either by being parted

605
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,560
or by death,

606
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,760
as I was parted from my son.

607
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,160
And should you be reborn a man,

608
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,240
may death claim you

609
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,360
at twenty-one,

610
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,200
as it now claims me.

611
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,160
Mom?

612
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,800
Mom...

613
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,880
Where are you?

614
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,120
I've been waiting for you every day.

615
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,680
Why don't you come back?

616
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,240
Look around you.

617
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,880
They've all paid for what they did to me
in every lifetime.

618
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,400
No...

619
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,200
Wat...

620
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,920
You can't die this way.

621
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,560
You can't leave me, Wat.

622
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,120
All have faced their karma,

623
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,040
except you.

624
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,600
You're the last one.

625
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,600
Only then

626
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,080
will my hatred finally fade.

627
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:18,510

636
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,720
Master,

637
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,000
what happened to you?

638
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,400
Don't worry about me.

639
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,200
Where is Grandma Si?

640
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,200

- Khem.
- Khem!

645
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:19,600
Calm down, Khem.

646
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,400
Khem!

647
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,640
Khem, are you alright?

648
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,520
Khem,

649
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,240
what happened?

650
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,920
It's Ramphueng.

651
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,280
What did she do?

652
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,000
She possessed Grandma Si.

653
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,480
Grandma Si!

654
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,360
- Grandma...
- Grandma...

655
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,400
- Grandma!
- No...

656
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,440
Go get Uncle Chai.

657
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,420
Grandma Si!

658
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,720
I told you to go get him.

659
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,360
And call an ambulance.

660
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,760
An elder drowned.

661
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,120
Yes.

662
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,200
Can you please hurry?

663
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,060
Please.

664
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,360
Please move.

665
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,880
Check her pulse, please.

666
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,560
That's enough, Khem.

667
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,240
No.

668
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,680
It hasn't been twenty minutes.

669
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,480
She might make it.

670
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,080
Trust me.

671
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,320
Grandma...

672
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,200
That's enough.

No.

676
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,320
It can't end like this.

677
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,480
Wake up, Grandma.

678
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,840
I told you to stop.

699
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,240
Si,

700
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,360
may you find peace

701
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,160
and reach a better realm.

702
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,040
Hello.

703
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,760
Come inside.

704
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,560
No one's blaming you.

705
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,360
Come on.

706
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,080

00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,200
I can't.

709
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,960
Si left this letter for me.

710
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,520
It seems she had a heart condition

711
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,200
and likely passed away the day before.

712
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,520
[Please take care

must have taken over her body.

715
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,080
I thought I should tell you

716
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,200
that her passing

717
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,560
had nothing to do with you.

718
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,160
The villagers
are also aware of this truth,

719
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,960

721
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,680
where you intend to stay?

722
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,920

my fellow monks and the abbot

723

748
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,680
Can you not go?

749
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,080
I've made up my mind.

750
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,880
Please let me be with him.

751
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,220
Thank you so much for everything.

752
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,800
Goodbye, Khem, Jet.

753
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,880
Please tell Charn I said goodbye.

754
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,240
Ake...

755
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,000
I'm really sorry.

756
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,360
Ake...

757
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,720
I'm sorry.

758
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,400
You know,

759
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,920
when I was little,

760
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,660
every time I sneaked out,

761
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,120
Grandma Si always helped me
get away with it.

762
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,320
And Thong and Ake...

763
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,840
They knew I had no friends,

764
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,900
so they became ones.

765
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,260
I understand

766
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,800
you're grieving, Jet,

767
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,960
but everyone has found peace.

768
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,800
If they looked from up above

769
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,080
and saw you not feeling cheerful,

770
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,040
they would worry about you.

771
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,840
No matter what happens,

772
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,200
you'll still have me by your side.

773
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,440
As a friend.

774
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,040
We have no idea what lies ahead.

775
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,240
I guess you'd want to take a break
from us for now, right?

776
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,640
Thank you

777
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,920
for understanding me.

778
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,960
Once things with Khem are settled,

779
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:07,940
we can continue where we left off.

780
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:14,400
When that time comes,

781
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,200
let's make everything clear between us.

782
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,360
For now,

783
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,040
let's just be best friends.

784
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,320
Uncle Chai...

785
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,000
Oh, Khem?

786
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,040
What is it?

787
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,860
I'd like to...

788
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,780
ask for your help.

789
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,120
Master?

790
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,520
Am I your master again now?

791
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,040
Uh...

792
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,680
I'm sorry.

793
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,280
I was just...

794
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,120
Please don't go, Khem.

795
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,600
Be with me.

796
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,760
But Grandma Si,

797
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,560
Thong,

798
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,210
and even Ake...

799
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,360
Everyone you loved

800
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,240
is gone because of me.

801
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,720
Grandma Si's time had just come.

802
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,520
And Thong and Ake...

803
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,720
were meant to be reborn long ago.

804
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,680
I was making them stay.

805
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,600
No,

806
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:48,580
that's not true.

807
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,040
It's me.

808
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,520
It's my fault.

809
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,220
You know very well, Khem,

810
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,310
that it's not like that.

811
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,280
But...

812
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,920
I don't think I can face anyone anymore.

813
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,560
I have no one left, Khem.

814
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,520
Please stay with me.

815
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,800
Peem...

816
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:43,260
I'm sorry.

817
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:22,800
Peem!

818
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:31,399
I'm okay.

819
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,479
Peem!

820
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,000
Ramphueng's power is still affecting me,

821
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,560
but it should fade in a day or two.

822
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:03,740
Don't worry.

823
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,859
She's in so much pain as well.

824
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,960
She'll probably lie low for a while

825
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,920
and won't show up anytime soon.

826
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:28,100
I'm most worried about you.

827
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,000
Then don't leave me, Khem.

828
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,120
Khem...

829
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,640
Peem,

830
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,820
I truly thank you for everything.

831
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,440
Every moment I've spent with you

832
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:33,120
has made my life worth living.

833
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,040
You let me experience a kind of love

834
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,720
I never thought I'd have.

835
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,440
[Jet]

836
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,080
I've been surrounded
by people who love me,

837
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,560
and it makes me feel so lucky
to have been born.

838
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,120
Is he picking up, Jet?

839
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,240
Let's borrow someone's car.

840
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,000
Okay.

841
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,480
Even if I don't make it past tomorrow,

842
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,120
I won't regret a thing.

843
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:09,930
Uh... Bangkok, please.

844
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:12,260
The next train comes at 2:50 P.M.

845
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:13,340
Thank you.

846
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,960
I'm not giving up.

847
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,840
But from now on,

848
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,640
I'll find my own way,

849
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,660
so no one else gets hurt because of me.

850
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,600
May every day ahead of you

851
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,580
be full of smiles, Peem.

852
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,800
Khem!

853
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:52,880
I'm sorry, Jet,

854
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,520
but I can't bear losing anyone again.

855
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,680
We're coming with you, then.

856
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,760
Khem's birthday is in seven days.

857
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,000
If he makes it until then,

858
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,160
the curse will be lifted.

859
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,400
Are you sure you can handle this

860
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,800
without your master?

861
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,960
He's already lost so much for me.

862
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,760
- Khemjira must survive!
- Khemjira must survive!

863
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,240
(Chanting)

864
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Khem,

865
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,360
don't give up yet.

866
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:36,390
♫One day you'll taste
the pain I've known,♫

867
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:43,010
♫Fall for the lies of a heart of stone♫

868
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:50,250
♫Your life will be shattered
by the one by your side,♫

869
01:15:50,480 --> 01:16:02,050
♫Only then will you see through my eyes♫
