Since filming the DMD series,

00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,420
this has been the crew
that's done the most good deeds.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,340
But it's also so beautiful and sacred,\nI still get goosebumps talking about it now.

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,380
In “Khemjira,” Khemjira is truly incredible.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,820
That short two-minute scene you all saw

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,220
actually took us a full hour to shoot.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,220
It was a certain kind of fate

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,860
that allowed us to meet.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,340
This opportunity means so much to me.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,780
It feels like a huge challenge.

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,180
Many scenes were done so realistically... absolutely stunning.

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,700
This is a series everyone poured their hearts into.

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,340

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,380
It seemed like something Brother Aof suddenly started,

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,820
and then he told me there was a novel

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,620
[Keng Harit Buayoi as Pharan]

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,700
that would suit me perfectly.

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,780
That novel is truly a masterpiece.

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,660
I looked it up right away and... wow... it had so many readers.

22
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,660
My first question was,

[Namping Napatsakorn Pingmuang as Khemjira]

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,980
“Cali,” the author... has she only ever written this one book?

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,420
It's like she gathered every trending element...

26
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,140
witchcraft, folk customs, all of it.

27
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,420
Any one of those could be a highlight in a drama,

28
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,060
but she packed them all into this one.

29
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,460
So the richness of this series is off the charts.

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,300
It's not just about characters people love that keep them watching.

31
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,539
It weaves in a Thai witchcraft storyline,

32
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:48,500
a chilling atmosphere, and Isaan folklore.

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,820
Or maybe you could call it Thai soft power... it made me understand why so many people read it.

[Co-producer & Director Kittiphat Jumba]

36
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:00,740
especially from my colleagues and friends.

37
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:06,780
They'd all say, “Hey, try reading this,” or “Get the rights and make it into a series.”

38
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,300
Everyone said it was interesting,

39
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,940
and after reading it myself, I agreed.

40
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,740
For me, adapting it into a series would be a new experience.

41
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,220
But maybe the timing wasn't right back then.

42
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,980
Then one day, the opportunity came, and I had to take on “Khemjira.”

43
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,700
I got to talk to the author, and it felt right.

44
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,860
So DMD would carry on... and we'd film it.

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,420
That's how the project got rolling.

46
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,860
I was thrilled.

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,660
But you know what comes with excitement?

Overwhelming pressure.

49
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,900
Because this story already had a loyal group of hardcore fans,

50
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,940
and I had to interpret it in DMD's own style.

51
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,500
This was also the first book I ever read

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,780
where the plot completely pulled me along,

53
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,700
like I was binge-watching a show in my head.

54

to get a general sense of it,

58
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,900
so I could understand the characters for the pilot.

59
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,860
But I ended up becoming hooked...

60
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,860
reading not for work, but as a captivated fan.

61
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,020

Simply put, it was fascinating and fresh... even in the BL circle, it felt new.

I knew right away the project would be challenging,

64

fantastical elements.

70
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,420
Like I've said before, I love a challenge, so I was in.

71
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,260
I really wanted to bring it to life.

72
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,940
At its core it's still a love story,

73
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,220
but one wrapped in a world of witchcraft...

74
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,260
rooted in faith and Isaan culture.

75
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,260
Let me be clear: I was born and raised in Bangkok,

76
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,020
so telling an Isaan story

77
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:20,899
isn't something I have more right to do than an Isaan native... especially since the author is from there.

78
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,900
They have the absolute authority to tell their own stories.

79
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,420
So in my position, there's always some nerves...

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,780
the excited kind,

81
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,020
knowing I have to film it well and truly care about the people living on that land.

82
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,140
I can't be some Bangkok outsider looking at Isaan from afar.

83
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,900
So I had to actually go there,

84
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,380
to really learn how people live.

85
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,900
It forced me to constantly check the book:

86
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,620
“Is this right? How should this ritual be done?”

87
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,060
And then go ask the locals... ask the people who actually perform them.

88
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,060
For example, in soul-calling rituals,

89
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,500
the tools used vary from place to place.

90
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,220
In Ubon, we used what Ubon uses...

91
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,340
only to find that one village does it differently from the next.

92
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,740
So which version should we use? Was the ritual accurate?

93
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,780
We had to prepare an incredible amount.

every line of dialogue...

97

incantations, customs...

98
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,740
what's real, what's fictional,

101
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,540
Because sometimes, if we don't understand a line,

102

strange things could actually happen.

103
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,420
We couldn't always tell who was “good” or “bad,”

104
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,300
or if we were offending anyone unseen.

105
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,860

I wanted to include that in the pilot.

112
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:09,060
Or if Brother Aof wanted to add a forest ritual that went beyond the original,

113
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,180
I had to search and verify... does it exist, could we use it?

When adapting a novel professionally,

115
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,420
the biggest thing in crossing disciplines

116
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,620
is knowing each field has its own “grammar”

117
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,060
and way of telling a story.

118
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,540
Novels excel at using words to make readers imagine,

119
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,700
so I could push descriptions

120
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,100
to the limit.

and I knew the time had come.

145

The author gave the rights,

146
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,900

Romantic scenes aren't exactly easy for me.

There are plenty of actors who are amazing at them,

but I'm the type…

151

I've always thought I was pretty open emotionally...

152
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,100
I mean, I can let myself cry when I'm sensitive.

153
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,140
But sometimes I've been used to hiding emotions...

154

thinking there's no need to cry

155

or feel too much over certain things.

Through training, I've learned to accept myself more, to follow my feelings.

Because this is Khemjira,

158
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,740
Khemjira had to be in every scene.

159
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,540
And it was exhausting.

And emotionally...

He doesn't believe in acting aids...

166
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,500
he's a pure method actor.

167
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,500
That means he cries for real every time.

168

Khemjira has to endure hardship his whole life.

169
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,380

Amazing, Khem.

179
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,100
Since DMD Friendship,

180
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,980
I've known this younger brother has real skill.

181
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,500
I've been waiting for him... waiting for him to truly act.

182
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,820
Because when we finally worked together,

183
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,260
I saw he's incredibly capable.

184
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,900
He works so hard... I hardly ever hear him complain.

185
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,220
Every time we talk, he says,

186
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,340
“Keng, this is the project I've been waiting for.”

187
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,780
Namping's acting is superb... whenever he plays Khem,

188
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,580
[Tle Matimun Sreeboonrueang as Chanwit]

189
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,300
Khem naturally makes you want to save him.

190
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,260
Why would someone be cursed like this?

191
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,380
Does life really have to be so cruel?

192
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,060
He nailed every scene.

193
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,980
Acting opposite him, I never had to worry about his performance... his emotions were always on point.

194
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,980
Khem also gave me so much inspiration about love.

195
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,700
With love as your guide, even the darkest life somehow finds hope again...

196
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,580
like a wisp of wind that feels unreal until you realize it's truly there.

197
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,860
As long as there's love and hope in your heart, life can go on.

198
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,740
That's why I like Khem so much.

199
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,140
Khem himself is such a positive person.

200
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,180
It also brings positive energy to others.

201
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,460
Namping is the same.

202
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,220
Mm, so it's no wonder the audience loves Khem...

203
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:35,660
after all, we love this younger brother and this character so much.

204
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,820
Incantation.

205
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,380
Incantation.

206
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,580
Keng, don't you and the sorcerer look alike?

207
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,260
Wow, if we're just talking appearance,

208
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,940
he actually matches the novel's cover quite well.

209
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,980
I don't know what kind of force it was

210
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,060
that drew him to play the sorcerer.

211
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,820
Because if it were me, walking past and seeing a poster of him as the sorcerer,

212
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,820
I'd definitely be like “Whoa,” just like…

213
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,460
Whoa...

214
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,740
so there really are people who look like characters from novels.

215
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,340
I tend to see things from a single angle,

216
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,220
very flat.

217
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,300
But I forgot he's also just an ordinary person like me.

218
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,300
I think every character's foundation has to have humanity.

219
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,740
Any role can resonate with me...

220
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,540
it's just a matter of how I shape the character

221
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,740
and build their background.

222
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,660
That's all.

223
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,740
The sense of the character has to be spot-on.

224
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,500
And my younger brother trained so much for this series.

225
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,060
Because I remember after he filmed the pilot,

226
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,060
people wanted him to tweak this and that.

227
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,780
So he kept doing his homework,

228
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,340
and by now, everything he trained for

229
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,780
is ingrained in his bones.

230
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,100
It's amazing... watching him act, I kept thinking,

231
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,780
“Wow, Keng.”

232
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,220
One way or another, this sorcerer is bound to make certain people in the country fight to be ghosts.

233
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,500
At first, I thought, “This is nothing like me...

234
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,180
I can't imagine how to play it.”

235
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,340
But once filming started and I built the background,

236
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,020
I felt like the role was becoming a part of me.

237
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:27,220
Because this character looks mature on the outside but is naïve and pure inside.

238
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,860
What he truly feels is one thing,

239
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,620
but what he shows is another.

240
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,620
He's also a risk-taker.

241
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,540
This was his first time truly playing a lead...

242
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,380
and in such a highly anticipated script.

243
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,380
I often told him, “Keng,

244
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,780
sorcerers like Pharan really exist.

245
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,220
There are real people like this.

246
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,660
So you have to respect the profession

247
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,940
and the believers.”

248
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,070
His biggest advantage is that he's already a teacher...

249
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,300
he has a natural teacher's aura.

250
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,460
In scenes where he's instructing others

251
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,060
or interacting with kids, it's all natural,

252
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,060
completely instinctive.

253
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,100
All we had to do was amplify his sternness and depth.

254
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,020
Pharan's sternness isn't innate... there's a reason behind it.

255
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,540
Once he understood that reason,

256
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,340
he acted it well... not just yelling,

257
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,660
but showing a fear hidden beneath.

258
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:34,100
Incantation.

259
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,140
Incantation.

260
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,780
Incantation.

261
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,500
And he became the sorcerer.

262
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,140
The moment “Action” was called...

263
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,780
Action!...

264
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,820
I truly believed Keng was the sorcerer.

265
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,500
He's the kind of person who earns genuine respect,

266
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,860
someone you can rely on, someone who can truly protect us.

267
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,020
That's the real feeling.

268
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:06,300
Honestly, I've almost never felt like I couldn't understand him.

269
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,020
Because every time I played Pharan,

270
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,220
after the director called “Cut,” I would self-reflect.

271
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,620
I'd think,

272
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,380
“If I were in Pharan's place, I'd make the exact same choices.”

273
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,620
This entire speech

274
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,220
was all Keng's lines.

275
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,980
I once memorized 365 pages of dialogue

276
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,060
and didn't remember a single one.

277
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,620
He didn't even need us to feed him the Isaan lines... he found them himself.

278
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,220
He asked friends and colleagues.

279
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,020
Even though we had a team to check, he came fully prepared.

280
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,980
We only had to check which tones he slipped on.

281
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,500
Pharan is from Ubon,

282
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:58,020
and the Ubon accent is different from other parts of Isaan.

283
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,580
I was lucky to have Ubon friends,

284
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,420
and there were Ubon colleagues in the crew.

285
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,020
So every time we were on set or about to roll,

286
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,500
I'd do my homework...

287
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,940
write Thai phonetics,

288
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,380
like karaoke subtitles,

289
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,140
and mark the tones

290
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,740
so I knew how to pronounce them.

291
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,060
Chanwit was played by Tle.

292
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,300
At first, I didn't expect him to act so well.

293
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,700
He's the super-cute homebody type

294
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,260
that drama fans would adore.

295
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:42,140
Uh, even watching from my seat, I felt this character was just so interesting.

296
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:47,060
He acted in a way that convinced me he was that charming, nerdy type.

297
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,420
Wow, when I first found out I'd be in this series, I was so excited...

298
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,660
because the character is nothing like me.

299
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,220
You could say Khemjira is my first series,

300
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,460
so it's hard to even put it into words.

301
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,859
When I knew I'd play the part, I thought, “Okay, I'll give it everything I've got.

302
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,780
I'll shape Chanwit as best as I can.”

303
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:12,940
Off-camera, we call Tle the “Top Student” of the royal class,

304
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,260
because his prep work is exceptional.

305
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,619
The newbies are all well-prepared and knowledgeable,

306
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,540
but Tle is like the valedictorian.

307
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,180
The first thing I did was research what kind of person Chanwit is.

308
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,300
If he were just an ordinary guy, how would he live?

309
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,060
What pet would he have? What books would he read?

310
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,420
What would he be like at home, and in social settings? What kind of friends?

311
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,620
It's just like studying for a course...

312
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,580
I had to research everything about him.

313
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,260
Mm.

314
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:50,220
It was all so the book fans' beloved Chanwit
could be portrayed in the most vivid way.

315
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,300
Tle has a strong presence and piercing eyes.

316
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,140
And during filming, his sense of timing was incredible.

317
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,460
His rhythm was sharp and precise.

318
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,100
Like I said, all the characters in this series

319
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,460
are very different from the actors themselves.

320
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,660
And we had to bring those characters together on screen.

321
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,500
The more we acted together, the harder it was to get into character at first.

322
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,740
So there was a stage... those first few scenes...

323
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,740
where I thought, “Wow, this is hard.”

324
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,700
Even if it was just the sorcerer, Khem, Jet, and Chan sitting and talking indoors...

325
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:32,420
the first take, I thought, “Why is this so hard?
Why does it feel like we're talking past each other?”

326
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,460
But after a few more takes,

327
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,020
everyone started to understand their own roles better.

328
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,700
That's when I realized
which scenes would be difficult in this series.

329
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,100
But when we filmed them,
everyone slipped into character instantly,

330
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,740
and it all became simple.

331
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,580
That time we got it in one take...

332
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,700
we were all satisfied with our performances in it.

333
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,340
It felt like the scenes that were once so hard
became easy once we were in the zone.

334
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,820
But early on, it really felt impossibly hard.

335
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,500
Right.

336
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,180
Tay.

337
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,620
Korn.

338
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,260
Phu.

339
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,820
Come on out.

340
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,740
Yeah, come on.

341
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,960
Everyone else is about to lose it.

342
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,300
Jet is played by FirstOne... to me, his acting feels natural.

343
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,180
He's practically playing himself.

344
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,700
He's the fun-maker of the series,

345
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,500
and he's always had a strong sense for acting.

346
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,060
The moment I see him, I can tell he's not “acting”...

347
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,260
he's being the character.

348
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,500
I think the audience will fall for him instantly.

349
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,460
Jettana is...

350
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,740
[FirstOne Wannakorn Reungrat as Jettana]

351
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,780
above all, someone who deeply loves his friends. He adores them.

352
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,300
He won't let anyone hurt Khem... no one can even get close.

353
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,860
If anyone comes within two meters of Khem, he charges in and intercepts.

354
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,300
He's super outgoing,

355
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,140
able to hype up a whole room by himself.

356
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,260
Cut... let me grab that.

357
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,140
Thanks.

358
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,060
First is Jet... a perfect match.

359
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,180
On the day of the table read,

360
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,220
Tle couldn't find the training room,

361
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,260
so First went to look for him, found him,

362
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,260
and brought him there.

363
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,460
They walked in the door and immediately started bickering:

364
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,580
“Tle, I told you to wait right there... why'd you come looking for me? I was looking for you!”

365
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,780
“Oh, I was worried you'd get lost, so I just…”

366
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,540
They walked in arguing... exactly like Jet and Chan.

367
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,980
I was like, “Wow, this is it, Aof.”

368
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,540
This CP is spot-on.

369
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,260
First is truly talented,

370
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,740
born for acting.

371
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,620
His acting is incredibly natural...

372
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,140
expressions, body language,

373
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,860
movements, humor... everything is there.

374
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,340
His acting instincts are strong.

375
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,860
In the series, there are incantations...

376
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,140
real incantations that can drive away spirits.

377
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,980
So it took a lot of effort to memorize the lines.

378
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,340
Because they're real, I had to recite them perfectly.

379
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,620
If I messed up even slightly, it wouldn't do.

380
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,780
I had to memorize every word exactly,

381
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,220
with perfect precision.

382
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,060
For the playful parts, he just let loose...

383
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,540
playful in such a cute way, teasing everyone and joining in all the jokes.

384
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,700
He blended right in with the crew,

385
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,260
chatting and playing non-stop.

386
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,900
When it was time to film,

387
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,620
he'd say, “Let's go, come on,”

388
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,620
and quiet down immediately.

389
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,740
Even when he sprained his ankle,

390
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,900
he said he could walk... but I knew he couldn't.

391
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,620
So I used blocking and camera angles to help him.

392
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,060
That just shows...

393
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:54,100
even if he seems all laughs,

394
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,780
he's not a careless person.

395
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,060
I think he's the most fitting person for Jettana.

396
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,920
If you watch the series, you'll definitely fall in love with Jettana.

397
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,740
I'm lucky to have worked with these two,

398
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,420
because they're both incredible.

399
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,380
Although their screen time wasn't very long,

400
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,980
their talent was at full throttle.

401
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,940
Whether in acting or anything else, they gave it their all.

402
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,020
They hadn't acted in many films or TV dramas before,

403
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,780
but their rhythm made me feel I couldn't afford not to take it seriously...

404
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,500
because they were so serious themselves.

405
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,020
The person...

406
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,020
the ghost Ramphueng... was played by Green Ausadaporn.

407
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,340
She is the soul of this series.

408
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,420
You might have seen her in the pilot.

409
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,740
Wow... when she appeared,

410
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,100
the impact of her very first words was huge.

411
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,660
This is Brother Aof's project, and I'd worked with Brother Aof and Ron before.

412
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,620
[Green Ausadaporn Siriwattanakul as Ramphueng]

413
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,260
We'd collaborated even before DMD.

414
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,660
I told Brother Aof, “If you let me act,

415
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,980
give me a role where I can really perform.”

416
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,260
It looked fun, and the character had strong layers.

417
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,500
From an actor's perspective, when I receive a script,

418
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,020
I look at how rich the character is... what's worth portraying.

419
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,140
How I want to play it, how I'll reinterpret it... this is the joy of acting.

420
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,460
It's also one of the reasons I took this role.

421
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,540
Everyone gets goosebumps from her performance.

422
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,420
In every scene, her emotions hit the mark.

423
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,140
I'm truly grateful that Khemjira has Green.

424
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,940
She is the key to how eerie and captivating this series can be.

425
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,100
The way Ramphueng's love and hate intertwine...

426
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,900
she's not actually a bad person.

427
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,340
It's just that the people there hurt her first.

428
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,020
That's what gave rise to her hatred,

429
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,020
turning it into a curse.

430
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:55,100
Acting opposite Green, I froze completely...

431
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,650
her presence is so powerful that even just standing still, she scared me.

432
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,550
But I realized I had to start doing my homework.

433
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:06,150
Because the sorcerer's role is written for a constant back-and-forth,

434
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,950
meaning that if Green came on strong, I had to match her

435
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,150
and hit back even harder...

436
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,100
because we had to subdue her, something like that.

437
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,670
As for the character Chayos,

438
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,680
he's played by Pung, a brand-new rookie...

439
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,320
even newer than Keng and Namping.

440
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,520
In terms of experience, this really was his first series,

441
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,820
making him extremely new to the industry.

442
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:33,550
Wow, you could say Pung

443
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,570
was fresh out of the gate.

444
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,680
[Pung Phirunwat Promrat as Chayos]

445
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,200
I felt so excited.

446
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:45,920
As the newest addition to DoMunDi,

447
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,420
I was thrilled.

448
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,350
The opportunity before me was huge... truly huge.

449
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,800
I saw it as a life-changing chance.

450
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:03,920
Joining Khemjira was also a big challenge.

451
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,800
But this younger brother gave everything to win the role.

452
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:14,650
He worked hard at acting... even without knowing much...

453
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,870
but he showed us he could do it, and we believed.

454
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,420
Now, anyone who's seen him act...

455
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,970
once it's edited... gets goosebumps.

456
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,730
“Wow, is this really a rookie?”

457
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,350
At first, it felt hard... really hard for me.

458
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,820
I'd never encountered a ghost, so I didn't know that feeling.

459
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,300
But it was an interesting role,

460
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,950
one that required a lot of homework...

461
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,600
in acting, emotional scenes,

462
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:49,070
action scenes... everything.

463
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,270
I had to learn and research,

464
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:57,350
with Teacher Den helping me and many seniors in the crew

465
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,750
giving full support and guidance.

466
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,680
He's from the North, with a pure northern dialect.

467
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,530
It can be trained out,

468
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,850
but it takes time.

469
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,450
Abroad, it might take a year or two

470
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,670
to master the standard official language...

471
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,220
but he had only three months, so we trained him intensively in all areas.

472
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,850
It was like compressing a four-year acting degree into three months.

473
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,620
He was incredibly hardworking,

474
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,670
putting in as much effort as Keng.

475
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:33,850
So for him, it had to succeed.

476
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:38,520
Pung's eye acting is excellent.

477
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,570
When he conveys emotion, it's like wind slamming into your face...

478
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,220
a direct hit.

479
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,600
How does someone achieve that?

480
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,350
For someone who's never studied acting,

481
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,900
I dare say Pung will become

482
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:03,870
an actor people remember.

483
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,450
For casting this series, we had Aomtimator handle it.

484
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,170
For example, Noknawy's grandmother role was the hardest to find...

485
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,500
we needed someone who could truly speak Isaan dialect

486
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,870
and sing blessing songs.

487
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,270
The casting team said the requirements were too specific...

488
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,720
should we train someone instead?

489
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:29,000
We said we preferred a real Isaan person.

490
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,950
We finally found the perfect match in Noknawy.

491
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,250
She's truly from Isaan,

492
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,400
and her addition gave the series

493
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,600
authenticity and a sacred feel.

494
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,300
She's so loving, treating the kids like her own grandchildren.

495
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,600
The role of Khemmika had to be Janis...

496
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,950
I couldn't think of anyone else.

497
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:58,250
Janis is usually lively, cute, and funny,

498
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,600
but her acting is powerful.

499
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:09,500
She needs roles that are delicate, realistic,

500
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,450
and give her room to perform.

501
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,820
It was part of our earlier “similar face” casting search.

502
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,550
Some people felt… close, but no one was as unique as Tle and First.

503
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,770
Tle and First have distinctive looks.

504
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,850
Someone who knew them

505
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,920
thought they looked exactly like the characters,

506
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,720
so they sent over photos.

507
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,500
One look and I gasped... it was uncanny.

508
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,270
My god, the resemblance was unbelievable.

509
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,750
It had to be these two.

510
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,850
[Prayers to the gods of heaven and earth]

511
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:54,120
May the entire Khemjira cast and crew be safe.

512
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,500
May we reach the other shore in peace.

513
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,330
May the series be a hit, with wealth flowing in,

514
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,550
free from disaster,

515
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,650
all wishes fulfilled with sincerity.

516
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,520
When we went to Ubon to do merit-making,

517
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,420
a senior monk at the temple reminded us

518
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,520
that the lead actors and core team of Khemjira...

519
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,920
including the director... must perform rituals before every scene.

520
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,770
Not just offering incense,

521
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,300
but bowing to the ground to ask forgiveness,

522
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:35,120
to apologize to the local spirits of the land.

523
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,120
When the crew went to the temple for blessings,

524
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,850
at a classic location from the novel where Khem stands,

525
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:51,050
a senior monk reminded the crew

526
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,370
that the actor playing Khemjira
must perform a ritual before every scene.

527
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,650
When we first heard this, everyone was startled.

528
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,800
This warning kept us respectful at all times.

529
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,070
We didn't know what might happen.

530
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,170
This role is marked with ill fate,

531
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,350
filled with supernatural elements.

532
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,420
Not just anyone can play it...

533
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:18,020
it requires true protective power.

534
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,540
We had to worship sincerely before each shoot,

535
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:27,370
performing full rituals to ensure smooth progress.

536
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,650
It's like asking a homeowner's permission before entering their house.

537
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:36,050
We borrowed the land humbly.

538
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,820
Touching the ground with our foreheads helped us focus.

539
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,470
Connecting with Mother Earth's energy

540
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:52,670
gave us the grounding to face the day's challenges.

541
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,320
There were many outdoor scenes...

542
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,950
like forest scenes.

543
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,670
Even the sorcerer's house was half outdoors.

544
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,050
It was hard to film when it rained.

545
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,500
We had our “magic director”

546
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,550
and a team dedicated to rituals,

547
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:21,670
who would raise the red flags our crew uses

548
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,150
to pray for no rain.

549
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,300
When filming a faith-themed series,

550
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:33,300
if the location has strong spiritual energy or a presence,

551
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:37,020
you can get goosebumps the whole time.

552
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,070
We're still on the path of spiritual practice.

553
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,300
Even now, we must keep accumulating merit.

554
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,270
This series must be completed without harm.

555
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,650
But right now, everyone around us is struggling.

556
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,170
To the whole crew and cast... keep going.

557
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,900
Everyone needs deep research,

558
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,170
because this is a real belief system.

[Self-help scripture for merit and fate-changing]

560
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,150

whether scouting locations,

562
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:12,620
consulting villagers and belief experts,

563
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,570
or perfecting costume details...

564
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,370
all departments worked closely together.

565
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,880
Sets, art, costumes...

566
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,950
everything had to coordinate perfectly.

567
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,620
Makeup and styling had their own details.

568
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,470

some had real runes,

571
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:34,000
so we consulted experts

572
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,350
to design them

573
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,420
with genuine protective meaning.

574
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,520
The originals were Bodhicitta talismans or five-Buddha amulets,

575
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,950
mainly for protection from disasters.

576
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,270
There were also various silver rings with meaning...

577
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,700
black onyx stones or cross-patterned rings

578
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,100
also carried protective symbolism.

579
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:05,750
The pilot version largely recreated the novel's illustrated compositions, adding creative touches.

580
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:10,300
The official series was upgraded and refined.

581

582
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,420
Hot handled the Naga dragon elements.

583

We wanted to show a specific art style.

584
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,700

592
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,430
For ceremonial costumes,

593
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,970
the clothes were truly sourced from Ubon.

594
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,100
The sorcerer's clothes came from Ubon.

595
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,500
We inspected Ubon in person,

596
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,600
observed villagers' festival attire,

597
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:10,850
and collected fabrics with local motifs, like lotus patterns.

598
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,800
For example, the grandmother's clothing...

599
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,500
with diamond and honeycomb patterned fabric.

The grandmother's clothing...

the pajama designs in this series are truly unique.

602
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,000
In most series, pajamas aren't a focus,

603
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,570
but here they appear in over 50% of the scenes.

604
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,270
Since much of the story takes place at night,

605
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:38,150
the pajamas had to match each character's personality.

606
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,270
This part was really fun.

00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,270
In the early episodes, Chanwit wears matching pajama sets,

608
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,550
reflecting his bookish personality.

natural-style shirts and wrap pants,

617
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:21,200
in cotton and linen, with earthy tones.

We clearly set the story in Ubon.

620
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,450
We needed authentic landmarks,

621
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,450
so we had to film on location.

622

Since no Isaan house fit the setting,

627

It took nearly half a year to find a location matching the novel...

629
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,820
it was that hard.

630
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:04,120
Simply put, there was almost no ready-made location to shoot in.

631

00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:17,070
How high is the stilt level? How is the house built?

635
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,750
And the plant life...

636
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:24,220
we researched every tree species in Isaan,

637
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,620
like neem and water fig,

638
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,050
and auspicious plants that bring good fortune.

639
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,800
It was true in-depth research,

640
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:37,200
so viewers could see Isaan folk life...

641
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:42,050
the house structure, kitchen layout, room arrangements.

642

Even the sorcerer's altar

643
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,200
was carefully researched.

644
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,250
We studied offering tables and the like.

645
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,420
We were fortunate to find

646
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:59,170
a true craftsman skilled in making ritual flower trays,

647
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,600

00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,050
How should a traditional altar be set up?

650
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,320
Then we blended in our own design elements.

651
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:15,200
Because the sorcerer is someone who helps the people...

652
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,960

on parts that needed adjustment.

658
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,070
This pushed the team to research even more deeply.

659
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,770
We believe the official series

660
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,370
will be even more refined.

661
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:48,120

from blueprints to a complete set.

00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:11,170
When the actors arrived, they all exclaimed how amazing Brother Arm was.

667
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,620
It made us proud,

668
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,620
proving we could pull it off.

669
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,650
We truly have the capability.

670

The production must be meticulous.

676
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:58,350
The challenge is keeping it aligned with the original novel,

677
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,600
matching the style of the CG illustrations in the book.

678
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,200
First, the team had to communicate thoroughly...

679
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,800
with the cinematographer, the director, and so on...

680
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,620
to make sure the shot designs were clear.

681
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,920
We had to be as precise as possible in our discussions.

682
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,070
The theme of the series is ghosts and horror.

683
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:18,120
Special effects makeup needed 4–7 hours of prep in advance.

684
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:22,250
The character Ramphueng often required ghostly SFX makeup.

685
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,600
Everyone, this is just the appetizer...

686
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:33,600
in the main series, you'll see many more characters with SFX makeup.

687
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,400
For my own SFX makeup,

688
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,520
we had to start three hours ahead...

689
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:43,400
painting vein patterns and more.

690
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,220
It was a novelty; I'd never worn ghost makeup before,

691
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,850
but the results were excellent.

692
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:56,100
Our director of photography pursued perfection.

693
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,220
Even for night forest scenes, he made sure the actors were clearly visible.

694

Behind him, the lighting crew worked in sync.

698

00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,550
featuring both familiar and unfamiliar musical styles.

702
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:34,440
Multiple songs convey different characters' inner worlds.

703
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,600
We wanted to find the most fitting singers,

704
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,200
inviting many artists to contribute...

705
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,520
including Aof Suraphon and Noknawy.

706
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:48,400
The actors themselves are also excellent singers.

707
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,720
Please look forward to their performances.

708
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,800
[Wishing for safety and peace]

709
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:03,300
The entire Khemjira crew poured their hearts into this project,

710
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,270
working side by side for a long time.

711
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,820
Every department conducted in-depth research,

712
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,050
striving for the ultimate presentation.

713
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,070
What I want to say to the sorcerer is...

714
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:22,020
I hope he has the courage to try what he truly wants,

715
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:26,150
as long as it doesn't harm others.

716
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:30,570
I hope he finds a beautiful love...

717
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,070
maybe he already has.

718
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:40,950
My bond with the character is deep.

719
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:44,550
My meeting with Khem was like destiny...

720
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:47,400
some kind of fate brought us together.

721
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,920
This time I was given an opportunity,

722
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,920
and the character chose me too.

723
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,700
I'm grateful to have met Khemjira,

724
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,250
and thankful for this experience.

725
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,970
This series is more than just an ordinary drama...

726
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,520
it's our shared goal.

727
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,400
From the moment we decided to work together

728
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,900
to the moment opportunity arrived,

729
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,970
it has been the dream of two young people

730
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:28,970
and of the whole team.

731
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,100
Everyone will see

732
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,020
how much we've given our all.

733
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,400
I just want to say... it's incredible.

734
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,770
We will see this through to the end.

735
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,350
No matter the outcome,

736
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:50,350
at least we've given it everything...

737
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:54,140
to the point our bodies feel like they might fall apart.

738
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,850
That goes for Namping and the entire team.

739
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:02,900
First, I want to thank you for choosing me to convey emotion,

740
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:08,050
to carry the creative vision.

741
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:14,700
Thank you to the character Jet for helping me grow...

742
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,500
both in acting and in speaking Isaan dialect.

743
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:26,370
Playing Jet has always been pure joy... thank you so much.

744
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:29,300
I've spent a whole year alongside Chanwit,

745
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,820
and our bond is deep.

746
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:38,270
I can only thank this character from the heart for putting me here today.

747
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:42,020
I hope to take him even further,

748
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:50,800
and I wish everyone would love Chanwit as much as I do.

749
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,320
Everyone has put in extraordinary care...

750
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,650
every actor, every crew member...

751
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,520
pouring their hearts into this series.

752
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,420
We both know how much the audience is anticipating it...

753
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:05,720
novel fans, drama fans, DoMunDi fans.

754
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:08,800
We've been truly serious about it.

755
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:14,900
It feels like one of our signature works.

756
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:20,370
Please follow my work, and follow the Khemjira team.

757
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:24,870
This is my first drama series,

758
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,470
and I've given it everything.

759
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:31,420
I want to say... a two-minute scene

760
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,220
can take hours to film.

761
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,920
It's a united effort,

762
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,070
never the work of just one person.

763
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,190
Seventy to eighty people work together

764
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:41,750
to finish a single shot.

765
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:46,250
I hope everyone enjoys the time spent with Khemjira.

766
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:50,450
No matter the final reviews,

767
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,750
whether I've put too much pressure on myself,

768
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:58,320
whether I can portray Khem perfectly...

769
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:02,350
I just hope the audience will see
the wholehearted effort from all of us.

770
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,670
I've given this character my all...

771
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,970
total dedication, every bit of care...

772
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:16,220
to meet the expectations of audiences worldwide.

773
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:19,270
This is a great opportunity

774
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,750
to showcase Thai culture to the world.

775
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:25,350
Frankly, the production cost was huge...

776
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,680
close to nine figures.

777
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,350
It's unlikely to turn a profit;

778
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:33,370
sponsorships don't cover the cost.

779
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,500
But what we truly want

780
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,970
is to showcase DoMunDi's production quality.

781
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,830
We hope Khemjira

782
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:44,550
becomes a work audiences can be proud of.

783
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,450
If there are follow-up events,

784
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,300
please continue to support us...

785
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,650
but also understand us.

786
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:52,620
Support within your means is enough.

787
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,370
Watching the series is the greatest support you can give,

788
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,450
because this is a work we've created with sincerity.

789
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:00,650
We hope to pass on something beautiful,

790
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:06,150
to bring joy through this series,

791
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:10,500
to showcase the charm of Thai culture,

792
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,450
and to change how the public perceives BL dramas.

793
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,170
We hope to take it international.

794
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:24,270
Soon, we'll be able to present it to you.

795
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:31,370
May it become a home in viewers' hearts,

796
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,560
because it means so much to us.

797
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,720
I hope the series runs smoothly,

798
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,700
and that the crew, cast, and audience are all safe and well.

799
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:42,820
Thank you.

800
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:49,750
Will Khem break the curse?

801
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,670
Will Pharan open his heart to Khem?

802
00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:00,470
How will Jet and Chan's relationship develop?

803
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,320
Please look forward to it.

804
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:04,850
I'm moved and grateful to this character

805
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:06,820
for bringing us beauty

806
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,750
and creating precious memories.

807
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,370
I don't know how the story will unfold,

808
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:17,300
but please continue to support Khemjira.

809
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,350
Hold Khem close,

810
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,850
and let's protect him together.
