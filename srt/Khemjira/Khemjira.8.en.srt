3
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,600
I hope you really think this over

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,120
and see if you can give me a chance.

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,760
I've never stopped loving you.

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,160
What is it?

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Pong's taking me
to the temple fair tonight.

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,320
Make sure he takes care of you.

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,600
- If anything goes wrong,
- Hey!

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,400
he'll be the first one I blame.

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,480
- What the fuck?
- Hey, hey.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,200
Hey!

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,040
What is that?

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,080
Thanks to all of you
for letting me have a fun time.

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,440
You won't get away with this.

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,200
They're all safe now.

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,120
Only Pong is seriously wounded,

18
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,400
but his life isn't in danger.

19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
Thanks a lot.

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,000
Go on and keep patrolling.

21
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,320
Yes, Master.

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,360
I knew you liked this song,

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,880
so I brought you a new tape.

24
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,920
I hope to be the person in this song

25
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,800
who soothes you when you're sad

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,600
and stands by you when you're happy.

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,400
Please give me a chance.

28
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,040
Thank you, Uncle.

29
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,840
Master!

30
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,150
Master, please help Pong.

31
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,010
I already know.

32
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,760
Take him upstairs.

33
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,680
Come on. Let's go.

34
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,440
Hurry.

35
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,000
You came to me for help

36
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,710
and are staying under my roof.

37
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,640
That makes you mine now.

38
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,640
I've helped you many times,

39
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,200
not for someone to hurt you like this.

40
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Master...

41
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,680
♫Search your heart and tell me who,♫

42
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,300
♫Who can love you more than I do?♫

43
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,580
I'm sorry.

44
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,400
I...

45
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:36,970
I can't.

46
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,240
♫Tell me what's true♫

47
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,120
♫Your eyes speak clearly,
you're just sorry♫

48
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:53,920
♫Love who you will, no need to worry♫

49
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,360
♫Even if it hurts, my heart won't flee♫

50
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,280
♫For it's you,
I can bear the pain endlessly♫

51
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,200
I...

52
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,040
I understand.

53
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,659
Khem...

54
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,200
It's okay, Master.

55
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Let's just...

56
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,840
forget what happened.

57
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,640
[Phra Nakhon, 1947]

58
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,080
Uh...

59
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,240
It's the letter from the diplomat.

60
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,480
Now that the war is over,

61
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,240
she wanted to help me,

62
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,480
so she wrote a letter
to help me pursue my studies in the U.S.

63
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,280
So you're leaving me, too.

64
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
What about me?

65
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,640
You're coming with me.

66
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,280
Let's leave this life here

67
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,640
and be together over there.

68
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,960
We'll be free,

69
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,480
and no one will judge us
the way they do here.

70
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,600
Come with me.

71
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,040
I will.

72
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,120
From now on,

73
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,160
let's share
the rest of our lives together.

74
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,800
Da!

75
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,520
- We're not...
- "We're not at home."

76
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,320
It's okay, Jin.

77
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,520
We're leaving this place soon.

78
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,280
Oh...

79
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,200
Grandma!

80
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,760
- Good morning, Grandma.
- Good morning.

81
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,600
Hi.

82
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,840
Good morning.

83
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Whoa,

84
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,560
you're all here?

85
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,120
Why would you all come?

86
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,840
We're here to visit you.

87
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,160
I heard from Uncle Chai
that you've been feeling unwell

88
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,520
and had to see a doctor.

89
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,080
I'm already in my last days,

90
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,200
and the doctor's telling me
to cut down on sugar.

91
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,640
Just listen to the doctor.

92
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,640
You're not a spring chicken anymore.

93
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,400
What?

94
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,120
I am listening to the doctor.

95
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,240
I wouldn't share this with the kids
if I weren't.

96
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,320
Eat up, kids.

97
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,320
It's yummy.

98
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,880
I made it myself.

99
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,170
Why are you so hungry, Jet?

100
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,680
Don't know

101
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,880
Guess I went a bit overboard last night.

102
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,040
Do they have this in Bangkok, Khem?

103
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Not freshly steamed ones.

104
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,720
This is amazing.

105
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,160
Do you want my recipe?

106
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,720
So that you can make this for...

107
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,760
Master.

108
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
My recipe is amazing.

109
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,520
He likes my desserts.

110
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,760
And his favorite dessert
when he was young...

111
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,880
Hey, Grandma.

112
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,360
Take it easy.

113
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,400
You're running out of breath.

114
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,800
Some water, Grandma.

115
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,839
I'm better now.

116
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Grandma,

117
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,080
you're still taking
Pra-taba turmeric, right?

118
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,480
From what I read,
it contains high levels of mercury.

119
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,400
How about taking a break
from it for now?

120
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,000
It might be causing your sickness.

121
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,080
I'm only taking a bit,

122
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,440
so I don't think it's the cause.

123
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,440
I appreciate your worry, though.

124
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,680
Just listen to Khem, Grandma.

125
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
I'm worried about you.

126
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,840
Why would you be?

127
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,840
Don't waste your time
on someone this old.

128
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,400
What do you mean?

129
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,880
You're the only one I have, Grandma.

130
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,200
Live a long life and stay with me.

131
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,560
I'm old now,

132
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,400
and I don't know
how many years I have left.

133
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,560
I've lived more than enough.

134
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,920
You, Master,

135
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,000
should take care of yourself

136
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,400
and find someone to look after you.

137
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,960
That's nonsense, Grandma.

138
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,120
It is not.

139
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,840
You're just a shaman, not a monk.

140
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,940
Even Grand Master Sek

141
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,200
had a family.

142
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,280
If you have a lover,

143
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,920
you're not doing anything wrong.

144
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,280
All done.

145
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,640
We've done all the dishes

146
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,640
and put the water in the fridge.

147
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,480
We're taking our leave, Grandma.

148
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,180
Good luck.

149
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,480
Good luck. May you be blessed.

150
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Master,

151
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,920
if you lose him,

152
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
you'll regret it.

153
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Wait up, Jet.

154
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,760
Khem!

155
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,640
Khem...

156
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,000
What happened last night...

157
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Well...

158
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,600
I...

159
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Oh, Prim?

160
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
Hello.

161
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,620
Hi, guys.

162
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,880
Master,

163
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,800
Prim's here.

164
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,520
There you go.

165
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,360
Messed around and found out, huh?

166
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,280
Hey, easy on me.

167
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,600
It's still sore.

168
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,520
Don't practice too hard for now.

169
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,600
Postpone the next match, too.

170
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,600
Thank you for saving me.

171
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,600
Come on.

172
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,840
Let's go home.

173
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
I have something
to talk to Master about.

174
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,120
Jet,

175
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,880
go make Pong a pennywort drink.

176
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,900
I can make him one.

177
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,880
Jet, Charn, you can go tidy up the room.

178
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,320
Oh...

179
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,960
Right. Okay.

180
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,400
Do you wanna come with me, Pong?

181
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,440
Sure.

182
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,670
You should change the sheet, too.

183
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,560
I was sweating a lot last night.

184
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,560
Sorry.

185
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,360
Alright.

186
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,920
We should hurry

187
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,640
'cause we need to change our sheet, too.

188
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,360
Come on, go.

189
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,040
Hurry.

190
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,180
Go now.

191
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,560
You're still into
vintage stuff, aren't you?

192
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,240
Are you ready
to give me an answer, Paran?

193
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,520
Please call me Master like you used to,

194
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,320
Prim.

195
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
I get it.

196
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,980
Maybe I'm not enough for you.

197
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,160
It's not like that.

198
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,600
You're perfect, Prim.

199
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,680
It's my fault.

200
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,920
My feelings are for someone else now.

201
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,440
I'm sorry...

202
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,560
I didn't tell you sooner,

203
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
but I needed some time, too.

204
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,000
I never meant to lie to you

205
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
or to give you false hope.

206
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,800
You must be really mad at me

207
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,600
- that I kept you waiting.
- I am.

208
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,960
How could I, actually?

209
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,960
But it's true that I'm disappointed.

210
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,960
It's not funny, Prim.

211
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
I'm sorry.

212
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,520
I was probably shocked

213
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,240
to hear your honest answer

214
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,080
that you have feelings for someone.

215
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,800
I just didn't know how to react.

216
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,200
It's too old.

217
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,040
I don't know if it still works.

218
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,280
♫Search your heart and tell me who♫

219
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,640
I wonder...

220
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,760
who stole your heart.

221
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,080
Who is it?

222
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:20,280
♫Why keep your secrets?
Give me a clue♫

223
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,720
♫We're not strangers,
tell me what's true♫

224
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,840
♫Your eyes speak clearly,
you're just sorry♫

225
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:38,880
♫Love who you will, no need to worry♫

226
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,360
♫Even if it hurts, my heart won't flee♫

227
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:53,120
♫For it's you,
I can bear the pain endlessly♫

228
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,800
♫Please, please save your tears♫

229
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,480
♫If your love's for him,
just erase me here♫

230
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,960
♫Don't let guilt make you fear♫

231
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,000
Khem,

232
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,400
with that much pressure,

233
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,600
it must've turned into powder.

234
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
I'm sorry.

235
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,840
Thank you

236
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,560
for saving me last night.

237
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,000
Anyway,

238
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,640
you can show me more places.

239
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,830
Painting suits you way better

240
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,280
than acting.

241
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
Sorry?

242
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,000
Well,

243
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,200
you're bad at acting.

244
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,000
I can tell you're not into me.

245
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,720
I don't think...

246
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,360
you even meant to give me a chance.

247
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,040
You...

248
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,420
already love someone, don't you?

249
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,160
And you brought me here...

250
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,480
not to give them space

251
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,480
but to make him jealous, right?

252
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,440
So,

253
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,520
you can tell?

254
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,360
I bet...

255
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,880
everyone could, except you.

256
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,920
Don't do this.

257
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,200
You could end up hurt.

258
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,680
Sometimes...

259
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,840
love makes us do this kind of stuff.

260
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,220
I don't know how things are going
between you and him.

261
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,520
But I think...

262
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,200
it's better to be honest with yourself.

263
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,720
Thanks, Pong.

264
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,520
But...

265
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,960
actually,

266
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,560
I'm gonna have to...

267
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,800
go through heartbreak, too.

268
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,600
♫Search your heart and tell me who♫

269
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
Let this heal you.

270
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,840
Come on, Pong.

271
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,680
Go ahead and drink it.

272
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,000
It heals physical pain,
not a broken heart.

273
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,360
Just drink it.

274
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
We both need to heal.

275
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:22,120
♫Your eyes speak clearly,
you're just sorry♫

276
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,480
Gosh...

277
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,400
It's more bitter than I expected.

278
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,040
Ew.

279
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,239
Try this.

280
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,880
Does that help?

281
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,440
I think so.

282
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
Whoa...

283
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,840
That's even worse.

284
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
It's too bad.

285
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,080
Wanna drink it?

286
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,240
There, there. Don't cry.

287
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,720
Stop that.

288
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
I'm perfectly fine.

289
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,660
- Really? Are you?
- Yeah.

290
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,320
Wanna comfort me instead?

291
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,520
There, there.

292
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,320
There, there.

293
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Khem...

294
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,880
Wait...

295
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,480
Shit!

296
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,240
Did anyone see it?

297
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
My bad.

298
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,920
I'll be gentler next time.

299
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,920
Was that alright?

300
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,720
Hey!

301
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,560
Was what alright?

302
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,000
No more!

303
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,240
There won't be a next time.

304
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,280
I thought you liked it.

305
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:41,690
Or...

306
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
- did I do anything wrong last night?
- Stop.

307
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,640
You were great.

308
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,360
Amazing, actually, but...

309
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,760
Can we talk about this later?

310
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
It's true.

311
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,520
I'm not hot enough.

312
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,800
You tried with me,

313
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,680
yet I'm still just a friend.

314
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,280
- It's not like that!
- What is it, then?

315
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,080
Well...

316
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,960
I mean...

317
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,120
Like...

318
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,680
You're not a friend,

319
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,180
but...

320
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,520
something more than that.

321
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,440
Just a bit more.

322
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,680
But...

323
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,210
let's be friends for now,

324
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,400
alright?

325
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,280
Let's take it slow.

326
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,640
- You didn't take it slow last night.
- Stop it, Charn.

327
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,280
We're not by ourselves.

328
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,640
We need to spend this night with Khem.

329
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,040
Let's just talk about this later.

330
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,800
He's coming.

331
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
Master?

332
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,380
Have you tried it before?

333
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,680
It's green chiretta.

334
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,480
Master,

335
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,680
how do you know

336
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,920
that I'm unwell?

337
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,960
Well, your cough was so loud.

338
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,480
I knew you wouldn't stand it.

339
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,280
Take small sips.

340
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
It's hot.

341
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,840
It's so bitter.

342
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,360
I hope it really helps.

343
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,960
Can we talk
about what happened last night?

344
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,280
I'm sorry I suddenly approached you

345
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,960
and made you feel uncomfortable.

346
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,200
But I want you to know that I did it...

347
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,440
because I have feelings for you, Khem.

348
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,160
You know it, don't you?

349
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,960
So...

350
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,280
did you stop

351
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,720
because Prim came to mind?

352
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,800
Not Prim,

353
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,600
but my mom.

354
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,520
It was her favorite song.

355
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,040
She was taken

356
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,540
by someone else's karmic enemy,

357
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,160
like a curse that clung to you.

358
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,140
She came to my mind,

359
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,240
and I realized

360
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,040
I can't bear
to lose anyone I love ever again.

361
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,720
And now I realize

362
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,560
I just need this moment,

363
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,600
just for a little while,

364
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,760
to listen to my heart

365
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,320
and tell you how I feel.

366
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,520
Master...

367
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,880
You feel the same way, don't you, Khem?

368
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,760
♫Please, let my prayer start,♫

369
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,800
♫May we never ever need to part♫

370
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:35,160
♫Please, I beg with all my heart,♫

371
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,600
♫May you never leave, never depart♫

372
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,880
♫Should any magic bind you to my side,♫

373
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,320
♫I'll cast the spell to keep you mine♫

374
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,440
♫I'll risk it all, nothing to hide,♫

375
00:46:53,480 --> 00:47:00,960
♫If only you'll never say goodbye♫

376
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,600
Uh...

377
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,480
Aren't my lips bitter?

378
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,400
I just had the green chiretta.

379
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,800
No.

380
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,320
They're sweet.

381
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,800
♫Should any magic bind you to my side,♫

382
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:40,240
♫I'll cast the spell to keep you mine♫

383
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,360
♫I'll risk it all, nothing to hide,♫

384
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:49,800
♫If only you'll never say goodbye♫

385
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:56,120
♫Though no spell works,
I'll pour my soul, my life,♫

386
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,640
♫Only to keep you near
and hold you tight♫

387
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,080
♫Should heaven be kind,♫

388
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,000
♫May it never take away my light♫

389
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,720
♫'Cause you keep me alive♫

390
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,760
♫Please be in my life♫

391
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,200
Why can't you let anyone know?

392
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,080
Khem and you being in love

393
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,120
isn't wrong, is it?

394
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,480
I know,

395
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,080
but it's not the right time.

396
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,560
Both Khem and I agree on this.

397
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,840
But Jet and Charn aren't anyone, Master.

398
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,840
If they found out,
they'd definitely be over the moon.

399
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,360
Both of them need to keep training

400
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,760
to be able to protect Khem.

401
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,640
I don't want them
getting distracted by anything else.

402
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,540
It could lead to mistakes.

403
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,800
Still, Master,

404
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,880
Khem can't hide what he's feeling.

405
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,520
Can we really keep this
from Jet and Charn?

406
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,400
Please.

407
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,600
Please, Master.

408
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,600
- Master...
- Please.

409
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,880
Please, Master.

410
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,040
Please.

411
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,600
I knew

412
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,040
you couldn't resist.

413
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,520
You're making him
a cushion, too, after all.

414
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,440
That's good.

415
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,080
Though he doesn't like you,

416
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,240
it doesn't mean you're just strangers.

417
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,440
Yeah,

418
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,280
you're right.

419
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,520
Guys,

420
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,360
Pong told me

421
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,120
Master and Prim have agreed
to be just friends.

422
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,840
What? Aren't you guys surprised?

423
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:14,960
Well,

424
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,880
it's none of my business, right?

425
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,400
So...

426
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,240
did he also tell you

427
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,440
the reason?

428
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,600
He didn't.

429
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,780
Could it be that

430
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,440
he's into someone else?

431
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,440
What do you mean?

432
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,880
I don't think so.

433
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,920
Someone who is virtuous
wouldn't care about love stuff.

434
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,760
It's nice

435
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,400
that he made it clear to Prim
that they can only be friends.

436
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,160
They've known each other for so long,

437
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,020
yet he firmly denied her.

438
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,240
I think that'll help you move on, right?

439
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,320
Yeah.

440
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,040
That's right.

441
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,320
Are you sick, Khem?

442
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,240
The way you're talking sounds weird.

443
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,400
What's wrong?

444
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,360
You went to get lozenges last night,

445
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,200
and it took forever.

446
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,240
Lozenges?

447
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,440
Oh...

448
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,160
I couldn't find any,

449
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,960
so I didn't take them.

450
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,880
So...

451
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,360
Uh...

452
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,120
I'll...

453
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,000
go get some...

454
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,240
lozenges.

455
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,240
I'm getting eye pain.

456
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,060
I'll continue my meditation,

457
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,080
hoping it might help me
see things more clearly.

458
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,040
My face's up here.

459
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,960
I'm sorry.

460
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,160
Is this one mine?

461
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:31,920
Yes.

462
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,960
I made this especially for you.

463
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,600
Thanks.

464
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,800
I'll put on my clothes.

465
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,240
Wait, Master...

466
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,800
Uh...

467
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,460
What do your tattoos mean?

468
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:38,400
My grandfather
once recalled my past life,

469
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,880
and it seems

470
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,900
I was somehow linked to a Naga.

471
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,700
He had me get it tattooed for good luck.

472
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,600
Does that mean...

473
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,520
you were a Naga in your past life?

474
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,800
Maybe not.

475
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,280
He only said there was a link.

476
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,160
I might have been
just a servant of a Naga.

477
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,420
At that time,

478
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,200
we might have met

479
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,680
and stayed together,

480
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,660
just like Pawat and Khemmika,

481
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,240
and like you and me now.

482
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,800
Do you think
others have fates like ours?

483
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,400
Not necessarily.

484
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,680
But every action we take

485
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,800
leaves its mark on someone else,

486
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,000
whether we realize it or not.

487
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,200
Like Ramphueng.

488
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,040
She's haunting me through every life,

489
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,040
and I don't even know
what I did to deserve it.

490
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,240
You're right.

491
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,320
Maybe it's because of her

492
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,520
that our paths crossed again.

493
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,240
Not just mine and yours.

494
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,100
What do you mean?

495
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,880
In fact, both Jet and Charn

496
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,200
have been bound to you
since your previous life.

497
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,060
Perhaps it's time for us
to recall our past lives.

498
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,720
Ever since I began my training,

499
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,160
I've been dreaming of Chayada.

500
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,680
But I just realized
Master had already known.

501
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,720
But...

502
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,970
how much do you know?

503
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,800
I know that both of you

504
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,240
were Khemmika's best friends.

505
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,320
Why?

506
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,480
Anything else I need to know?

507
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,200
Oh,

508
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,920
nothing, Master.

509
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,780
I was just curious.

510
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,720
Focus your mind

511
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,960
and recall the feeling you had
when you faced Ramphueng.

512
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:24,920
I'm Khem, Khemmika.

513
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,360
You guys

514
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,120
really need to
come hang out with me often.

515
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,800
Look, now that Khem has her own place...

516
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,440
Just like when we were in school!

517
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,240
She will be too annoyed
to ever feel lonely.

518
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,160
Khem!

519
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,000
- Wake up and talk to me!
- Calm down, Jin.

520
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:43,120
Is that Jintana?

521
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,880
I can only hear Da talk.

522
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,920
Me, too.

523
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,920
I can only hear Khemmika.

524
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,760
If we tell her,

525
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,690
will it make her feel even lonelier?

526
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:53,760
Wait,

527
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,440
I think I can hear a baby crying.

528
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,000
I mean...

529
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,560
an infant.

530
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,040
Focus,

531
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,840
and let that cry guide you.

532
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Mom?

533
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,920
Shit,

534
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,040
I think I'm hearing it, too.

535
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,600
So am I.

536
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,600
Focus your mind

537
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,440
and fix it on Khem.

538
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,240
What happened, Master?

539
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,640
I saw it.

540
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,080
It's someone my grandfather knew.

541
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:25,920
Does Monk Kasem

542
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:28,880
have something to do with this boy?

543
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,520
I'm not so sure myself.

544
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:38,840
That's why I want to look into it.

545
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,680
Do you happen to know where he is?

546
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,560
They say

547
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,560
he became a revered monk
down in the South.

548
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,920
I'll try to reach out to his disciples.

549
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,920
It's been over a decade
since he withdrew from worldly life,

550
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,880
so I can't promise I'll find him.

551
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Very well, Grandma.

552
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,600
If you can reach him,

553
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,640
please tell him

554
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,480
we need his help with Ramphueng.

555
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,400
If he has something to do with this,

556
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,800
he'll understand.

557
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,120
Sure.

558
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,960
Leave it to me.

559
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,640
Don't know what's wrong with me today.

560
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,280
I feel more exhausted than usual.

561
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,120
I'm struggling to breathe.

562
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,400
Grandma,

563
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,080
perhaps you should stay with Uncle Chai.

564
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,800
If you're all by yourself,

565
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,400
I'll be worried.

566
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,760
I'm not going anywhere.

567
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,440
I'm staying here.

568
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:32,400
Chai and everyone visit me often enough.

569
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,160
Look,

570
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,640
he's here.

571
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,920
Speak of the devil.

572
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,440
Hey...

573
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,840
Easy, Grandma.

574
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,600
I feel better now.

575
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,640
I'm alright.

576
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:13,840
Okay.

577
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,680
I was just excited.

578
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,240
Master,

579
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,680
can we pull over?

580
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,680
During the ritual last night,
my mom came to my mind.

581
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,600
So I thought I'd make her chili paste

582
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,120
and dedicate it to her.

583
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,080
Master,

584
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,080
wanna help me get this?

585
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,200
If you're worried about Grandma Si,

586
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:35,040
why not let her stay with us?

587
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,560
My power may be white magic,

588
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,640
but I do have black magic stuff
in my house.

589
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,440
An invocation performer like her

590
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,600
might lose her power
if she comes too close.

591
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,140
It seems like...

592
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:14,520
you love her so much.

593
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:28,720
She nurtured me together
with my grandfather.

594
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,840
Every vital force in this village

595
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:37,400
is under her care.

596
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,840
I really wish she could have a break.

597
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,480
But everyone's also taking care of her.

598
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,760
You don't have to worry.

599
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:20,520
Please let me...

600
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,920
Please don't worry, Master.

601
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,120
Peem.

602
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,400
Yes?

603
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,880
From now on,

604
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:25,580
when we're by ourselves,

605
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:28,880
call me Peem.

606
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:54,880
Okay, Peem.

607
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,360
Well,

608
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,320
should we get it now?

609
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:11,720
Come on.

610
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,200
How much do you want?

611
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,920
Some more, please.

612
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,520
Master was right.

613
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,600
He knows Ramphueng.

614
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,880
He'll catch the train early tomorrow
to come to us.

615
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,160
Thank you, Grandma.

616
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,160
No worries.

617
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Good luck, guys.

618
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,400
Get yourself ready, too.

619
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,960
He's also your old friend.

620
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,520
Let me know if you need anything.

621
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,440
Okay.

622
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,160
If I need your help,

623
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,600
I'll let you know.

624
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,840
Will I get to see you, Kasem?

625
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:59,320
Will I be able
to take a deep breath until then?

626
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,680
You two, go wait for Monk Kasem.

627
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,760
With Khem's birthday approaching,

628
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,000
Ramphueng's power will grow stronger.

629
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,760
He might be able to help us.

630
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,040
How's everything?

631
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,320
The train had some trouble.

632
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,720
They're waiting to change trains
in Buri Ram

633
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:07,360
and will arrive here by morning.

634
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,800
Then we've come all this way
for nothing.

635
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,200
I don't get it.

636
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,360
Why are both Monk Kasem and Master

637
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,800
so against mobile phones?

638
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,840
They're virtuous. That's why.

639
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,720
What should we do?

640
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,040
Should we leave?

641
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,160
So Charn and I
[Jet]

642
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,800
are gonna stay at a hotel.

643
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,600
Can you stay alone tonight?

644
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,680
Sure.

645
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,780
Master's with me. I'll be okay.

646
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,680
Master...

647
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,040
I mean,

648
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:08,630
Peem,

649
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,600
you can come in.

650
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,400
Okay.

651
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,040
Sure.

652
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,240
Take care of yourself, okay?

653
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,600
Don't worry about me.

654
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,080
Uh...

655
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,640
Hurry back tomorrow, alright?

656
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,640
Bye-bye.

657
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:49,400
You're teasing me.

658
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,120
I'm not.

659
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:56,400
I was just worried.

660
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,480
So you're sleeping alone tonight?

661
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,280
No one's around.

662
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,600
What if Ramphueng comes and harms you?

663
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,280
Why?

664
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:28,380
You wanna be with me instead?

665
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,240
No.

666
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,480
If you can be alone, then that's fine.

667
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,320
Peem,

668
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,240
won't you feel tired?

669
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,840
It's nothing.

670
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,720
This isn't the first time I've stayed up
watching over you.

671
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,200
You're right.

672
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:32,220
You've always helped me,

673
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,440
even though you were cold.

674
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,040
Thank you.

675
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,500
And...

676
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,360
I'm sorry for always giving you trouble.

677
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,390
You're not.

678
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:55,180
I'm always willing to help you.

679
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,000
How about lying down on the bed
and getting comfy?

680
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,160
[Khanti means patience]

681

[Dharma]

682
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,240
I thought
you wanted to sleep by yourself.

683
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,240
It's just that...

684
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,840
when I realize
how little time I have left,

685
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,680
I'm afraid that

686
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,760
if I don't follow my heart now,

687
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:12,120
I might not get another chance.

688
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,010
So...

689
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:39,480
I don't know what I'm currently feeling.

690
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:48,480
Rak, sometimes,
it's nothing complicated.

691
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:49,920
Don't make it seem that way.

692
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,960
Just say whatever you're feeling.

693
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,160
Sometimes, things you're worrying about
in your mind

694
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,120
might not be like what you thought.

695

697
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:09,160
Simply do what your heart says.

698
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,360
I'm the one supporting you.

699
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:16,300
You just keep staring.

700
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,080
What's your problem, huh?

701
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,560
Nothing. I'm just a friend.

702
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:28,720
There you go again.

703
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,120
I already told you

704
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:32,560
you're more than that.

706
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:42,680
What do you mean, then?

707
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,320
A friend is a friend.

708
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,400
What's more than a friend?

709
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,000
I don't know, man.

710
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:54,880
I don't even know

711
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,240
if these feelings are mine or Jintana's.

712
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,440
My dad just gave me a matching name

713
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,040
like it was meant to be.

714
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,040
We've loved each other
since our past lives.

715
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:15,160
So why complicate things?

716
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,200
Wait,

717
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,040
you don't believe in past lives, do you?

718
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:20,840
I do now.

719
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:24,660
I really feel connected to you, Jet.

720
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,440
And I even lost my virginity to you.

721
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,560
Don't make it sound like
you're the victim.

722
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,280
I also lost mine to you.

723
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,120
Shit...

724
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,160
Saying it aloud makes me flustered.

725
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,520
You're flustered because of me?

726
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,000
Yeah.

727
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,280
Well,

728
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,040
I've never done it with anyone before.

729
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:18,920
So...

730
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:21,640
I'm your first?

731
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:25,680
Obviously.

732
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:30,880
So...

733
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:35,520
let me be confused for now.

734
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,000
I'm...

735
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,000
not ready to make any decisions.

736
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,560
Gosh, what are you doing?

737
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,760
You're just so cute, Jet.

738
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,320
Stop that.

739
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,040
Let us...

740
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:09,920
be friends for now,

741
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,640
alright?

742
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,600
Okay,

743
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,640
buddy.

744
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,040
Come on, go to sleep.

745
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:27,880
Tonight,

746
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:30,800
we'll just hold hands, okay?

747
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:37,440
Okay.

748
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,180
What do you think

749
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,720
Khem's doing right now?

750
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,480
Is he still safe?

751
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:22,880
That wasn't good.

752
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:28,720
What you just said wasn't good.

753
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:39,220
I intend to keep you safe
from this curse.

754
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:48,440
You have a long life to live

755
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:51,520
for your parents,

756
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:53,900
Jet and Charn,

757
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:59,320
and me.

758
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:08,120
You mean so much to me, Khem.

759
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,600
Peem,

760
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,800
is this wrong?

761
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,800
If it comes from love,

762
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,280
it can't be entirely wrong.

763
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:21,020
Can I just help make you happy, Peem?

764
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:21,200
They're not coming soon.

765
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:43,640
What's wrong?

766
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:48,500
Jet,

767
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:49,940
can you try calling Khem?

768
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,160
Something feels off.

769
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Grandma Si?

770
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:36,480
Give me a moment.

771
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:00,160
Grandma Si,

772
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:02,000
are you feeling better now?

773
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:04,720
What do you mean? I'm not sick.

774
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,520
Here, I made Master some dessert.

775
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:11,840
Is he still sleeping?

776
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:14,600
Yes.

777
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:17,900
Right,

778
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:19,280
Grandma,

779
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:21,440
the train got delayed,

780
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:23,520
so he hasn't arrived yet.

781
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,480
Who hasn't arrived yet?

782
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:34,200
Monk Kasem, you know.

783
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:37,620
Oh,

784
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:39,600
Monk Kasem!

785
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,480
Have you gotten the flowers
ready for him?

786
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:48,520
Perfect. I'm picking some lotuses.

787
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:50,360
Do you want to come, too?

788
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:52,920
The lotuses here are really lovely.

789
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:55,000
Yes.

790
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:57,920
Let me prepare this
for Master first, then.

791
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:08,120
[Missed calls: Jet]

792
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,880
[Getting some lotuses with Grandma Si;

793
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:27,240
have some dessert she made for you
on the table]

794
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:06,200
Wow.

795
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:12,720
I think that one is perfect.

796
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:21,760
Wow!

797
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:24,440
It's so pretty.

798
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,560
Grandma Si,

799
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:31,720
it's pretty, isn't it?

800
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:10,600
Are you still taking Pra-taba?

801
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:15,560
I trust you,

802
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:18,680
hoping it helps.

803
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:01,320
- Master!
- Master!

804
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:33,160
Grandma,

805
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:35,000
let's head back to the shore.

806
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,120
It's getting hot.

807
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:38,680
You might get sick.

808
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:42,360
I might get sick?

809
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:48,240
But you guys...

810
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,480
will die.

811
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:06,360
You won't make it out alive this time.

812
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:25,840
- Master!
- Master!

813
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:27,360
Go save Khem.

814
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:28,200
Look.

815
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:29,120
See it.

816
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:30,960
See what I had to go through.

817
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:32,360
Where is Grandma Si?

818
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:38,440
Please forgive me.

819
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,990
Why should fortune smile upon you?

820
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:44,200
I have faithfully fulfilled my duties
as a wife for years,

821
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:45,240
yet you, a mere servant,

822
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,480
dare to take everything from me.

823
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:48,200
Ma'am!

824
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:49,360
They're lying, my lord.

825
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:50,400
They're framing me.

826
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:54,200
♫I'll risk it all, nothing to hide,♫

827
01:55:54,240 --> 01:56:01,960
♫If only you'll never say goodbye♫

828
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:08,080
♫Though no spell works,
I'll pour my soul, my life,♫

829
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:13,480
♫Only to keep you near
and hold you tight♫

830
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:15,880
♫Should heaven be kind,♫

831
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:18,840
♫May it never take away my light♫

832
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:21,520
♫'Cause you keep me alive♫

833
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:26,560
♫Please be in my life♫

834
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:48,040
♫Please be in my life♫
