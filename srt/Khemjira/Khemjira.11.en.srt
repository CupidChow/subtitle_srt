3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,920
Khem!

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry, Jet,

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,640
but I can't bear losing anyone again.

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,800
We're coming with you, then.

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,880
Khem's birthday is in seven days.

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,120
If he makes it until then,

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,280
the curse will be lifted.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,520
Are you sure you can handle this

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,920
without your master?

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,080
He's already lost so much for me.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,880
- Khemjira must survive!
- Khemjira must survive!

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,120
Khem,

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,440
don't give up yet.

16
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,459
Let go!

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,450
Let go of me!

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,440
Hey!

19
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,479
You finally showed up, Mr. Fancy-pants.

20
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,360
Thought you'd let your buddy
get his ass kicked,

21
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,210
huh?

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,660
Let my bro go.

23
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,760
If you wanna blame someone, blame me.

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,329
You both are pieces of shit.

25
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,970
If you hadn't poked your nose
into our turf,

26
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,050
the girls wouldn't have dumped me.

27
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,660
And even my girl,

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,840
Khaopad, dumped me!

29
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,200
With that ugly mug of yours,

30
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,860
whether it's Khaopad,
Khaosuay, or Khaoniew,

31
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,500
no girl's gonna pick you, dude.

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
You've got a smart mouth, huh?

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,280
Hey!

34
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,220
My bro!

35
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,530
Kachen, my buddy,

36
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,620
run!

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,880
What do you want?

38
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,900
I already broke up with her.

39
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,160
If you want her,
go ask her out yourself.

40
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,700
Fuck that.

41
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,270
Bring that pretty mug over here

42
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,080
so we can beat it up.

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,800
You up for it?

44
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,030
Fine.

45
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,100
If I win,

46
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,860
let my buddy go.

47
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,130
No!

48
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,640
My buddy,

49
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,400
don't do that!

50
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,220
Don't stop me, Paran.

51
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,200
Just think of it

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,560
as me paying for the sin

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,780
of being born this hot.

54
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,860
If you're ready to die, bring it on!

55
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,329
Hey, guys.

56
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,560
Kachen!

57
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,079
My buddy... No!

58
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,240
Kachen,

59
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,810
run!

60
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,480
No!

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,900
Run.

62
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,120
Kachen,

63
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,360
no!

64
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,680
Gosh,

65
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,300
cut the boasting, Kachen.

66
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,500
The truth is a hundred times smaller.

67
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,270
What took you so long?

68
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,820
I was...

69
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,110
So you handled all of them?

70
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,230
Yeah.

71
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,780
Pay the compensation to them for me.

72
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,280
I think...

73
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,980
you got it all wrong, Jane.

74
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,000
Anyway, guys,

75
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,560
since then, Paran and I

76
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,520
have become best buddies,

77
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,160
like ride-or-die kind of friends.

78
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,640
Right, bro?

79
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,680
So,

80
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,120
you were a thug, Master?

81
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,620
I only defended myself.

82
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,590
I've let go of that life.

83
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,590
Growing up means getting wiser,

84
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,600
not just getting older.

85
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,310
Come on, man.

86
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,990
Master just said
you need to get wiser, too.

87
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,380
Jet,

88
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,170
you know very well...

89
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,780
my age isn't the only thing
that's bigger.

90
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,660
You forgot,

91
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,460
huh?

92
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,740
Shall we dig up some old memories,

93
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:30,830
huh?

94
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,660
You down?

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,840
Hey!

96
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,920
Quit it.

97
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,290
Can you stop messing with my brother?

98
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,120
Enough.

99
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,180
I called Kachen here today

100
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,260
because we need him.

101
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
Right, Jane.

102
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,600
Are you still putting spells
on your tukata sia kaban?

103
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,980
Well,

104
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,720
I do perform some spells,

105
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,240
but not seriously...

106
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,130
I treat them as art toys.

107
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,520
No need to lie.

108
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,890
I don't mind it.

109
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,430
We really need them this time.

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,800
Ramphueng won't hear anything

111
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,080
we say in this room.

112
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,320
I'll go over the whole plan just once.

113
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,030
These materials are consecrated.

114
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,120
Tell me if you need help.

115
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,680
Get it done as quickly as you can.

116
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,700
I'm made to handle urgent tasks, Master.

117
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'll make it in time.

118
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,900
What are you doing, Khem?

119
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
You seem dedicated.

120
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,940
Some keepsakes.

121
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,940
At first, I planned to...

122
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,020
send a letter to everyone

123
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,380
so that if I were gone,

124
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,640
they'd have something to remember me by.

125
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,860
But now,

126
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,440
I'll use this

127
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,520
to remember those who've helped me.

128
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,110
♫Just one glance, and I could feel♫

129
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,490
♫A vow long hidden, suddenly revealed,♫

♫To meet once more with a bond to seal♫

132
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,760
You don't need to
bear all of this alone anymore.

133
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,840
You need to trust everyone, Khem.

134
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,780
♫It's more than love at first sight,♫

135
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,990

146
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,800
Whoa, bro.

147
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,260
That was dope.

148
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,760
What do you think, Charn?

149
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,520
Was that dope?

150
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,500
Yes,

151
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,400
very...

152
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,120
Hey.

153
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,840
Are you okay?

154
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,690
I think that was too slow.

155
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
To run from that Ramphueng,

156
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,120
we need to be faster.

157
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,280
I can do it for you if you can't.

158
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,780
Master said

159
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,360
this task needs Charn's instincts.

160
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,840
Don't worry.

161
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,600
One more round with him
and you'll get used to it.

162
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,800
You really trust him, don't you?

163
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,420
If my instincts weren't strong,

164
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,220
you'd have let him handle it.

165
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,830
You sure he's got this?

166
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,240
No matter what, I'm going with him.

167
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,150
Whoa,

168
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,800
I've never seen you
trust someone this much.

169
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,170
Don't bother him too much.

170
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,400
Just focus on teaching him.

171
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,110
What, Jane?

172
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,440
Yeah.

173
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,480
We're fine.

174
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,400
How long have you known Jet, Charn?

175
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,400
We met at the volunteer camp

176
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,940
a month ago.

177
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,880
Only a month?

178
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,750
I've known him since he was 16.

179
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,540
Oh, yeah?

180
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,420
He never mentioned you.

181
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,920
Maybe he's been busy.

182
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,520
We haven't met
since he went to university.

183
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,440
Oh, okay.

184
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,880
If you're really close,

185
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,720
you'd probably make time to meet.

186
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,250
We're really close.

187
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,859
We've been through a lot together,
you know.

188
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,480
How close...

189
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,840
are you two, though?

190
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,760
What do you mean?

191
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,800
Well,

192
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,960
I got close to him...

193
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,040
'cause I was his first.

194
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,200
Well,

195
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,750
I've never done it with anyone before.

196
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
So...

197
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,560
I'm your first?

198
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,720
Obviously.

199
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,320
You're shocked, huh?

200
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,750
He didn't tell you, did he?

201
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,450
If he didn't mention it,

202
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,800
I probably don't need to know.

203
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Suit yourself.

204
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,090
But if you can outpace me today,

205
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,300
I'll tell you myself.

206
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,600
Deal?

207
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,880
Get in the car.

208
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,120
No need to rush.

209
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,280
We have all afternoon.

210
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,020
Holy shit!

211
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,880
That's even faster.

212
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,040
Shit,

213
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,540
that was you?

214
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,240
Charn,

215
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,600
that was fire!

216
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,450
Hey, bro.

217
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,410
You alright?

218
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,160
Was that your revenge?

219
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,360
No,

220
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,280
I was just...

221
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,680
What?

222
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,200
I was hoping you'd have a plan.

223
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,990
Still, I must praise you.

224
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,250
In so little time,

225
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,620
you've sealed the trace of his spirit
so completely.

226
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,120
A little retaliation is welcome.

227
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,600
Don't fail me.

228
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,400
So that I can enjoy myself...

229
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,240
Before every last one of you

230
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,360
gets wiped out tonight.

231
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,600
I told you
to use a different car, didn't I?

232
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,880
This won't seat all of us.

233
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,120
You said you needed it
to run away from that ghost.

234
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,080
This is the cheapest one.

235
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,920
Is this...

236
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,840
the cheapest one?

237
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,360
That's right, Khem.

238
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,840
But it's gonna be pretty tight.

239
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,760
Be careful.

240
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,760
Don't ever get hurt,

241
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,680
okay?

242
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
I know.

243
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,760
Don't worry.

244
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,840
I'm hard to kill, you know.

245
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,780
Ouch!

246
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,650
Hard to kill, huh?

247
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,680
Come on, Jane.

248
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,320
Can't you let me be cool for a sec?

249
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Please protect him.

250
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,960
He's my only brother.

251
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,280
You don't need to worry.

252
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,520
I won't let anything happen to him.

253
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,080
Don't push yourself too hard, either.

254
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Are you ready?

255
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,840
Yes.

256
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Come with me.

257
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,800
You sure
you don't wanna know it anymore?

258
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,280
Yes.

259
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,720
Whatever his past was,

260
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,640
it doesn't matter to me.

261
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,360
The only one I care to be with

262
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,440
is who he is now.

263
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Whoa,

264
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,400
you've won my heart, man.

265
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Hey, Kachen.

266
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
The time has come.

267
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,560
May you all be safe.

268
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,200
That's not him.

269
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,640
Follow them.

270
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
They're here.

271
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,040
Oh, shit!

272
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,960
Ramphueng's been growing her power
for over 400 years.

273
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,560
The closer we get to Khem's birthday,

274
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,080
the stronger she becomes.

275
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,960
Even I can't say for certain
that I can stop her.

276
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,440
But there's one thing on our side,

277
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
and that is time.

278
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,200
We'll stall her

279
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,960
and lure her into wasting her strength.

280
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,000
The curse that binds her to Khem

281
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,080
lets her sense Khem's soul
no matter where she is.

282
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,160
I'll enchant Khem's belongings

283
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,840
and have you all carry them.

284
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,000
It should confuse her for a while.

285
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,400
But she won't be fooled for long.

286
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,640
When she knows, Jane's tukata sia kaban

287
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,760
will radiate
the strongest trace of Khem's soul.

288
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,640
Someone will have to stand in
as the false Khem

289
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,560
and lure her into this trap.

290
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Calm down.

291
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,120
Let your instincts guide you.

292
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,960
I'm right here with you.

293
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,720
You're lucky you can't see ghosts.

294
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,480
I don't think so.

295
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,080
Either way,
that car's trying to run us over.

296
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,040
Shit...

297
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,280
Hold tight, Jet.

298
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,840
They're still here.

299
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,080
Charn, stop!

300
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,240
What's going on?

301
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,640
Why don't they...

302
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,520
Shit...

303
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,720
She's here, isn't she?

304
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,800
Hold on.

305
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,440
I need a moment.

306
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,480
If you think
those sacred rice grains will save you,

307
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,320
I'm warning you.

308
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,199
They'll only make your death
even more painful.

309
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,200
So...

310
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,120
that's all that shaman
could come up with?

311
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,600
I expected he'd have something better.

312
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,600
Don't you dare insult my master,

313
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,880
you witch!

314
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,040
Witch?

315
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,560
I am no witch.

316
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
That's not what I meant.

317
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,920
It was a curse.

318
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
Shit!

319
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
What happened?

320
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
What did she do?

321
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,800
I don't know.

322
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,440
That shaman came to you just a day ago,

323
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
but your soul's already grown stronger.

324
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,120
Oh,

325
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,500
so you're trying to control my mind?

326
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,520
Not a chance.

327
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,720
You're not the only one whose mind
I would control.

328
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,200
Jet!

329
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,240
Jet?

330
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,000
How dare you deceive me?

331
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,000
Jet!

332
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,880
Jet!

333
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,720
Jet!

334
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,240
Charn...

335
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,120
Jet...

336
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,000
Jet!

337
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,920
Jet...

338
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:19,960
Charn...

339
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,920
Jet!

340
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,610
Jet...

341
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,320
Charn...

342
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,280
Jet!

343
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,800
Charn...

344
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,800
Jet...

345
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,640
Jet...

346
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,360
Jet...

347
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,680
Ramphueng,

348
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,320
I'm begging you.

349
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,920
Please let us go.

350
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,160
We're not part of this.

351
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,160
Then why do you meddle in what's mine?!

352
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,920
Jet!

353
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,840
Jet...

354
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,400
Jet!

355
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,680
Jet!

356
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,080
Jet...

357
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,620
Tell me

358
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,600
where Khem is.

359
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,920
Answer me,

360
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,240
and I shall spare you.

361
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,960
Jet!

362
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
The dorm!

363
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,240
Kachen and I were just decoys.

364
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,880
Master's there with Khem,
waiting for midnight to pass.

365
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,700
Khemjira...

366
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:53,750
Jet!

367
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,800
Jet, wake up.

368
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,840
Jet...

369
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,200
Wake up and talk to me.

370
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,920
You said...

371
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,040
we'd make it out together, remember?

372
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
Jet,

373
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,800
please wake up.

374
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,140
Please...

375
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,440
Jet...

376
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,460
Khemjira...

377
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,600
Together.

378
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,020
Khemjira...

379
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,720
You are exceedingly bold to deceive me.

380
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,470
If you keep fooling around with me,

381
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,470
you'll miss your chance
to get to your target.

382
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,310
All set.

383
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,470
I've had my butler
get the private jet ready.

384
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,790
We'll take off
as soon as we reach the airport.

385
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,910
I even told you to get a different car,

386
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,460
yet you brought another two-seater.

387
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,630
Come on,

388
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,910
this is just perfect.

389
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,070
Cozy, you know?

390
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,190
Are you tired?

391
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,070
I'm not.

392
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,710
I'm worried that I'm too heavy.

393
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,190
Not at all.

394
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,030
Keep your eyes on the road.

395
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,770
Yeah, yeah.

396
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,550
Luang Por Derm's yantra

397
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,190
perfectly hides all traces of your soul,

398
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,190
so Ramphueng's not after us.

399
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,590
Don't worry.

400
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,630
From here to the destination,

401
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:22,830
you'll be completely safe.

402
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,150
That means she's definitely after Jet.

403
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,110
He may not seem serious,

404
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,410
but when he needs to be,

405
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,910
he's actually pretty strong.

406
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,550
I know he's strong,

407
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,150
but I'm afraid
he might push himself too hard.

408
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,110
Just remember,

409
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:57,190
he is not facing this alone.

410
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:33,390
Da?

411
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:34,750
Jin...

412
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:46,830
Da,

413
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,590
how did you get here?

414
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,270
Your friend snuck me in.

415
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,030
I don't have much time

416
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,830
before your mom comes.

417
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,110
Da,

418
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,190
I'm sorry.

419
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:03,350
I'm really sorry.

420
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:06,990
Why would you be?

421
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,790
You've done nothing wrong.

422
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,270
I thought

423
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,150
my mom would understand

424
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:18,710
and let me come with you.

425
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,110
It's okay, Jin.

426
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,150
It's totally okay.

427
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,430
I'm leaving today.

428
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,190
I'm really sorry,

429
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,790
but I can't bear
seeing you marry someone else.

430
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,670
I'm coming with you, then.

431
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,830
Right now, just us two.

432
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:54,230
What about your wedding

433
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,350
and your parents?

434
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,190
You can't do that, Jin.

435
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,190
You look so gorgeous

436
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,470
in your wedding dress.

437
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,550
I'm sorry

438
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,550
I can't be by your side today.

439
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:46,470
Da,

440
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,110
do you think

441
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,990
there's a world

442
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:59,110
where people of the same gender
can get married?

443
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,310
You're dreaming again.

444
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,110
That kind of world doesn't exist.

445
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,310
But even if we can't get married,

446
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:15,150
you'll always be the one I love

447
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:18,150
in this life

448
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,990
or any other.

449
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:22,470
Da,

450
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,030
but I believe

451
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,110
such a world exists.

452
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:30,110
I don't know where,

453
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,350
but someday,

454
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,870
we'll meet again

455
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,190
in a world where we can get married

456
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,190
and...

457
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,910
be together forever.

458
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:49,950
Because you're the only one

459
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,750
my heart belongs to

460
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:56,590
in this life

461
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,230
and every life to come.

462
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,910
♫No more will I let your hand go,♫

463
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:20,710
♫Through dream or dawn,

00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:25,030

00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:28,710

00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:37,710

470
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:49,630
25, 26, 27,

471
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,200
28, 29, 30...

472
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,910
No, Charn.

473
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,630
Come on, wake up.

474
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,030
No, Charn.

475
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:17,630
You need to be with me in this life!

476
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,150
Wake up.

477
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:28,590
Don't you see...

478
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:32,670
a world where we could be together?

479
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:37,690
Wake up, Charn.

480
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,230
Charn...

481
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:02,510
Charn...

482
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:03,630
Charn!

483
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:04,550
Jet...

484
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,750
Forgive me for making you worry.

485
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:20,990
In this life,

486
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:24,230
let's finish the story we once began.

487
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:33,290
♫No more will I let your hand go,♫

488
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:36,040
♫Through dream or dawn,

♫While I hold your hand tight

494
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,230
If you keep fooling around with me,

495
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,410
you'll miss your chance
to get to your target.

496
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,070
Who do you think you're up against?

497
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,950
You asked for this yourself.

498
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,220
You're not here.

499
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:10,780
Where are you?

500
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:16,740
Come, Ramphueng.

501
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,270
Let's end this.

502
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:27,830
Soon you will see what I can do!

503
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,350
I'll be at the ordination hall.

504
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:45,950
At midnight,
I'll strike the gong to let you know.

505
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:49,630
Thanks a lot.

506
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:52,990
I hope you stay safe, Khem.

507
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,940
I'll be waiting
to wish you a happy birthday.

508
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:58,790
Thank you, Kachen.

509
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:17,410
If you are to use it, think carefully,

510
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:19,590
for it carries

511
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:22,310
the power of the sacred weapon,

512
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,070
belonging to the guardian
of the Underworld treasures.

513
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:27,870
The human body you inhabit

514
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,510
is not meant to endure such might.

515
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:34,230
Is that the weapon
Lord of the Mountains gave you?

516
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:37,550
Yeah.

517
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:40,350
Just in case.

518
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,830
I hope I won't need it.

519
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,390
She is almost here.

520
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,990
Keep yourself inside the sacred ring
with Monk Kasem.

521
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:21,950
No matter what happens,

522
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,270
do not leave the ring.

523
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,870
In a few hours,

524
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,150
we'll celebrate your birthday together.

525
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,190
Here I am.

526
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:32,650
A monk?

527
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,190
I see.

528
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:41,190
Venerable,

529
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:44,910
this is no concern of yours.

530
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:50,390
Leave now before my patience withers.

531
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:24,910
You damn shaman...

532
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,470
You never fail to cause me trouble.

533
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,190
You've lost.

534
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:35,630
Now go atone for what you've done.

535
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:39,070
What makes you think

536
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:41,270
I'd ever lose to you?

537
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:48,510
You should've realized it
when you came here alone.

538
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:55,950
I've freed every spirit in this place.

539
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:02,910
There are no wandering souls left
for you to command.

540
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,670
Even if you call upon those from afar,

541
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:09,510
they won't reach you in time.

542
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,510
Then...

543
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:17,270
face me alone.

544
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:31,010
Do you think your invisibility spell

545
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,990
can save you?

546
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:35,630
Who knows?

547
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:38,790
But the clock is ticking.

548
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,350
Show yourself.

549
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,990
I don't have time for your nonsense.

550
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,190
A relentless spirit like you

551
01:03:57,230 --> 01:04:00,150
cannot stand against
Phraya Ananta Nagaraja's might.

552
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:04,390
I bet Phraya Ananta Nagaraja...

553
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:07,950
can't even keep you breathing, can he?

554
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,340
Master!

555
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:51,910
I granted you a chance,

556
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,910
but since you insist on opposing me,

557
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:56,750
then die.

558
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:49,910
It's past midnight.

559
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:53,390
Khem's 21 now.

560
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:55,470
Let him go.

561
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:59,190
And why should I do that?

562
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:05,230
If you break the vow you swore,

563
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:08,910
your soul will fade away.

564
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:12,470
The vow I swore?

565
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:15,990
Ramphueng,

566
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:20,310
I understand
losing your son must've hurt deeply,

567
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:26,750
but I have nothing to do with it.

568
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:30,790
Let's finally set each other free.

569
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:34,630
No.

570
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,430
This can't be the end.

571
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:43,070
It's over.

572
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:46,990
Go and face your karma.

573
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:06,830
They're finally here.

574
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:44,990
You may not know

575
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:49,030
that a place not far from here

576
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:51,430
was once a battlefield,

577
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:56,230
filled with spirits
I could bind to serve me.

578
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,550
And you probably didn't know

579
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,630
when I said

580
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,750
Khem must die at 21,

581
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:17,229
I never said it had to be at midnight.

582
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:22,510
He was born at six in the morning.

583
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:34,670
Peem!

584
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:05,710
I can sense that Khem's still alive,

585
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,149
but that doesn't mean he's safe.

586
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:09,950
Please stop.

587
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:13,270
My life is all you want, right?

588
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:14,390
Khem...

589
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:15,990
Go back!

590
01:09:16,229 --> 01:09:18,229
In my past life,

591
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:22,390
I let someone die right before my eyes.

592
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:25,790
You will know the pain I've felt.

593
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:27,390
Goodbye.

594
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:35,729
♫It's more than love at first sight,♫

595
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,870
♫But a bond through every life♫

596
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:41,490
♫Our destinies cross again in this life♫

597
01:09:41,529 --> 01:09:44,490
♫You'll be my last, my eternal light,♫

598
01:09:44,529 --> 01:09:46,600
♫From now until the end of time♫

599
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:53,279
♫Whether it's a dream or it's true,♫

600
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:55,670
♫My heart forever stays with you♫

601
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:59,080
♫No force shall tear our souls in two♫

602
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,120
♫I love you through and through♫

603
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:04,530
♫Even if the world ceases to move,♫

604
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:07,870
♫These words will still be true,♫

605
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:13,310
♫I love you♫
