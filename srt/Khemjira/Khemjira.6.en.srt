00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,680
Stop it, Ramphueng.

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,360
You know my name?

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,800
I was minding my own path.

6
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,820
It is you who came to provoke me.

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,920
Go into the forest

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,080
and look for red pieces of paper
rolled like this.

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,480
Because it's not dark yet,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,720
Phrai, the territory holder,
is still awake.

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
Phrai?

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,920
Who's that?

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,480
May I stay here
until the semester break ends?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Please.

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,300
Please, Master.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,680
Master's dad and Prim's were close,

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,880
so they'd often visit each other.

[Ubon Ratchathani, 2010]

19
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,670
Honey...

20
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,560
Honey!

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,800
Honey...

22
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,200
Why are you not in bed?

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,759
You should lie down and rest.

24
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
Why are you here?

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,770
Wanted some music.

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,620
The cassette tape's stretched.

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,520
I was gonna fix it.

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,440
Why didn't you tell me?

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,720
You were out to pick up our son.

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,840
I thought I could do it myself.

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,960
I've been so drained lately.

32
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,400
I can't even listen to music
without bothering someone.

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
You're like this

34
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,520
because of my dad.

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,000
It's all on him.

36
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,280
All done, Mom.

37
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,440
I'll heat up the food.

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Okay.

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,800
What's wrong?

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,680
Easy, sweetie.

41
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,400
You're not a little boy anymore.

42
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,640
I spoke with your dad.

43
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,320
If you want to keep learning
shamanic practices with Grandpa,

44
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,600
he won't stop you.

45
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,080
When you grow up,

46
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,000
I know you're gonna be
a really great shaman.

47
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,680
I really wish you could be here
until I become a shaman.

48
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,880
You know what?

49
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,000
Being a shaman means
you can't have a lover, sweetie.

50
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,240
I don't need one, Mom.

51
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,080
You're such a sweet talker,

52
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,200
Peem.

53
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,320
I'll be watching over you.

54
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,480
Paran and Prim are already close.

55
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,240
He's not a kid anymore.

56
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,320
He needs to have his own life.

57
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,280
He needs to have his own life?

58
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,920
I'd say it's the life you chose for him.

59
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,080
He's your son, yet you don't even know

60
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,640
that he wants to be a shaman here.

61
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,900
That's on you.

62
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,320
You've been drilling that into him.

63
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,159
And you?

64
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,440
You're making him marry
Mr. Chang's daughter to pay off a debt.

65
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,760
But did you even ask him?

66
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,440
Mr. Chang tricked you
into that investment,

67
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,040
and it all went to hell.

68
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,120
You were so messed up
that I had to help.

69
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,400
Do you want me to be honest

70
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,240
and tell you who's actually to blame?

71
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,360
My wife is dead,

72
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,960
and Paran's lost his mom.

73
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,640
Our family ended up like this

74
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,320
all because of you, Dad,
isn't that right?

75
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Don't you think so?

76
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,000
I didn't mean for any of it.

77
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,800
And that made it even worse.

78
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,740
You knew damn well

79
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,000
it would all backfire on your family,

80
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,560
but you just kept going.

81
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,320
Learned a new technique
from Uncle Kasem,

82
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,200
so you wanted to try it out, huh?

83
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,520
Chai...

84
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,400
has helped us a lot.

85
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,960
When trouble came,

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,480
I wanted to help him, too.

87
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,920
You are right.

88
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,760
But if that curse really backfires,

89
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,160
I can still break it.

90
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,600
But you couldn't

91
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,120
'cause you're not that good, Dad.

92
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,600
And all this acting nice
to your grandson...

93
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,280
is to cover up your mistake, right?

94
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,520
Paran?

95
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,000
Is that true, Grandpa?

96
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,200
So it turns out
no one truly cares about me.

97
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,240
Paran!

98
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,200
Paran...

99
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,240
Your dad has sent his regards.

100
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,440
He also said

101
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,040
he missed you and our home.

102
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,680
No need to lie, Grandpa.

103
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,840
He fled overseas to avoid his debts

104
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
because he didn't care about me.

105
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,560
I don't think he's coming back.

106
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,240
As for the debt he owes Mr. Chang,

107
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,840
I'm taking care of it.

108
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,680
After this, it's up to you

109
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,560
which way you want to go.

110
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,960
Okay.

111
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,240
I chose to ordain

112
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,560
because I genuinely wanted to know

113
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
what my life is meant for.

114
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,140
I'm sorry

115
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,620
for everything
that happened to your mom.

116
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
I know

117
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,740
that you're still upset

118
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,880
and angry with me,

119
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,540
but I don't have the nerve
to ask for your forgiveness.

120
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
I just want you to remember that...

121
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,820
if you ever want to become a shaman,

122
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,760
I'll still be waiting for you at home.

123
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,780
I just...

124
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,180
wanted to try it out.

125
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,740
Haven't I told you

126
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,660
that we're no longer in love
with each other?

127
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
Just give up.

128
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,940
You promised me

129
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,540
that you wouldn't cause me any trouble.

130
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,340
If you wanna stay, just stay.

131
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,180
But don't force me to do anything.

132
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,940
It's impossible between us.

133
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Is it?

134
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,260
All this time that you've been helping

135
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,210
and protecting me...

136
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,740
You were not willing to do it, were you?

137
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,860
Did I force you to do that?

138
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,900
You don't need to answer me.

139
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,500
This is clear enough.

140
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,620
I'm sorry for everything, then.

141
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,780
And...

142
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,660
about tonight...

143
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,260
Please act as if it never happened.

144
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,500
Whoa.

145
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,380
You could totally
be a master chef, Khem.

146
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,460
Once you graduate,
you should open a restaurant.

147
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,660
You'd better be ready
to gain some weight

148
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,580
'cause after this,
Khem's going to cook every meal for us!

149
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,060
That's good news!

150
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,940
Thank you, Khem.

151
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,860
Khem...

152
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,260
Khem!

153
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,540
Yeah?

154
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,780
Oh...

155
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,460
Looks like he's still sad.

156
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,260
I can see it.

157
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,300
My eyesight
is so much better than yours.

158
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,900
Hey, Khem.

159
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,579
Wanna go paddle at the lotus pond today?

160
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,619
It's gorgeous there!

161
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,020
Wow...

162
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,140
That sounds like a brilliant idea.

163
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,980
Makes me want to go right away.

164
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,580
The lotus pond!

165
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,020
The lotus pond...

166
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,740
You wanted to become my disciple,

167
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,580
but didn't want to learn anything?

168
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,980
Finish your meal and come with me.

169
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,020
I'll teach you
the basics of white magic.

170
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,780
Okay, Master.

171
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,300
Master...

172
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,060
What about breakfast?

173
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,980
I'm good.

174
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,940
Uh...

175
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,060
It's already ready.

176
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,580
I can take it upstairs for you.

177
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,460
No need.

178
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,740
I'm not hungry.

179
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,300
Come on,

180
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,100
I made your favorite dishes here.

181
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,380
I was being clear enough.

182
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,780
Eat it yourself
if you don't wanna throw it.

183
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,420
Or just give it to Dotty.

184
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,020
Go.

185
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,740
I was pretending nothing happened.

186
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Khem!

187
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,660
Khem!

188
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,220
Oh, Grandma Si?

189
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,490
- Hello.
- Good morning.

190
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,100
Hi.

191
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,740
Are you here for Master?

192
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
For you.

193
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,220
I'm going into town
for a vital force calling,

194
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,460
so I'm here to get you.

195
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,980
Me?

196
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,100
Yeah.

197
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,620
I might have to ask Master
for his permission.

198
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,900
You don't.

199
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,740
He told me to get you.

200
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,660
Let's go.

201
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,940
Okay.

202
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,860
Right, hold on.

203
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
Thongphun,

204
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,860
give me the herb.

205
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Here, take this.

206
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,820
What is it?

207
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,220
It's a turmeric called Pra-taba.

208
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,660
It's incredibly powerful.

209
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,640
Spirits, whether good or bad,

210
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,760
won't come near.

211
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,660
Your master has plenty upstairs.

212
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,340
I also have some in the car.

213
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,180
You should take it

214
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,540
to strengthen your protection.

215
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,100
Okay.

216
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,500
Thank you, Grandma.

217
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,140
Are you going into town?

218
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,660
This is it. We're here.

219
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,780
Stop the car.

220
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,980
Okay.

221
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,820
Khem, take the stuff
and come with me, okay?

222
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,020
Grandma...

223
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
Come on.

224
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,620
Hurry.

225
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,580
- What?
- Come here.

226
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,740
She's upstairs.

227
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,180
Jeez.

228
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,980
What's going on now?

229
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,540
Please help me.

230
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,780
That's why I'm here.

231
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,260
Big...

232
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
Where is she?

233
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,580
Big...

234
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,980
Big...

235
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,710
She's not actually sick.

236
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,900
Big...

237
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,180
Big!

238
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,620
How is she feeling?

239
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,700
Big!

240
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,140
Big...

241
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,500
Hey.

242
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,020
Big...

243
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,180
Is there any way to help her?

244
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,540
She's been like this for two days.

245
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,340
Seems like she got even worse today.

246
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,620
She hasn't breastfed her baby
all day, either.

247
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,380
I'm the one taking care of it.

248
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,420
It's nothing new.

249
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,940
Her vital force has left her body

250
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,420
and is around her boyfriend.

251
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,860
Big hasn't visited her
at all for months,

252
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,380
and he won't even pick up her calls.

253
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,300
Big...

254
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,740
She might be mad at him

255
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,340
for leaving her.

256
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
His family wouldn't let him come,
would they?

257
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,860
They can't just let her
raise the baby by herself.

258
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,820
Isn't that too cruel?

259
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,860
Big...

260
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,140
There are 40 subjects of meditation.

261
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,620
You need to practice them
one set at a time.

262
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,220
Read through these.

263
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,300
I'll teach you the one you want.
[Supreme Buddhist Mantras of Great Power]

264
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,300
[Patipada: Path of Practice]

265
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,540
But it takes time to master each one.

266
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,140
How quickly someone masters

267
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,580
it depends on each person.

268
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
Okay, Master.

269
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,980
The other book

270
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,020
is a book of mantras.

271
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,740
It's filled with
protective incantations.

272
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,380
However, you must not
use them improperly.

273
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,940
Let's start with meditation, then.

274
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,260
[Phra Nakhon, 1941]

275
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,580
I'm sorry.

276
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,300
I woke you up.

277
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,580
It's okay.

278
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,220
I shouldn't be sleeping here
in the first place.

279
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,540
Give me some more time.

280
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,860
You're so gorgeous
without your glasses.

281
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,860
Jin!

282
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,180
We're not at home now.

283
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,180
It's a holiday.

284
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,620
How many people would actually
be hanging out in the library like you?

285
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,420
Are you getting tired of this?

286
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,860
Not at all!

287
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,380
Da,

288
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,660
do you think...

289
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,640
we should tell Khem about us?

290
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,940
Well...

291
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,380
Khem's still sad about Wat.

292
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,420
If we tell her,

293
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,060
will it make her feel even lonelier?

294
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
Really?

295
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,300
Is that the actual reason?

296
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,900
Not because you're afraid
she won't support us, right?

297
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
No.

298
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,140
I'm just worried that
she'll feel like she's a third wheel.

299
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,100
Though we've never seen her
act that way,

300
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,100
someone like her
would definitely overthink it.

301
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,420
How about we wait
until Wat comes back

302
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,340
and tell her at her wedding?

303
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,700
We could even take that chance

304
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,260
to go on a honeymoon with them.

305
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,660
Sounds good?

306
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,780
Yeah.

307
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,660
That's a promise.

308
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,900
That's a promise.

309
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,540
That's a promise.

310
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,420
That's a promise.

311
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,540
Jet...

312
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,340
Jet!

313
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,980
Jet!

314
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,100
Master Paran asked me
to take care of this boy,

315
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,300
so he's here.

316
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,370
I see.

317
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,860
Come on, hurry.

318
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,940
Suay is coming home soon.

319
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,460
- Alright.
- Come in.

320
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,620
Come on, Khem.

321
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,780
You're not just a boy anymore,
you know that?

322
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,740
Found someone new
and forgot the old one, huh?

323
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,420
How about ending things with Earn first

324
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,900
- Come on...
- before being with this one?

325
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,300
It's not that I've stopped loving her,

326
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,220
and I couldn't just leave my baby there.

327
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,500
So you want both of them?

328
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,100
What's stopping you
from going back to her, seriously?

329
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,900
I can't go.

330
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,030
Stop asking me.

331
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,100
Don't tell me what to do.
I know what to do.

332
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,660
- Do it.
- Go away from me.

333
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,420
Jeez.

334
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,460
It's ready, Grandma.

335
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,580
Sadhu.

336
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,260
Dear all deities,

337
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,740
household deity, Goddess of the Earth,

338
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,980
and the guardians of this land,

339
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,860
I'm here to call upon Earn's vital force

340
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,180
to return to her body.

341
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,580
Is that Suay?

342
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,420
- Let this ritual succeed and be blessed.
- Yeah.

343
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,380
She's my wife.

344
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,590
May her vital force come to me.

345
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,340
She was actually my other girlfriend,

346
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,660
but she's legally my wife now.

347
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,820
My family wanted me to marry her.

348
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,540
But...

349
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,300
you and Earn
have a baby together, though.

350
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,780
You won't understand.

351
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,580
You'll face these problems
once you grow up.

352
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,380
Mom...

353
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,060
Grandma Si?

354
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,860
Right, it's me.

355
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,540
Do you want to eat something?

356
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,700
I'll make you something tasty.

357
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,660
Okay.

358
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,260
I'll tie your wrist.

359
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,700
May you be alright,

360
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,540
and may your vital force be with you.

361
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,420
May it bring healing to you.

362
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,500
Eat a lot. Take enough rest.

363
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,780
Always think of your baby
and mom, okay?

364
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,780
If your vital force
leaves your body again,

365
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,820
I'll let Master give you
a serious lesson.

366
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,260
Auntie, are you home?

367
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,220
What?

368
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,940
Your car is blocking the road.
Come move it.

369
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,980
Got it.

370
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,020
Wait,

371
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,700
maybe that's my car.

372
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,980
Where's my driver, though?

373
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
Thongphun...

374
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,180
What a smart-ass.
He must be somewhere else.

375
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,060
I'll give him a call.

376
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,500
Grandma, thank you so much.

377
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,380
Yeah.

378
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,540
Hope you feel better.

379
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,660
We'll take our leave.

380
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
- Okay.
- Jeez.

381
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,940
He sure knows how to slack.

382
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,460
I'll go wash the baby bottle
and prepare a new one.

383
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,620
Hey, Thongphun.

384
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,380
Come here now.

385
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,020
Can't take my eyes off of you, can I?

386
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,900
You sure know how to slack off, huh?

387
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,220
Jeez.

388
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,780
Khem...

389
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,460
What's wrong?

390
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,580
What happened?

391
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,940
I think...

392
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,500
Ramphueng's here with me.

393
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,020
What?

394
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Earn!

395
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,100
Earn,

396
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,540
where are you?

397
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,659
- Earn!
- Ugh, what now?

398
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,659
Earn's missing!

399
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,300
She took her baby, too.

400
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,739
How is that possible?
I just got down here.

401
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,739
Go look for her.

402
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,780
I've looked everywhere,
but I couldn't find her.

403
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,620
Are you sure you have?

404
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,020
How could she leave that fast?

405
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:44,340
Where could she possibly go?

406
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,020
Jet,

407
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,300
are you with Master?

408
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,110
Can't find her.

409
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
I think...

410
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,060
Ramphueng's messing with us.

411
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,940
Are you crazy?

412
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,580
Why did you bring the baby?

413
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,540
Suay is home.

414
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,780
I told you I'd visit you when I can.

415
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,060
I have only one question.

416
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,980
Give me the answer,

417
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,620
and I'll leave.

418
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,260
Do you still love me?

419
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,700
Earn!

420
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,420
You came here just for this?

421
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,980
But it matters to me.

422
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,620
Answer me,

423
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,780
so I'll know what to do next.

424
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,860
Earn,

425
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:56,980
go home.

426
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,580
Your mom's worried about you.

427
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,740
Why are you here, Master?

428
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,740
You told me
you'd stay away from him, didn't you?

429
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,780
I just want to know

430
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,780
if he still loves me and our baby.

431
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,780
I'm tired...

432
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,520
of raising this baby all alone.

433
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,060
What's going on?

434
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,420
So you haven't visited us at all...

435
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,820
Get inside, Suay. It's unsafe.

436
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,180
So now, I'm making her feel unsafe?

437
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,820
The one to blame

438
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,800
is the person who left his baby
and didn't own up, isn't it?

439
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,860
I carried this child

440
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,140
because you said you loved me.

441
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,660
But how could you treat me like this?

442
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,780
Earn!

443
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,260
You damn ghost,

444
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,060
get out of my daughter's body now!

445
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,060
Let her go.

446
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,140
She has nothing to do with this.

447
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,500
You're wrong.

448
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,700
No spirit did this.

449
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,820
What do you mean?

450
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,420
Then, why is she like this
all of a sudden?

451
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,420
What's wrong with me?

452
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,380
Yeah,

453
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,500
I guess it's just me.

454
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,420
The only crazy one,

455
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,860
the only fool!

456
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,540
Earn,

457
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,860
let's come home.

458
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,220
Forget that bastard.

459
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,340
No.

460
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,300
I won't leave

461
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,260
unless I get my answer.

462
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,860
Do you still love me?

463
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,820
Answer me!

464
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,300
I...

465
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,620
No matter what,

466
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,900
I always want the best for you.

467
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,340
So that's a no.

468
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,620
You can't even be honest about it.

469
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,900
You're expecting another baby,

470
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,080
so I guess...

471
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,940
I won't have to take care
of this shit anymore.

472
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,820
- Earn!
- Earn!

473
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,260
- Earn...
- Leave me alone!

474
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,420
Stay away from me.

475
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,980
Get a grip!

476
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,220
You better know
what you're trying to do.

477
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,300
- Earn...
- Earn!

478
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,220
- Earn!
- Earn!

479
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,740
Ma'am!

480
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,000
Ma'am...

481
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,500
No!

482
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,980
Ma'am!

483
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,140
Let go of me!

484
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,380
Ma'am...

485
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,020
Earn...

486
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,780
Earn!

487
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,020
Earn...

488
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,460
Why did you do that?

489
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,740
Mom, I'm sorry.

490
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,380
I didn't know what to do.

491
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,380
Master,

492
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,820
I'm really sorry.

493
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,180
If it were you hurting yourself,

494
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,260
I'd stay out of it.

495
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,900
But you literally involved your child,

496
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,580
and that made you even worse than him.

497
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,940
You're no different.

498
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,900
Selfish.

499
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,780
Self-centered.

500
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,940
You nearly turned a woman
into a murderer.

501
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
I'm sorry.

502
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,900
I'm sorry, Earn.

503
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,140
If you're not ready to be parents,

504
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,540
let the child live.

505
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,020
Your child isn't a doll

506
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,100
you can just toss around.

507
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,020
Will you raise your baby?

508
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,100
If not,

509
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,500
then place the child in an orphanage.

510
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,660
Take care of Earn.

511
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,980
Let her heal.

512
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,320
Find her a job.

513
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,020
When she's ready,
she can get her baby back.

514
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,380
Thank you, Master.

515
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,740
Without your power,

516
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,700
things would've turned out worse.

517
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,180
It wasn't me.

518
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,380
Oh...

519
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,260
If it wasn't you...

520
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,500
Quit nagging me, will you?

521
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,220
Take care of yourself.

522
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,100
Master,

523
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,020
take Khem back with you.

524
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,220
He can stay and help you

525
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,620
until you're all done.

526
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,260
Are you mad at each other?

527
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,580
Uh...

528
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,780
We're not.

529
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,780
Anyway, Grandma Si,

530
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,340
when everyone froze just now,

531
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,820
was it really
not because of Master's power?

532
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,860
Master was telling the truth.

533
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,140
But is it true...

534
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,180
that Ramphueng's been following you?

535
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,180
Well...

536
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,300
Yes.

537
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,300
Also, she always messes
with people's minds.

538
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,740
I'm so scared

539
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,420
that if anything goes wrong,
I'll be the cause.

540
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,500
Don't overthink it.

541
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,860
Master already told you

542
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,280
that Earn did that on her own.

543
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,380
She loved him so much

544
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,940
that she lost her mind,

545
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,100
acting like she was possessed.

546
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,940
No need to worry.

547
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,420
So it was you who saved the baby.

548
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,340
Though you've lost
most of your humanity,

549
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,780
you still remember
what it means to be a mother.

550
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,140
It all turns out that...

551
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,020
no ghost was possessing her.

552
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,700
It was Earn herself.

553
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,060
He didn't let her go,

554
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,300
and she wouldn't move on.

555
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,580
That's why it's toxic.

556
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,260
I also think...

557
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,540
I won't bother Master anymore.

558
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:52,900
What?

559
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,740
What do you mean?

560
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,940
What's wrong?

561
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,140
I feel like
I've been making him uncomfortable.

562
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,820
That's it.

563
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,740
Let's go to sleep.

564
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,260
Jeez, what is this?

565
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,980
We haven't even set sail,

566
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,020
but my ship has already sunk.

567
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,620
I respect your decision, Khem.

568
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,740
If you want some space to move on,

569
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,780
I'll support you.

570
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,140
Right now,

571
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,820
your priority should be

572
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,500
breaking the curse.

573
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,780
But...

574
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,820
wouldn't it be too hard, Khem?

575
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,100
I guess there's no choice.

576
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,500
Charn's right.

577
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,140
I should focus on the curse

578
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,380
and not waste time on this stuff.

579
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,580
Khem!

580
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,620
Khem...

581
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,820
Khem!

582
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,700
Wake up and talk to me!

583
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:39,100
I have so many things to tell you.

584
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,900
Khem...

585
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,540
Calm down, Jin.

586
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,980
She's no longer with us.

587
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,580
Now what, Da?

588
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,740
Does our promise still matter?

589
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,780
I'm sorry, Jin.

590
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,060
If we visited her more often,

591
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,220
she wouldn't feel so alone...

592
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,820
and ended up like this, right, Da?

593
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,640
We were by her side

594
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,980
all the way to the end.

595
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,820
I'm sorry, Jin.

596
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,980
It's not your fault.

597
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,540
Who the heck is Jin?

598
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,060
What am I doing?

599
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,460
- Good morning.
- What's that?

600
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:27,780
Oh,

601
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,180
I got these
from Uncle Chai this morning.

602
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,220
- I'm gonna make some cushions for...
- That's fine.

603
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,260
No need to trouble yourself.

604
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,860
Well, I was saying...

605
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,260
I'd make some cushions
for Jet and Charn.

606
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,900
They have to meditate for hours,

607
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,500
so they might feel uncomfortable.

608
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,860
Oh,

609
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:50,820
is that so?

610
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:54,660
Good.

611
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,500
Are you making coffee?

612
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,360
Then...

613
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,280
No need.

614
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,300
Just do what you need to do.

615
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,540
Oh,

616
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,220
I was gonna say

617
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,500
you might need to boil some more water

618
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,140
since I've used it all.

619
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,060
Well,

620
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,820
if that's all,
I'll put the stuff away now.

621
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,820
Hang in there, Khem.

622
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,660
Prim's here again.

623
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:15,800
Wait,

624
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,140
that's Elder Chang.

625
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,260
Why is he here?

626
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,500
Who is he?

627
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,500
Prim's dad.

628
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,780
Isn't it normal for him
to come with his daughter?

629
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,580
He and Master
have been at odds for ages.

630
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,260
I don't know why.

631
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,380
Hello, Master.

632
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,020
Long time no see, Elder.

633
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,700
You came all the way here.

634
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,940
Is there a reason for your visit?

635
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,420
Well...

636
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,220
Nothing serious.

637
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,860
My luck's been bad lately,

638
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,580
so Prim suggested I come

639
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:59,020
to have you check my fortune.

640
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:02,260
I hope you don't mind me being here.

641
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,780
I absolutely don't.

642
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:09,820
Please.

643
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,340
Hello.

644
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,180
Hello.

645
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,380
Thank you so much.

646
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,260
I'll go make merit as you suggested.

647
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,460
Well, actually...

648
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,380
I came here

649
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,460
to apologize

650
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,500
for what I did
that led to our past conflicts.

651
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,420
I've never had any conflict with you,

652
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,540
but I'll accept

653
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,180
the goodwill you have for me.

654
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,380
Please take this.

655
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,660
Dad wouldn't feel at ease

656
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,260
if he didn't give you something.

657
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,900
Prim's right, Master.

658
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,220
Jet,

659
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,580
put this away.

660
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:28,980
Go help Charn with his practice, too.

661
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,460
Okay, Master.

662
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:55,620
Anyway, please keep looking after
my daughter.

663
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,580
Well,

664
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,380
actually,

665
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,700
I need your help, Master.

666
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:17,980
I'm advising some students right now,

667
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:21,420
and they're putting on a play
commemorating the Phi Bun Rebellion.

668
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,340
The Phi Bun Rebellion?

669
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,660
You mean the Holy Man's Rebellion?

670
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,060
Yes.

671
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:39,980
It involves spirits
and some real-life events,

672
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:43,500
so I wanted to ask

673
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:47,140
if you could perform the ritual for us.

674
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,520
When?

675
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,180
May 3rd, Master.

676
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,950
But there might need to be...

677
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,180
some practice beforehand.

678
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,540
Uh...

679
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,260
I'm sorry.

680
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:38,500
Don't be.

681
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:41,100
I didn't let you know I was around.

682
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:44,900
Uh...

683
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,620
You're Pong, right?

684
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:49,340
Wait,

685
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,020
you know me?

686
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,380
Oh, yes.

687
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,940
Jet has told me about you.

688
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:03,220
Uh...

689
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,220
Are you going to see Prim upstairs?

690
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,380
No.

691
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:11,900
I think...

692
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,100
I'll wait here.

693
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,980
The view here...

694
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,740
is so nice and...

695
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:20,740
easy on the eyes.

696
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,500
Well,

697
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,780
- okay. I'll get you some water.
- Hey.

698
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,180
I'm good.

699
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,900
Anyway,

700
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,260
what's your name?

701
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,300
I'm Khem.

702
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,420
Khem?

703
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,140
That's a beautiful name.

704
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,940
Nice to meet you.

705
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:04,620
Hold on...

706
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:26,780
All done.

707
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,060
Thank you.

708
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:29,940
So,

709
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:33,420
are you a Master's disciple like Jet?

710
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,860
I'm not.

711
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,060
It's my semester break,

712
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,180
so I'm here with Jet.

713
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,220
That's great.

714
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,540
I can come here often now

715
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,860
and get you something.

716
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,900
By the way, what do you like to eat?

717
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,060
You seem a bit gloomy, Pong.

718
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:01,100
There's a chance of getting hurt,

719
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,460
so make sure to pray regularly.

720
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:08,740
Hi, Master.

721
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,380
Anyway,

722
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,480
you also look kinda worn out.

723
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,660
Did you have enough sleep?

724
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:21,660
Pong,

725
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,100
are you seriously
messing with Master, too?

726
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,460
So, see you later.

727
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:29,660
Okay.

728
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,140
Goodbye, Master.

729
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,860
I'll see you soon.

730
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,140
Have a safe ride.

731
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,900
Pong,

732
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:49,700
are you coming?

733
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,020
Start the car, please.

734
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:52,460
Okay.

735
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,660
Bye.

736
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:32,420
Charn's almost done with his practice.

737
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,540
Go make him some lunch.

738
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,860
Yes, Master.

739
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:45,220
As for my lunch,

740
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:50,580
keep it covered.

741
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:52,940
I'll eat it later.

742
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,340
If you don't eat it,

743
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:10,680
you'll be in trouble.

744
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:27,820
Come on, what's with that smile?

745
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:29,340
You barely got out of the car.

746
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,540
Stop saying that to your brother.

747
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,700
Now that you have a reason
to come here often,

748
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,740
that's good for you too, isn't it?

749
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:40,860
Are you happy that I came today?

750
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:41,900
Yes, Dad.

751
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:45,140
Thank you so much for accepting Master.

752
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,420
Yeah.

753
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,260
You'd better think it through.

754
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,620
I really love him, Dad.

755
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:56,780
No matter what,

756
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:58,580
I'll win his heart.

757
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,620
Exactly! That's right.

758
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:02,980
Good.

759
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,780
I'm getting on in years now.

760
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,180
I want a grandchild!

761
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,260
What a classic boomer line.

762
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:13,140
How many, Dad?

763
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:14,500
You'll need to give me some, too.

764
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,180
What do you think?

765
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,540
Is his intention good or bad?

766
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,420
I don't think it's bad,

767
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,300
but I'm not sure if it's good.

768
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,460
Should we let Master know about it?

769
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:45,580
Picture this.

770
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:51,340
"There's a chance of getting hurt,

771
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,100
so make sure to pray regularly."

772
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:58,780
See?

773
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,260
I'm sure he was jealous.

774
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,380
Quit it.

775
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,420
Master probably thought

776
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,460
Pong was going too far.

777
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,380
No, I mean...

778
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,220
it was like a scene from a movie.

779
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:15,660
Like...

780
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,980
acting like he belongs to him
now that someone shows up.

781
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:24,140
He has no feelings for Khem,

782
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:26,140
but Khem's also his?

783
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,180
Is that what you're saying?

784
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,820
Is the master you know

785
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,100
that possessive and irrational?

786
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:39,740
So,

787
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,900
was that Pong guy

788
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,660
really flirty, Khem?

789
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,380
Well,

790
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,840
I don't know,

791
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:52,340
but his gestures and words
seemed unusual.

792
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,180
Come on.

793
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,380
You had dust in your hair.

794
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,700
I would've taken it off for you, too.

795
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,740
Jet,

796
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,740
if you didn't feel anything,

797
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,380
would you really touch someone's hair
while looking at them?

798
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,260
Alright.

799
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,220
Other than approaching too fast,

800
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,460
he seems like a decent guy, right?

801
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:26,780
Hey,

802
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:29,300
how can you change your ship now?

803
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,940
I never cared
about any of that shipping stuff.

804
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,100
Think about it.

805
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,740
Khem's trying to move on,

806
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,740
and someone's approaching him.

807
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:43,620
It wouldn't hurt for Khem

808
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:45,060
to consider him, right?

809
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,660
Are you seriously a psychology major?

810
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,140
Is it that easy to change who you like?

811
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,820
Exactly, I'm a psychology major,

812
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:57,420
- so I know a theory by Robert Stern...
- Stop that.

813
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:58,940
We're on a semester break.

814
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,300
No lectures here.

815
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,660
To sum it up,

816
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,660
love consists of intimacy,

817
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,980
passion,

818
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,580
and commitment.

819
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,820
Khem is close to Master

820
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:12,740
and attracted to him,

821
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,380
but they met not so long ago.

822
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,220
Not much longer before Pong.

823
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:22,100
So there's no commitment
between them.

824
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,939
But they've been in love
since their past lives.

825
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:25,859
Jet,

826
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:27,979
take it easy.

827
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,060
I've told you

828
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,620
our past lives
have nothing to do with this.

829
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,660
Of course they do.

830
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,979
You've been in love
for almost a century.

831
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:40,420
How is that not commitment?

832
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:56,779
That's a promise.

833
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:06,180
You're shocked, huh?

834
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,859
Nothing to say?

835
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:15,660
You're wrong.

836
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:19,260
I was just...

837
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:22,340
thinking about
what you told me about Prim...

838
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:23,380
Prim?

839
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:27,340
What's with her?

840
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,420
Jet?

841
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:34,220
Well,

842
01:09:35,229 --> 01:09:36,660
when she came,

843
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,140
I eavesdropped a bit.

844
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:43,620
It seemed like...

845
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:45,979
she was trying to get Master,

846
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,779
and he...

847
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,260
didn't seem to reject her.

848
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:08,940
Could it be that...

849
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,740
he still has feelings for her?

850
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,140
Now, that...

851
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,500
is commitment.

852
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,260
In this life,

853
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:26,420
not from a previous one.

854
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,460
I see.

855
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:46,660
That's how it is.

856
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:49,260
But...

857
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,380
why didn't you tell me that?

858
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,220
Well,

859
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:55,860
I was worried you'd still be sad.

860
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:58,020
Sad?

861
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:00,660
It's better this way.

862
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,700
Like I said, I'm trying to move on.

863
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,700
I didn't ask you to do that.

864
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,260
Why stick your noses into it?

865
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:11,980
We're sorry.

866
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:15,820
We just wanted to know
if Elder's intention was good or bad.

867
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,260
This time,

868
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:34,580
it seems like Prim's serious, Master.

869
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:38,660
Elder Chang even said
he wanted a grandchild soon.

870
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:43,580
♫If I have questions,
will you answer me?♫

871
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,220
That's up to them.

872
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:48,460
But it involves you, Master.

873
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,300
Aren't you going to do anything?

874
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,500
Prim means no harm.

875
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:04,060
It's nothing that needs to be stopped.

876
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:13,620
♫If I weren't here,
would your tears fall,♫

877
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:18,500
♫Or would my leaving
change nothing at all?♫

878
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:19,940
Now, that...

879
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:21,860
is commitment.

880
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,290
In this life,

881
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:28,980
not from a previous one.

882
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:02,580
I hope you really think this over

883
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:05,100
and see if you can give me a chance

884
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:06,740
I've never stopped loving you.

885
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:08,140
What is it?

886
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:10,180
Pong's taking me
to the temple fair tonight.

887
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,300
Make sure he takes care of you.

888
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,580
- If anything goes wrong,
- Hey!

889
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,380
he'll be the first one I blame.

890
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:17,460
- What the fuck?
- Hey, hey.

891
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,180
Hey!

892
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,020
What is that?

893
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:27,060
Thanks to all of you
for letting me have a fun time.

894
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,420
You won't get away with this.

895
