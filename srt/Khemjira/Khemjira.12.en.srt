3
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,040
Ramphueng won't hear anything

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,760
we say in this room.

5
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,960
I'll go over the whole plan just once.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
I was hoping you'd have a plan.

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,280
Don't fail me,

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,520
or every last one of you

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,360
will be wiped out tonight.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,920
You don't need to
bear all of this alone anymore.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,280
No, Charn.

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Come, Ramphueng.

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,880
Let's end this.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,720
Soon, you will see what I can do.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,680
And you probably didn't know

16
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,570
when I said

17
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,940
Khem must die at 21,

18
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,080
I never said it had to be at midnight.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,800
He was born at six in the morning.

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,610
Peem!

21
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,880
Khem, stay focused.

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,120
Do not step out of the ring.

23
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,680
Keep your faith in him.

24
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,390
Please stop.

25
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,960
My life is all you want, right?

26
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,880
I will leave this ring.

27
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,720
Do it.

28
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,910
Please let everyone go.

29
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,410
Stop whining

30
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,940
and come out.

31
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,960
Will you promise me

32
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,240
that you'll let them go?

33
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,279
I owe you no promises.

34
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,540
The shaman made it clear, didn't he?

35
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,180
I meant to curse only you.

36
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,480
You are the one I have issues with.

37
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,280
They're not with you yet?

38
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,920
I even heard strange noises
coming from the forest.

39
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
Should I go and check?

40
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,960
Hold on.

41
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
It's too risky.

42
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,520
Charn,

43
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,920
is Khem...

44
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,460
still alive?

45
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,480
I can sense that Khem's still alive,

46
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,659
but that doesn't mean he's safe.

47
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,980
We're on our way
to see Jane at Khem's dorm.

48
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,800
Can you have someone pick us up?

49
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,720
It'll still be hours at best,

50
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,880
but I'll have a chopper sent.

51
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,780
Send me your location.

52
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,120
Calm down, Jet.

53
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,360
All we can do right now is...

54
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,290
trust the people there.

55
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,850
And you, Kachen,

56
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,660
please go inside and pray for Khem, too.

57
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,770
Sure.

58
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,480
I'll keep you posted.

59
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,140
Venerable,

60
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,500
I beg you.

61
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,360
Do not interfere.

62
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,700
I'm not here to stop you,

63
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,500
but indulge me
with one question, will you?

64
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,419
I have no time for your riddle.

65
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,820
Answer me.

66
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,700
I wish to know

67
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,590
what you

68
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,300
truly want?

69
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,780
I want only Khem's life.

70
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Are you deaf and blind, Venerable?

71
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,040
I'll ask again.

72
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,680
What do you really want?

73
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,740
Once you take this boy's life,

74
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,960
what will you gain?

75
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,880
Is it merely to settle a grudge?

76
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
That alone

77
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,520
will satisfy me.

78
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,060
Is that really all you want?

79
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,540
It is.

80
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,380
Even if I must descend
into the deepest hell,

81
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,680
I accept it.

82
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,980
In that case,

83
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,190
I must apologize

84
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,720
for taking your time

85
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,900
because this...

86
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,840
isn't the end of it.

87
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,360
What are you saying?

88
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,080
Peem...

89
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,670
Khem!

90
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,880
You've still got power left?

91
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:57,080
(Incanting)

92
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,620
Peem!

93
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,420
Why?

94
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,140
What happened?

95
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,100
That's...

96
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,540
not a weapon made by mortals, is it?

97
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
It is not.

98
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,160
He told me

99
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
Lord of the Mountains gave it to him.

100
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,680
That means...

101
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,490
a mortal body can't endure its power.

102
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,870
And he knows that very well.

103
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,280
He never told me that.

104
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,620
I must admire your last struggle.

105
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,570
You wiped out my servants all at once.

106
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,700
Now it's time for you
to undo your spell.

107
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,330
Let go of me

108
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,840
and give me that boy.

109
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,060
Please give her what she wants.

110
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,980
I'm ready.

111
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,550
Khem,

112
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,040
don't do this.

113
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,970
No, Khem.

114
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,180
Go back!

115
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,880
You will know the pain I've felt,

116
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,210
Krongkwan.

117
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,680
Argh!

118
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,520
Argh...

119
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,670
In my past life,

120
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,600
I let someone die right before my eyes

121
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,190
and did nothing.

122
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,640
I can't let it happen again in this one.

123
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,080
I heard a little thump.

124
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,790
Come out soon, little one.

125
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,920
Ma'am!

126
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,250
Ma'am...

127
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,200
Ma'am!

128
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,760
I saw Auntie Ramphueng...

129
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,440
hurl the boy into the river.

130
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
No.

131
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
That's not true.

132
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,600
No, it's not true.

133
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,240
No...

134
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,880
That's not me.

135
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,360
Not at all.

136
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,840
It has nothing to do with me.

137
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,210
Goodbye...

138
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,720
Peem.

139
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,200
How does it feel...

140
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,440
to watch someone you love die
before your eyes

141
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,910
while you can do nothing?

142
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,830
Focus your mind.

143
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,930
Don't let anger and grief take over you.

144
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,860
Your power
is so much stronger than hers.

145
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,320
Focus, okay?

146
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,560
- You've got this, Master.
- You've got this, Master.

147
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,540
Stay calm, Wat.

148
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,000
Why are you here?

149
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,080
Mom?

150
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:43,910
(Incanting)

151
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,120
Let go of me.

152
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,230
Ramphueng,

153
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,360
you're also a mother.

154
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,760
I'm sure you understand
why I can't let you do that.

155
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,930
Ramphueng!

156
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:21,120
(Incanting)

157
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,580
I will imprison your soul,

158
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,320
so you can never hurt anyone again.

159
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,400
Would you be so kind as to spare her?

160
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,760
Monk Kasem...

161
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,840
Monk Kasem!

162
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,350
Stop, Ramphueng.

163
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,360
He has nothing to do with this.

164
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,280
Then why did he meddle?

165
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,160
I'll take this old man with me.

166
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,200
What, Mom?

167
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,730
Let her, Master.

168
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,360
Why aren't we helping him?

169
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,680
He asked us not to.

170
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,630
No wonder you're a monk.

171
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
Not even a bit shaken, huh?

172
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,110
When it comes to karma,

173
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,480
sometimes you just have to let it happen.

174
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,180
But Ramphueng,

175
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,560
if you use too much of your power,

176
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,140
your soul will shatter.

177
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,970
Don't act like you know everything.

178
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,550
Before you take me,

179
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,100
may I show something...

180
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,130
to you?

181
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,490
After all,

182
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,330
our fates are finally...

183
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,360
intertwined...

184
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,300
once more.

185
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,970
Once more?

186
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,640
What are you talking about?

187
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,510
Quit riddling.

188
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,600
Om...

189
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,600
You old monk,

190
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,270
what did you do to me?

191
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,160
I wish to know

192
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,240
what you

193
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,940
truly want?

194
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,420
I want only Khem's life.

195
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Is that really all you want?

196
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,740
You must suffer like I did...

197
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,980
as I was parted from my son.

198
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,730
My son,

199
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,940
go live your life,

200
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,010
grow strong,

201
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,850
and be free.

202
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,200
I'm sorry

203
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,240
that my fate

204
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,800
has granted you so little.

205
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,980
There, there.

206
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,350
There, there.

207
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,270
Don't cry, sweetie.

208
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,400
Aw, honey.

209
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,080
There, there.

210
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,840
There, there.

211
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,400
I'm right here, honey.

212
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,810
Whatever you're holding on to,

213
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,780
let it go...

214
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,520
Mother.

215
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,870
There, there.

216
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,440
Sweetie,

217
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,920
I'm right here.

218
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,330
Don't cry, okay?

219
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,280
There, there.

220
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Sweetie...

221
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,760
My son...

222
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,520
I'm sorry, Khem.

223
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,970
I'm sorry for everything.

224
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,010
I'll pay for my karma...

225
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,450
and meet him again.

226
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,530
Please forgive me.

227
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,280
I understand that...

228
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,010
you've endured so much pain and loss,

229
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,970
but you also made those around me suffer,

230
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,280
those who had nothing to do
with any of this.

231
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,720
If there is anything you want me to do,

232
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,560
I will do it.

233
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,330
Please don't do this.

234
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,360
The choice is yours, Khem.

235
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,280
If it's your decision,

236
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,800
I'll accept whatever comes.

237
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,720
- We, too, think
- We, too, think

238
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,080
- you should be the one to decide.
- you should be the one to decide.

239
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
Whatever you choose,

240
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,210
we'll respect it, Khem.

241
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,460
I can't forgive you that easily,

242
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,070
but if I were to take revenge,

243
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,600
the karma between us
would bind us forever.

244
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,260
Just accept the punishment you deserve.

245
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,380
I hope that in your next life,

246
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,440
you'll be reunited with your son.

247
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,100
Thank you.

248
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,010
Thank you very much.

249
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,100
The atonement

250
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,280
must be grievous indeed,

251
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,380
but our paths will cross again.

252
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,930
When that day comes,

253
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,140
please...

254
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,800
let me take care of you,

255
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,080
at least once, Mother.

256
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,130
She even made you leave so soon,

257
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,930
but I couldn't just take revenge.

258
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,590
You made the right choice, sweetie.

259
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,610
Revenge...

260
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,560
only breeds more revenge.

261
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,480
You've grown into a great person, Khem.

262
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,040
I'm very proud of you.

263
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,450
It seems you're fine without me.

264
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,770
I nearly couldn't make it, Grandma.

265
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:46,460
Come on,

266
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,160
don't be so dramatic with me.

267
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,970
If you can't live alone,
go live with Khem.

268
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,210
And if you ever mistreat him,

269
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,920
I'll haunt your dreams.

270
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,170
I'm sorry, Grandma Si.

271
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,330
I should be sorry.

272
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,680
My good deeds were brief.

273
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,320
You must've been very shocked.

274
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,600
I'm sorry, Kasem,

275
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,080
I couldn't wait until you came.

276
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,280
Don't join me so soon, okay?

277
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,900
It puts me at ease

278
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,469
to see that death

279
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,699
can't change your sharp tongue.

280
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,080
- Khem...
- Khem...

281
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,120
I didn't expect you'd come.

282
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
Wow...

283
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Is that really how someone says

284
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:47,040
to greet his brother after so long?

285
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,449
Thanks.

286
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,020
And I'm sorry.

287
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,620
I'm sorry that in our past life,
I failed as your brother.

288
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,640
I neglected you,

289
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,010
and it led to this ending.

290
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,690
After paying for your karma,

291
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,430
I hope life treats you well.

292
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,230
Thanks, Wat.

293
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,090
Khem,

294
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,720
please take care of my brother.

295
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:26,910
So,

296
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,800
how has it been up there?

297
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,390
Just okay.

298
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,730
There aren't many toys.

299
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,850
I'd rather be born again.

300
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,480
Please take care of Khem, will you?

301
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,110
He's a good person.

302
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,160
You don't have to act so cold.

303
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,090
Okay, Auntie.

304
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,280
I'm ready, Monk Kasem.

305
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,890
It's finally over.

306
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,740
Happy birthday, Khem.

307
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,000
I told you

308
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,800
we'll be together

309
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,410
this year

310
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,730
and for all the years to come.

311
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,450
Mm.

312
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,330
Thank you.

313
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,470
Remember, Khem...

314
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,970
I choose you.

315
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,730
Okay.

316
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,230
Peem!

317
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,170
Peem...

318
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,530
Are you okay?

319
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:53,920
Peem!

320
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,570
Khem!

321
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,840
- Khem!
- Khem...

322
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,680
- Khem...
- Khem!

323
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,880
Jet, Charn!

324
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,670
Khem!

325
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:47,890
- We made it!
- We made it!

326
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,510
We did it, Khem.

327
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,480
From now on,

328
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,240
we'll stay friends
for the rest of our lives.

329
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Khem...

330
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,860
Miss you!

331
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,120
Pay your respects to Monk Kasem
before he leaves.

332
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,080
I'm about to take him to the station.

333
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,510
I'm truly grateful, Monk Kasem,

334
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,210
that you saved my friend.

335
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,960
It's nothing.

336
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,570
I'm glad I could help,

337
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,480
and we could settle
the matters left unresolved.

338
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,290
I've heard about...

339
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,070
your past life.

340
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,600
I have one question, though.

341
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,720
Ask me.

342
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,450
So,

343
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,120
when did you realize

344
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,120
that Ramphueng was your mother?

345
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,560
And when you did,

346
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,960
did you try to find her?

347
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,440
When you met us,

348
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,200
why didn't you tell us right away?

349
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,680
And in the forest,

350
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,520
why didn't you just tell her the truth?

351
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,870
Why couldn't Khem
keep the yantra wrapped all the time?

352
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,480
And why wouldn't you let Master stay
in the sacred ring, too?

353
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,960
Why did you wait until Master got hurt

354
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,240
and even put yourself in danger?

355
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,750
You said you had one question.

356
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,350
Well, yeah...

357
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,910
It's okay.

358
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,810
Some things...

359
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,210
had to be allowed to happen,

360
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,880
so the karma we were bound by

361
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,820
could be settled easily.

362
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,160
Had to be allowed to happen?

363
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,520
Do you mean...

364
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,440
Paran...

365
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,120
had to lose his power.

366
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,070
Only then would you sacrifice yourself

367
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,540
as you couldn't lose the one you love.

368
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,480
At that moment, those you loved

369
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,560
would come to help.

370
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,060
And only then...

371
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,160
Ramphueng

372
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,100
would target me.

373
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,320
So she'd been haunting me

374
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,060
not only to avenge herself

375
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,520
but also her son.

376
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,950
What she truly wanted

377
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:02,270
was to see her son once again.

378
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,520
So,

379
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,280
she had to almost kill me

380
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,540
to find out the truth.

381
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,280
She had to realize

382
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,960
she almost lost her own son again
by her own hands

383
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,780
before she could let everything go.

384
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,550
I get it now.

385
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,180
If she had known earlier,

386
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,580
she'd think we were tricking her.

387
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,880
And it might've caused more losses.

388
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,680
But...

389
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,200
you mentioned
Master had to lose his power...

390
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,160
Just temporary.

391
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,800
He'll regain it soon enough.

392
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,320
Khem,

393
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,280
don't worry.

394
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,610
I'm sure that...

395
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,990
he meant to do this from the start.

396
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,080
Remember, Khem...

397
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,640
I choose you.

398
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,200
Peem...

399
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,080
I choose you, too.

400
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,260
Now,

401
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,620
wake up soon, okay?

402
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:53,630
Mm.

403
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,190
Peem?

404
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,280
Peem...

405
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,750
He told you everything, didn't he?

406
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,320
Peem,

407
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,710
from now on,

408
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,990
I'll take care of you.

409
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:37,100
I'll bring you food

410
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,230
and water,

411
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,100
get a job,

412
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,560
earn money,

413
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,920
and support you, Peem.

414
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,840
I just lost my power,

415
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,320
not my ability to move.

416
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,070
I just want to repay you.

417
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,150
You've done so much for me.

418
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,960
Just having you here, Khem,

419
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,520
is the greatest thing
I could ever ask for.

420
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,880
For the rest of this new life of yours,

421
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:40,650
I want to always be part of it.

422
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,830
I thought he said he was rich.

423
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,640
Why isn't he staying at a nice hotel?

424
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,870
He could get a ride anytime.

425
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,270
That's just how he is.

426
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,520
He always does whatever he wants.

427
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:41,670
Hey,

428
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,070
I've already...

429
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,260
ignored it several times.

430
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,180
So, what's going on

431
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,320
between you and Kachen?

432
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:54,530
Well,

433
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,180
nothing's going on.

434
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:01,390
Come on, tell me.

435
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,190
What's wrong?

436
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,420
So,

437
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,620
don't get mad at me,

438
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,860
but he said something like...

439
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,000
he was your first.

440
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,370
What's so funny about that?

441
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,030
You literally said I was your first.

442
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:32,880
And now...

443
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,950
you expect me to not be offended?

444
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,120
He was the first
to let me ride in a sports car,

445
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,500
take me out,

446
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,590
take me drinking,
and act wild with me at concerts.

447
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,760
That's why Jane doesn't like him.

448
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,040
What's this?

449
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,280
"CLUB NEPTUNE..."

450
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,800
It's the massage parlor

451
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:22,640
he signed me up for as a member.

452
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:23,490
Huh?

453
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:26,310
He gave it to me on my 18th birthday.

454
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,050
He wanted me to go so badly,

455
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,460
but I've never been there.

456
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,040
I told him I had, though.

457
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,530
That's why he's so proud

458
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,200
and claimed
he made me lose my virginity.

459
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:41,670
I see.

460
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:46,270
Actually, I wasn't thinking much
about it.

461
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,320
You're the one...

462
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,670
who took my first time.

463
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,950
You took my first time

464
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,440
and my heart.

465
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:09,280
Night-night, my first one.

466
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,240
Wait...

467
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,730
How am I supposed to sleep now?
Don't sleep yet.

468
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,120
Wake up.

469
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,120
How can I sleep now?

470
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,230
Jet, wake up!

471
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:47,810
Oh,

472
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:49,390
you're up so early.

473
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,630
Should I serve you breakfast?

474
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:52,640
Where's everyone?

475
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,480
Oh,

476
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,070
Jet and Charn had their breakfast

477
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,760
and already rode off on the bike.

478
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,200
Master hasn't come downstairs yet.

479
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,850
Did you know...

480
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,190
before you came back last night,

481
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:08,470
Jet and Charn...

482
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,000
Wait,

483
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,720
did Monk Kasem forget something?

484
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:24,250
Oh...

485
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,000
Why didn't you wake me up, too?

486
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,290
Master...

487
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,920
What did I tell you?

488
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:39,100
Call me Peem when we're by ourselves.

489
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:40,870
Well,

490
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,070
we're not by ourselves right now.

491
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,110
This is...

492
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,030
Monk Pinyo,

493
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:58,950
my father.

494
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,280
Good morning,

495
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:10,510
Monk Pinyo.

496
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,430
Your suffering has come to an end.

497
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,240
May your life
finally be filled with joy.

498
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,900
Thank you, Father.

499
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,160
Father,

500
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,350
now that everything's over,

501
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,680
will you leave the monkhood?

502
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:41,970
I mean...

503
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,810
I just want you to live...

504
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,320
your own life.

505
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,730
I am content with my life.

506
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,120
Master,

507
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,680
I sincerely thank you

508
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,420
for going through all the trouble
to help my son.

509
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,270
Please don't mention it.

510
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,230
It's no trouble.

511
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:06,880
I'm more than willing.

512
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,450
Anyway, don't rush things.

513
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,640
Khem still hasn't completed his studies.

514
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:17,190
Father!

515
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,970
I'm not against it.

516
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,150
I just feel that now that Khem...

517
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,720
has his freedom,

518
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:27,280
I want him to enjoy life fully for now.

519
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,670
There's no need
to rush into settling down.

520
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,510
Settling down?

521
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,180
Come on, Father.

522
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,320
I...

523
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,750
I haven't really thought that far ahead.

524
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,400
I'm just saying what a father would.

525
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,160
After all, it's your choice.

526
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,350
If you stay strong, Khem,

527
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,920
I entrust you, Master,
to take care of my son.

528
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:56,790
I promise

529
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:00,680
to take the very best care of your son.

530
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,000
Come on,

531
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,880
what are you talking about?

532
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,450
Khem!

533
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,010
Oh,

534
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,540
Uncle Chai?

535
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,990
Is everything okay?

536
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,520
Uncle Chai?

537
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:23,890
Oh,

538
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:25,830
you don't see him?

539
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,580
Khem,

540
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:30,410
let Master know

541
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,290
I'm waiting downstairs.

542
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:33,790
Okay.

543
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,180
He can leave his body now, can't he?

544
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:46,270
Since when could you do it?

545
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,830
Not so long ago.

546
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:51,470
Master,

547
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:53,940
we all know...

548
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,070
what happened to you.

549
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:00,640
Oh,

550
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,320
Charn said all your disciples

551
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:04,060
have the right to know.

552
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:04,710
Hey,

553
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,590
you agreed with me, didn't you?

554
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,590
Don't just blame me.

555
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,000
I'm not blaming you.

556
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,830
They'll all find out sooner or later.

557
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,110
So, Master,

558
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,750
you saw it just now

559
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:17,940
that I can leave my body.

560
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:20,120
So from now on,

561
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,750
please let me handle...

562
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,330
the villagers' troubles.

563
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,010
Okay.

564
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,280
Master...

565
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:38,640
Right,

566
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,680
Mek and Lah

567
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,000
often go into the forest,

568
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,640
so the nymphs favor them

569
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,670
and have granted them sacred wood.

570
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,980
If anything bad happens
in the forest again,

571
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,830
we'll take care of it.

572
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,230
Right.

573
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:52,710
You don't need to worry, Master.

574
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:54,770
Master,

575
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,950
I'll take a part-time job

576
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,910
as an invocation performer.

577
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,440
Don't worry.

578
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,000
Mother Si left me this.

579
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,640
Master,

580
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,280
from now on,

581
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,470
just...

582
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:11,960
keep training.

583
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,830
If you can't master it in five years,

584
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,570
take ten, twenty,
or as long as it takes.

585
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:18,150
Just don't worry about us anymore.

586
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,480
So there'll be nothing left
for me to do, will there?

587
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:22,670
Come on!

588
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,640
That's not it, Master.

589
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,640
You're still our master

590
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,940
who will be here to guide us,

591
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:30,950
right?

592
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,150
- Yeah.
- Right.

593
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:32,990
Yes.

594
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:33,990
No matter what,

595
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:37,600
we still love and respect you,

596
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:38,660
right?

597
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,230
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

598
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,050
Right.

599
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,850
Come on now.

600
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:43,110
- Come.
- Let's give our blessings to him.

601
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:45,580
Alright,

602
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,220
may you stay healthy

603
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:48,870
and take good care of yourself.

604
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,560
- Sadhu.
- Sadhu.

605
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,690
He's such a kind person,
loved by so many.

606
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,160
- Knowing that he loves and protects you
- Now give him what you brought.

607
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,830
- eases my heart.
- Come on.

608
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,020
Some fruits...

609
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,750
Brought so many, huh?

610
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,460
Come on,

611
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,990
do you even know what you said?

612
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,530
It's making me blush.

613
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,530
I'm truly happy

614
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:19,380
that you've finally
found the silver lining.

615
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,650
Alright, let's join hands
and cheer Master up.

616
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:24,930
Gosh,

617
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,480
now that we're actually leaving,

618
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,570
I can't help but feel a little sad.

619
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:32,270
Anyway,

620
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,550
does Master happen to have

621
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,580
any charms
that could help me catch up in class?

622
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,150
Kachen told me

623
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,070
Thong and Ake
even came to save Khem.

624
00:58:58,610 --> 00:58:59,720
So that means...

625
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,280
they're in a better place now, right?

626
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:04,990
Yeah.

627
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:06,960
That's such a relief.

628
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,490
Jet,

629
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,780
for the rest of my life,

630
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:23,120
I'll always be right beside you.

631
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,350
What's with you?

632
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:27,050
Getting cheesy all of a sudden?

633
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:29,190
Well,

634
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,960
I just wanted you to know that

635
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,190
no matter what happens,

636
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:36,390
you'll always have me.

637
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,190
The moment you let yourself
go down that bridge with me,

638
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,110
I already knew

639
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:56,550
you weren't going anywhere.

640
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:01,150
If you tell me to go down,

641
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,280
I'll make sure I go down a storm.

642
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,880
If you tell me to dive,

643
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:11,170
I promise I won't go off the deep end.

644
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:12,390
What's this, huh?

645
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:14,280
You're cracking jokes now?

646
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:16,230
Well, it was getting too cheesy,

647
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,300
so I had to balance it out,

648
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,760
right, babe?

649
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:22,470
Hm?

650
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:23,960
Babe?

651
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:27,920
Well,

652
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,150
you said when things are settled,

653
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,880
we can continue where we left off,
didn't you?

654
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,200
But you've never made it clear

655
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,870
if we're officially dating or not.

656
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,180
Babe!

657
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,000
Clear enough?

658
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:54,530
Nope.

659
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:57,330
That wasn't clear.

660
01:00:58,110 --> 01:00:59,910
Can you say it...

661
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:05,370
♫The one who makes my dreams come true,♫

662
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:09,080
♫The one in my heart, baby, it's you♫

663
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,930
♫It's you I've been longing for,♫

664
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:18,200
♫The one I've always adored♫

665
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,440
♫Right by my side, it's truly you♫

666
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,240
♫Clearly, my heart beats just for you♫

667
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,070
♫It's you I want, nothing more♫

668
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:36,430
♫From now on, you'll be my all♫

669
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,200
How is your father?

670
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,960
He's staying
at the temple in the village.

671
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,800
He should be heading back soon.

672
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,560
Is something the matter?

673
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,640
So...

674
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,320
I haven't started my training yet.

675
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,960
Whatever I couldn't do
back when I was a shaman,

676
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,440
I can do it now.

677
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,960
Wanna stay in my room tonight?

678
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,160
Why do you keep looking into my eyes?

679
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,320
You have beautiful eyes.

680
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,200
Oh...

681
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,120
Sorry.

682
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,440
It's okay.

683
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,720
Wanna look into them closer?

684
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,360
Open your eyes.

685
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,600
You wanted to take a closer look,
didn't you?

686
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,400
Do you really want to do this,

687
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,440
or are you just trying to please me?

688
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,680
I really want it.

689
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,080
Then we'll go all the way
this time, okay?

690
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,470
We're taking our leave, Master.

691
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,380
Anytime,

692
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:44,700
you're always welcome here, Khem.

693
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,280
Okay, Peem.

694
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:48,720
Not just that.

695
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:53,820
Call me...

696
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,330
the way you did last night.

697
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,680
This name...

698
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,880
was the one my mom wanted to give me,

699
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,700
but it got turned down.

700
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,320
Only she ever called me that.

701
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,200
After she passed,

702
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,640
no one's called me by it again.

703
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,520
From now on,

704
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:32,340
I'll be your...

705
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,120

will you?

736
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,920
Does it poke your eye?

737
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:27,730
Do I need to get closer?

738
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,000
Looking good.

739
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,900
Here I am.

740
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:37,670
Did you get started already?

741
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,040
Not yet.

742
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,150
We were waiting for everyone.

743
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:42,560
Anyway,

744
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:44,800
why did you finish
your grooming so fast?

745
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:46,480
No, no.

746
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,050
We're not grooms. We're just boyfriends.

747
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,800

01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:54,870

752
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,720
I know you didn't get to tell Khemmika

753
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,200
in your past life,

754
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:18,510
but in this one,

755
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:20,560
you don't have to tell me
every chance you get, you know.

756
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,060
That should be enough.

757
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:36,720
It's perfect.

758
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:37,840
- Let me see.
- Okay.

759
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,320
Wow,

760
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,950
my face is literally glowing.

761
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,280
That's how
tone-up sunscreens work, right?

762
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:46,630
Alright, let's get some photos

763
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,840
so I can go to my Peem soon...

764
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:49,480
Wait...

765
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:50,840
I meant Master.

766
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,480
You won't get to go soon.

767
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,520
Whoa,

768
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,400
looks like he was in such a hurry.

769
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,280
My face must be worn out by now,

770
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:30,870
my Peem.

771
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,030
Wow, that's so beautiful.

772
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:41,430
You're right.

773
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,680
I'm back.

774
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,200
Was it a long wait?

775
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:51,730
I have waited longer than this before.

776
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,120
Welcome back to Ubon Ratchathani, Khem.

777
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,240
Yeah.

778
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:13,470
Let me take that.

779
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:30,940
Alright, let's do it.

780
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:32,010
Come on.

781
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:03,750
Let's go

782
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,120
to the Bun Bang Fai Festival.

783
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,090
Okay.

784
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:07,930
Let's go.

785
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,210
Okay.

786
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,180
Let's go!

787
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,800
- The Bun Bang Fai Festival!
- Come on.

788
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:17,940
Hurry.

789
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,680
Don't forget the tripod.

790
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:05,640
Dad...

791
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:10,480
What?

792
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:12,840
This is my darling.

793
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,910
Hello, Dad.

794
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,400
I'm Charnvit Charoenkiatpreecha.

795
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:25,320
So,

796
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:27,240
I'm gay.

797
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,160
Jet's also gay.

798
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,480
We're crazy in love.

799
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:35,400
I promise

800
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,320
I'll take the best care

801
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,120
of your son.

802
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:53,980
Bear with him, okay?

803
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:55,120
He's a handful.

804
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,920
Come on, Dad!

805
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,400
Enjoy yourselves.

806
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,840
Go ahead. Enjoy.

807
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,520
Why did you need to say your full name,

808
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:11,300
huh?

809
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:13,130
Trying to flaunt your last name?

810
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,240
Well, I just changed it.

811
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:16,680
How about...

812
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,240
changing yours to mine, too?

813
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,170
Let's get some ice cream.

814
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:43,560
Having fun, huh?

815
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:48,610
Seems like
we can't get away from each other.

816
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:49,590
Obviously.

817
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Thanks for saving my brother, though.

818
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,600
Consider helping me
next time, too, alright?

819
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:03,960
That ghost smacked me into a closet,

820
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,160
and I woke up all alone

821
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,390
with no lover around.

822
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,040
Sorry.

823
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,400
I did call the ambulance, though.

824
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,840
Thanks.

825
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:17,220
Anyway, it's better

826
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,360
that he got away from you
and met a good guy like Charn.

827
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:23,880
Are you Jane,

828
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,240
Jet's sister?

829
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,050
Yes.

830
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:28,930
Here.

831
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:31,300
You're invited to Prim's wedding.

832
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:32,520
Oh...

833
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:35,770
She's sent her apologies
for not inviting you herself.

834
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:37,410
She has some matters to attend to.

835
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:41,160
Thank you. I'll make sure to come.

836
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,600
- See you.
- See you.

837
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,280
Prim's getting married?

838
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:50,680
Yeah.

839
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,160
Here's yours.

840
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,120
Sorry?

841
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,040
You're invited to her wedding.

842
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,650
You can either come as a guest

843
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:01,320
or help out with the preparations.

844
01:27:03,430 --> 01:27:05,490
You're trying to use me, huh?

845
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:07,330
Sure,

846
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:09,000
I'll definitely come.

847
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:12,840
Right, so...

848
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,530
Prim mentioned...

849
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,520
you're joining her faculty
as a professor?

850
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,260
Are you serious?

851
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:22,920
Someone like you...

852
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,080
can easily be one in Bangkok.

853
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:26,630
I'm serious.

854
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,840
I don't plan on leaving here.

855
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:31,950
Was my accent alright?

856
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,240
It was close.

857
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,820
You sounded almost like a native.

858
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:35,750
So...

859
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,040
how are things with Master?

860
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,240
Are you still together?

861
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,320
Are we, Khem?

862
01:27:53,070 --> 01:27:55,710
Prim said you've been making a move
on a physical therapist.

863
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,250
Pong!

864
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,080
So you're both taken, huh?

865
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:03,780
So,

866
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:06,590
allow me
to show my boyfriend the rocket.

867
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,320
Sure.

868
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:09,830
Take good care of yourselves.

869
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:12,780
Okay.

870
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,850
We're about to fire the rocket!

871
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,840
Alright, that's enough. Listen up.

872
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,330
First of all,

873
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,650
let's make a prayer.

874
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:25,420
Dear Phaya Thaen and the deities,

875
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,180
may this year bring abundant rain,

876
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:30,260
- and may everything be prosperous
- It's so nice

877
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:32,500
- so we can finally live in happiness.
- that we're all here.

878
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:36,240
- Please! Sadhu.
- Sadhu!

879
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,300
Isn't it wonderful?

880
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:40,450
We've grown up,

881
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,640
but our love remains the same.

882
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:45,700
So...

883
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,540
how's everything?

884
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,240
Have you been training a lot?

885
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:54,120
Is your power back to how it used to be?

886
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:55,120
Hey,

887
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:56,960
fire the rocket now!

888
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,590
Do it.

889
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:17,360
Off it goes! Wow, that's so high.

890
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,160
It's really high!

891
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,630
Wow, that's high!

892
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,530
Wow, that's incredible.

893
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,730
May this year bring rain everywhere!

894
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:18,760
(Casting a spell)

895
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:44,640
My Peem,

896
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,480
what are you doing?

897
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,080
Nothing.

898
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:53,120
Wait...

899
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,400
Are you wearing perfume today?

900
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,880
Trying something new, you know.

901
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,720
Come on, let's go.

902
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:07,860
Alright.

903
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:13,310
Charn, Jet!

904
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:15,180
- Let's go.
- Alright.

905
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:19,010
Took so many pics, didn't you?

906
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,200
The weather is amazing.

907
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:15,440
What an incredible view.

908
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:45,800
[January 21, 2028, 12th waning day
of the 2nd lunar month, Year of the Goat]

909
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,390
What is it?

910
01:34:58,440 --> 01:34:59,810
Our wedding date.

911
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,980
Your father suggested
we hold the wedding

912
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:17,200
and register a marriage on the same day.

913
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,280
I once told you

914
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:45,160
I'd do everything to keep you safe.

915
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:55,940
For the rest of your life,

916
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,120
I want you to spend it with me.

917
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:11,490
Will you marry me, Khem?

918
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:24,380
I do.

919
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:31,240
You've always protected
and taken care of me.

920
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:34,900
From now on,

921
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:38,920
let me take care of you, too.

01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:50,980
♫Perhaps fate has bound our souls,♫

923
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:56,000

when should it happen?

934
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:53,800
Well...

935
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:57,440
let's just be Khem's groomsmen for now,

936
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:00,090

01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:20,640
can I be here and help you cook?

987
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,360
Come on, Dad. It smells amazing!

988
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,020
We'll eat it all
if you're not coming soon.

989
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:33,280
I'm coming.

990
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,880
You're gonna eat everything, huh,

992
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:38,040
Today,

993
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,960
I even helped Daddy cook!

994
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,250
I made this.

995
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:43,650
Wow,

996
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,680

998
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:01,920
This is amazing, honey.

01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:05,440
Whoa,

1000
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:06,760
Singha,

1001
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:10,140
did you put in
half of this ThyChef sachet?

1002
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,760
'Cause you said
it'd make the food super tasty!

1003
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,000
It's gonna be spicy.

1004
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:23,200
"Ten times spicy."

1005
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:25,960
Is "ten times" a lot?

1006
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,960
Is it too spicy, Dad?

1007
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:28,960
Not at all.

1008
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:30,220
It's incredible

1009
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,680
and perfectly spicy.

1010
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,960
I'll make sure to eat all of this.

1011

Next time, I'll cook for you, too.

1012
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,480

1013
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:42,260
Whoa,

1014
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:44,640
that really makes me happy.

1015
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:46,060

1016
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:48,100

1017

1018
01:42:51,150 --> 01:42:52,960

1021

Our son made this for me.

1022
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,200
Can I get some water, though?

1023
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,450
Oh...

1024
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,180
It's kinda funny, actually.

1025
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,340
I guess I'm facing my karma.

1026
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:47,680
I used to spank Thong and Ake a lot,

1027
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,770
and now I'm paying for it.

1028
01:43:54,940 --> 01:43:56,320

1029
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:01,560
