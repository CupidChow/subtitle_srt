2
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:41,140
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,140
=Episode 28=

4
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,760
Su?

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,480
You want to enter Tianguang Market?

6
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,640
I want to ask you

7
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,120
how you got in back then?

8
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,199
(I had failed)

9
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,759
(the China Academy of Art exam)

10
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,960
(three times.)

11
00:02:12,822 --> 00:02:14,630
(I was drinking by the river.)

12
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,120
(I passed out without realizing it.)

13
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,639
(When I woke up,
I was in the Tianguang Market.)

14
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,159
It was right here.

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,711
So this river has to be one
of the gateways into the market.

16
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:30,844
Keep this for me.

17
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,479
Su.

18
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,439
Su!

19
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,039
I'm still here.

20
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,800
Are you sure it was this river?

21
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,919
Yes.

22
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,080
But it wasn't in the water.
It was on the bank.

23
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,599
Why didn't you say so?

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,240
Come up. We'll figure it out together.

25
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,680
Dry yourself off.

26
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,120
Don't catch a cold.

27
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,599
Lan told me that she wandered

28
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,919
into Tianguang Market

29
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,479
after getting lost in the hills.

30
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,319
So there must be more than one entrance.

31
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,879
Don't lose hope yet.

32
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,240
I'm not giving up.

33
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,560
I just don't have

34
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,759
any other ideas right now.

35
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,400
If I told anyone else this,

36
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,199
they'd think I was crazy.

37
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,199
A lot of answers

38
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,960
are already there.

39
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,439
It's just not the time
to uncover them yet.

40
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,439
We'll find a way.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,159
Thanks, Lu Feng.

42
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,240
You can do this.

43
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,439
Just like I did

44
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,919
when I believed I'd see Lan again.

45
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,759
I hope you're not upset

46
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,000
that I called you back.

47
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,240
Hall Master.

48
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,879
Did something happen?

49
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,560
The Time Administration has
been following us.

50
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,720
The 25th-century vault

51
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,879
is off limits for now.

52
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,720
I assume you know why.

53
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,759
Someone betrayed Fusheng Hall.

54
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,720
One of our own.

55
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,360
You already know who it is, don't you?

56
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,000
Bring her in.

57
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,959
Miss Ye,

58
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:00,430
this is all a misunderstanding.

59
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,300
Please, you have to...

60
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,639
You leaked the coordinates
of our vault to an outsider.

61
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:06,879
Didn't you?

62
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
I didn't.

63
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,480
No.

64
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:20,830
I didn't know he was
with the Time Administration.

65
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,079
I had no idea...

66
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,920
Take her away.

67
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,519
You're much more decisive

68
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,959
than you were five years ago.

69
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,279
I apologize.

70
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,519
This was my oversight.

71
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,839
Liangyin,

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,389
you joined Fusheng Hall eight years ago

73
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,000
and have already become a supervisor.

74
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,519
Do you know why I trust you so much?

75
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,560
You're meticulous and level-headed

76
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,240
in how you handle things.

77
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,920
Above all,

78
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,439
you're obsessed with these artifacts
in a way few others are.

79
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,000
I hope you keep pushing forward.

80
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,360
And don't forget the lessons
you learned.

81
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,680
(Eight Years Ago)

82
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
Thank you.

83
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,600
(Shiyi, Head of the Fusheng Hall
Operations Unit)

84
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,279
Miss Ye.

85
00:06:59,066 --> 00:06:59,870
Please have a seat.

86
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,839
Thank you.

87
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:06,222
We've reviewed your resume.

88
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:07,822
We're pleased with what we've seen.

89
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:10,533
The Hall Master can't appear in person,

90
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,377
but he strongly wants you
to join in Fusheng Hall.

91
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,600
Do you really

92
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,839
have those artifacts?

93
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:23,630
Far more than that.

94
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,839
But

95
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,360
these are all holograms.

96
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,240
Where are the real artifacts?

97
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,600
What you see is only part of it.

98
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,000
The physical artifacts are stored
in Fusheng Hall's vaults.

99
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,319
Those vaults

100
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,600
are scattered
across different timelines.

101
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,800
To keep them hidden,

102
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,600
each artifact has
its own set of coordinates.

103
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,040
But responsibilities within Fusheng Hall
are strictly divided.

104
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,759
Those coordinates are classified.

105
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,680
Even I'm not made privy

106
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,800
to them.

107
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,980
(Two-eared Bronze Cauldron)

108
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,519
A fleeting life

109
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,319
can be eternal.

110
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,199
These artifacts deserve more
than being lost to history.

111
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,959
They deserve to be given
a rightful place.

112
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,199
I trust

113
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,000
a professional researcher like you

114
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,279
will one day

115
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,240
realize your ideals.

116
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,620
(Four Years Later)

117
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,320
Ye Liangyin,

118
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,879
you're now
Head of the Planning Division.

119
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,960
You'll oversee task planning

120
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,510
and the time-space vaults going forward.

121
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,600
You carry great responsibilities.

122
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,080
You've done well these past few years,

123
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,440
but I must remind you

124
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,679
that not interfering with history
is the foundation of Fusheng Hall.

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,720
Understood.

126
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,399
This mission is dangerous.

127
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,879
Be careful.

128
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,919
Put it into the vault.

129
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,000
All right.

130
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,820
(Huayang City)

131
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,559
Operatives don't
have the clearance to...

132
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,279
It's fine.

133
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,960
Do you trust me?

134
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,155
(Zi of Fusheng Hall Planning Division)
Yes.

135
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,360
Then you can trust him, too.

136
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,500
(Year 3085-2005)

137
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,780
(Huayang City)

138
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,000
Hall Master.

139
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,759
How's the search going?

140
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,720
We've recovered the Jinyang Square Zun

141
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,960
from Huayang vault.

142
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:57,250
We've also located the coordinates
for the Bronze Bells of Shang and Zhou.

143
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,120
I'll handle the Dushan Jade myself.

144
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,244
I've informed them

145
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:02,960
that we'll no longer be utilizing
the Huayang vault in 2005.

146
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,555
They'll clean it up as soon as possible.

147
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,360
Have you figured out who did it?

148
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,030
We're still investigating.

149
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,399
Don't bother.

150
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,279
It was one of our own.

151
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,240
Your weapon

152
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,519
won't work in the 21st century.

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,039
There's a gun in the glove compartment.

154
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,360
I trust

155
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,639
you'll make the right choice.

156
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,080
(Is it him?)

157
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,639
(Did he really do it?)

158
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,600
Liangyin.

159
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,519
It really was you.

160
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,200
Why?

161
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,320
Why?

162
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,559
All these years,

163
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,080
every mission I've done

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,759
has risked my life.

165
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:23,222
And what did Fusheng Hall give me?

166
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,120
That little bit of money.

167
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,360
It's not worth dying for.

168
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,600
I sold

169
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,320
the Dushan Jade here

170
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,720
and made a fortune.

171
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,399
And I took it back myself.

172
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,799
In 2028,

173
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,399
I have buyers

174
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,399
willing to pay

175
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,320
even more for it.

176
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,679
You'd do anything for money?

177
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Do you realize this will draw
the Time Administration's attention?

178
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,480
Fusheng Hall will be exposed.

179
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,279
As if Fusheng Hall is any better.

180
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,320
You exploited my trust

181
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,799
and stole the coordinates
of the 2005 vault.

182
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,399
You're out of this,

183
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,840
but have you thought about
what Hall Master will do to me?

184
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,279
Liangyin,

185
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:20,879
listen to me.

186
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,679
Come with me.

187
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,120
The two of us

188
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
can leave Fusheng Hall together.

189
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:29,155
I've sold most of the other goods I took

190
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:29,750
from the vault.

191
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,911
No matter which era we go to,

192
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,030
we'll survive just fine.

193
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,159
We'll be happy.

194
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:33,960
Trust me.

195
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,200
It's too late.

196
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,519
Hall Master already knows.

197
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,759
I don't care whether he knows

198
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,960
or not.

199
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,000
I just want to know

200
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,559
what you think.

201
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,320
I want you to come back with me.

202
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,559
Shiyi.

203
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,919
Return the items,

204
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,279
and I'll speak on your behalf.

205
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,240
I can make up for the rest, too.

206
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,240
If we run together,

207
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,639
we won't get away.

208
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,759
You listen to me!

209
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,000
I've gone this far!

210
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,440
I never planned on going back!

211
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,759
Do you understand?

212
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,559
Do it.

213
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,879
You should leave.

214
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,240
I can't give up my dreams.

215
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,240
If this is what you want,

216
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,799
I'll do as you ask.

217
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,360
Miss Ye.

218
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,879
It's been taken care of.

219
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Is there anything else?

220
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,400
We haven't been able to crack

221
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:26,890
the garbled coordinates for Yashe yet.

222
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,960
It seems to be a place

223
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:29,910
with no readable coordinates at all.

224
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,919
That makes sense.

225
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:37,600
That place never had coordinates

226
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,679
to begin with.

227
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,919
How did I not realize it before?

228
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,440
Where is it?

229
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,240
Have you heard

230
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,600
of a time rift?

231
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,160
Chu Qiu.

232
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,039
Chu Qiu!

233
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,119
Market Lord.

234
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,720
Mr. Chu still hasn't returned.

235
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,799
He meant it

236
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,200
when he said he was leaving.

237
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,680
Market Lord.

238
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,599
You're awake.

239
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,319
How are your injuries?

240
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,960
Much better now.

241
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,880
Leave us.

242
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,400
Yes.

243
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:41,830
I'm sorry about this, Market Lord.

244
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:43,920
Spare me the courtesies.

245
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,519
We're friends. You've been good to me.

246
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,920
I couldn't just watch you die.

247
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,790
I shouldn't have come back
to the Tianguang Market.

248
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,640
Alas,

249
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,839
I had nowhere left to turn.

250
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,200
What happened?

251
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,559
Who did this to you?

252
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:01,510
After the Treasure Trove artifacts

253
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,680
were placed in the Tianguang Market,

254
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,480
I thought everything was finally over.

255
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,440
Turns out it wasn't.

256
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,880
What do you mean?

257
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,640
If the past didn't happen

258
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,079
the way we thought,

259
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,920
and if someone's death in the past

260
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,880
was caused by some interference
from the future,

261
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,920
then shouldn't that past be corrected?

262
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,480
Did you discover something?

263
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,119
I'm not sure.

264
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,711
Do the Commissioners
of the Time Administration

265
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,240
have an alarm device

266
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,880
that works in any timeline?

267
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:48,160
Some kind of emergency device

268
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,680
that summons reinforcements?

269
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
That's right.

270
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:53,720
But I don't have one.

271
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,822
Chu Qiu should, though.

272
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,680
That said,

273
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,160
the Tianguang Market is a time rift.

274
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Those devices don't work here.

275
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,000
I understand.

276
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,759
There are other ways to alert
the Time Administration.

277
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,359
If you need it, I can help you.

278
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,759
The time isn't right yet.

279
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,319
When it is,

280
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,599
I'll let them know.

281
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,440
What I have isn't

282
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,559
sufficient proof yet.

283
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,160
And once

284
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,640
they intervene,

285
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,079
some truths

286
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,599
will be buried forever.

287
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,240
But that truth matters

288
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,319
to me.

289
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,680
Is this about your friend?

290
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,100
Yes.

291
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,839
Please keep this a secret for me.

292
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,400
This time,

293
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:47,510
I want to investigate
without any ties holding me back.

294
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,400
I don't want
to drag anyone else into this.

295
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,680
Especially not you.

296
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,119
They have weapons

297
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,880
and a time elevator.

298
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,920
They could charge in at any moment.

299
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,839
They won't find this place.

300
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,000
Stay here and recover before you leave.

301
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
That silver chain

302
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,200
looks beautiful on you.

303
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,359
Every time I give you a gift,
you light up with joy.

304
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,880
But I've always sensed

305
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,319
you don't plan to stay here.

306
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,559
If one day

307
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,839
you decide to leave,

308
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,119
I'd give my life to help you.

309
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,599
I could leave anytime

310
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,440
I wanted.

311
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,720
But there's a reason I mustn't.

312
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:47,400
We're here.

313
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:50,559
Come in.

314
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:04,839
What do you think?

315
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,880
I never imagined Luoxia Manor

316
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,480
had a place like this.

317
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,000
Luoxia Manor was Chu Qiu's work.

318
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:14,240
This is the only part

319
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,400
I built myself.

320
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,119
Don't tell Chu Qiu about it.

321
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,799
He doesn't know this place.

322
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,480
All right.

323
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:23,920
Look.

324
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,440
These are gifts

325
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,279
from my parents.

326
00:21:31,488 --> 00:21:33,350
This longevity lock
was a gift from them, too.

327
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,799
I never thought

328
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,920
I'd actually live this long.

329
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,200
Your mother

330
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,119
gave you this lock?

331
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,839
You're not from the future?

332
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,640
You're from the past.

333
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,559
How did you end up
at the Tianguang Market?

334
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,759
My home was deep in the mountains,

335
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,790
in a place known as the Miao Village.

336
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,759
My father was a woodworker.

337
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,519
My mother was an apothecary.

338
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,380
(Miao Village)

339
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,279
Miao Tong, you're back.

340
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:13,920
Yes.

341
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,359
Miao Tong.

342
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:16,400
Sir. Ma'am.

343
00:22:16,555 --> 00:22:18,270
Looks like you picked
a lot of mushrooms.

344
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,559
I did. There are plenty more down
by the foothills.

345
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,519
You should go pick some.

346
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:21,920
All right.

347
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,359
Oh, please pass our thanks
to your mother.

348
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,319
Our child's doing much better.

349
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,160
I will.

350
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,839
You're welcome.

351
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,119
This is

352
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,359
vital purging croton.

353
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,519
And this is

354
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,799
purging croton.

355
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,400
They're great for injuries and sprains.

356
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,119
This is

357
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,240
a false morel.

358
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,200
It's toxic.

359
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,319
You mustn't consume it.

360
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,640
Clan Elder.

361
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,839
This looks a lot like false morel.

362
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
But true morels are delicious.

363
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,200
Miao Tong.

364
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,079
Where's your mother?

365
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:57,960
Is she back yet?

366
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,240
I don't know.

367
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,720
She might already be home.

368
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,920
I'll go check.

369
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,720
Miao Tong, things haven't been peaceful

370
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,019
in the mountains at night lately.

371
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,200
Tell your mother to make sure
she's back before sunset.

372
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:11,559
I will.

373
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,799
And this is...

374
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,759
Father.

375
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,400
When will the swing be ready?

376
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:22,799
Soon.

377
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,559
I'll have it ready before dark.

378
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,720
Has my mother not returned yet?

379
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,839
Madam Ru's child fell ill.

380
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,440
Your mother's treating the patient.

381
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:38,799
Tong.

382
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,799
Mother.

383
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,039
You're finally home!

384
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:42,759
Welcome back.

385
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:43,830
You must be tired.

386
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,440
I'll take that.

387
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,160
I'm fine.

388
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,279
I'll make us dinner.

389
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,039
All right.

390
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:49,960
Have a seat, Mother.

391
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,200
That's a lot of mushrooms.

392
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,880
Yes.

393
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:54,599
Mother.

394
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,960
The Clan Elder told me

395
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,359
the mountains have been restless
at night lately.

396
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,640
You should be careful.

397
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:03,955
There have been reports of activity near
an ancient tomb from the last dynasty.

398
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:05,260
They're even saying it's haunted.

399
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,680
There are no ghosts or spirits
in this world.

400
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,039
There's nothing to fear.

401
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,640
If that's true,

402
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:12,440
how about

403
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,319
taking me to see it for myself?

404
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:17,480
Maybe someone's trying to loot the tomb.

405
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:24,110
Watch your step.

406
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,044
- All right.
- Here.

407
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:28,440
Here.

408
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,160
Wait. I'll go first.

409
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:34,640
Come, Tong.

410
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,466
I can do it myself.

411
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,039
Be careful.

412
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:48,720
That's strange.

413
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,200
What's the matter?

414
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,000
I thought the disturbance
at the tomb was caused by herb thieves.

415
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,319
But these high-grade pink knotweed

416
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,240
and gentian roots

417
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,079
are still here, untouched.

418
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,440
Any thief would've

419
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,480
taken these.

420
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:04,640
Mother.

421
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,480
Look!

422
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,319
Lingzhi!

423
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,640
Slow down.

424
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,039
Careful.

425
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,311
(They didn't even take something
as valuable as lingzhi.)

426
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:35,200
Up ahead

427
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,666
is where the ancient tomb
from the previous dynasty is.

428
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,039
Tong,

429
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,079
you stay here and harvest the lingzhi.

430
00:25:41,088 --> 00:25:42,240
I'll go take a look up front.

431
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,079
I want to go too.

432
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:43,599
Do as I say.

433
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,119
Wait here and don't move.

434
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,319
I'll be back soon.

435
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,559
Mother!

436
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,160
Mother, where are you?

437
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,920
Mother!

438
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,759
I'm scared...

439
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,519
Mother?

440
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:26,599
Mother?

441
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,720
Mother, where are you?

442
00:27:52,822 --> 00:27:55,666
(That was the first time
I ever entered the Tianguang Market.)

443
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,839
(I don't know how much time passed.)

444
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,359
(One day, I realized that)

445
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,319
(when the mist rose,)

446
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,440
(a path appeared)

447
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,839
(guiding me forward.)

448
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,920
Mother!

449
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,920
When I woke up,

450
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,480
I was in a place I'd never seen before.

451
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,440
That was where

452
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,519
I met Chu Qiu.

453
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,839
At the time,

454
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,519
I thought he was a deity.

455
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,000
I had no idea

456
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,119
I'd passed through
the Tianguang Market's entrance

457
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,480
and arrived in the 31st century.

458
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,119
Are you

459
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,200
a deity?

460
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,640
Where did you come from?

461
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,839
Please save me.

462
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,519
I'm lost.

463
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:06,720
I want to go home.

464
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
How did you get here?

465
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,240
I live in Miao Village.

466
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,319
My mother and I were gathering herbs
near the ancient tomb.

467
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,039
She disappeared,

468
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,599
so I went looking for her.

469
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:20,279
I think I tripped and fell.

470
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,480
After that,
I ended up somewhere strange.

471
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:23,799
It was filled

472
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:24,920
with mist.

473
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,039
The sky glowed red like sunset.

474
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,039
There was

475
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,920
a red tree.

476
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,160
And a very long river.

477
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,000
I kept walking along that river,

478
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,440
and somehow I ended up here.

479
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,880
You've been to the Tianguang Market?

480
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,119
What's the Tianguang Market?

481
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:47,333
People who've been there aren't supposed

482
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,640
to remember it.

483
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
Mr. Deity,

484
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,200
can you send me home?

485
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:54,799
One moment.

486
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,720
This is the Time Administration.

487
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,039
A girl from a different timeline
was transported here.

488
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,200
It appears to be an accident.

489
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:06,822
However,
she's been to the Tianguang Market

490
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:08,440
and retains her memories of it.

491
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,720
She wishes to return home.

492
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,720
Please send me the data from her time.

493
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,279
Data transmitted.

494
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:38,640
Are you sure you want to go back?

495
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:40,599
Yes.

496
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,920
(The Time Administration
treated my injuries)

497
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,240
(and sent me back to Miao Village.)

498
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,440
(But in the days I was away,)

499
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,400
(everything changed.)

500
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,039
Clan Elder!

501
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,559
What happened here?

502
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,880
Miao Tong.

503
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,160
Run!

504
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,680
Run as far from the village

505
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,799
as you can.

506
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,480
Someone disturbed the ancient tomb.

507
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,200
The deities are enraged

508
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,720
and their wrath has fallen upon us.

509
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,319
I'll suffer

510
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,440
any punishment,

511
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,920
but please spare the young kids.

512
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,039
Father!

513
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:36,680
Mother!

514
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,039
Mother!

515
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,000
Father.

516
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,599
Father, what's going on?

517
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,759
Tong, you're back.

518
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,480
Go...

519
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
Leave this place...

520
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,400
The ancient tomb... The spirits...

521
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,519
The curse...

522
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,319
You must leave at once...

523
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,480
I'm not going anywhere.

524
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,400
Father...

525
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:56,640
Mother...

526
00:31:58,599 --> 00:31:59,920
Mother...

527
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,440
This is all my fault.

528
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,759
I shouldn't have dragged you
to the ancient tomb.

529
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,519
Mother...

530
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,640
Mother, wake up.

531
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,480
Mother...

532
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,480
I was foolish.

533
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,839
I'll take responsibility for what I did.

534
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:26,559
Please don't punish
my innocent family and fellow villagers.

535
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,720
Father.

536
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,160
Mother.

537
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,440
I must go now.

538
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,720
You must all live on.

539
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,119
(Miao Village)
(Later, I learned)

540
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,720
(they weren't deities at all.)

541
00:33:35,577 --> 00:33:37,480
(They were members
of the Time Administration.)

542
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,480
(I underwent their training,)

543
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,240
(came to the Tianguang Market)

544
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:46,666
(and became the Market Lord.)

545
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,839
It's almost unheard of
to retain your memories

546
00:33:54,911 --> 00:33:56,000
after leaving the market.

547
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,000
The Time Administration
recognized your potential.

548
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,920
I do have a good memory.

549
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,640
After training,

550
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,800
I could identify the market's portals

551
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,639
from different eras.

552
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,840
They said this ability only exists

553
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,119
in time-space analysts.

554
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,960
As far as I know,

555
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,960
they trained several people like me.

556
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,639
I just want someone to replace me soon.

557
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:26,190
You stayed here willingly

558
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,519
for the sake

559
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,440
of your family

560
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,519
and your people.

561
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,800
That's admirable.

562
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,639
But...

563
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,760
But what?

564
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,960
The first and foremost rule

565
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,760
of the Time Administration

566
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,639
is never altering the course of history.

567
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,239
Should you

568
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,320
be amenable to this,

569
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,510
I'd like to visit your family
on your behalf.

570
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,960
When and where

571
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,840
did you live?

572
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,960
In the Wanqi era,

573
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,599
Zicang County.

574
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,920
Miao Village,

575
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,239
east of Er Mountain.

576
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,760
I'll remember that.

577
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,159
Thank you for saving me.

578
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
I'll hide here for a while.

579
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,199
I'll escape on my own

580
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,400
if necessary.

581
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:24,044
You need not worry about me.

582
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,719
But...

583
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,000
Please remember,

584
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,679
no matter what happens,

585
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,480
protect yourself first

586
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,119
and make the right choice.

587
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,960
The purpose of time travel isn't

588
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,977
to change the past,

589
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,960
but to create

590
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,679
a better future.

591
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,559
As long as you're alive,

592
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,760
there's hope.

593
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
Take care.

594
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,119
Farewell.

595
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,840
Bizhi!

596
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:23,360
My name is Miao Tong.

597
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,119
"Tong" as in bright red.

598
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,079
If you ever get the chance,

599
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,400
please visit my parents for me.

600
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,239
Tell them

601
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:36,920
I'm doing well.

602
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
Miao Tong.

603
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,440
A splendid name.

604
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,679
Take care,

605
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,880
Miss Miao Tong.

606
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:33,960
Lin Zhong!

607
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,079
Lin Zhong!

608
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:36,679
Lin Zhong!

609
00:37:36,777 --> 00:37:37,800
You got here before me.

610
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,960
Did you see who stole half my table?

611
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,244
The other half was about this big

612
00:37:41,266 --> 00:37:43,030
and this tall.
Just like the one you're on...

613
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Get down from there!

614
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,599
Get down!

615
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:49,320
This table's made from
the root of a thousand-year-old tree!

616
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,960
Stingy. I'm just borrowing it.

617
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,480
That thing's heavy.
How did you even move it by yourself?

618
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,559
You're just bad luck for me.

619
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:57,760
It's been nothing but disasters
for me today.

620
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,320
Master Dong!

621
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,440
Su Beilu.

622
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,280
I say, you look decent today.

623
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,199
Looking sharp.

624
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:03,800
Master Dong.

625
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,280
I'm desperate.

626
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,400
You've seen the world.

627
00:38:06,422 --> 00:38:07,590
Can I ask you about a place?

628
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,360
Go on.

629
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:10,360
Have you heard of the Tianguang Market?

630
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:11,199
What?

631
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,559
It's a place

632
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,360
where time stands still.

633
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,840
People from different dynasties

634
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,920
live there.

635
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,199
I know it.

636
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,719
Come here. Let's sit down and talk.

637
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:24,070
That place you're talking about

638
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,000
is a quantum field.

639
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,039
What you're describing

640
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,360
is a time-frozen space that exists

641
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,960
as a quantum pair

642
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,400
with the outside.

643
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,199
No...

644
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,519
You need an observer for that.

645
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,880
You know John von Neumann?

646
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,519
No.

647
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,920
How about quantum entanglement?

648
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
No more entanglements!

649
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,119
There's a river there.

650
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,719
It's called the River of Oblivion.

651
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,760
There's a big tree by the river.

652
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:50,039
Red leaves fall from it.

653
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:51,550
You've got connections everywhere.

654
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,800
Help me look into it, please?

655
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,960
You mean this place?

656
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,440
Who drew this?

657
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,110
This painting's called

658
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,155
"The River of Oblivion."

659
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,066
It was done by a senior of mine
from Huayang Academy of Fine Arts.

660
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:23,630
Did she say where this place is?

661
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,800
No.

662
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:25,880
She just said

663
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,880
that when she was a kid,
she once went camping

664
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,239
and a heavy fog rolled in.

665
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,159
She had a dream.

666
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,719
In the dream, she saw this scene.

667
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,800
When she grew up,

668
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,840
she painted it.

669
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,360
It was foggy.

670
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,400
When I was about to fall asleep,

671
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,559
I saw layers of mist.

672
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,920
Everything was white.

673
00:39:42,488 --> 00:39:44,360
That's when I entered
the Tianguang Market.

674
00:39:45,622 --> 00:39:46,760
So that's how it happened.

675
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,380
Please help me get the address from her.

676
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,360
Master Dong,

677
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:50,960
come on!

678
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,639
Master Dong, drive faster!

679
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,920
This is as fast as I can go.

680
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,669
This car's been acting up lately.

681
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,380
Feels like
it's not getting enough power.

682
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,480
The address Lin Zhong gave us
is too remote.

683
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,750
If we go any farther,
we'll be heading into the mountains.

684
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,079
