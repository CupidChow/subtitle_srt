00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,760
Tuanzi.

5
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,919
Don't worry.

6
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,199
I will

7
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,199
give you a home.

8
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,719
Allow me.

9
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,400
Thank you.

10
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,479
Here, Sir.

11
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,319
I'm telling you.

12
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,400
The house I got for you

13
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,429
is a great deal. It's right in front.

14
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,933
(Ninghai City Map of Houses for Rent)

15
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,240
Can you find another house for me?

16
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,719
The previous ones were barely habitable.

17
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,759
Yes.

18
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't have a high budget,

19
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,919
but can you find a house
that's actually habitable?

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,599
This house is great.

21
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,639
Nice layout,

22
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,439
huge space,

23
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,960
and great lighting.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,360
And a comfy bed.

25
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,319
But are you sure a nice house like this

26
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,879
only costs so little to rent?

27
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,960
Keep us safe...

28
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,400
Something happened

29
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,719
in this house before.

30
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,000
That's why it's such a bargain.

31
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,800
Mister,

32
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,800
are we closing down?

33
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,400
Don't jinx me like that.

34
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,560
We're just moving.

35
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,870
Moving?

36
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,759
Stop idling around.

37
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,759
Give us a hand.

38
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,960
Okay.

39
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,520
Mister,

40
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,800
your new home is awesome.

41
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,800
It's a five-room apartment, right?

42
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:18,000
Look at the beautiful
Chinese-style furnishings

43
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,866
and the central air-conditioning system.

44
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,040
It's a huge house.

45
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,888
Doesn't it feel creepy
to live here alone?

46
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,600
If this is the dorm for
Yashe's employees,

47
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,839
it won't be that huge.

48
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,120
Yashe's employees?

49
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,720
I'm the only employee, right?

50
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,079
Tuanzi and Xuan Wu
are our employees too.

51
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,560
This place accepts pets.

52
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,920
Then you mean

53
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,240
I don't need

54
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,439
to find a house anymore?

55
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,120
I can move here

56
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,800
with Tuanzi, right?

57
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,600
Mister,

58
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,040
you're amazing!

59
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,240
You don't know

60
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,079
how tiring it is to find a house!

61
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,600
Then, do I have to

62
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,839
pay rent?

63
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,439
I'll deduct it from your pay.

64
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,160
No problem!

65
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,720
Mister,

66
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,279
I will work hard!

67
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,079
What else do I need to carry?

68
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,800
Tuanzi,

69
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,519
we have a home!

70
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,860
(Yashe)

71
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,279
Anyone?

72
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,279
Yes.

73
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:14,959
Please come in.

74
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,480
What do you want to...

75
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,079
This place is huge.

76
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,800
Hello.

77
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,639
I seek treatment.

78
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,600
It's so quaint in here.

79
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:31,959
Excuse me,

80
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,160
is this a souvenir store?

81
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,120
You can see it that way.

82
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,279
Take a look around.

83
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:39,759
Sure.

84
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,749
It's an antique store.
Su Beilu mentioned it before.

85
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,577
An antique store?

86
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,560
Do people really buy this kind of stuff?

87
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,240
I heard that antique stores like this,

88
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,839
for every item they sell,

89
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,600
can survive for
another three years.

90
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
There's a turtle here.

91
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,240
Isn't this medicine from our hospital?

92
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,290
(Chongle Pet Hospital)
Isn't this our hospital's bag?

93
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,319
Xuan Wu!

94
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,839
I remember you!

95
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,720
You're the old guy
who got dragged out that day.

96
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,519
Old guy?

97
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,480
What a coincidence, old guy.

98
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,360
Long time no see.

99
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,519
Are you here

100
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,600
to buy something?

101
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,639
No.

102
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,439
We're here to look for someone.

103
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,319
Mister,

104
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,879
I've finally finished pulling the weeds,

105
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,279
and I've fed Xuan Wu.

106
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,519
I'm pooped.

107
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,079
You're here.

108
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:30,680
Mister,

109
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,199
I'm meeting them for dinner.

110
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,829
Can I leave early today?

111
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,044
You want to leave work early?

112
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,244
I'll deduct that from your pay.

113
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:38,630
No.

114
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,600
I mean,

115
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,639
you can order takeaway and eat here.

116
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,000
Is that really okay?

117
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,000
Thank you, Mister.

118
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
What do you want to eat?

119
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,199
Anything.

120
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,879
So, you're Su Beilu's boss.

121
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,120
What a nice coincidence.

122
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,399
Actually, Beilu is

123
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,000
a kind-natured person.

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,399
Yes.

125
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,240
He's a diligent worker.

126
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,240
And very friendly too.

127
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,720
Yes.

128
00:07:04,777 --> 00:07:06,190
When he was working at our hospital,

129
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,720
he got along well

130
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,879
with his colleagues

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and customers.

132
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,279
Even animals love him.

133
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,480
He's a people person.

134
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,399
Yeah.

135
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,800
But

136
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,639
no one is perfect.

137
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,240
Everyone has flaws.

138
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,600
He's not really that flawed.

139
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,360
He is.

140
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,160
We need to be humble.

141
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,639
At least one example.

142
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,519
Yeah.

143
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,560
So, we're nitpicking here.

144
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,240
Su Beilu

145
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
can be

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,800
a little

147
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,600
rash.

148
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,279
Not really.

149
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,000
He's just a little...

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,319
intolerant of evil.

151
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,240
Yeah.

152
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,600
When he left the hospital,

153
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,079
the problem wasn't exactly with him.

154
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,639
It's got nothing to do with him.

155
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,439
It's our manager

156
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,629
who doesn't like him.

157
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,844
He's not exactly a good person.

158
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:54,720
That's right.

159
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,360
Understood.

160
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,439
I hired him because

161
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,079
I admired his character too.

162
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,839
He's blessed to have friends like you.

163
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,399
Dinner's here!

164
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,000
What were you talking about?

165
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:06,900
Good things about you.

166
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:07,830
Yeah, don't worry.

167
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,040
Enjoy your food.

168
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,879
I won't bother you.

169
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,959
Mister, let's eat together.

170
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,600
I bought extra.

171
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,079
Yeah.

172
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,959
Let's eat together.

173
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,560
No.

174
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,360
Enjoy.

175
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:16,920
You're really not eating, Mister?

176
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:17,920
Fine.

177
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,000
Time to unbox.

178
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,959
Your boss is a nice guy.

179
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,519
Yeah.

180
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,040
Look at this bullfrog.

181
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,450
I queued up for a long time for it.

182
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,839
Can you eat bullfrog?

183
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,720
Of course.

184
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,459
I don't.

185
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,560
You're scared of bullfrogs?

186
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,120
But you look like one.

187
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,200
What do you mean?

188
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,679
You look like one yourself.

189
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,000
This bullfrog tastes amazing.

190
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,311
I've been craving it.
Min, you like bullfrog, right?

191
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,970
- It's getting late.
- I'm okay with it.

192
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,080
Come on.

193
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,120
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

194
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,039
I need to eat now.

195
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,960
I'm starving.

196
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,919
Tomatoes.

197
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,720
Try some, Min.

198
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,039
It tastes nice.

199
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,720
Tasty, right?

200
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,240
Try some.

201
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,600
It does taste great.

202
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,790
The eggs are nicely cooked too.

203
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,220
It's just a little too scrambled up.

204
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,240
Try the mushrooms.

205
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,000
Freshly harvested.

206
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,159
Just harvested?

207
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,200
You're already leaving?

208
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,559
Yeah.

209
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,879
We still need to work tomorrow.

210
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,679
Yeah.

211
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,639
We'll take the trash out.

212
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,488
Bye.

213
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,159
Mister?

214
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,759
Mister?

215
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,039
Why did he drink so much?

216
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,519
Mister?

217
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,720
Mister?

218
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Let me help you.

219
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,840
Up you go.

220
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,480
Are you okay?

221
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,440
I need to take a nap.

222
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,399
Careful.

223
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,080
Watch the step.

224
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,639
Careful.

225
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,720
You should go back now.

226
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,519
I'm okay.

227
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,720
Are you really okay?

228
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,720
You might catch a cold like this.

229
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,039
Then, I'm

230
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,039
going now.

231
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,039
No.

232
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Just this once.

233
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,311
There's a dance performance over there.

234
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,320
That's all for now.

235
00:12:28,422 --> 00:12:29,630
Let's check that place out.

236
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,519
Okay.

237
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,919
(If I simply approached someone
to ask them what date today is,)

238
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,960
(they might think I'm mad.)

239
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,879
(Photo booth?)

240
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,559
(They should display the time here.)

241
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,799
(Touch screens don't exist right now.)

242
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,720
No date?

243
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,519
(Today is 12 October 2005.)

244
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,840
(Proudly developed by China,)

245
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,840
(Shenzhou 6, designed
for human spaceflight,)

246
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,440
(has successfully lifted off
at Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.)

247
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,288
(It is expected to be
in orbit for five days.)

248
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
(The spacecraft was placed at
an inclination of 42.4 degrees...)

249
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,960
(2005?)

250
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,519
(I'm back.)

251
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,279
(Dad.)

252
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:35,879
(Mom.)

253
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,679
(Wait for me!)

254
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,620
(Huayang Kindergarten No. 3)

255
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,679
Bye.

256
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,559
Bye.

257
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,519
Bye.

258
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,759
Bei.

259
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,039
Bei.

260
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,919
Bei!

261
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,080
Mommy!

262
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,919
Bei.

263
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:25,799
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,759
I'm sorry.

265
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,759
I'm late.

266
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,879
You must have waited long.

267
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:30,644
There's a major operation
at the hospital.

268
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,120
Everyone was busy.

269
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,480
Your dad was the chief surgeon.

270
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,039
So, after the operation,

271
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,960
the patient will recover?

272
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:38,960
Of course.

273
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,120
Have you forgotten?

274
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,799
Your father is Dr. Monkey King.

275
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,679
When he's there,

276
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,320
the demons will be gone.

277
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,279
Amazing, right?

278
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:45,960
Yeah.

279
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,720
Mom, I'm amazing too.

280
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,519
Look at the origami dog I made.

281
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,120
Fantastic!

282
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,879
You have improved.

283
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,360
Will you give it to me?

284
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,960
Sure.

285
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,919
Why don't you name it?

286
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,519
It has a round face, just like yours.

287
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,200
Let's call it

288
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,600
Little Tuanzi.

289
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:04,879
Tuanzi.

290
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:05,480
Is that okay?

291
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,320
Little Tuanzi.

292
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:07,679
Okay.

293
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,759
Let's go back now.

294
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,720
We need to depart early tomorrow.

295
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:15,679
Fang Linlin!

296
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,000
You are?

297
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,320
I...

298
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,460
I am...

299
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,879
I am...

300
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,600
a teacher in the kindergarten.

301
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,720
Are you Su Beilu's mother?

302
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,480
Yes.

303
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,519
I've never seen him before.

304
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,759
Then...

305
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,799
I'm the new intern.

306
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,720
It's possible that the kids
don't know me yet.

307
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,039
Hello, Sir.

308
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,159
Is there anything you need from me?

309
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,600
Here's the thing.

310
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,759
As an intern, I've been assigned a task.

311
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,440
I need to learn about
the children's weekend plans.

312
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,480
So, I'd like to know

313
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,399
what you're planning

314
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,600
to do this weekend.

315
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,320
We're going to Ninghai this weekend!

316
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,759
Yes.

317
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,919
Ninghai?

318
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,240
It's a great place.

319
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,799
That's where I'm from, too.

320
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,200
But...

321
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,559
You're from there, too?

322
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,279
Then we're fellow townsfolk.

323
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,200
Please keep a close eye

324
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,320
on Bei in the kindergarten.

325
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,080
We need to go now, Sir.

326
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:25,550
Let's go.

327
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,080
I...

328
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:30,879
Wait!

329
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,799
Is there anything?

330
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,720
Can you

331
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
go to Ninghai next week instead?

332
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,519
Next week?

333
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,240
Why?

334
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,720
Does the kindergarten
have any arrangements?

335
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,759
No, not at all.

336
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,519
But...

337
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,320
You're planning to drive there, right?

338
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,720
Yes.

339
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,200
I heard

340
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,960
that there are roadworks
on the way to Ninghai.

341
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,600
It might be a bumpy ride.

342
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,559
If you go next week instead,

343
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,679
it'd be a smoother journey.

344
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,000
Thank you for the reminder,

345
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,290
but we've planned everything out.

346
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,288
We're going anyway.

347
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,799
We need to go home now.

348
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,799
Say goodbye.

349
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,960
Bye, Sir.

350
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
Goodbye.

351
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,559
Mind the step.

352
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,440
Slowly.

353
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:16,960
Well?

354
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,920
Did you have fun
at the kindergarten today?

355
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,279
Look.

356
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,200
Who's back?

357
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:34,920
Daddy!

358
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,039
Slowly, Bei.

359
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,240
You're back!

360
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,680
Bei.

361
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,400
Have you behaved yourself?

362
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,359
- Tell me.
- Slowly.

363
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,359
I have.

364
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:44,030
Let's go home for dinner.

365
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,622
I want to watch "The Monkey King".

366
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,160
Okay.

367
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,160
The Monkey King it is.

368
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,400
You spoil him.

369
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,789
Only before dinner,

370
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,688
and not during dinner.

371
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,920
Do as your mom says.

372
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,839
Okay.

373
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,799
(To stop you from going...)

374
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,720
(Sorry, Dad.)

375
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,240
What is this?

376
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,960
We're going to the carnival tomorrow!

377
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,039
Awesome!

378
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:45,680
Say,

379
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,880
what's the rush?

380
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,119
We leave tomorrow,

381
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,480
and you're loading the luggage now?

382
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,279
We leave early tomorrow.

383
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,039
Now, we can

384
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,279
get some extra winks in the morning.

385
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,599
Honey,

386
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,079
look at this.

387
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,400
This is...

388
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,160
Is this a flat tire?

389
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,160
Yes.

390
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,440
But all four tires are flat...

391
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,440
Someone must have done this on purpose.

392
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,279
Let's call the police.

393
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,759
Forget it.

394
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,039
It's not a big deal.

395
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,720
Let's call Huang

396
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:30,920
and have him fix the tires.

397
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,319
Right now?

398
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,039
It's already late.

399
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,680
His workshop must be
closed for the day.

400
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,839
Besides, how do we go there
with four flat tires?

401
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,559
How about

402
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,119
we cancel the trip

403
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,599
to Ninghai tomorrow?

404
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,319
Yes.

405
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:48,960
Don't go.

406
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:49,960
No.

407
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,240
I promised him.

408
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,880
Bei has been wanting

409
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,440
to go to the Beach Carnival.

410
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,720
He's been talking about it.

411
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,759
If we don't go,

412
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,319
I'd be breaking my promise.

413
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,599
I don't want to disappoint Bei.

414
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,799
(So, it was me)

415
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,960
(who insisted on going
to the Beach Carnival.)

416
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,279
I'd hate to cancel too,

417
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,000
but it'll take time

418
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,079
to fix the car.

419
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,799
Don't go.

420
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,079
We can take the bus instead.

421
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,160
There's the overnight bus

422
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,400
that departs in the wee hours

423
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,720
and arrives at Ninghai in the morning.

424
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,960
We can take the bus.

425
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,480
If we take the bus,

426
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,640
if anything happens to my patients,

427
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,079
I might not make it back in time.

428
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,839
You're not the only doctor
in the hospital.

429
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,240
Someone else can take over.

430
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,519
Don't go.

431
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,240
Don't go.

432
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,720
Fine.

433
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:39,240
I'll buy the tickets.

434
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,079
That sounds more like it.

435
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,279
I don't want

436
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,400
to leave any regrets in Bei's childhood.

437
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,920
Later, we need to tuck Bei in bed early.

438
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,559
(No.)

439
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,240
(Not even if they take the bus.)

440
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,720
(I need to stop them.)

441
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,680
Hello,

442
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,960
how many buses are there
to Ninghai today?

443
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,680
There's the last bus tonight.

444
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,000
I'll buy up all the seats.

445
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,839
Are you sure?

446
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,880
All 28 of them?

447
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:16,880
Yes.

448
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,000
Okay.

449
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:18,880
A moment, please.

450
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,200
2,800 yuan.

451
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:22,599
Here.

452
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,666
Who's scanning, you or me?

453
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,440
What?

454
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,640
It's okay.

455
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,559
Anyway, I'll buy up all the tickets.

456
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,070
Let me take care of the money.

457
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:35,559
Sir.

458
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:36,799
Sir.

459
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,000
Can you lend me 2,800 yuan?

460
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,839
I'll pay you back.

461
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,440
Sorry,

462
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,279
I can't help you.

463
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,200
I have no money.

464
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,319
Ask someone else.

465
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,960
Hello, can you lend me 2,800 yuan?

466
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,480
No.

467
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,880
Sir, can you lend me 2,800 yuan?

468
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,240
You must be mad.

469
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,200
Borrowing money from me?

470
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,200
Kid,

471
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,480
I've got my eye on you in there.

472
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,200
Sir,

473
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,480
can you lend me 2,800 yuan?

474
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,710
You're trying to cheat me now?

475
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:55,310
Come with me.

476
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:55,559
No.

477
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,079
Come with me.

478
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,039
I can explain.

479
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,510
You can explain at the police station.

480
00:21:58,599 --> 00:21:59,839
Su Huabin! Dr. Su!

481
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,880
You're

482
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,000
calling me?

483
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,039
You know me?

484
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,460
(Huayang Bus Terminal)

485
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,440
My grandfather

486
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,799
is your patient.

487
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,440
He often told us

488
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,599
that you're a great doctor

489
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,839
because you

490
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,359
extended his life from a few months

491
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,559
to years since then.

492
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,119
You are

493
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,160
Mr. Zhou's

494
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,359
grandson?

495
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,079
Yes.

496
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,069
You two know each other?

497
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,244
Take him away from here.

498
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:40,160
Don't let him borrow money
from random strangers.

499
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:41,070
Sorry for the trouble.

500
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:41,680
Not at all.

501
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,480
Is your grandfather doing fine?

502
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,359
Pretty good.

503
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,960
Earlier,

504
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,039
he was saying that you're

505
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,920
borrowing money?

506
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:57,920
My grandfather

507
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,759
is celebrating his 90th birthday soon,

508
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,759
and our whole family is about

509
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,759
to go to Ninghai to visit him.

510
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,400
We hired a driver and a car,

511
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,160
but they canceled us last minute.

512
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,319
That's why I'm trying
to buy tickets here.

513
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,880
There are 28 of us,

514
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,119
so we need 28 tickets,

515
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,319
which cost 2,800 yuan.

516
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,279
But...

517
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,799
I forgot to bring money.

518
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,039
Actually,

519
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,559
our family is planning to take
this bus to Ninghai too.

520
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,079
But it's okay.

521
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,559
I'll think of something else.

522
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:26,680
Mr. Zhou

523
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,240
is someone I respect very much.

524
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,119
How about this?

525
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,440
I'll lend you

526
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,160
2,800 yuan.

527
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:35,880
Really?

528
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,920
Follow me to the bank.

529
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,440
I don't have that much cash with me.

530
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:52,079
2,800 yuan.

531
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,880
Take it.

532
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,400
Thank you, Dr. Su.

533
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:56,960
I have your phone number,

534
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,920
so I'll return the money once I'm back.

535
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,440
Sure.

536
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,319
Be careful on the way back.

537
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,599
I'm off.

538
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,240
By the way,

539
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,319
you guys

540
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:08,920
are not going to Ninghai anymore?

541
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,559
It's not an urgent trip.

542
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,799
We can always

543
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,279
go there next time.

544
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:15,880
Okay.

545
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,440
Goodbye.

546
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,160
Goodbye.

547
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:40,559
Dad.

548
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,000
Here's your money.

549
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,319
No,

550
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,960
it's not safe here.

551
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,240
Scram!

552
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:53,270
You're the one who sabotaged the tires.

553
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,440
I knew I could catch you here.

554
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,039
I'm calling the police.

555
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,319
Don't try to run away.

556
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,160
Mr. Shen...

557
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,279
You don't have to explain.

558
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,720
When you slashed the tires,

559
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,400
I saw you from my house.

560
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,480
Mr. Shen!

561
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,799
Wait.

562
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,960
How do you know they call me Mr. Shen?

563
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,599
Mr. Shen, I know you.

564
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,044
Doesn't my face look familiar?

565
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,240
You remember now?

566
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,400
Oh, my.

567
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,559
You've been secretly

568
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,880
gathering information on everyone here.

569
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,519
So, are you pulling off a heist?

570
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
No.

571
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,640
We know each other.

572
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,680
I'm your neighbor.

573
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:27,839
Be honest,

574
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,720
or else I'll...

575
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,119
Mr. Shen!

576
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,319
What's wrong?

577
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,920
Dr. Su!

578
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,960
Over here!

579
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:32,480
Mr. Shen,

580
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,839
put the bottle down.

581
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,720
Don't get worked up.
You might injure someone.

582
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,319
Dr. Su,

583
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,960
I caught the culprit
who slashed your tires!

584
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,319
It's you?

585
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,039
I'm not.

586
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:44,759
You're not?

587
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,599
I can bear witness!

588
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,300
♪What do you call your father's father?♪

589
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,860
♪Your father's father

590
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,319
It's iced.

591
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Thank you.

592

♪Your father's sister is your aunt♪

594
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,759
Did you slash the tires?

595
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,079
Yes.

596
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,119
Dr. Su.

597
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,720
Actually,

598
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,240
about the tickets,

599
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,920
I lied to you too.

600
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,039
Here,

601
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,759
it's your money.

602
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,839
So,

603
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,599
you're not Mr. Zhou's grandson?

604
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,640
No.

605
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,599
Then, who are you?

606
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,480
How did you

607
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,680
know me?

608
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,200
I...

609
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,759
I'm not interrogating you.

610
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,240
If you refuse to say,

611
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
I won't ask.

612
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,640
I just want to tell you

613
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
that you're still young.

614
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,200
You look like a decent lad.

615
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,599
If you do well,

616
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,160
I believe you will be a great person.

617
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,200
Actually,

618
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,480
I take after

619
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,839
my dad and mom.

620
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,119
My father's

621
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,440
just like you.

622
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,400
He's a doctor.

623
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,960
My fellow colleague?

624
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,119
Which hospital does he work at?

625
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,119
He's no longer around.

626
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,039
I'm sorry.

627
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,319
It's okay.

628
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,519
Daddy, why aren't you home yet?

629
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:57,920
Bei.

630
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,319
I'll be back soon.

631
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,200
Tell me a bedtime story later.

632
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,880
Sure.

633
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:02,720
I'll be back

634
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,559
to tell you a bedtime story.

635
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,359
You promise?

636
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:05,720
Yes.

637
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,839
I'll be back right away.

638
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,160
I need to go home now.

639
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,440
Thank you.

640
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:27,559
Promise me.

641
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,000
In the future,

642
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,799
take every step wisely.

643
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:33,880
Promise me this.

644
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:39,839
I promise.

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,119
That's a catchy nursery rhyme.

651
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,640
Can you

652
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,119
give me a coin

653
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,240
to ride that?

654
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,160
Say,

655
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,880
a handsome lad like you

656
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,960
can be so erratic.

657
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:34,880
Catch.

658
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,799
Bye.

659
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,160
See you.

660
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,440
Stop!

661
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,359
Don't go!

662
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,079
Come back!

663
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,319
I need to call him.

664
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,119
My phone.

665
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,559
Why is there no signal?

666
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,920
2005!

667
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,160
I know you.

668
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:29,559
You're Bei.

669
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,359
How did you grow up so fast?

670
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,079
Mr. Shen, I have no time for this.

671
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,933
My parents are going to die
in a car crash!

672
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,200
You can't go.

673
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,559
Not until you explain.

674
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,599
What car crash?

675
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,799
Later, I'm in a rush.

676
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,000
It's still early.

677
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,759
The buses,

678
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,519
taxis and rickshaws
are not in service yet.

679
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,440
How will you go after them?

680
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,279
What should I do?

681
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,240
I have.

682
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,960
Mr. Shen,

683
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,079
is this your car?

684
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,559
It's yours now.

685
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,000
Go.

686
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,039
Thanks, Mr. Shen.

687
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,000
Run along now!

688
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,359
This kid grows up so fast.

689
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,599
Su Beilu.

690
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,100
(13 October 2005)

691
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,799
We must thank

692
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,039
Huang for this.

693
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,440
He spent the night patching up the tires

694
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,680
so that Bei

695
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,880
could realize

696
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,839
his wish.

697
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,680
It's all thanks to you, too.

698
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,960
You performed surgery on his wife,

699
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,319
so he was willing to help.

700
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,559
I'm a doctor.

701
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,880
Isn't that my job?

702
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,400
Honey, there's a gas station in front.

703
00:32:55,422 --> 00:32:56,440
There's a store there too.

704
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,480
Let's make a stop

705
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,680
to buy some snacks for Bei.

706
00:32:59,039 --> 00:32:59,720
Sure.

707
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,480
I'll go with you.

708
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,400
We left in a hurry,

709
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,644
so we forgot to pack water.

710
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,519
Yeah, sure.

711
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,039
Su Beilu.

712
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:37,599
I'm telling you,

713
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,839
you guys must not go to Ninghai today.

714
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,240
When your parents come back,

715
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
just throw a tantrum.

716
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,519
A huge tantrum.

717
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:44,777
Tell them you don't want to go,

718
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,480
okay?

719
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,400
You're not a teacher!

720
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,319
I've never seen you in the kindergarten!

721
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,200
Dad!

722
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,720
Mom!

723
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:57,119
- Mom!
- Bei!

724
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,000
What's wrong, Bei?

725
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,640
What's wrong, Bei? Why are you crying?

726
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,119
What happened, sweetheart?

727
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,960
There's a kidnapper.

728
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,240
Kidnapper?

729
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,480
Where?

730
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,360
Honey,

731
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,079
let's go.

732
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,320
I don't think it's safe here.

733
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,800
