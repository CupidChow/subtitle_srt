1
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,380
(Qin Residence)

2
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,400
Young Master.

3
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,840
It's getting late.

4
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:57,422
You should put on another layer.

5
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,150
Never mind.

6
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,540
(Qin Ziyi)

7
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,230
The blizzard will only get worse.

8
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,350
Shall we move to
Her Majesty's room to warm up?

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,640
You may leave first.

10
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,150
I'm not cold.

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
Yes.

12
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,560
(Bizhi,)

13
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,760
(I'm trapped in a clan dispute.)

14
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,920
(I bear the weight of my crimes.)

15
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,000
(The road ahead is long.)

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,070
(Take care of yourself.)

17
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,200
(May you remain unharmed.)

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,840
(And beware of the cold.)

19
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,220
(Bizhi)

20
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,690
Withdraw now!

21
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,550
Move!

22
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,960
Go!

23
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:40,590
I told you to stay
at the residence and protect Ziyi?

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,520
Why are you here?

25
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,150
What are you doing?

26
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,520
(Huo Shu, retainer of the Qin family)
He ordered me to protect you.

27
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,590
General Huo.

28
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,710
I'm not Huo Shu right now.

29
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,800
Right now, I'm you!

30
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,488
Go, now!

31
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:53,510
We're leaving together.

32
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:55,190
Young Master needs you to save his life.

33
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,590
Go!

34
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,470
Over there!

35
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,310
Su Rou.

36
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,510
(We travel thousands of miles apart.)

37
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,390
(Mountain after mountain
separates us from our old woods.)

38
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,950
(The old woods are no longer in sight.)

39
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,000
(Old bonds grow deeper in solitude.)

40
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,600
(All my life, I held to one conviction.)

41
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:50,750
(Though a thousand miles apart,)

42
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,000
(may we each travel in peace.)

43
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,000
(Ziyi.)

44
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,870
(I've obtained the testimony.)

45
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,830
(I can prove your innocence now.)

46
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,830
(Why didn't you wait for me?)

47
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,390
(Why?)

48
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,700
(Yashe)

49
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,300
(Away)

50
00:05:52,300 --> 00:06:05,500
(Yashe)

51
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,711
=The Company=
=Season 1=

52
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:35,940
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

53
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,820
=Episode 1=

54
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:55,660
(Yashe)

55
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,700
(Ninghai City)

56
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,220
(Yashe)

57
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,160
(I am Bizhi.)

58
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,670
(The owner of
Yashe antique shop.)

59
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,630
(It is now the twenty-first century.)

60
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,870
(A time unfamiliar to me.)

61
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,360
(Do they have this flower here as well?)

62
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,120
(It seems spring is in full bloom.)

63
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,670
(I've arrived at the right time.)

64
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,200
Come on. Take a look.

65
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,750
Sir, take a look at this one.

66
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,710
Look at this.

67
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,870
A jade pendant.

68
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
Exceptional quality.

69
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,670
Everything I sell here is genuine.

70
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,459
Take your time.

71
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,990
I'll definitely give you a fair price.

72
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,870
This one is a Qing-dynasty
replica of Jun ware,

73
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,710
a twin-handled vase.

74
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,600
A fixed price of 50,000.

75
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,150
It's a premium tribute porcelain
from the Tang-dynasty Yue kilns.

76
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,990
Look at the base.

77
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,840
Look at the glaze.

78
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,150
Pick it up and feel it yourself.

79
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,030
Go on.

80
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,320
Even if it's a replica,

81
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,960
it is still an object.

82
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,670
This time, hold it carefully.

83
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,120
The sword of King Goujian of Yue.

84
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,000
There were several of them.

85
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,870
All famed swords of the realm.

86
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,480
The man who forged them

87
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,390
was called Ou Yezi.

88
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,360
It's said that once,

89
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
while Ou Yezi was forging a sword,

90
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,120
with a sudden plunge,

91
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,080
he fell straight
into the forging furnace.

92
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,870
From that moment on,

93
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,030
he and the sword

94
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,630
became one.

95
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,270
He became the sword's spirit.

96
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,150
This blade cuts through anything.

97
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,080
It can win any battle.

98
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,320
And now...

99
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,030
it is

100
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,750
in my hand.

101
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,560
Give me a break.

102
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,910
Haven't you been swindled again, Dong?

103
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,750
Look.

104
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,600
I'm telling the truth!

105
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,000
That's King Goujian of Yue!

106
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,320
You know who he is, right?

107
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,390
What he said is true.

108
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,320
Everyone knows
Ou Yezi forged only five swords.

109
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,750
They were Zhanlu,

110
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,590
Juque,

111
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,240
Shengxie, Yuchang,

112
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,110
and Chunjun.

113
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,320
But in fact, he forged a sixth.

114
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
That sword brings misfortune,

115
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,670
so it was never given a name.

116
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,480
Collecting treasures

117
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,150
is all about the art of concealment.

118
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,510
Master Dong,

119
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,000
I've long heard of you.

120
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:00,870
To judge an object,
one must know the person.

121
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:01,810
A pleasure to meet you.

122
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,870
The pleasure is mine.

123
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,320
Gentlemen,

124
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,150
I've got a VIP client today.

125
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,080
Please excuse me. Let's wrap it up.

126
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,470
That's it, everyone. Come on.

127
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,733
(Private Negotiation Area)

128
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,550
Sir, how should I address you?

129
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,600
My name is Bizhi.

130
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,110
Mr. Bi,

131
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,360
please have a seat.

132
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,390
Bi is not my surname.

133
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,990
Please, sit.

134
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,240
Here.

135
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,080
Have some tea.

136
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,720
Your bronze sword

137
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,080
has caught my interest.

138
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,360
Would you sell it to me?

139
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,390
That sword

140
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,470
is not for sale.

141
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,110
How about this?

142
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,670
Try something else.

143
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,680
Have some tea.

144
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,630
You can't show your money here.

145
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,670
Too many eyes are watching.

146
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,230
Sir,

147
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,200
this isn't about the money.

148
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,120
The Twin Dragon Zichen Pendant?

149
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,960
This is for me as well?

150
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,030
Sincerity

151
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,840
lies in the word sincere.

152
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,200
Sir, this way, please.

153
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,480
Someone actually paid that much
for this piece of junk?

154
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,270
This can't be real, can it?

155
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,710
Master Dong?

156
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,240
Master Dong!

157
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
You

158
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,390
will pay with your life!

159
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,110
Master Dong?

160
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,440
Why am I here?

161
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,910
Your finger was cut just now.

162
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,630
I helped bandage it.

163
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:01,600
Do you know
you faint at the sight of blood?

164
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,600
I fainted just now?

165
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,440
Yeah.

166
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,510
Why does it hurt here?

167
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,750
You probably bumped
into something earlier.

168
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,920
The money's here.

169
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,960
Count it.

170
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,550
It should all be there.

171
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,390
Okay.

172
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,840
I've secured the bronze sword.

173
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,080
I'll take my leave.

174
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,390
Leaving already?

175
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,670
I'll see you out.

176
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,680
No need.

177
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
I know the way out.

178
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,080
Do come again.

179
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,840
My hand's cut...

180
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
But why does my neck hurt?

181
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,220
Come on, take a photo.

182
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,470
Come on.

183
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,100
(Golden Liquor)
(Special Offer)

184
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,490
Hey, handsome.
What would you like to drink?

185
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:07,440
Do you have any Golden Liquor here?

186
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,560
Golden Liquor?

187
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,940
Yes. Have a seat.

188
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,230
Thank you.

189
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:23,440
This isn't the liquor I want.

190
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,080
What I want is Golden Liquor.

191
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,080
The liquor written on your sign.

192
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,320
Let me get you our house special.

193
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,630
Golden Coast.

194
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,470
Please enjoy.

195
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,840
This isn't what I want.

196
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,155
Vermilion grass grows among
the rocks of famed mountains.

197
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:42,311
Its sap is like blood.

198
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,680
- Just mix it the way he said.
- Cast gold and jade into it,

199
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,800
and it forms pellets like clay.

200
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,990
Over time, it turns into liquid.

201
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,320
Add gold to it,

202
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,555
and it is called golden elixir.

203
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,870
Add jade to it,

204
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,080
and it is called jade nectar.

205
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,510
Taking either grants longevity.

206
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,960
True Golden Liquor

207
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,480
is brewed from sugarcane.

208
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,270
Its fragrance is rich.

209
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:00,120
On the tongue, it is incomparably sweet.

210
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,960
Down the throat,
it turns faintly bitter,

211
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,640
followed by a sharp, lingering finish.

212
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,550
It must be served in
the finest twin-handled jade cup

213
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,350
to be worthy of such a peerless brew.

214
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:14,222
Hello. Here's the drink
mixed as you requested.

215
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:24,240
♪Happy birthday to you♪

216
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,080
(This liquor)

217
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,400
(is the Golden Liquor I once spoke of,)

218
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,400
(brewed from sugarcane.)

219
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,510
(A rare treasure of the mortal world.)

220
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,110
Today,

221
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,830
let us drink together.

222
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,160
Would that not be fitting?

223
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,480
(Ziyi was my only friend.)

224
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,440
(He lost his life in that great fire.)

225
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,160
(No matter how hard I tried,)

226
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,440
(I could not save his life.)

227
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,830
(The many treasures
he collected in his lifetime)

228
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,350
(were scattered across different times)

229
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,240
(because of my mistake.)

230
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,750
(Reclaiming them one by one)

231
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,240
(became the destiny of my life.)

232
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,590
The treasured sword remains the same.

233
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,720
But the man is gone.

234
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,830
It's okay.

235
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,110
I can get back on my own.

236
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,790
Bye. Remember to call and wake me up.

237
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,750
We're heading off. Bye.

238
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,590
Okay.

239
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,240
How much did you drink?

240
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,550
Can you even stand?

241
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,770
Here, I'll give you a hand.

242
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,310
Steady.

243
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,350
Hold onto your things.

244
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,640
Ziyi!

245
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,550
Is this really you?

246
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,830
Why are you here?

247
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,480
It's my birthday today.

248
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,590
Come on. Wish me a happy birthday.

249
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,920
I understand now.

250
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,200
You're just like these artifacts.

251
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,110
You've drifted into this time as well.

252
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,480
That's wonderful.

253
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,270
It's so good that you're alive.

254
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,550
How much did you drink?

255
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,720
I'll call a cab to take you home.

256
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,280
Yeah.

257
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,440
I'll take you back.

258
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,750
Let's go.

259
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,240
No. You don't have to.

260
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,400
You don't belong here.

261
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,550
It's fine. I'll take you.

262
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,920
You've had too much to drink.

263
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,590
What place is this?

264
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,300
(Yashe)

265
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,240
Here.

266
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,310
Your things.

267
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,580
(Yashe)

268
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,790
What exactly is this place?

269
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,390
Careful.

270
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,780
Come on. Sit down.

271
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,590
I have to send you back.

272
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:33,030
Take good care of yourself.

273
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,030
Ziyi.

274
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,300
(Days Pass and Months Go By)

275
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,750
What just happened?

276
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,200
Did I imagine it?

277
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,980
(Yongning Gate)

278
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Why is it winter outside?

279
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Maybe the coordinates were wrong?

280
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,680
This time, it'll definitely work.

281
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,680
(Yashe)
Flowers for sale.

282
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,440
Sir.

283
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:03,688
Would you like to buy a flower?

284
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,110
Sure. I'll take one.

285
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,950
How about this one?

286
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,750
- Want a pack of cigarettes, Sir?
- No.

287
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,750
Take one. They're new.

288
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,490
- I really don't want any.
- They're cheap.

289
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,350
Thanks.

290
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,110
Watch the road!

291
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,030
I got it wrong again.

292
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,960
I got it wrong.

293
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,200
Let's head back.

294
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,550
Was that a tram just now?

295
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,880
What's going on with your house?

296
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,510
What are you doing?

297
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,270
This time, it's right.

298
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,120
Cheers.

299
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,020
Hi.

300
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,240
Who are you?

301
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,000
My name is Su Beilu.

302
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,160
Beilu?

303
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,960
Are you an enemy from the north?

304
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,640
Enemy?

305
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,590
Where do you live?

306
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,830
Where did you come from?

307
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,880
I came from the South District,
Ninghai City.

308
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,550
Bibo Garden, Changping Road.

309
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,640
Building C, D3.

310
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:33,840
A spy?
[*Sounds like a spy.]

311
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,920
Beat this spy to death!

312
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,000
Death?

313
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,310
Let him go.

314
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,110
Run!

315
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,000
He's getting away.

316
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,040
- Stop!
- After him!

317
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,950
After him!

318
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,070
They've got a fire lance.

319
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,960
Run!

320
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,070
Over there!

321
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,200
Stop!

322
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,070
Sorry to have frightened you, Ziyi.

323
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,510
But please believe me.

324
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,070
I will get you back safely.

325
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,750
Setting the time.

326
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,790
You're the worst.

327
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,790
Wait! This is a misunderstanding.

328
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,640
We're not bad people.

329
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,240
We wandered in by mistake.

330
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,200
What do you mean, by mistake?

331
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,240
Don't go!

332
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,550
Stay!

333
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,680
Sorry, sorry.

334
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,520
One more take.

335
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,400
After them!

336
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,310
Get them!

337
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,830
My condolences.

338
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,550
(Bronze Sword...)

339
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:10,420
(Days Pass and Months Go By)

340
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
(Yashe, Treasure Trove)

341
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,400
(Every era has its own rules.)

342
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,110
(Although I can travel
to any point in time,)

343
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,830
(once the rules are broken repeatedly,)

344
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,720
(disturbances to time
and space will occur.)

345
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,720
(I returned to that great fire
countless times.)

346
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,270
(Not only could I change nothing,)

347
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,440
(but it also caused anomalies
in the energy of these artifacts.)

348
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,830
(If left unchecked,)

349
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,960
(they would harm others,)

350
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,150
(and even)

351
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,270
(rewrite their fates.)

352
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,550
(Energy anomaly is neutralized.)

353
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,880
(Don't worry, Ziyi.)

354
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,550
(I'll retrieve all of them.)

355
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,880
What exactly happened last night?

356
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,740
(Chongle Pet Hospital)

357
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:19,000
(Chongle Pet Hospital)
Ziyi?

358
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:25,000
(Chongle Pet Hospital)

359
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,110
Chun Ge.

360
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,200
If we're really buddies,
switch shifts with me.

361
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,350
(Chun Ge)
Don't try to rip me off.

362
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,640
I'm serious. I'm not lying.

363
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,790
I drank too much yesterday.

364
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,720
I kept running around
in my dreams all night.

365
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,880
I woke up with leg cramps this morning.

366
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,640
You get leg cramps
from drinking too much?

367
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,550
Seriously.

368
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,750
I had strange dreams all night.

369
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,200
What are you doing?

370
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,310
Ziyi.

371
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,030
It really is you.

372
00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:57,022
Long time no see.

373
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,950
Buddy.

374
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,590
You've got the wrong person.

375
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,920
Why are you here?

376
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,400
I really don't know you.

377
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,720
It's me.

378
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,240
It's me!

379
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,240
Bizhi.

380
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,030
Bizhi?

381
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,240
Bi...

382
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,500
(Su Beilu)

383
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,880
Su Beilu?

384
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,070
You changed your name?

385
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,790
Why didn't you tell me last night?

386
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,760
Last night?

387
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,310
I remember now.

388
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,590
I saw you yesterday.

389
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,550
No wonder you looked so familiar.

390
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,960
I even took you home, didn't I?

391
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,920
Your place was pretty special.

392
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,790
I thought I'd never
see you again in this lifetime.

393
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,880
I never expected you,
like those artifacts,

394
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,000
to arrive at this time as well.

395
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,030
That's truly wonderful.

396
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,960
It's okay.

397
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,160
I'll tell you everything

398
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,400
that's happened over the years.

399
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,680
Let's leave this place first.

400
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,280
Okay.

401
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,720
Let's leave.

402
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,440
Manager, it's him.

403
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,510
Teach him a proper lesson.

404
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,720
Ziyi.

405
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,950
Pal.

406
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,750
This is a pet clinic.

407
00:31:13,822 --> 00:31:15,590
If you've got a pet,
you're welcome here.

408
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,670
But if you're here for trouble,
not on my watch.

409
00:31:21,622 --> 00:31:23,240
Take her over there to see Dr. Zhang.

410
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,550
Okay.

411
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,390
Next.

412
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,980
(Chongle Pet Hospital)

413
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,200
Hello.

414
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,320
I'm here for a consultation.

415
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,550
I have a pet.

416
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,510
Its name is Xuan Wu.

417
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,110
I'd like to see Dr. Su Beilu

418
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,480
for a private consultation.

419
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
Wait...

420
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,200
You're here to get a turtle checked?

421
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,040
That's right.

422
00:31:57,355 --> 00:31:58,720
What's wrong with your turtle?

423
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,400
It

424
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,920
isn't eating.

425
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,310
Ziyi.

426
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,480
There's no one else here now.

427
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,240
You can reconnect with me.

428
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,800
Mr. Bi,

429
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,400
I really am not that friend of yours.

430
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,640
My surname isn't Bi, Ziyi.

431
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,510
Have you forgotten even this?

432
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,310
Did something happen
when you were travelling

433
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,400
through time?

434
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,200
Memory loss, or something else?

435
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,040
I didn't.

436
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,270
There's nothing wrong with your turtle.

437
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,666
Not eating is probably

438
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:46,911
a stress response caused
by a change in the environment.

439
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,510
I'll have Dr. Tang

440
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,244
prescribe some vitamins for your turtle.

441
00:32:50,311 --> 00:32:51,800
It should improve after taking them.

442
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,400
You can wait outside now.

443
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,140
(Haidong Province, Ninghai)

444
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:05,760
What are you doing?

445
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,400
This place has all sorts of people.

446
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,480
You don't wish to draw attention.

447
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,400
I get it.

448
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,640
This is my address.

449
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,960
When you feel the timing is right,

450
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,200
come and find me anytime.

451
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,920
I'll take Xuan Wu and go first.

452
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,480
These past ten years,

453
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,160
I've always kept our friendship in mind.

454
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,550
That you're still alive

455
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,270
is already the greatest miracle.

456
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,480
I won't ask for anything more.

457
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,030
What a pity.

458
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,440
In the prime of his life,

459
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,780
yet mentally unbalanced.

460
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,460
(Yashe)

461
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,840
Sorry.

462
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,960
I only bought you back on a whim

463
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,710
because I needed to see my friend.

464
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,360
But you have to believe me.

465
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:12,550
I'm not someone
who abandons things halfway.

466
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,360
I'll treat you well.

467
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,880
(Fish-patterned Mirror
expires on March 16.)

468
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,230
(Time is limited.)

469
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:31,190
(It's best to retrieve it
as soon as possible.)

470
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,400
Yashe?

471
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,630
Quite a distinctive name.

472
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,920
You did come after all.

473
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,480
Of course, I did.

474
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,190
You forgot your medicine.

475
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,070
Thank you.

476
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,840
Do you know how to
give medicine to a turtle?

477
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,760
Want some help?

478
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,950
That'd be great.

479
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,240
Please, come in.

480
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,420
(Yashe)

481
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,360
Where's Xuan Wu?

482
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,760
You finally remember me.

483
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,070
Are you thinking of going back?

484
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,000
No. Where's Xuan Wu?

485
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,490
That's not important. It's over there.

486
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,390
I can immediately...

487
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,400
Xuan Wu.

488
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,030
I brought you medicine.

489
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,590
It's not there either.

490
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,520
Forget about Xuan Wu.

491
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,800
It's gone where it belongs.

492
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,320
You need to go back where you belong.

493
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,880
I'll send you back right now.

494
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,000
Okay. Let me tell you
how to give the turtle its medicine.

495
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,030
First is medicine number one.

496
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,030
Find a bowl about this big,

497
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,670
crush the medicine in it,

498
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,710
and mix it into its food.

499
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,760
See if it'll eat it.

500
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,480
If it doesn't,

501
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,030
use a bit of hot water

502
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,000
to dissolve it into a liquid.

503
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,280
See if it'll drink it.

504
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,800
If it still won't drink,

505
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,880
then you'll need
a thinner pair of chopsticks,

506
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,070
about this thin.

507
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,710
(So he really was just here
to deliver the medicine.)

508
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,350
Are you listening?

509
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,440
You don't remember anything,

510
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,390
do you?

511
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,200
I...

512
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,110
I remember.

513
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,920
We were both drunk last night.

514
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,550
I walked you to your doorstep.

515
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,360
I said I wouldn't come in,
but you insisted.

516
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,910
Then, I helped you over to this sofa.

517
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,630
When I opened my eyes again,
it was today.

518
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,630
Then, it was the pet hospital,

519
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,960
and then here.

520
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,400
Looks like you really forgot a lot.

521
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,630
But it's okay.

522
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,480
I'll help you remember.

523
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,470
I'll go first.

524
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,920
Dr. Su.

525
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,880
There's something I want to give you.

526
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,110
See if it helps you remember anything.

527
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,000
This is the feathered cup you gave me.

528
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,840
See if you can...

529
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,150
The important matter first.

530
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:22,020
(Yashe)

531
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:47,020

533
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,060
