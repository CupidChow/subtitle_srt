2
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:41,140
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,140
=Episode 22=

4
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,000
You're here again.

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,159
Beautiful flowers.

6
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:50,031
Zhao.

7
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,220
You're closing your stall, huh?

8
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:52,822
Yes.

9
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:55,630
Let's drink today
while our liquor remains.

10
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,272
Oh, my dear.

11
00:01:59,272 --> 00:02:00,471
Scholar Zhao.

12
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,231
Why is it you two again?

13
00:02:04,352 --> 00:02:05,471
Such bad luck.

14
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:07,391
What do you want?

15
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:08,591
Zhao Wanli,

16
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,471
they helped you pay off
your old liquor debt.

17
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:11,832
Shouldn't you thank them?

18
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:12,832
No need to be polite.

19
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:16,311
Who asked them to pay?

20
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:17,552
Serve the liquor.

21
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:20,152
There's no liquor for you today,
Scholar Zhao.

22
00:02:20,152 --> 00:02:20,751
That's right.

23
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,191
They've bought all of it.

24
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:23,191
Then you chat.

25
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:24,232
I'll be off.

26
00:02:24,232 --> 00:02:24,872
Thank you.

27
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:29,311
All sold out?

28
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,552
What exactly

29
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,071
do you want?

30
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:36,152
We just want...

31
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:37,751
All the liquor in this shop,

32
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:40,672
you can drink as much as you like.

33
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:44,311
But you must
answer a few questions first.

34
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,380
You want to ask about
the Autumn Twilight Painting, right?

35
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:49,872
Exactly.

36
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:51,952
I'd rather die than fall for your trick.

37
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:53,712
Worst case, I won't drink today.

38
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:55,392
Tomorrow, it'll be gone anyway.

39
00:02:57,112 --> 00:03:00,232
Tonight,
we'll move all this liquor away.

40
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:02,791
You'll never drink this kind again.

41
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,712
Right, Madam Ran?

42
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,791
It's a family recipe.

43
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:06,952
This is all that's left.

44
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:08,432
You bought all of it.

45
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:14,751
3,000 Drunken Tavern
really has good liquor.

46
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:21,631
Fine.

47
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,622
So that's how you want to play it?

48
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:24,392
Alright then.

49
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,888
You want to ask about
the Autumn Twilight Painting?

50
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:28,272
I have a condition, too.

51
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:30,591
One question per pot of liquor.

52
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:33,152
However much I drink,
you drink the same.

53
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:34,392
If one gets drunk, we all do.

54
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:35,791
Don't think about

55
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,511
pulling sneaky tricks once I'm drunk.

56
00:03:37,712 --> 00:03:39,191
Good liquor should be shared.

57
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:40,031
No problem.

58
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:40,631
Alright.

59
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:42,432
Wait.

60
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:43,952
How many pots can we even drink?

61
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,791
Each question counts.

62
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:47,152
Please.

63
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:48,751
Cheers!

64
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:55,989
First question.

65
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,444
Why did you copy so many
Autumn Twilight Painting paintings?

66
00:03:58,533 --> 00:03:59,733
What do you mean by "copy"?

67
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:02,031
I painted
the Autumn Twilight Painting myself.

68
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:04,552
I can paint as many as I want.

69
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,471
You're lying.

70
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,022
The Autumn Twilight Painting
was painted by Gu Zhiqian.

71
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:10,432
Speaking of Gu,

72
00:04:10,872 --> 00:04:13,872
he was my greatest confidant in life.

73
00:04:13,872 --> 00:04:15,031
Confidant?

74
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,071
You lived a hundred years apart.

75
00:04:17,232 --> 00:04:19,191
When he passed away,
you weren't even born.

76
00:04:19,352 --> 00:04:20,711
How could you be confidants?

77
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:21,631
That's because...

78
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,071
That's another question.

79
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:27,992
Another pot.

80
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,111
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

81
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:35,631
Go on.

82
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,266
How did you become confidants?

83
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:38,872
Gu and I

84
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:41,592
shared the same fate.

85
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:43,711
How many truly make the honor roll

86
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:46,151
in the imperial examination path?

87
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,631
So many scholars

88
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:49,792
waste away their years.

89
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,710
In the blink of an eye,
a lifetime is gone.

90
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:53,469
You're dodging the question.

91
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,244
That's basically saying nothing.

92
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:04,391
How could you understand my bond
with Gu?

93
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,022
True kindred spirits are hard to find.

94
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:12,071
To have one confidant in life is enough.

95
00:05:16,992 --> 00:05:17,592
Come.

96
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:18,792
To our confidant,

97
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,271
let's have another pot.

98
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:21,191
Alright.

99
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:21,992
Pour the liquor.

100
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:35,311
Scholar Zhao.

101
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:38,711
You

102
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:40,071
just tell us.

103
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:42,912
Where exactly did you hide

104
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:47,071
the Autumn Twilight Painting?

105
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:51,070
The Autumn Twilight Painting...

106
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:53,032
I'll tell you.

107
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,432
I'll tell you where it is.

108
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:00,071
It's in my heart.

109
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:04,191
You...

110
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:07,151
will never find
the Autumn Twilight Painting.

111
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:12,792
Gu.

112
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:16,071
You are

113
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:18,472
my whole life's

114
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,831
best confidant.

115
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:34,311
That's all?

116
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,992
Why did you stop halfway?

117
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:37,951
Get him up.

118
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,631
Keep drinking.

119
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:40,792
Get up.

120
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:42,992
Up!

121
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:46,151
Take him back.

122
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:46,872
Get up!

123
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:47,792
I haven't...

124
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:49,912
I haven't drunk.

125
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,032
I haven't had enough.

126
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:58,992
Gu...

127
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:03,672
- Liangzhu Silk.
- Liangzhu Silk.

128
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:13,232
Is my taste really that bad?

129
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,672
Why do I

130
00:07:14,672 --> 00:07:17,472
not see what's so good
about this painting?

131
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:21,232
Where's Autumn?

132
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,151
Give it to me!

133
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:24,511
Give it to me!

134
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:25,592
No.

135
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:27,951
Alright.

136
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:28,831
Name your price.

137
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:30,432
No matter how much, we'll buy it.

138
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:32,232
All this liquor is yours.

139
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,112
Enough nonsense.

140
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:35,631
The Autumn Twilight Painting is my life.

141
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:36,751
I'd die before selling it.

142
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,391
Yes.

143
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:38,032
Give it back!

144
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:39,511
Return it!

145
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:41,912
Or I'll smash this place up.

146
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:44,592
Return it!

147
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:46,112
Alright.

148
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:46,829
Get lost!

149
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,800
It's a misunderstanding!

150
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:48,555
A misunderstanding!

151
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:49,000
Get lost!

152
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:50,432
We'll leave.

153
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,472
Don't be impulsive!

154
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:53,831
A misunderstanding.

155
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:55,552
Out!

156
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,992
Scoundrels.

157
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:08,711
Gu.

158
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:11,592
Your painting wasn't lost.

159
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:13,432
It's still here.

160
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:21,352
I really didn't expect him
to be so stubborn.

161
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:25,511
This time, we found
the Autumn Twilight Painting.

162
00:08:26,232 --> 00:08:28,511
He must've memorized our faces.

163
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:30,672
So next time,

164
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,511
how are we supposed to take it?

165
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:35,712
Let's go back to Yashe first.

166
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:39,072
Why?

167
00:08:39,072 --> 00:08:40,031
I'm going to sleep.

168
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:41,952
You're not taking the painting?

169
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:44,044
There must be something strange
about this.

170
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:46,155
After we wake up,
we'll go find Gu Zhiqian.

171
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,440
(One Hundred Years Ago)
The Gu family was renowned in Gusu City,

172
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:53,288
rich beyond measure.

173
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:54,431
Gu Zhiqian

174
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:55,422
is young and carefree,

175
00:08:55,422 --> 00:08:56,444
handsome and debonair,

176
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,992
a classic spoiled noble.

177
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,422
A frequent visitor to brothels
and pleasure houses.

178
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:02,551
We're here.

179
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,488
(Gu Residence)
So this is the Gu Residence?

180
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,352
You really can't tell

181
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:10,791
that it was once so famous,

182
00:09:11,112 --> 00:09:12,271
and immensely wealthy.

183
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,352
Let's go in first.

184
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,232
It's actually quite large inside.

185
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:29,671
A rich household, after all.

186
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:56,271
This is

187
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:58,352
Gu Zhiqian?

188
00:09:58,592 --> 00:09:59,592
Seems like it.

189
00:10:00,872 --> 00:10:02,112
Something wrong?

190
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:05,271
He looks too destitute.

191
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:06,631
Then,

192
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:08,511
did we come to the wrong era?

193
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:11,992
Shouldn't be wrong.

194
00:10:15,312 --> 00:10:16,192
You know,

195
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:17,791
artists are always a bit unkempt.

196
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,230
Fantastic peaks and graceful trees,

197
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,155
sparse forests and distant islets,

198
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,151
autumn colors dye the layered woods.

199
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:34,992
The mood is vast, serene, and clear.

200
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:39,072
This is the true
Autumn Twilight Painting.

201
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:41,551
Since we've found it,

202
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:42,631
we'll take it with us.

203
00:10:43,832 --> 00:10:44,952
Isn't this still stealing?

204
00:10:47,592 --> 00:10:48,431
However,

205
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:50,431
his Autumn Twilight Painting

206
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:53,551
seems basically finished.

207
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:56,511
But why did Zhao Wanli's
only get half-painted?

208
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:00,271
Right.

209
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:02,751
Everything should

210
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:05,031
have a cause before the effect.

211
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:07,712
You can't have the effect
before the cause.

212
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:16,212
(Twelve Years Ago)

213
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:19,832
Alas.

214
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:21,192
Alas.

215
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,511
Where does sorrow come from?

216
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:25,312
This dancer

217
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:27,510
is the top courtesan
of the entertainment district.

218
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:30,031
And now she dances here
with all her might.

219
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,352
Gu doesn't paint beauties,

220
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:33,872
but landscapes instead.

221
00:11:34,112 --> 00:11:36,431
I mourn for the beauty.

222
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,050
(Gu Zhiqian)
Dancing beneath the willows

223
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:43,559
with the moon above,

224
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:46,232
singing beneath the
peach blossom fan wind.

225
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:49,472
This beauty

226
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:50,950
dances with the wind and moon.

227
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:52,712
And this wind and moon

228
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:53,992
belong to nature.

229
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:56,312
Within this nature,

230
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,312
she blends with the landscape.

231
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:01,270
Much better than being stuck at home
studying the Confucian classics,

232
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:02,592
or chasing arranged marriages.

233
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:05,511
The landscapes I paint

234
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:08,271
are beyond your understanding.

235
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:10,151
Indeed.

236
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,671
Our Young Master Gu

237
00:12:11,671 --> 00:12:12,872
is the most refined.

238
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:14,511
We, a bunch of coarse men,

239
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:17,992
are only concerned about how slender
the beauty's waist is,

240
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,271
and how red her lips are.

241
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:21,352
Come on.

242
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:22,192
Come on.

243
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:23,151
Fine.

244
00:12:23,472 --> 00:12:24,712
Today is my birthday.

245
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:25,431
Speak.

246
00:12:25,822 --> 00:12:26,888
What do you want to play?

247
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:27,630
Don't.

248
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,232
Precisely because today
is your birthday,

249
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:32,192
we should also be refined.

250
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:33,112
Gu,

251
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:34,431
in this moment,

252
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,511
why not compose a poem

253
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:37,791
to praise the beauty?

254
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:39,832
Good.

255
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:41,712
Bring the paper.

256
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:02,352
Done.

257
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:03,592
See how it is.

258
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:11,551
Dawn is hazy,

259
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:14,232
and the beauty just puts on a silk robe.

260
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:16,112
Her eyes slightly intoxicated,

261
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:18,592
her brows half-wet like green hills.

262
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:21,952
Her tiny waist resembles
a heart wounded by spring.

263
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:24,751
The heavy doors close,
delicate hands fatigued,

264
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:26,790
fearing the oriole's song
might shatter the moment.

265
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:29,472
Poor little young lady.

266
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:30,911
Beautiful lines.

267
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,312
- Beautiful lines.
- Great!

268
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:34,872
- Good.
- Good!

269
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,312
Hurry up.

270
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:40,511
Madam will arrive soon.

271
00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:41,551
Sneaking a taste again?

272
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:44,509
Since it's Young Master's birthday,

273
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,080
aren't these supposed to be his friends?

274
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:47,000
But it's actually them.

275
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,990
What nonsense are you talking about?

276
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,444
That is the Second Young Lady
of the Lin family of Gusu City.

277
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:52,671
Next to her is

278
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:54,872
the eldest unmarried niece
of the Wang family.

279
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:56,631
And the one at the back is

280
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:59,312
the eldest daughter of the newly moved
Shen family from Jinling.

281
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:01,112
In my opinion,

282
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:03,352
all the young ladies
from Gusu City prominent families

283
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:04,592
have been invited.

284
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:06,592
No wonder.

285
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:07,952
They said it's a birthday banquet,

286
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:08,829
but actually,

287
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,790
it's to select a young mistress
for Young Master.

288
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:11,952
Exactly.

289
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:14,511
If Young Master doesn't find
a young mistress soon,

290
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,631
he might end up being
devoured alive by you.

291
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:18,631
Yanwu!

292
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:19,712
Exactly.

293
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:21,072
Am I wrong?

294
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:24,751
Just wait.

295
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:28,030
Stop making a fuss.

296
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:28,631
Madam is here.

297
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:29,911
Why hasn't Young Master arrived?

298
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:31,791
Could he be oversleeping again?

299
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:33,352
Xingyu,

300
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:34,751
(Madam Gu)
quickly go fetch Young Master.

301
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,911
Please come in, everyone.

302
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:37,271
Why is it me again?

303
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,911
Stop dawdling.

304
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:38,750
Go quickly.

305
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,031
Got it.

306
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:50,431
- Madam.
- Madam.

307
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:55,391
Please all be seated.

308
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:00,391
So sumptuous.

309
00:15:00,592 --> 00:15:02,112
Madam, you've worked hard.

310
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,431
- Indeed.
- Yes.

311
00:15:04,832 --> 00:15:05,712
Where is Young Master?

312
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:07,631
Wasn't he supposed to arrive early?

313
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:08,872
Madam.

314
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:11,232
Young Master studied
until the middle of the night.

315
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:13,151
He's a bit tired today.

316
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:15,511
I asked Xingyu to fetch him.

317
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:16,832
Studied until midnight?

318
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:18,551
Is he all right?

319
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,800
(Master Gu)
Could he have caught a cold?

320
00:15:21,232 --> 00:15:24,352
This child doesn't know how
to take care of himself.

321
00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:25,472
Where's that rascal?

322
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:28,712
Master,

323
00:15:30,271 --> 00:15:32,192
Zhiqian stayed up late studying.

324
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:33,192
He'll be here soon.

325
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,031
Studying?

326
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:35,872
Don't mention studying.

327
00:15:35,872 --> 00:15:37,151
If you do, I'll be furious.

328
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:38,749
The tutor I hired for him

329
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,666
taught for over half a month
before realizing

330
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,844
that the student

331
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:43,488
was that rascal's servant.

332
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,472
Impossible.

333
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:46,592
Useless thing,

334
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:47,751
idling away every day.

335
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:49,511
He had his servant attend class for him.

336
00:15:49,631 --> 00:15:50,791
His essays make no sense.

337
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,551
He even learns the gossip
of the entertainment district.

338
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:55,069
Truly lazy and stupid.

339
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,377
A rotten tree can't be carved.

340
00:15:58,352 --> 00:15:58,872
Come.

341
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,911
Master, please calm down.

342
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:04,151
Even if Zhiqian has made
a grave mistake,

343
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:05,911
today is his birthday.

344
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:10,031
The young ladies present were personally
chosen by the palace consorts.

345
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:12,592
We must not show any discourtesy.

346
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:17,431
This child is really...

347
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:19,671
Something's wrong.

348
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:20,751
Something's wrong.

349
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:22,312
Madam, Master,

350
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:23,271
Young Master

351
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:24,391
is missing.

352
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:27,592
Missing?

353
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,000
Something's wrong, Young Master.

354
00:16:31,155 --> 00:16:31,830
Young Master.

355
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:32,472
What happened?

356
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,200
Young Master.

357
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,000
Something's wrong.

358
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,355
Master is coming from that side.

359
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,072
Why didn't you say so earlier?

360
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:39,431
Block that side, too!

361
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:43,232
You useless thing!

362
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:44,151
Stop right there!

363
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:46,791
This way.

364
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:49,631
Careful!

365
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:51,472
Careful!

366
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:54,472
Young Lady!

367
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,151
Young Master.

368
00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:56,992
Young Master.

369
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,266
(Dancer, Weiwei)
Thank you, Young Master.

370
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:06,191
No need to thank me.

371
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,200
It's my fault you fell
into the water today.

372
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,510
You useless thing!

373
00:17:10,422 --> 00:17:11,230
You useless thing!

374
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:11,832
Father!

375
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:12,792
Go back.

376
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:13,231
Your name?

377
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:13,911
Go back.

378
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,072
My name is Weiwei.

379
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:16,072
Young Lady Weiwei.

380
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:17,550
I'll come to you
to formally thank you one day.

381
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:18,951
You'll still want to thank her?

382
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,191
A dancer fell into the river,

383
00:17:21,191 --> 00:17:23,471
and you personally jumped in
to save her.

384
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:28,412
(Eternal)

385
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:41,671
Slowly. Be careful.

386
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,991
Step slowly and lightly.

387
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,072
- Close the door.
- And lock it.

388
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,112
Watch him carefully.

389
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:48,872
Why are you here?

390
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:50,431
Young Master.

391
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:52,991
We couldn't bear to see you
kneeling alone in punishment,

392
00:17:53,111 --> 00:17:54,990
so we came to celebrate your birthday
with you.

393
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,112
It's numbed.

394
00:17:58,112 --> 00:17:59,711
You are really good to me.

395
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,272
But

396
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:03,512
you still need to be careful.

397
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:05,272
Don't worry, Young Master.

398
00:18:05,272 --> 00:18:07,032
All the people outside are ours.

399
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:07,991
It's all arranged.

400
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:08,872
Rest assured.

401
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:10,991
That's good.

402
00:18:11,151 --> 00:18:13,671
My father told me to kneel
in punishment all night.

403
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:16,991
My knees are sore and aching,
but it's nothing serious.

404
00:18:17,752 --> 00:18:21,792
The main thing is that this long night
is truly boring.

405
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:24,711
I'm happy because you all came.

406
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:25,631
Of course.

407
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:27,072
Today is Young Master's birthday.

408
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,471
So we celebrate.

409
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:29,352
Tea.

410
00:18:29,352 --> 00:18:30,112
Liquor.

411
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:30,792
Noodles.

412
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:31,231
Flowers.

413
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:32,191
All are indispensable.

414
00:18:32,431 --> 00:18:33,312
Then let's

415
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,072
wish Young Master a long life.

416
00:18:35,112 --> 00:18:37,151
Bring back a fortunate young mistress
for us.

417
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,800
- Wish Young Master a long life.
- Wish Young Master a long life.

418
00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:42,231
Now the second gift, Young Master,

419
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:42,951
look!

420
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:43,631
What is this?

421
00:18:43,631 --> 00:18:44,512
Liquor has arrived.

422
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:46,112
It's still your favorite.

423
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:47,991
Only Fuxiang truly understands me.

424
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:50,951
- Happy birthday, Young Master.
- Happy birthday, Young Master.

425
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:56,711
Now the kitchen fire is out.

426
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:57,711
So,

427
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:01,431
we brought a substitute.

428
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,151
Young Master,

429
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:04,631
how about using this Xiangyun silk
to make noodles?

430
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,112
Elegant.

431
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,431
Truly elegant.

432
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:12,471
We already have the other three.

433
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:14,631
And the flowers?

434
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,022
- Already prepared for you.
- Already prepared for you.

435
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:26,872
Good!

436
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:28,792
Come, let's drink together.

437
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,752
- Happy birthday, Young Master.
- Happy birthday, Young Master.

438
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,312
Master.

439
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:44,191
Why are you still awake?

440
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:46,512
Did something happen?

441
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:47,911
Tomorrow,

442
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:49,951
I must go to the court.

443
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,112
Tomorrow?

444
00:19:51,872 --> 00:19:52,911
So urgent?

445
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:53,872
Yes.

446
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:56,832
The consort has important matters
to discuss with me.

447
00:19:59,352 --> 00:20:00,191
Just now,

448
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,133
you went to see that rebellious son.

449
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:04,832
Master,

450
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:07,151
Zhiqian is your son,

451
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,872
not a rebellious one.

452
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:11,951
He is kneeling right now.

453
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:13,431
Pitiful to see.

454
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:14,991
Spoiling a child is like killing him.

455
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:17,911
In history, Dou Yifang
spoiled King Liang.

456
00:20:18,512 --> 00:20:21,431
And Lv Zhi doted on King Huainan,
making him arrogant.

457
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:24,832
Even as a child,

458
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,312
he was overly spoiled.

459
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,352
Forming laziness and pride.

460
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,555
He's grown up, expecting him to change

461
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:32,231
is impossible.

462
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:34,552
Master,

463
00:20:34,752 --> 00:20:36,512
I understand what you mean.

464
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:38,431
Zhiqian knows his mistake.

465
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:39,752
He's reflecting now.

466
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:42,151
The new tutor will arrive tomorrow.

467
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:44,112
He will surely attend school obediently.

468
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:46,512
Don't let this anger harm your health.

469
00:20:46,671 --> 00:20:47,552
Come, sit.

470
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,072
Our household has misfortune.

471
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:56,272
Right now,

472
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:58,431
the court is in turmoil.

473
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:00,711
The consort is ill again.

474
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,552
We don't know how long
she can protect us.

475
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:05,690
Now the only hope

476
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,552
is for Zhiqian to succeed
in the imperial exams

477
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:09,191
and gain favor with His Majesty.

478
00:21:09,552 --> 00:21:12,711
As long as he memorizes the Four Books,

479
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:15,391
that is what matters most.

480
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:16,752
Yes.

481
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:20,072
I will remind him.

482
00:21:20,592 --> 00:21:22,112
Master, have some tea.

483
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:54,951
Tell me,

484
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,711
this sentimental Young Master

485
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:58,151
has been painting for hours.

486
00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:02,231
Young Lady Weiwei hasn't said
she's thirsty or hungry.

487
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:04,312
We'd better not disturb them.

488
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,288
Let's continue drinking our fine liquor.

489
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:08,151
Here.

490
00:22:08,512 --> 00:22:09,391
Young Master.

491
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,552
Young Master.

492
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:13,471
Something's wrong!

493
00:22:13,552 --> 00:22:14,229
What?

494
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,266
My father is here again?

495
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:15,911
On the way

496
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:17,709
to the capital,

497
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,866
Master Gu suddenly fell ill

498
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:20,466
and died.

499
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:32,832
Madam, take care of your health.

500
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:34,711
Mother.

501
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:37,272
- Young Master!
- Young Master!

502
00:22:37,352 --> 00:22:38,191
Mother.

503
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,512
How did father die?

504
00:22:42,312 --> 00:22:44,352
Wasn't father always healthy?

505
00:22:44,752 --> 00:22:45,631
How could this happen?

506
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,711
Perhaps someone didn't want
your father to enter the capital.

507
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:52,872
Zhiqian,

508
00:22:53,151 --> 00:22:54,711
your father is gone.

509
00:22:54,951 --> 00:22:57,391
The backbone of our family is gone.

510
00:22:58,552 --> 00:22:59,431
Right now,

511
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:03,431
the most important thing is
to protect the Gu family.

512
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:06,552
Within Gusu City,

513
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:08,512
there must be someone

514
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:12,391
who can safeguard us.

515
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:15,512
My child.

516
00:23:15,951 --> 00:23:16,752
Mother.

517
00:23:16,951 --> 00:23:20,552
Right now, we can only rely on you.

518
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:22,872
Mother,

519
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:26,352
I know what to do.

520
00:23:46,072 --> 00:23:48,431
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

521
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:57,252
(Lin Residence)

522
00:24:02,872 --> 00:24:03,592
Young Master Gu.

523
00:24:03,631 --> 00:24:05,512
My father and Master Lin
are close friends.

524
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:06,911
Could you help convey the message?

525
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:08,749
Master Lin is ill today.

526
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,533
He has instructed
that no one is to see him.

527
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:24,772
(Zhao Residence)

528
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:33,792
Is my aunt really not at home?

529
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:35,512
Yes, she really isn't.

530
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:37,352
Aunt,

531
00:24:37,752 --> 00:24:39,312
it's your nephew, Zhiqian.

532
00:25:25,644 --> 00:25:27,430
You must come more often from now on.

533
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:29,790
Young Master Gu.

534
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:30,552
Madam.

535
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:31,711
Madam Lizhu.

536
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:33,471
May I ask,

537
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,151
is Lin Zhaonan here?

538
00:25:35,872 --> 00:25:36,951
Young Master Lin?

539
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:38,352
He isn't here.

540
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:40,231
Then,

541
00:25:40,244 --> 00:25:41,910
what about Xu Bingwen and Fang Zhiyuan?

542
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:43,312
Not here either.

543
00:25:43,431 --> 00:25:44,592
I'll go in first.

544
00:25:53,231 --> 00:25:54,512
Madam Lizhu.

545
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:55,991
What tune is being played?

546
00:25:56,112 --> 00:25:56,991
I don't understand it.

547
00:25:57,231 --> 00:25:58,072
Change it.

548
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:00,910
Picky about words and phrases,

549
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:03,112
truly think oneself a scholar,

550
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:04,391
but really ridiculous.

551
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:06,911
Just like Gu Zhiqian.

552
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:07,389
Yes.

553
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,266
Comes to the pleasure quarter
to write poetry,

554
00:26:09,288 --> 00:26:11,750
as if everyone should know
he has many poems,

555
00:26:11,752 --> 00:26:13,312
and his library is complete.

556
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:14,991
What he writes isn't poetry,

557
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,951
it's nonsense.

558
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,991
Such a waste of
the Gu family's treasures.

559
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:19,911
Perhaps,

560
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:21,431
they'll all be confiscated.

561
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,512
Listen.

562
00:26:23,512 --> 00:26:25,312
He came to my house a few days ago,

563
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,311
and had the audacity to propose
to my cousin.

564
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:29,231
Luckily, my father turned him away.

565
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:30,631
I heard,

566
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:33,072
he went to all the prominent families
in Gusu City,

567
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:35,631
and no one would accept him
as a son-in-law.

568
00:26:37,688 --> 00:26:38,870
Uneducated and unskilled,

569
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:40,951
what use is good looks alone?

570
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:42,112
Exactly.

571
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:45,231
Come.

572
00:27:10,272 --> 00:27:11,669
Young Master,

573
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,400
it's been a while
since you last visited.

574
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,592
When will you finish the painting

575
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,032
you were making for me last time?

576
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:24,792
I promised to finish it for you.

577
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:27,151
And I will.

578
00:27:28,151 --> 00:27:29,151
But,

579
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:34,911
the painting isn't done,

580
00:27:36,911 --> 00:27:38,622
yet people and matters have changed.

581
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:45,352
Young Master Gu, I've heard about

582
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:47,533
what's been happening in your household.

583
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:51,431
I hope you take care of your health.

584
00:27:56,512 --> 00:27:58,072
Previously, in and out of the residence,

585
00:28:00,072 --> 00:28:01,991
everyone cared about my health.

586
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:04,711
Even a slight cough

587
00:28:05,272 --> 00:28:06,752
was a huge matter.

588
00:28:08,231 --> 00:28:10,072
But now, overnight,

589
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:14,872
people's hearts have changed.

590
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,711
I have seen it clearly now.

591
00:28:24,112 --> 00:28:25,431
I never studied.

592
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,733
I don't understand poetry.

593
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:31,112
Only knows that even calm rivers
have ripples.

594
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,072
I have long been accustomed

595
00:28:35,352 --> 00:28:37,512
to drifting like a small boat
on the water.

596
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:40,151
But now,

597
00:28:41,072 --> 00:28:43,711
after years drifting
in the pleasure quarters,

598
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:47,671
I have already grown weary of such days.

599
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:50,151
Life,

600
00:28:50,888 --> 00:28:53,430
always has a day when tired birds
return to the forest.

601
00:28:57,832 --> 00:28:58,671
Young Master Gu,

602
00:29:02,112 --> 00:29:03,671
if you don't mind,

603
00:29:04,592 --> 00:29:07,552
I've already prepared some money
to redeem myself.

604
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:10,032
From now on,

605
00:29:10,512 --> 00:29:12,191
I wish to leave the pleasure quarters

606
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:13,832
and serve you in daily life.

607
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:15,951
All I ask

608
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,431
is to stay by your side.

609
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:32,151
Weiwei,

610
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,431
I promise you.

611
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,090
I will bring you back to my residence
as soon as possible.

612
00:30:14,832 --> 00:30:16,592
Mother!

613
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:21,431
Mother!

614
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:30,191
Mother!

615
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:36,792
Mother!

616
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:42,252
(The entire family was executed
as a warning.)

617
00:30:42,276 --> 00:30:43,561
(Their property was confiscated)

618
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,133
(to supplement the national treasury.)

619
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:07,832
Weiwei.

620
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:09,872
Madam Lizhu.

621
00:31:10,191 --> 00:31:11,231
Why are you here?

622
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:15,032
It was Young Master Gu
who asked me to give this to you.

623
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:19,112
The Gu family has been executed.

624
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:25,951
I heard Young Master Gu was saved
by a consort with her life,

625
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:29,032
leaving him as the only descendant
of the Gu family.

626
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:31,112
Don't wait any longer.

627
00:31:52,532 --> 00:31:54,680
(Life is like floating duckweed,
unreliable to entrust.)

628
00:31:54,688 --> 00:31:56,333
(Hereby farewell, please do not worry.)

629
00:32:54,671 --> 00:32:55,792
Huang, you passed the exam.

630
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:56,911
Congratulations!

631
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:57,792
You're amazing.

632
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,991
Come, please, inside.

633
00:33:49,022 --> 00:33:49,550
Please, inside.

634
00:33:49,552 --> 00:33:50,312
Madam Lizhu.

635
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:51,191
Come often.

636
00:33:51,832 --> 00:33:52,671
Madam Lizhu.

637
00:33:54,552 --> 00:33:55,711
Young Master Gu,

638
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:56,671
what brings you here?

639
00:33:56,832 --> 00:33:57,671
May I ask,

640
00:33:58,072 --> 00:33:59,951
do you still remember Young Lady Weiwei?

641
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:01,431
How is she now?

642
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:02,312
She

643
00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:03,671
died long ago.

644
00:34:05,312 --> 00:34:06,552
How did she die?

645
00:34:08,071 --> 00:34:09,192
She drowned herself.

646
00:34:09,352 --> 00:34:11,071
I heard she was abandoned.

647
00:35:05,212 --> 00:35:11,572
(Gu Residence)

648
00:35:58,911 --> 00:36:00,071
(These paintings)

649
00:36:00,712 --> 00:36:02,591
(aren't of much use kept here.)

650
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:04,152
(Might as well)

651
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:06,192
(sell them.)

652
00:36:24,272 --> 00:36:24,872
This...

653
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:26,752
This...

654
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:28,752
Where did

655
00:36:30,031 --> 00:36:31,391
this wild goose come from?

656
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:34,632
I never painted it.

657
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:38,471
This...

658
00:36:40,312 --> 00:36:42,672
painting shouldn't have a wild goose.

659
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:02,431
Who are you two?

660
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:04,111
Sorry to bother you.

661
00:37:04,111 --> 00:37:05,150
Young Master Gu, sorry,

662
00:37:05,232 --> 00:37:06,712
we saw the door was open

663
00:37:06,752 --> 00:37:08,031
and didn't want to disturb you,

664
00:37:08,031 --> 00:37:09,111
so we waited here.

665
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,391
Didn't scare you, did we?

666
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,533
No need to call me "Young Master".

667
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,951
Call me "Scholar" instead.

668
00:37:18,632 --> 00:37:20,312
Why have you come here,

669
00:37:21,152 --> 00:37:22,312
gentlemen?

670
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,672
We heard you excel
in both calligraphy and painting,

671
00:37:26,752 --> 00:37:28,431
so we wish to request
a painting from you.

672
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:32,071
Excel in both calligraphy and painting?

673
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:36,792
May I ask

674
00:37:37,312 --> 00:37:39,391
where you heard such a rumor?

675
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:40,792
Coincidentally,

676
00:37:41,272 --> 00:37:42,551
almost all of my works

677
00:37:43,031 --> 00:37:44,672
have already been sold.

678
00:37:45,152 --> 00:37:45,991
Coincidentally,

679
00:37:46,071 --> 00:37:47,152
we want this one.

680
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:50,991
Sorry,

681
00:37:51,272 --> 00:37:52,272
this one is not for sale.

682
00:37:52,712 --> 00:37:53,471
Why?

683
00:37:53,752 --> 00:37:54,632
Money isn't the issue.

684
00:37:54,632 --> 00:37:56,152
Not for sale means not for sale.

685
00:37:58,272 --> 00:38:00,111
If you have no other business,

686
00:38:01,272 --> 00:38:02,511
please leave.

687
00:38:03,471 --> 00:38:04,752
I still need to study.

688
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,312
Scholars hate fate.

689
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:12,272
Many students have
gone forward tirelessly

690
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:14,792
just to earn honors one day.

691
00:38:15,272 --> 00:38:16,391
As a fellow scholar,

692
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,031
I understand the difficulty you face.

693
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:21,792
I hope

694
00:38:22,444 --> 00:38:24,150
you succeed in the imperial exam soon,

695
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,577
and fulfill your ambition.

696
00:38:26,232 --> 00:38:27,031
Farewell.

697
00:38:30,192 --> 00:38:30,991
Wait.

698
00:38:35,551 --> 00:38:36,672
Gentlemen.

699
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,622
Are you two scholars
who have come from afar

700
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:41,591
to take the imperial exam in Gusu City?

701
00:38:43,152 --> 00:38:44,792
Come from afar?

702
00:38:45,752 --> 00:38:46,872
You could say that.

703
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:49,133
Coming for the exam, of course.

704
00:38:49,272 --> 00:38:50,872
Since we are fellow scholars,

705
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:53,991
I see that it's already late today.

706
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:55,272
Gentlemen,

707
00:38:55,872 --> 00:38:57,551
if you don't mind my humble abode,

708
00:38:58,272 --> 00:38:59,632
you may stay here for the night.

709
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,933
You can prepare for the exam
together with me,

710
00:39:02,712 --> 00:39:03,832
and avoid

711
00:39:04,071 --> 00:39:05,511
the hardships of wind and rain.

712
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:07,431
We shall gladly accept.

713
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:08,071
Thank you.

714
00:39:20,431 --> 00:39:22,192
How long do we have to stay here?

715
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:26,312
Until he is willing to give us
the Autumn Twilight Painting.

716
00:39:31,192 --> 00:39:31,991
Young Master Gu.

717
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:33,591
Gentlemen,

718
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,272
now that you are settled,

719
00:39:35,511 --> 00:39:36,672
it's time to study.

720
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:38,352
Follow me.

721
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:49,152
I have fought three battles
and retreated three times.

722
00:39:51,111 --> 00:39:53,192
Uncle Bao did not consider me cowardly,

723
00:39:54,152 --> 00:39:55,911
knowing I have an elderly mother.

724
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,591
Young Master Gu.

725
00:39:57,591 --> 00:39:58,511
Your leg...

726
00:39:58,511 --> 00:39:59,312
It's fine.

727
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,391
Don't be distracted.

728
00:40:03,071 --> 00:40:04,391
Young Master corrects mistakes

729
00:40:05,991 --> 00:40:07,991
and summons the reluctant to death.

730
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:10,471
I was imprisoned and humiliated.

731
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:14,511
I would rather be imprisoned
and humiliated

732
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:17,752
than die under my lord's order

733
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:20,352
and serve as an enemy's tool.

734
00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:23,031
It is truly an unkind act.

735
00:40:24,951 --> 00:40:25,872
Yet,

736
00:40:26,832 --> 00:40:29,192
Uncle Bao did not consider it shameless,

737
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:31,832
and he only corrected the small faults.

738
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:32,752
He's talking himself?

739
00:40:32,752 --> 00:40:36,312
He felt ashamed if his achievements
were not known in the world.

740
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:40,232
Tell me, all scholars in the world,

741
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:44,152
who does not hope for fame
and recognition?

742
00:40:47,192 --> 00:40:48,152
Alas,

743
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:52,192
the heart is troubled.

744
00:40:53,832 --> 00:40:55,752
Like unwashed clothes,

745
00:40:57,312 --> 00:40:59,031
thinking quietly,

746
00:41:01,071 --> 00:41:02,471
I cannot soar.

747
00:41:04,471 --> 00:41:06,991
Luckily, Guan Zhong met Uncle Bao,

748
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:08,991
but I

749
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:11,911
did not spare the hardships of singers.

750
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:15,511
Sadly,

751
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:20,232
true friends of talent are rare.

752
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:25,511
How sorrowful.

753
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,471
Why are you crying?

754
00:41:27,672 --> 00:41:28,832
Are you alright?

755
00:41:28,911 --> 00:41:29,872
It's fine.

756
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:34,111
In books, there are houses of gold.

757
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:37,632
In books, there are measures of grain.

758
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:43,632
If a man fulfills his lifelong ambition,

759
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:46,711
he should diligently study
the Six Classics.

760
00:41:47,352 --> 00:41:48,189
Study by the window.

761
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,155
He's gotten completely obsessed
with studying.

762
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:51,911
Keep reading, then.

763
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,288
I can't take it anymore.

764
00:42:16,511 --> 00:42:17,832
If you don't sleep soon,

765
00:42:17,832 --> 00:42:19,511
he'll come again to urge you to study.

766
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,088
I've been listening to
his reading all day.

767
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:23,422
Before I graduated,

768
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:26,190
I had never studied this seriously.

769
00:42:26,591 --> 00:42:28,672
Burning the midnight oil,
rising at dawn.

770
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,312
This is the time for a man to study.

771
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,712
Don't waste your youth. Study early.

772
00:42:33,712 --> 00:42:34,511
Stop.

773
00:42:35,431 --> 00:42:36,629
Don't let him infect you.

774
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,955
I don't want to hear
another classical text today.

775
00:42:41,152 --> 00:42:42,152
Then come here first.

776
00:42:51,752 --> 00:42:53,312
Gu Zhiqian's paintings

777
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:55,951
are full of liveliness and energy.

778
00:42:56,471 --> 00:42:59,152
He must have been someone
who roamed freely

779
00:42:59,152 --> 00:43:00,471
among mountains and rivers.

780
00:43:01,632 --> 00:43:04,192
I don't know why he became
like this now.

781
00:43:04,991 --> 00:43:06,632
Then I also ask you,

782
00:43:06,632 --> 00:43:08,391
I am also lively and energetic.

783
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:09,632
If this continues,

784
00:43:10,111 --> 00:43:11,832
I'll end up just like him.

785
00:43:12,352 --> 00:43:13,832
If you don't want to study,

786
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:15,471
then go to sleep quickly.

787
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,071
I need to close the window,

788
00:43:17,312 --> 00:43:18,312
so he won't notice.

789
00:43:25,071 --> 00:43:26,632
It's strange.
