00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:40,860
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

3
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 15=

4
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,780
(Guangling Residence)

5
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,060
(Sun Zhixuan, Stepmadam of Guangling)

6
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,199
I already said I do not want to go.

7
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,919
Why must you force me to meet
that so called heir?

8
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,220
There is no need.

9
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,919
(Somehow,)

10
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,360
(the very first moment
I saw the Princess,)

11
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,919
(I felt)

12
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,719
(that there was some kind
of connection between us.)

13
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,400
(To confirm my suspicion,)

14
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,759
(I followed the carriage)

15
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,960
(to the restaurant.)

16
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,919
This way, please.

17
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,910
We look forward to serving you again.

18
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,199
This way, please.

19
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,719
Please come inside.

20
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,080
The honored guests
are not eating this duck.

21
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,390
You can split it among yourselves.

22
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,360
Young lady.

23
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:06,759
Young lady.

24
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,319
Such a fine duck.

25
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,280
Why throw it away?

26
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,039
The guests from Guangling Residence
will not eat it.

27
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,960
They said the Princess
has a cold constitution.

28
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,879
She cannot eat duck.

29
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,800
Otherwise, she will break out in rashes.

30
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,719
That steward even scolded me just now.

31
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
(That child)

32
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,919
(has the same cold constitution as I do.)

33
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,960
(As soon as she eats duck,)

34
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,599
(rashes break out all over her body.)

35
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,759
All these years,

36
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,360
there has been a question
weighing on my heart.

37
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
At last,

38
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,360
I found the maid

39
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,560
who once gave me
a bowl of water out of kindness.

40
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,560
I knelt outside her door.

41
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,599
Seeing how pitiful I was,

42
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,919
she finally told me the truth.

43
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,520
Back then,

44
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,520
my child did not die at all.

45
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,080
On the contrary,

46
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,000
the child was taken away by them

47
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,240
to replace the stillborn child

48
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,240
of the Madam of Guangling.

49
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,639
How is she?

50
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,680
She is fine.

51
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,839
She just passed out.

52
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,160
Look at this child.

53
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,680
Why bring him before me?

54
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,240
The child of the person
who killed my sister

55
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,720
has no place in this world.

56
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,399
Deal with it immediately.

57
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,879
Why do I hear a baby crying?

58
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,839
A child?

59
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,839
This is my wife's child and mine.

60
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,480
Master.

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,920
This child is not...

62
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,800
He is.

63
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,120
Give him to me.

64
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,879
He is my son.

65
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,560
He is still alive.

66
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,199
He is the flesh and blood
of my wife and me.

67
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,519
You speak rightly.

68
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,680
In that case,

69
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,399
I am willing to take my sister's place

70
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,759
and raise this child.

71
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,399
(After that,)

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,120
(I slowly learned the truth)

73
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,279
(of what had happened)

74
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,319
(during the years I was away from Lin'an.)

75
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,040
(It turned out that Xuan
became the stepmadam.)

76
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
(She later bore children of her own,)

77
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,439
(one of them being the Princess's uncle.)

78
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,560
As for my poor son,

79
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,160
he became an eyesore to her,

80
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,000
a thorn she could not tolerate.

81
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,600
Only a few years
after the old prince passed,

82
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,560
my young child

83
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,439
also died far too early.

84
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,959
Fortunately,

85
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,560
he left behind his only bloodline,

86
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,079
his one and only flesh and blood.

87
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,680
That child is you, Your Highness.

88
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,560
Come.

89
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,240
(Once I understood all of this,)

90
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,959
(I knew)

91
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,959
(that if the stepmadam
learned I was still alive,)

92
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,959
(I would surely not survive.)

93
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,680
(So)

94
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,000
(I could only pretend to be mute,)

95
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,800
(and earn a living by roasting tea
for Guangling Residence.)

96
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,000
(All I ever wanted)

97
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,319
(was the chance, now and then,)

98
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,920
(from far away,)

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,600
(to catch a glimpse)

100
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,279
(of my little Princess,)

101
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,319
my precious granddaughter.

102
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,839
So,

103
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,399
you are my grandmother.

104
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,360
All the tea I have drunk these years,

105
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,040
and the camellias by my desk,

106
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,920
they were all from you.

107
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,360
My child,

108
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,319
I have been useless.

109
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,959
I could do nothing for you.

110
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,959
All I could manage,

111
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,920
was to send you
one lovely bouquet each day.

112
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,959
Thank you.

113
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,480
If not for that
single bouquet of flowers,

114
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,279
I would never have held on this long.

115
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,199
Silly child,

116
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,600
it is I who should thank you.

117
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,120
If I had not seen you that day,

118
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,800
outside Guangling Residence,

119
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
I would have lost
all will to go on living.

120
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,639
You were the reason I stayed alive.

121
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,079
I told myself I had to live on.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,240
I had to live long enough

123
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,079
to see you grow up,

124
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,480
to see the day you married.

125
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,800
Only then would I die without regret.

126
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,559
But

127
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,720
I never imagined

128
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,159
they would treat you like this.

129
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,360
My child,

130
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,799
you must not go back.

131
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,360
You must never go back.

132
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,240
Never return there again.

133
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,039
Do you understand?

134
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,639
Grandmother.

135
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,159
Lan.

136
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,000
Lan.

137
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:51,480
Grandmother.

138
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Let Lan lie down first.

139
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,159
Grandmother.

140
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,279
Please step outside.

141
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,279
I just need to rest.

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,480
Just let me rest.

143
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,600
I will stay.

144
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,279
I will take care of her.

145
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,399
Come.

146
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,250
Grandmother, let me
tuck the blanket over you.

147
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,320
My...

148
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,799
My precious granddaughter.

149
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,320
Good.

150
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,000
Good.

151
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,159
I never imagined

152
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,799
we would witness Xia Zelan
in her final years.

153
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,279
Boss.

154
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,759
Please get up.

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,559
Get up.

156
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,360
I am begging you.

157
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,520
Let me stay with Lan a little longer.

158
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,919
The Kun Blade has already been found.

159
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,919
Lan has suffered far too much.

160
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,440
I cannot bear to leave her all alone.

161
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:49,960
Get up first.

162
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,200
That is right.

163
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,279
And Princess Yan Rong as well.

164
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,080
Neither of them is truly out of danger.

165
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,240
We cannot simply walk away.

166
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,279
Thank you.

167
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,679
You should go.

168
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,559
Take Yan Rong

169
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,799
and leave this place.

170
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,080
I am an old body, worn and sick.

171
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,399
Let me face whatever comes.

172
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,639
Do not worry about me.

173
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,440
Lan.

174
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,240
In one lifetime,

175
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,640
one must have something to hold on to.

176
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,720
If you know there is someone

177
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,360
whether you are together

178
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
or apart,

179
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,440
no matter what road you walk,

180
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,799
who never stops thinking of you,

181
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,879
then in this lifetime,

182
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,559
has one truly lived in vain?

183
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,039
Let us go that way.

184
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,399
I have lived here for so long,

185
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,879
yet I never knew

186
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,679
there was a place like this.

187
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,240
It feels so much like

188
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,080
the place where we
once lived for a long time.

189
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,300
It was called the River of Oblivion.

190
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,639
There was water,

191
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,320
there were flowers,

192
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,840
even the leaves were crimson red.

193
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,080
Along the horizon,

194
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,519
there was a band of sunset
that never seemed to fade.

195
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,120
Do you think this place

196
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,600
might be a dream?

197
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,879
Perhaps

198
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,159
it truly is a dream.

199
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,559
Lan.

200
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,679
The Lan you once were,

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,679
even when you knew we would part,

202
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,919
you always faced it with a smile.

203
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,840
People at Tianguang Market once told me

204
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,200
that every meeting there

205
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,399
was like a line of poetry.

206
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,519
A lamp gives birth to fire,

207
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,000
dust scatters
like a carp borne on the wind.

208
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:48,080
Yet you never agreed with that.

209
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,720
You said,

210
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,039
what binds us
through meeting and parting?

211
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,500
These Double Spring Buckle
worn around the wrist.

212
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,639
Union means coming together,

213
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,879
parting means being apart.

214
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,720
Whether together or separated,

215
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,799
with this pair of buckles,

216
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,240
to me,

217
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,519
it was a promise to grow old together.

218
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,960
If one day

219
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,519
I were to leave
Tianguang Market for good,

220
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,799
I would hope that at the very least,

221
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,120
I would not forget you.

222
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,879
If you do not forget me,

223
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,639
you will be left wondering,

224
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,100
you will be left longing.

225
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,390
Once obsession takes root,

226
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,799
the road ahead becomes hard to walk.

227
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,480
Feng.

228
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,000
Promise me this.

229
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,000
Even if one day we end up far apart,

230
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,960
and have other people by our sides,

231
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,240
as long as we once crossed paths
and walked together,

232
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,320
there will be no regrets.

233
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,590
This pair of Double Spring Buckles,

234
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,320
I made them especially for you
when I came here.

235
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,240
I

236
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,440
was wondering
if I could give them to you.

237
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,240
What binds us
through meeting and parting?

238
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:16,600
These Double Spring Buckle
worn around the wrist.

239
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,720
Sir, your medicine.

240
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,679
Thank you.

241
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:51,639
Let us go.

242
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,639
It seems Yan Rong was right.

243
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,919
The Guangling Residence
wields immense power.

244
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,500
Even if we get out
of the Guangling Residence,

245
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,879
with so many guards at the gates,

246
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,480
we still cannot leave the city.

247
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,119
In broad daylight, hiding like that

248
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,559
only makes you stand out more.

249
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,519
Put your hand down.

250
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,440
I am only doing this for everyone.

251
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,119
By the way,

252
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,279
tell me,

253
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,519
do you think Xia Zelan
will remember Lu Feng?

254
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,279
What do you think?

255
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,119
I do not know.

256
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,440
Before meeting Granny Xia,

257
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,440
I hoped she would remember.

258
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Even though we did not
stay long at Tianguang Market,

259
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,200
I could feel what lay between them.

260
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,359
I used to scold Lu Feng
for being unreliable,

261
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,960
but he truly changed.

262
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,839
If those who care for each other
can reunite, that is for the best.

263
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:46,880
It is just that...

264
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,480
Just that never expected Xia Zelan

265
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,839
to have endured so much on her own,

266
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,060
and to even have a granddaughter.

267
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:52,720
Right?

268
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,200
Grandmother. That is enough already.

269
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,319
Stop working and come eat.

270
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,640
Coming.

271
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,319
You are back.

272
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,079
Granny Xia.

273
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,400
What are you doing?

274
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,119
Come and eat.

275
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,079
Lan is much better today.

276
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,519
Do not just stand there. Come eat.

277
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,039
That is wonderful.

278
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,359
I am starving.

279
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,920
Come.

280
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:16,160
Come.

281
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,799
Sit down.

282
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,640
I do not have any fine ingredients here.

283
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,180
I just made do with what I had.

284
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:22,920
Eat more, all of you.

285
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,279
This is already very generous.

286
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:25,759
Here.

287
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:26,839
Eat.

288
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,079
Thank you, Grandmother.

289
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,960
You should eat more too.

290
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,440
Grandmother,

291
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,880
your cooking is truly wonderful.

292
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,039
Really?

293
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,279
That makes me very happy.

294
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,240
Take your time eating.

295
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,880
I will go get some seasoning.

296
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,839
Eat slowly.

297
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
I truly did not expect

298
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,799
Lan to be in such good spirits today,

299
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,240
and to prepare so many dishes.

300
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes.

301
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,680
This dish is cooked just right.

302
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,480
Yan Rong, try this.

303
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,359
Thank you.

304
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,039
If only we could eat
Grandmother's cooking every day.

305
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,559
Did Granny Xia spend the entire day?

306
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,160
Just to prepared this meal for us.

307
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,680
You eat first.

308
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,610
I will go check on her.

309
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,559
Lan.

310
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,440
Lan.

311
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:01,359
What is wrong?

312
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,079
Grandmother.

313
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,240
Grandmother.

314
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,680
Promise me.

315
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,559
You must,

316
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,279
no matter what,

317
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,880
take Rong,

318
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,599
and leave.

319
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,920
All right?

320
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
Grandmother.

321
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,000
I promise.

322
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:53,920
Why

323
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,319
did you leave before me?

324
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,559
It took me so long to get here.

325
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,559
I finally found you again.

326
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,799
And now you...

327
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,880
It is all right.

328
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,839
I

329
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,880
remember everything now.

330
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,279
At last...

331
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,440
At last...

332
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,440
I

333
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,960
met

334
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
you.

335
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,960
Grandmother.

336
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,519
Grandmother.

337
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,920
Lan.

338
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,240
Xuan.

339
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,519
Zhiyun.

340
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,440
Xuan.

341
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,880
Do not come closer.

342
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Do not come closer.

343
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,480
Stay back.

344
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,920
All these years,

345
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,400
you plotted against Master,

346
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,000
and countless concubines
and their children.

347
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,160
No.

348
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,079
I did not.

349
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:28,920
Zhixuan.

350
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,119
You were too greedy.

351
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,720
You ruined me,

352
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,839
and you ruined yourself as well.

353
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,000
I heard the authorities reopened
the Guangling Residence case.

354
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,839
Those concubines' children
were all killed by her.

355
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,680
She even murdered her own sister.

356
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,920
Serves her right.

357
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,599
Move it.

358
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,400
Right away.

359
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,290
Do not block the road.

360
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,079
What is happening up ahead?

361
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,200
Mr. Lei.

362
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,400
It is a peddler's cart.

363
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,400
Watch the rear.

364
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,359
- Yes.
- Yes.

365
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,519
You.

366
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,279
Get lost.

367
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,480
At once.

368
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:26,359
Stop.

369
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,960
What are you carrying in that cart?

370
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:31,519
Sir..

371
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,119
Just ordinary goods.

372
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,160
Ordinary goods?

373
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:46,559
Then why do you smell
of Western Regions incense?

374
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,599
I travel all over the land.

375
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,480
It is easy to pick up scents.

376
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,000
Look up.

377
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,480
It is you.

378
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:07,799
Stop him.

379
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,839
Stop him.

380
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:09,640
Hurry.

381
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,740
Proceed with the funeral as planned.

382
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,000
Do not delay the hour.

383
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:12,559
Yes.

384
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,759
Is Her Highness inside?

385
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,920
What Her Highness?

386
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,240
You are the one who abducted
Her Highness before.

387
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,359
You have the wrong person.

388
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,279
Do not move.

389
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,039
Take this back.

390
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,279
He will not wake up, will he?

391
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,640
Given his build,

392
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,780
that dose will keep him out
for a full day and night.

393
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:27,079
Still,

394
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,160
three of us against one man

395
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,519
does feel a little dishonorable.

396
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,000
This was far too dangerous.

397
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,000
It must not happen again.

398
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,240
Then the Princess

399
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,640
should have made it
out of the city safely, right?

400
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,500
(Lin'an City)

401
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,980
(Lin'an City)

402
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,740
(Yashe)

403
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,559
Boss,

404
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,319
thank you for letting me
see Lan one last time.

405
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,880
You also helped me recover
what I was looking for.

406
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,480
I owe you my thanks as well.

407
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,130
What do you plan to do next?

408
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,599
Now that Lan is gone,

409
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,640
what plans could I possibly have?

410
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,200
I will find a place

411
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,759
and live out the rest of my life
in quiet peace.

412
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,920
In her lifetime,

413
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,759
being able to see you again

414
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,519
means she surely left with no regrets.

415
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,680
Yes.

416
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,720
Life lasts only a few short decades.

417
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,200
To have shared a love so unforgettable
means the life was not lived in vain.

418
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,279
Do not worry.

419
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,120
About what happened this time,

420
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,240
I will not tell anyone.

421
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,839
Please take good care
of yourself, Mr. Lu.

422
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,279
Focus on your writing.

423
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,960
Produce more fine work.

424
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,480
Thank you.

425
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:16,359
Let's go.

426
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,279
Tuanzi must be
anxiously waiting at home.

427
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,720
Do you think there are really coincidences
in this world?

428
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,039
What do you mean?

429
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,119
We had just gotten news
about the Kun Blade,

430
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:38,519
and Lu Feng showed up right after.

431
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,799
How could that be such a coincidence?

432
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,799
Exactly.

433
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,519
It really is too perfect.

434
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,480
Yes, far too perfect.

435
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,920
Let me be honest with you.

436
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,400
About Lu Feng, actually...

437
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,799
Once a coincidence is explained,
it stops being one.

438
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,559
Luckily, nothing bad came of it.

439
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,700
I will just pretend I know nothing.

440
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,319
I think you have changed.

441
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:07,920
What?

442
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,920
You are not like you used to be.

443
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,640
Back then, you would never have agreed
to let Lu Feng go to the past with us.

444
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,950
You might even have sent him
straight to Tianguang Market.

445
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

446
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,790
I have no idea what you mean.

447
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,400
Look at you,

448
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,839
playing dumb now.

449
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,100
Did you learn that from me?

450
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,400
As if I need to.

451
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,440
No, really, you are much better
like this now.

452
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,000
You are witty and actually warmhearted.

453
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,920
If only you could raise my pay,
that would be perfect.

454
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,240
What?

455
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,400
I cannot hear you.

456
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,359
What are you doing?

457
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
What are you doing?

458
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:06,920
I am working out.

459
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,079
After what happened last time,
I finally understood something.

460
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,000
Without a strong body,

461
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,460
you cannot handle sudden dangers.

462
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:13,990
That is true.

463
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:16,440
Still, you should train more seriously.

464
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:18,839
Then what are you doing?

465
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,039
Me?

466
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,240
I am enjoying the wind.

467
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,559
Enjoying the wind?

468
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,680
What is there to enjoy about that?

469
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,759
Does the future not have wind?

470
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:35,759
It does.

471
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,160
But everything there is simulated.

472
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,519
Simulated?

473
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,440
So with a snap of the fingers,

474
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,400
you can make it snow,

475
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,279
rain,

476
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,359
or strike lightning?

477
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,480
Yes.

478
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,359
All of it is man-made.

479
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,400
That sounds impressive,

480
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,480
but if you live
in something unreal for too long,

481
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:58,799
you stop noticing
the value of what is real.

482
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,720
The scent of flowers,

483
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,200
the soft breeze,

484
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,759
falling leaves and gentle rain,

485
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,119
only when you truly feel them

486
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,319
do you realize how beautiful they are.

487
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,079
Recently, a villager uncovered
a pair of uniquely styled jade bracelets

488
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,000
while digging on his own homestead.

489
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,200
He immediately
contacted the authorities.

490
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,160
After experts examined the site

491
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,640
and made a preliminary assessment,

492
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,480
the bracelets were dated
to the Qinglong period.

493
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,559
As no large ancient tombs
were found nearby,

494
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,000
the identity of their original owner
remains unknown.

495
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,119
However, their craftsmanship
is extremely rare,

496
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,519
making this a first-ever discovery
in the area.

497
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,519
Experts believe the craftsmanship
behind this pair of jade bracelets

498
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,840
would have been nearly impossible

499
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,990
given the level of industrial technology
at the time.

500
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,440
They can only be described
as masterfully wrought,

501
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,590
with extraordinary ingenuity.

502
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,880
Some specialists further suggest

503
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,680
that the bracelets
appeared in this region

504
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,720
through long-distance commercial trade.

505
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,359
As for their exact place of origin,

506
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:02,920
experts will continue
with follow-up analysis and research.

507
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,359
Next, we bring you a brief update.

508
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:12,840
Lan.

509
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:53,920
Lan.

510
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,760
Have I been too fragile lately?

511
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,360
I keep drowning myself in drink.

512
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,719
I miss you so much.

513
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,760
You still remember me.

514
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:22,599
That is enough for me.

515
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,119
Since

516
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,880
you have already returned
to your own world,

517
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:32,039
you should live your life well.

518
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:40,760
But I…

519
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,719
Feng.

520
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,400
I have fulfilled my dream.

521
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,280
I became a chef.

522
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,119
In this lifetime,

523
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,920
I have no regrets.

524
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:54,920
And you?

525
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,079
Have you realized your own aspirations?

526
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,400
Promise me.

527
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:14,079
Live your life with sincerity,

528
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,440
all the way to the end,

529
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,280
just like I did.

530
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:36,239
Lan.

531
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,679
Promise me.

532
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,000
Live your life with sincerity,

533
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,519
all the way to the end,

534
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,199
just like I did.
