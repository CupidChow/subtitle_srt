(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

=Episode 5=

4
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,560
Once you start scrolling,
you can't stop.

5
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:52,680
(Top influencer Nana has recently been
revealed to have a new relationship.)

6
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,777
(So, she has been taken.)

7
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:54,600
Isn't that Lu Feng?

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,510
(This lucky man)

9
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,480
(is an artist named Lu Feng.)

10
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,480
(The two were photographed dining
together at a high-end restaurant.)

11
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,070
Wasn't that just now?

12
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,070
These paparazzi work fast.

13
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,640
(Lu Feng's sculpture exhibition
opens tomorrow.)

14
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:10,422
(He's really holding
an exhibition tomorrow.)

15
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,580
(Lu Feng)

16
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,530
Feng, the video
you had the paparazzi take

17
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,960
has hit a million views.

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,630
Did you settle the remaining payment?

19
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,244
I did. The non-disclosure agreement
has also been confirmed.

20
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
These paparazzi

21
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,120
charge a hefty sum.

22
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,800
They really think they're something.

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,710
As long as there's popularity,

24
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,080
everything's negotiable.

25
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,360
Feng,

26
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,080
you look pale.

27
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,520
Are you okay?

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,470
Same old problem.

29
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,240
Stomach pain.

30
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,750
You haven't eaten all day.

31
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,150
Want me to order porridge for you?

32
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,990
No need.

33
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,800
You head back first.

34
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
Oh, right.

35
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,360
The guy you added on WeChat just now...

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,511
Do you want to contact him?

37
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,590
Who?

38
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,190
The one outside the restaurant.

39
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,030
His surname is Su.

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,000
Ignore him.

41
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,080
Zhang.

42
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,000
Buy me some stomach medicine.

43
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,120
The liquor cabinet is empty, too.

44
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,030
Bring back two bottles of wine.

45
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,870
Okay.

46
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,260
(Huayang Media, Shiyan:
See you tomorrow, Feng.)

47
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,700
(Planner Bai: Thanks for the invite,
Feng. See you tomorrow.)

48
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,860
(Publicity Ruby: Coming to see
the big star tomorrow.)

49
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,700
(See you tomorrow.)

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,190
(Lu Feng)
It's all scandals about him.

51
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,360
Lu Feng used to be so sincere

52
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,310
and devoted.

53
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,960
Now he's turned into a playboy.

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,840
He let Lan down at Tianguang Market.

55
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,080
Fame and fortune

56
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,080
are an artist's greatest enemies.

57
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,120
His passion

58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,750
has probably faded long ago.

59
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,750
Bizhi.

60
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,520
What are we

61
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,080
looking for

62
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,680
this time?

63
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,680
Kunwu Blade.

64
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,430
It consists of
the Kun Blade and the Wu Blade.

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,680
We're after Lu Feng's Wu Blade
this time.

66
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,510
There's no news about the other one.

67
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,750
What do we do now?

68
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,860
(Lu Feng)

69
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,480
I knew you'd have a plan.

70
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,933
You said we were just looking around.

71
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:36,480
Why do you only have one ticket?

72
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,470
Where's mine?

73
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,000
I didn't buy one for you.

74
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,830
I'll buy it myself.

75
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,830
Phones are really convenient.

76
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,177
You can buy anything with them.

77
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,420
(Invitation)

78
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,800
E-ticket.

79
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,000
Eco-friendly.

80
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:56,750
Are you planning to go to
an art exhibition dressed like that?

81
00:04:58,682 --> 00:04:59,630
What's wrong with this?

82
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,520
Bizhi.

83
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,070
How do I look?

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,680
Presentable, right?

85
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,630
I think it looks pretty good.

86
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,560
I've never worn clothes like this.

87
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,950
They're so expensive.

88
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,390
Do we really have to buy them?

89
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,630
I already did.

90
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,710
Let's go.

91
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:31,830
I didn't take off the tags.

92
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,800
Can I return them later?

93
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,640
Yes.

94
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,510
Bizhi.

95
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,350
Have a nice day.

96
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,190
I look like a successful guy now.

97
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,630
I can fool Lu Feng, right?

98
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:42,555
(Custom Tailoring)
Just don't talk.

99
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,790
You!

100
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,440
Mr. Lu,

101
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,390
your current style

102
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,390
is very different from your early work.

103
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,000
Did you experience a change in life,

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,430
or did you compromise with the market?

105
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,040
François Millet once said

106
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,630
we should view ordinary things
with a noble heart

107
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,630
to give art its true power.

108
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,190
The issues of this world
are very complex.

109
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,680
I try to tell them

110
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,830
in a surreal way

111
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,733
and avoid rigid traditional thinking

112
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:15,480
without putting myself
in direct opposition.

113
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,510
Yes, you're right.

114
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,390
You applied to the national art academy
at twenty,

115
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,000
and it took you five years to get in.

116
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,600
What kept you going

117
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,800
during those five years?

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,240
Is five years really that long?

119
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:30,571
I think

120
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:33,651
time only adds to our anxiety.

121
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:37,091
It creates a sense of
fleeting emptiness.

122
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:40,241
So I turn those distractions

123
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,921
into images of life.

124
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:45,209
Thank you.

125
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,320
That concludes my interview.

126
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:47,381
Alright, let's wrap it up.

127
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:50,651
You're Xuan, right?

128
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:52,010
Let's add each other on WeChat.

129
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:52,851
Sure.

130
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:54,771
It's done.

131
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:55,971
If anything comes up,

132
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:57,481
you can contact me directly,

133
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:58,731
alright?

134
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:00,241
Feng.

135
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:03,171
Ms. Kaihua.

136
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:04,571
Big star.

137
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:07,531
I just got off the plane
and rushed over.

138
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:09,131
I was waiting for you.

139
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:10,211
I know.

140
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:11,361
You said you'd bring clients.

141
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:12,601
Don't forget.

142
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:13,891
Don't worry.

143
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:17,571
All your works are flawless.

144
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:20,481
I just bought a villa in the suburbs.

145
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,888
There's space on the second floor.

146
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:24,010
It's perfect for displaying your pieces.

147
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,088
That'd be my honor.

148
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,970
I'll personally pick some for you later.

149
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:28,811
Sure.

150
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,090
(Nana)
(Give me an explanation in three days.)

151
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:33,891
(Either we go public, or we're done.)

152
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:41,011
Ms. Kaihua, come.

153
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:43,041
This is my latest work.

154
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:43,891
Mr. Lu.

155
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,280
A client is waiting for you
in the tea room.

156
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:47,131
They'd like to meet you.

157
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:48,041
I'm busy right now.

158
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:50,241
They're a major client.

159
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:51,841
They bought several pieces,

160
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:53,481
including that one.

161
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:58,131
I'm so sorry.

162
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,331
The exhibition is really...

163
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:03,201
You two?

164
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:04,971
Mr. Lu, you're really busy,

165
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:06,281
yet you still remember us.

166
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:07,361
Impressive.

167
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,201
Please have a seat.

168
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,891
I wanted to contact this...

169
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:11,921
Su.

170
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:13,331
Mr. Su.

171
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:15,331
But you know how hectic

172
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:16,451
an exhibition can be.

173
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:17,651
I haven't slept all night.

174
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:18,841
I understand.

175
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:20,531
You're an experienced collector.

176
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:21,771
You must've run

177
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,691
a gallery before, right?

178
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,161
I wonder which one it is.

179
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:26,371
Rain Manor.

180
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:28,891
Rain Manor?

181
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:32,291
That estate is known for collecting
rare treasures from all over?

182
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:34,521
I knew Mr. Yu, the owner.

183
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,001
I suppose he passed away long ago.

184
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:41,291
My great-grandfather
was a close friend of his.

185
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:42,641
To be precise,

186
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:44,481
my great-grandfather

187
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:47,001
funded him.

188
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:02,291
I was too blind

189
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,571
not to recognize you.

190
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:05,241
I slighted you yesterday.

191
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:07,291
I'm not usually high-profile.

192
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:09,521
It's just that my young friend here

193
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:12,121
admires your work greatly,

194
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:13,521
so he seemed showy.

195
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,601
Please forgive us.
We're simply too eager to buy your work.

196
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:17,601
Not at all.

197
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:18,931
- This Mr...
- Su.

198
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,241
Mr. Su,

199
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:21,641
a pleasure to meet you.

200
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,211
You sure change your tune fast.

201
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,131
By the way,

202
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:30,361
our boss wants to buy
one more item from you.

203
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:32,411
Of course.

204
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:35,451
But most of the works on display today

205
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:37,601
have been sold.

206
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:39,481
There are some pieces not yet exhibited.

207
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,321
Zhang,

208
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:41,971
bring me my catalogue.

209
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:42,951
- Yes.
- Quick.

210
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:48,571
Please have a look.

211
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,641
Some pieces are quite remarkable.

212
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:54,121
A lady just bought four at once.

213
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,121
She said she'd place one

214
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:57,721
on each floor of her villa.

215
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,171
Really?

216
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:02,121
Mr. Lu, you're indeed
an outstanding artist.

217
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:03,451
Impressive.

218
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:05,091
I only want one thing.

219
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:06,841
A dagger.

220
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:09,571
Dagger?

221
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:11,291
I heard you're in possession of
the Wu Blade.

222
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,171
To be honest,

223
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:15,331
it belonged to
a deceased friend of mine.

224
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:16,931
If you sell it to me,

225
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:18,931
everything else is negotiable.

226
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:27,931
Wu Blade?

227
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:30,051
Are you reluctant to give it away,

228
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,361
or have you forgotten?

229
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:35,241
I believe I have one.

230
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,251
But my storage holds

231
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:38,121
many items.

232
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:40,121
Please give me some time

233
00:10:40,331 --> 00:10:41,479
to look for it.

234
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,111
Take the catalogue with you.

235
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:44,720
Look it over when you have time.

236
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,222
I have other matters to attend to.

237
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:47,450
I need to go.

238
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:48,291
Yes, go ahead.

239
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:49,721
Feel free to read it.

240
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:50,561
Please excuse me.

241
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:56,091
Money really does
make the world go around.

242
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:58,171
Did you see how fast his tune changed?

243
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:01,571
But was your great-grandfather

244
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:03,521
an investor in Rain Manor?

245
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:05,481
No.

246
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:08,571
You were lying?

247
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:11,481
I didn't lie.

248
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,881
I was an acquaintance of Mr. Yu.

249
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:35,521
Wu Blade?

250
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:38,001
I don't remember that at all.

251
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:46,831
(Nana: How are we responding
to the trending topic?)

252
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,591
(Sorry, I'm busy today.)

253
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:35,641
Next, let's welcome

254
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:38,601
young artist Lu Feng to the stage.

255
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:40,351
(Rising Art Awards of Huayang City)

256
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:48,911
(Rising Art Award, Lu Feng)

257
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:38,931
Sir,

258
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:40,481
please have a look.

259
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:42,451
Is this the one?

260
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:52,171
I believe

261
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:53,971
you can carve

262
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:56,121
your finest work with it.

263
00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:59,241
(Isn't this the blade Lan gave him?)

264
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:05,291
Name your price.

265
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:07,761
Sir,

266
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:09,171
you've supported me so much.

267
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:10,761
This Wu Blade

268
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,241
isn't worth much.

269
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,291
It's not valuable.

270
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:15,331
Consider it a gift.

271
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:17,211
Let's be friends.

272
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:21,971
I'll pay for the sculptures now.

273
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:23,481
Sir,

274
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:25,641
when I hold my next exhibition,

275
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:27,971
I hope you'll honor me
with your presence.

276
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:29,840
As for the Rain Manor Art Gallery

277
00:15:30,331 --> 00:15:31,451
you mentioned,

278
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:34,171
I also hope you can introduce me.

279
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:37,811
If my work could be exhibited
at Rain Manor,

280
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,971
it would be the greatest honor
of my life.

281
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,121
I hope you'll focus on creating

282
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,511
and keep distractions at bay.

283
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,931
Sir, this way, please.

284
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,091
How would you like to pay?

285
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:49,931
Cash.

286
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:52,930
Come with me to withdraw it.

287
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:53,851
Yes, sure.

288
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:58,091
Your boss really is

289
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,091
quite a character.

290
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:01,201
Su,

291
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,760
there's a great restaurant nearby.

292
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:05,521
I'll treat both of you
to dinner tonight.

293
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:07,571
I'll invite Nana as well.

294
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:08,601
You know her, right?

295
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:11,171
The influencer
with twenty million followers.

296
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,121
She can really sing.

297
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:15,361
Is Miss Nana your girlfriend?

298
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:26,211
I'm really disappointed in you, Lu Feng.

299
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:30,480
You lost your memories after
leaving Tianguang Market, that's fine.

300
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:32,481
You forget something, that's fine.

301
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:34,171
But how did your character

302
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:35,971
and your morals change, too?

303
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:38,761
Do you even see what you've become?

304
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:40,121
Snobbish.

305
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:41,051
Greedy.

306
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:42,601
A total playboy.

307
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:44,331
Do you think this is fair to Lan?

308
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:47,531
Lan?

309
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:49,011
Never mind.

310
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:52,811
You don't deserve Lan.

311
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,444
And you don't deserve
that Wu blade either.

312
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:57,081
Sir.

313
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:07,871
(Yashe)

314
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:15,651
You actually bought them?

315
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:17,210
What else could I do?

316
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:18,401
So,

317
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,281
what now?

318
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:22,451
We'll see.

319
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:27,791
(Frank and Upright)

320
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:31,001
Does money corrupt people?

321
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:32,721
It's not money that corrupts him.

322
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:34,890
It's because
he forgets his original intention.

323
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:38,244
That's why he drifted farther
and farther away from who he used to be.

324
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,931
He's someone irrelevant.

325
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:43,561
Why do you care so much about him?

326
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:46,411
Maybe because

327
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:49,411
more than ten years
have passed in real life.

328
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:51,281
But for me,

329
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:55,481
everything that happened in
Tianguang Market feels like yesterday.

330
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:57,721
He used to be so sincere,

331
00:17:58,281 --> 00:18:00,131
and now he's turned into a jerk.

332
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:02,241
I can't accept it.

333
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:05,651
Time travel can stir up emotions
like that.

334
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:07,080
But you must remember this.

335
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:09,521
We can't change their life paths.

336
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,850
And we shouldn't form emotional ties
with them either.

337
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:15,241
The piece here

338
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,411
is one of the key works

339
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:18,481
in my exhibition.

340
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:20,801
I want to show

341
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:24,171
a sense of realism and eeriness.

342
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,011
Feng.

343
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:26,849
Ms. Kaihua.

344
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,044
The interview isn't over yet.

345
00:18:28,088 --> 00:18:29,000
Why is he like this?

346
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:29,891
Come.

347
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:30,761
Let me introduce you.

348
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,321
This is Dean Wu
from the Fine Arts Academy.

349
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:35,651
Hello, Dean Wu.

350
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:36,971
You're truly young and talented.

351
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:37,931
Thank you.

352
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:39,971
This is an investor, Mr. Tao.

353
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:41,170
Mr. Tao. We know each other.

354
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:42,691
We have each other's contact.
In the flesh, finally.

355
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:43,481
You're impressive.

356
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:44,321
Thank you.

357
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:46,801
Let me introduce

358
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,129
my new works to everyone today.

359
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,400
Alright. Let's take a look.

360
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,031
(Nana calling)

361
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,040
- Come.
- So beautiful.

362
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:57,041
This is very different

363
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,801
from my usual work.

364
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:03,081
- From its height to the materials.
- Isn't that Lu Feng?

365
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:05,371
- We can see the overall style
- That's him, right?

366
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:06,281
is...

367
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:07,761
Check your phone.

368
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:08,721
Lu Feng is trending.

369
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:10,521
Besides, it makes everyone...

370
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:15,361
What's wrong, Ms. Kaihua?

371
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:23,671
(Trending Topic)

372
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:27,161
Ms. Kaihua,

373
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:29,561
about this...

374
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:30,971
Quick. Interview him.

375
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:32,211
- He's right there.
- Sir.

376
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:34,521
Mr. Lu Feng, could you respond

377
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:35,691
to the news?

378
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:36,761
Can you explain it?

379
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:37,721
Mr. Lu Feng,

380
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:39,131
could you explain this?

381
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:41,371
Was this a publicity stunt
from the agency?

382
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:42,831
Did you know about this beforehand?

383
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:44,211
Ms. Kaihua.

384
00:19:45,371 --> 00:19:46,761
Please respond directly.

385
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,321
(Well, this famous artist, Lu.)

386
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:05,281
(Before the night of his exhibition...)

387
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:06,891
Oh no.

388
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,488
(He happened to have dinner with Nana)

389
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:10,040
(and happened to get photographed
by paparazzi.)

390
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,411
Your sculptures
won't be able to sell now.

391
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,561
(How do so many things
coincidentally line up?)

392
00:20:15,411 --> 00:20:17,371
Do these bloggers ever sleep?

393
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:18,651
(Another woman has come forward)

394
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:22,131
(and claimed that while dating Lu,)

395
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:23,761
(he constantly asked her)

396
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,266
(to use her PR position
to arrange interviews)

397
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:28,690
(and magazine features for him.)

398
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:30,281
(She later found out)

399
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,200
(that when he said
he was on a business trip,)

400
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,131
(he was actually)

401
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,041
(traveling with a female CEO
from a major corporation.)

402
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,241
(Oh, heavens.)

403
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:39,555
(This kind of shamelessness
is on another level.)

404
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,429
(Nana, I miss you.
Please reply. I'm having a hard time.)

405
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,266
(I'm sorry, Nana.)

406
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:53,820
(Nana has enabled friend verification.
You're no longer her friend.)

407
00:20:58,551 --> 00:20:59,671
(Ms. Kaihua)

408
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:05,141
Hello?

409
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,771
Ms. Kaihua,

410
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:07,771
I...

411
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:23,101
Lu Feng?

412
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:24,891
Is that Lu Feng?

413
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:28,121
Lu Feng's here!

414
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:29,531
It's him! Take the picture!

415
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:30,371
Expose him!

416
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,466
(Fried Rice Noodles,
Fried Noodles, Fried Rice)

417
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:01,080
Young man, how much did you drink?

418
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:03,081
Grab a bite before you go.

419
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:13,371
One fried rice with egg, please.

420
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:14,211
Sure thing.

421
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,560
Here's your fried rice.

422
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:27,011
The soup's free.

423
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,060
(Year 2009)

424
00:24:17,131 --> 00:24:17,971
Give me more.

425
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,131
Sure.

426
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:20,761
Lan, your fried rice is the best.

427
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:22,129
Here, a spoon. Enjoy.

428
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,577
I'll come again next time, Lan.

429
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:34,251
Excuse me.

430
00:24:34,481 --> 00:24:35,721
Where is this place?

431
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:38,011
You just got here?

432
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:40,610
This place is called Tianguang Market.

433
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:42,891
Just think of it as a hidden paradise.

434
00:24:44,131 --> 00:24:45,891
Tianguang Market?

435
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:49,281
How do I get out?

436
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:51,171
You can't.

437
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:52,451
Why not?

438
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:54,971
You've seen it yourself.

439
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:57,466
People from different dynasties
wander in here all the time.

440
00:24:57,561 --> 00:24:59,041
It's easy to enter, but hard to leave.

441
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:00,411
Not just you,

442
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:02,081
even I don't know
when I'll be able to go.

443
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,520
What am I supposed to do?

444
00:25:08,171 --> 00:25:10,521
Did you come here through thick fog?

445
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:12,651
They say when the fog appears,

446
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:13,891
some people enter,

447
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:15,001
and some can leave.

448
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:16,041
You can try your luck.

449
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:19,891
Where's the fog?

450
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:20,969
Go straight ahead.

451
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,390
There's a river called
the River of Oblivion. Go take a look.

452
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:26,051
Thank you.

453
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:39,881
Stop.

454
00:25:40,177 --> 00:25:41,488
Please let me get on the raft.

455
00:25:41,521 --> 00:25:42,211
Someone told me

456
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:43,721
that if I enter the fog, I can leave.

457
00:25:43,721 --> 00:25:44,561
Please let me pass.

458
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:46,131
When the fog rises,

459
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:47,851
someone will leave.

460
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:49,851
But you're not that person.

461
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,211
Why not me?

462
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:53,561
That choice isn't yours.

463
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:54,531
I don't believe you.

464
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:56,481
Take me into the fog.

465
00:25:56,691 --> 00:26:00,481
Only the guests of Luoxia Manor
can use the raft.

466
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:03,081
Hold up.

467
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:05,211
The water is hundreds of meters deep.

468
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:06,761
You could lose your life.

469
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:08,721
You should leave.

470
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:24,731
You're back.

471
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:27,691
Are you hungry?

472
00:26:43,721 --> 00:26:45,051
Here, eat while it's hot.

473
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:47,290
Do you want some chili?

474
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:48,451
No chili.

475
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:49,971
- Scallions?
- No.

476
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:58,731
I...

477
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:00,171
don't have any money.

478
00:27:00,761 --> 00:27:01,611
That's fine.

479
00:27:01,611 --> 00:27:02,931
We don't use money here.

480
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:03,891
We trade goods.

481
00:27:10,851 --> 00:27:11,691
What is this?

482
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:13,001
I'm a student.

483
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:14,321
These are the only things

484
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:15,691
I have.

485
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:16,760
You can pay it back later.

486
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:19,039
You won't be leaving
anytime soon anyway.

487
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,333
You can pay it back slowly.

488
00:27:20,561 --> 00:27:21,401
Thank you.

489
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:36,211
Eat slowly.

490
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:54,691
How long

491
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:55,971
have you been here?

492
00:27:57,451 --> 00:27:59,481
There's no day or night here.

493
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:00,561
I've lost track of time.

494
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:02,851
Aren't you anxious?

495
00:28:03,622 --> 00:28:05,560
I need to go back
and prepare for the exam.

496
00:28:05,891 --> 00:28:08,281
If I miss it,
I'll have to wait another year.

497
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:09,890
It's no use being anxious.

498
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:13,081
You should think about how
to make a living in Tianguang Market.

499
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:15,931
Making a living?

500
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:18,451
I'm just a student.

501
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,080
How am I supposed to do that?

502
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:24,971
Are you alright?

503
00:28:25,611 --> 00:28:26,481
I'm fine.

504
00:28:26,891 --> 00:28:27,999
This cleaver isn't sturdy.

505
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,355
The handle keeps falling off.

506
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:31,931
Can I take a look?

507
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:42,521
The joint doesn't fit.

508
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:43,930
Do you have a small knife?

509
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:44,771
A small knife?

510
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:50,121
Can this work?

511
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:53,081
Yes.

512
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:06,611
This dagger is pretty good.

513
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:07,971
Of course.

514
00:29:08,044 --> 00:29:10,450
This Kunwu Blade is a family heirloom
from my mother's side.

515
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,644
It's forged from Xuan iron.

516
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:13,481
It stays sharp without sharpening.

517
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:14,491
It's amazing, right?

518
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:18,191
- Done.
- Done?

519
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:22,411
I didn't expect

520
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:23,451
you to be a carpenter.

521
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:25,891
I'm majoring

522
00:29:26,211 --> 00:29:28,321
in sculpture,
that's what we call it where I'm from.

523
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:29,161
Sculpture?

524
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:30,851
What's that?

525
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:36,889
Well...

526
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:37,977
There's this wooden figure.

527
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:41,131
You cover it with clay.

528
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:42,521
After that,

529
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:44,241
carve it into a finished piece

530
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:47,081
with a knife.

531
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:50,121
How about this?

532
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,422
Do you have paper and a brush?

533
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,691
Yes.

534
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:53,531
I need them.

535
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:56,131
Will this do?

536
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:57,531
Let me see.

537
00:29:58,241 --> 00:29:59,081
Yes.

538
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:20,771
Good.

539
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:23,691
What's this?

540
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:24,731
This is you.

541
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:26,561
- Me?
- Yes.

542
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:28,171
I've never seen a drawing

543
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:29,651
like this.

544
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:31,001
In our world,

545
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:33,211
art focuses on perspective,
three-dimensionality,

546
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:34,451
and light and shadow.

547
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:36,721
Perspective and three dimensions?

548
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:39,411
But...

549
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:42,651
I'm not very talented.

550
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:43,970
I don't draw that well.

551
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:45,691
You draw very well.

552
00:30:46,155 --> 00:30:47,410
And you're good with your hands.

553
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:49,321
In my time,

554
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:51,451
the best painters
might not match your skill.

555
00:30:51,801 --> 00:30:53,001
Don't underestimate yourself.

556
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,800
At least you won't go hungry
in Tianguang Market.

557
00:30:56,971 --> 00:30:58,931
If I know you, I won't starve.

558
00:30:59,411 --> 00:31:00,611
Your fried rice

559
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:02,721
is the best thing I've eaten so far.

560
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:05,451
That's because you're hungry.

561
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:07,851
Still,

562
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:11,281
I should find some work.

563
00:31:11,451 --> 00:31:14,081
I can't keep eating on credit.

564
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:16,281
No rush.

565
00:31:16,281 --> 00:31:17,131
Take your time.

566
00:31:17,131 --> 00:31:18,481
You'll find something.

567
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:23,081
Miss.

568
00:31:23,611 --> 00:31:24,521
One fried egg.

569
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:25,361
Sure.

570
00:31:25,521 --> 00:31:26,361
You eat first.

571
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:32,281
Same as usual. More scallions and chili?

572
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,121
Right.

573
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:46,591
(I Fix Everything)

574
00:31:46,611 --> 00:31:47,451
Lan.

575
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:01,451
Can you fix this box?

576
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:04,811
It's broken here.

577
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:05,999
I can fix it.

578
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,155
I'll give you these vegetables.

579
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:08,001
Sure.

580
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:09,481
I'll bring it over once it's done.

581
00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:10,321
Sure. Thank you.

582
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:11,291
You're welcome.

583
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:15,841
Lan.

584
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:28,841
Can I

585
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:32,801
still have your fried rice today?

586
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:35,451
Yes.

587
00:32:38,977 --> 00:32:40,666
I'll bring it to you once it's ready.

588
00:33:38,971 --> 00:33:39,811
What is this?

589
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:44,801
Why are you making this?

590
00:33:47,761 --> 00:33:48,891
I don't know

591
00:33:49,171 --> 00:33:50,481
when I'll be able to leave.

592
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:52,281
Since I have time now,

593
00:33:52,721 --> 00:33:54,691
I thought I'd practice a bit.

594
00:33:56,171 --> 00:33:57,171
Once I get out,

595
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:00,761
I don't plan to study this anymore.

596
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:05,881
Why?

597
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:07,971
I've taken the exam so many times,

598
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:10,251
and never got into the university
I wanted.

599
00:34:11,681 --> 00:34:12,561
That means

600
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,971
I just don't have talent for it.

601
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:17,411
I'll find any job after I leave.

602
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:19,121
I guess

603
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:20,481
my life will be like that.

604
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:24,681
But you've put in so much effort.

605
00:34:25,561 --> 00:34:26,771
Isn't it a pity

606
00:34:27,121 --> 00:34:28,201
to give up now?

607
00:34:28,411 --> 00:34:29,641
It's not that much.

608
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,666
Just a few years of exams.

609
00:34:41,971 --> 00:34:42,971
If I were you,

610
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:44,931
I'd try again.

611
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:50,851
A few years may seem long,

612
00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:53,291
but in a lifetime,

613
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:54,601
it's not that much.

614
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:57,601
Instead of giving up,

615
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:59,161
why not give it a try?

616
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:00,890
That way, you won't regret it later.

617
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:17,331
You only spent a few years.

618
00:35:18,622 --> 00:35:20,080
My mother spent her entire lifetime

619
00:35:20,971 --> 00:35:22,371
for me.

620
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:32,521
Lan,

621
00:35:33,251 --> 00:35:35,561
you've never told me about your past.

622
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:42,971
My family were cooks for generations,

623
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:46,731
but my mother didn't want me
to spend my life in taverns.

624
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,000
She hoped I could enter
a royal residence

625
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:51,081
and become the head chef.

626
00:35:53,771 --> 00:35:55,201
To send me a royal residence,

627
00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:57,851
she spent all her savings,

628
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:01,001
only to fall ill from overwork

629
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:04,521
and pass away.

630
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:09,201
And yet,

631
00:36:10,161 --> 00:36:11,331
I still disappointed her.

632
00:36:12,177 --> 00:36:14,755
I finally entered a royal residence,
but only stayed a few days.

633
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:17,561
I got lost in the back mountain.

634
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:19,291
I walked into thick fog

635
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:20,971
and ended up here.

636
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,971
I don't know
when I'll be able to go back.

637
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:34,001
Lan,

638
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:36,371
if you wish to leave,

639
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:37,931
I'll help you.

640
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,681
If you wish to stay,

641
00:36:43,121 --> 00:36:44,291
I'll stay with you.

642
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:47,731
If you get out,

643
00:36:49,371 --> 00:36:50,641
I'll leave with you.

644
00:37:26,081 --> 00:37:27,291
We'll steal a raft,

645
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:29,370
row into the fog
in the middle of the river,

646
00:37:29,371 --> 00:37:30,681
and then we can leave.

647
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:34,291
But there are guards on the raft.

648
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:41,161
This is a nice place.

649
00:37:41,244 --> 00:37:43,066
- Follow me.
- I don't know if I'll come back.

650
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:44,244
Let me take one more look.

651
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:46,851
What's wrong, young man?

652
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:48,041
What happened?

653
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:49,041
Don't scare me.

654
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:50,041
Call an ambulance now.

655
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:51,091
(I remember now.)

656
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:52,481
(He's Lu Feng!)

657
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,450
(The patient has a perforated stomach
and is unconscious.)

658
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,777
(Dr. Xu is preparing for surgery.)

659
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:01,970
(What's the blood pressure?)

660
00:38:01,971 --> 00:38:03,041
(Eighty over forty-seven.)

661
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:03,891
(Blood oxygen is sixty.)

662
00:38:03,891 --> 00:38:04,731
(Notify anesthesia.)

663
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:05,731
(Okay.)

664
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:10,971
Is there no other way?

665
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:14,641
All we can do is treat every moment

666
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:17,081
as if it were the last.

667
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:28,001
I'm sorry.

668
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:32,081
I couldn't take you out.

669
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:35,561
It's fine.

670
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:52,022
If you've grown attached to this place,

671
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:55,331
you'll forget the sharp knife
from Bingzhou,

672
00:38:55,971 --> 00:38:57,331
and the white salt from Wu.

673
00:39:00,331 --> 00:39:02,081
If you remain lost in sleep,

674
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:06,601
all that awaits
is withered spring blossoms

675
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:08,811
and desolation.

Has Lu Feng found his conscience?

680

(Donates All Assets to Charity)
He's giving everything away

681
00:40:26,482 --> 00:40:28,333
and plans to focus on creating
from now on.

682
00:40:28,355 --> 00:40:31,250
Perhaps it's because Kunwu Blade
can sense one another.

683
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:33,810
When Lu Feng came into contact
with the Wu Blade again,

684
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:36,331
all the past memories came back.

685
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:37,481
That's only natural.

686
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:42,291
But even if he remembers,

687
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:44,291
he can't change what already happened.

688
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:46,481
Maybe it's better to forget.

689
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:53,411
