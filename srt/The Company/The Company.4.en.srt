(Chongle Pet Hospital)

5
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Morning, Min.

6
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,200
You're here.

7
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,070
Give it to me.

8
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:50,990
Let's go.

9
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,600
- Morning, Chun Ge.
- Morning.

(Comprehensive Canine

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,040
(I need to understand his life better)

12
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,920
(to know whether he truly is Ziyi.)

13
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,180
(On-duty Consultation Room)

14
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,311
A urinary tract infection,

15
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:13,590
but it's not very serious.

16
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,430
Su Beilu.

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,400
Xiaomi weighs eight jin.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,710
How many grams of nitrofurantoin
should be given per dose?

19
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,360
Eight jin is four kilograms.

20
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,870
Nitrofurantoin per kilogram...

21
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,120
Per...

22
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,240
Sixteen milligrams per dose.

23
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,710
Right.

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,360
Three times a day.

25
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:38,590
Go get the prescription.

26
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,680
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Tang.

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,560
You're welcome.

28
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,120
You can't even
answer something this basic?

29
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:47,590
No wonder it's been three years

30
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,380
and you still haven't
gotten the vet license.

31
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,750
Jenny,

32
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,360
could you give me a few more days?

33
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,150
What?

34
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,430
Selling the place?

35
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:57,910
(Staff Lounge)
That won't work.

36
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,000
Where am I supposed to live?

37
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,000
(It seems his life isn't
going too well.)

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,240
We should at least respect the contract.

39
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,080
You were the one who had me sign
for three years back then.

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,190
You can't be

41
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,800
changing your mind at the last minute.

42
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,800
What's going on? Why are you so mad?

43
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,733
Who are you yelling at?

44
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,520
Look at the lighting.

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
Great airflow and ventilation.

46
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,240
Take a look. Feel free.

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,960
(This place is so cramped and narrow.)

48
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,430
(I never imagined his life
would be this rough.)

49
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,240
The young man living here
is a top student.

50
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,750
A doctor at a top-tier hospital.

51
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:42,630
The longer he stays,
the more energetic he gets.

52
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,560
He even got himself
a girlfriend recently.

53
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,630
Really?

54
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,470
Yeah.

55
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,840
Look.

56
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,150
(There are none
of the items Ziyi usually uses.)

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,680
(Nor any token
that could prove his identity.)

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
(Did he come from another time?)

59
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,430
(There's no telling.)

60
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,800
Give me a call once you've decided.

61
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,840
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

62
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:02,550
Hey, stop right there.

63
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,680
Who are you?

64
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,755
What are you doing here?

65
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,840
Sorry to bother you.

66
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,680
You're not leaving.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
Explain yourself,

68
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,200
or you're not leaving this room.

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,150
I'm actually Su Beilu's cousin.

70
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,600
Su Beilu has a cousin?

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,870
Why haven't I heard of that?

72
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,950
How are you going to prove
you're his cousin?

73
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,600
He's not a doctor
at a top-tier hospital.

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,480
He's a vet assistant at a pet hospital.

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,240
And he doesn't have a girlfriend.

76
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,910
Cousin, huh?

77
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,120
I was just trying to sell the place.

78
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,480
It was a well-meaning lie.

79
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,560
He's actually been
having a hard time lately.

80
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,600
Taking the place back right now

81
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:38,710
wouldn't be very nice.

82
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,860
(Pay Rent)

83
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,100
(No Pets Allowed. Move Out If Violated.)

84
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,240
It's just a temporarily
adopted stray cat.

85
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,660
(Available Balance: 380 yuan)

86
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,560
(I'm so useless.)

87
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,390
(It seems there's only one way left
to confirm his identity.)

88
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,000
I bought you breakfast.

89
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,360
You paid my rent for me, didn't you?

90
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,600
Jenny told me

91
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,070
a cousin helped me pay for it.

92
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,160
I don't have any cousins.

93
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,360
I knew

94
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,270
it couldn't have been Chun Ge.

95
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,600
It could only have been you.

96
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,920
Or maybe some other relative?

97
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,800
Impossible.

98
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,430
Jenny told me

99
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,120
that my cousin is just like me,

100
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,360
well-groomed and presentable,

101
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,390
just a bit weathered.

102
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,480
So it could only be you.

103
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,560
That definitely wasn't
Jenny's exact wording.

104
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,870
No need to thank me.

105
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,920
I still should.

106
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,750
I've already written an IOU.

107
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:25,310
I'll pay you back
once I get paid next month.

108
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,480
(IOU)
May I ask something bluntly?

109
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,600
How did you

110
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,950
end up unable to pay rent?

111
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,000
Doesn't that feel like a failure?

112
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,310
Originally,

113
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,240
I promised my mentor

114
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,270
that I'd pass
the veterinary licensing exam.

115
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,480
But it's already the third year,

116
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,800
and I still haven't passed.

117
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,430
I never became
a licensed doctor either.

118
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,070
It does feel like a failure.

119
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,430
Is the exam that hard?

120
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,680
For some people, probably not.

121
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,390
But I just can't pass it.

122
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,870
Maybe in my past life,

123
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,070
I simply wasn't cut out for studying.

124
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,200
Impossible.

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,120
What I mean is,

126
00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:17,830
you may not like studying now,

127
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,750
but it doesn't mean

128
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,750
you never liked it before,
or never will.

129
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,600
Maybe.

130
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,680
Honestly,

131
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:28,070
it's not that I absolutely
have to become a doctor.

132
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,040
I don't have any grand ambitions.

133
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,030
I think that for one person

134
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,510
to have a job

135
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,510
in life

136
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,270
and to be able to help animals,

137
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,080
to be healthy and out of trouble,

138
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:41,960
and to live safely and peacefully
is enough.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
But why is it

140
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:48,270
that everyone keeps
forcing me to improve?

141
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,030
There's a saying here too,

142
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,670
"Escaping is shameful,

143
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,320
but it works."

144
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:57,750
You don't need to persuade me.

145
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,080
Right now,

146
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,480
I just want to escape.

147
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,910
There are many useful ways.

148
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,910
Escaping isn't the only one.

149
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,590
Come with me.

150
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,080
Let's clear your head.

151
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,320
Where are we going this time?

152
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:26,220
(Yashe)

153
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,200
The sunset here is incredible.

154
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,790
I've never seen a sky this beautiful.

155
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,120
If you look at it long enough,

156
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,150
you'll grow tired of it, too.

157
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,720
Which dynasty

158
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,000
is this?

159
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,630
This place actually doesn't
belong to any dynasty.

160
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,030
So where is this?

161
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,350
This place

162
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,840
is called Tianguang Market.

163
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,320
Market?

164
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,360
It simply means a place of trade.

165
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:07,950
This place is under the jurisdiction
of the Time Administration.

166
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,360
You can think of it as a wormhole,

167
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,870
or a tear in time.

168
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,080
It was because this place was discovered

169
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,270
that in our era,

170
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,200
time travel became possible.

171
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
I don't get it.

172
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,150
I knew you wouldn't.

173
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:25,390
You know this one at least, right?

174
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,030
An hourglass.

175
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,200
You can think of different timelines

176
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,000
as the two ends of an hourglass.

177
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,600
This place is Tianguang Market,

178
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,600
a shortcut for time travel.

179
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,790
Why do the people here

180
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,600
look like they're
from different dynasties?

181
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,910
Because Tianguang Market
connects different timelines.

182
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,510
People often stumble in here by chance.

183
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,870
To survive,

184
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,630
they can only trade supplies here,

185
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,360
waiting for the day they can leave.

186
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,270
Time here is frozen,

187
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,870
so things never change.

188
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,120
There is only dusk,

189
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,360
never night.

190
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,030
Hence the name Tianguang Market.

191
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,550
All the clocks here don't move.

192
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,440
Here, they have no meaning at all.

193
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,150
They're the most useless things.

194
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,080
Then,

195
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,670
can they still go home?

196
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,510
If they can come in,
they can naturally go back.

197
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:20,870
They'll return to their origins,

198
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,270
with nothing changed.

199
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,360
As for when they can return,

200
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,870
that's no longer within their control.

201
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,030
I'm just glad they can go home.

202
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,720
Otherwise, being trapped here

203
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,790
would be pretty dreadful.

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,550
Weren't you just saying

205
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,320
how much you liked the sunset here?

206
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,440
That's not the same thing.

207
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,840
Without family, without friends,

208
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,360
no matter how nice a place is,

209
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,630
you wouldn't be happy there.

210
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,630
Look at that tree.

211
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,360
It's so big and so red.

212
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,000
Pity that the Forgetting Tree

213
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,600
stands for oblivion.

214
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,120
Oblivion?

215
00:12:34,222 --> 00:12:36,450
(Times Change)
Though the crimson clouds are brilliant,

216
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,390
the past is faint and cannot be traced.

217
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,870
People here

218
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,000
come and go without end,

219
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,150
yet no one can stay.

220
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,870
Just like these leaves.

221
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
They can never remain
on the branches forever.

222
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,720
But looking at scenery this beautiful,

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,670
I ended up forgetting some things, too.

224
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,910
Work,

225
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,240
rent,

226
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,150
exams,

227
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,270
and life plans.

228
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,910
I forgot all about

229
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,000
these maddening woes.

230
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,480
Thank you.

231
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,670
You're welcome.

232
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,030
Have you been here before?

233
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,230
No.

234
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,440
Let's go.

235
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,600
Bizhi,

236
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,720
you never told me your friend is loaded.

237
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,870
Can you let me stay here?

238
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,910
I don't mind how long.

239
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,390
When we meet the owner later,

240
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,750
be mindful of your words.

241
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,200
There's only one thing you should say.

242
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,120
What is it?

243
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,150
The nice stuff.

244
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,360
Praise her beauty.

245
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Praise her makeup.

246
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,910
Praise how graceful she is.

247
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,870
Any kind of compliment, don't hold back.

248
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,000
Say it all, okay?

249
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,510
Who are you?

250
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,870
Buddy,

251
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,390
you're really beautiful.

252
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,080
Well, your makeup looks great, too.

253
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,480
Your skin is so delicate.

254
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,780
(Chu Qiu, Guard Captain)
Like a flower.

255
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,270
Chu Qiu, he's my friend.

256
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,200
Let him go for now.

257
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,040
A friend?

258
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,360
Chu Qiu.

259
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,750
Don't be rude.

260
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,340
(Lord of Tianguang Market)

261
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,840
He's my guest.

262
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,240
Let him go.

263
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,200
My lord.

264
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,750
Thank you, fairy.

265
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,480
What did you call me?

266
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
A fairy.

267
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,510
When I saw you walking over from afar,

268
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,755
I thought you looked beautiful.

269
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,510
I didn't expect that up close,

270
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,710
you'd be even more beautiful.

271
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,600
Just look at this.

272
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,150
Your makeup is so exquisite.

273
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,510
And this red dress of yours,

274
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,960
was it custom-made just for you?

275
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,750
It suits you perfectly.

276
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,150
Are you serious?

277
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,790
I never lie.

278
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,440
Bizhi,

279
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,600
your friend certainly has
a sweet tongue.

280
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,550
His name is Su Beilu.

281
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,390
This is the Lord of Tianguang Market.

282
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,360
Why don't you greet her?

283
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,240
So, you're the lord here.

284
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,270
You're so young,

285
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,320
yet you have such a vast estate,

286
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,360
and you manage so many people.

287
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,960
You're truly gifted.

288
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,030
Alright, alright.

289
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,440
Since you're a guest,

290
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,390
I should naturally show you around.

291
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,030
For now, Bizhi and I have
important matters to discuss.

292
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,000
Chu Qiu,

293
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,955
I'll leave him to you.

294
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,320
Actually,

295
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,320
it's fine if we don't tour.

296
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,350
Oh?

297
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,270
Is my Tianguang Market not beautiful?

298
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,910
It is.

299
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,110
Go on.

300
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,240
That's more like it.

301
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,630
I looked for that Fish-patterned Mirror
twice for you.

302
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,480
Payment and goods are now settled.

303
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,840
Where is the item?

304
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,120
This is the remaining payment
for the mirror.

305
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,960
They are two different deals.

306
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,630
Don't get them mixed up.

307
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,600
Fair enough.

308
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,120
Across the entire realm,

309
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,600
you're truly
the best businessperson of all.

310
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,000
What's this?

311
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,960
Open it and see.

312
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,600
The red-blue flowers of Yanzhi Mountain
are the most fragrant.

313
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,320
Blush made from these red-blue flowers

314
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,910
really lives up to its reputation.

315
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,320
You do have a discerning eye.

316
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,510
The spacetime coordinates
of the next antiquity.

317
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,350
Thank you.

318
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,630
There's one more thing

319
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,080
I'd like to ask you.

320
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,350
Go on.

321
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,390
After that great fire years ago,

322
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,790
my friend's belongings were
scattered across different timelines

323
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,750
and caused energy disturbances.

324
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,510
I want to know,

325
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,310
if objects can be like this,

326
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,760
what about people?

327
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,840
People?

328
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,110
Can people also be like objects,

329
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,350
suddenly appearing in another timeline?

330
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,480
Did you meet someone?

331
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,720
In the twenty-first century,

332
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:26,666
(Time Shifts, the World Changes)
I met someone called Su Beilu.

333
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,510
He looks exactly
like that friend of mine.

334
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,030
The weather's really nice today.

335
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,920
The temperature's pleasant, too.

336
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,680
How long have you been here?

337
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,590
I think it's been quite a long time.

338
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,590
Do you miss home?

339
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,070
Are you married?

340
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:46,310
Do you have a girlfriend?

341
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,640
What do you think lies
at the end of this river?

342
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,790
I heard it's something called

343
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,550
a time rift.

344
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,200
Then, where does this river flow to?

345
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
What are you doing?

346
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,400
Don't you find this
really stress-relieving?

347
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,720
You seem pretty stressed.

348
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,820
Come on, join me.

349
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,640
What was that noise?

350
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,720
My friend just startles easily.

351
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,640
Ignore him.

352
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,200
Have you seen him in Tianguang Market?

353
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,960
Then, the price has to be recalculated.

354
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,200
That's a bit much.

355
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,550
I'm joking.

356
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,960
Why can't you take a joke?

357
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,550
Then, go on.

358
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,480
He has never been to Tianguang Market.

359
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,030
Think again.

360
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,000
He really hasn't.

361
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,640
Even if he had been here,

362
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,680
he could only return
to where he came from.

363
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,070
Those who can freely travel
through time using Tianguang Market

364
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,200
are extremely rare.

365
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,000
Besides, your friend has
such a sweet tongue.

366
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,680
I'd definitely remember him.

367
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,030
So, that means

368
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,270
he isn't that person.

369
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,440
That's not what I meant.

370
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,070
I only know what happens
within Tianguang Market.

371
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,720
Thank you.

372
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,240
I do have one more idea.

373
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,240
Why not use the Yashe
to take a look at his past?

374
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,350
That way, his origin

375
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,960
will be clear.

376
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,030
(No need to keep guessing.)

377
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,590
This place is really nice.

378
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,933
I don't know if I'll get
another chance to come back.

379
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,240
Let me take a few more looks.

380
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,670
Let's go.

381
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,170
Don't move. Don't speak. Follow me.

382
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,050
Hurry.

383
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,270
Drop your weapon.

384
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,350
Throw it away.

385
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,520
Get on.

386
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,870
Don't move.

387
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,660
Lan, get on the boat.

388
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,480
Row.

389
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,720
Faster.

390
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,680
Su Beilu.

391
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,590
Bizhi, save me!

392
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,600
Don't shout. Hurry.

393
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,830
- Row faster.
- Move.

394
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,590
Hey.

395
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,350
From the way you're dressed,

396
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,790
you're also from
the twenty-first century.

397
00:21:00,888 --> 00:21:02,010
We're from the same place.

398
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,960
Shut up.

399
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,800
Row faster.

400
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,580
That way.

401
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,300
Into the fog. Hurry.

402
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,750
Faster. Go faster.

403
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,080
I'll row with you. Go to the back.

404
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,840
Careful.

405
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,510
I'll go check ahead.

406
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,700
You...

407
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,880
Don't be nervous.

408
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,480
We won't hurt you.

409
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,880
Are you

410
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,400
from ancient times?

411
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,840
I am.

412
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,110
But he isn't.

413
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,350
Then, why are you

414
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,240
leaving together?

415
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,750
We met in Tianguang Market.

416
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,240
But one day,

417
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,350
we'll have to return to our own eras.

418
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,440
That's why we're trying

419
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,510
to find a way to leave
Tianguang Market together.

420
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,960
Don't chit-chat with him.

421
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,440
We'll stop here.

422
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,440
Once we leave the thick fog,

423
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,750
you row back on your own.

424
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,880
Can you leave after passing

425
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,510
through the fog?

426
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,440
Yes.

427
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,070
They say the dense fog over
the River of Oblivion is the exit.

428
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,520
Feng.

429
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,440
If we can't

430
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,720
leave together...

431
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,520
That won't happen.

432
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,640
We'll definitely leave together.

433
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,110
But once you leave Tianguang Market,

434
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,160
if you come to my era and are forever

435
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,440
separated from your parents and family,

436
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,160
would you be happy?

437
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,790
As long as I'm with you,

438
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,310
I'll be happy.

439
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,920
And honestly,

440
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,830
I had nothing

441
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,480
in my own era.

442
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,420
I'm willing to go to your era.

443
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,550
But that would be

444
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,200
far too unfair to you.

445
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,400
(Who would have thought)

446
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,030
(that it would turn out
to be a love story?)

447
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,240
The fog...

448
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,080
Row.

449
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,310
Row, row faster.

450
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,550
We're already inside the fog.

451
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,310
Why hasn't anything changed?

452
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,070
Go deeper into the fog.

453
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,240
Why are we back again?

454
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,480
This feels like a maze.

455
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,030
Turn around. Quickly.

456
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,160
Market Lord.

457
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,590
I am the Lord of Tianguang Market.

458
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,440
I offer you both this advice.

459
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,350
The River of Oblivion
is like a sea of suffering.

460
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,110
Turning back is the wiser choice.

461
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,920
You're the Lord of Tianguang Market?

462
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,590
Fine.

463
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,910
Then tell me,

464
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,960
on what grounds are you keeping us here?

465
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,590
We want to leave now.

466
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,630
Let us go.

467
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,070
You should know

468
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,310
the one trapping you here is not me,

469
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,310
but this time rift.

470
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,240
Tianguang Market is a time rift

471
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,400
because it connects countless eras.

472
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,110
When people from different eras

473
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,750
are unable to return for the time being,

474
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,680
it is because the entrances
and exits of time are closed.

475
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,070
But the operation of those gateways

476
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,310
is like the rising
and dispersing of this fog,

477
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,733
ever-changing and unpredictable.

478
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,270
Even I cannot accurately foresee

479
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,920
when the gate
to your world will open again.

480
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,680
No one knows.

481
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,590
I want to go to her era

482
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,310
and live together with her.

483
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,720
Here,

484
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:33,550
we don't even know
when we'll be able to leave.

485
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,590
I don't want to
be separated from her. Am I wrong?

486
00:25:36,888 --> 00:25:38,200
I want to be with her forever.

487
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,400
Is that not allowed?

488
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,880
You say that in this place,

489
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,550
lovers never know
if the next moment will part them.

490
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,830
But what about your world?

491
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,310
Isn't it the same there?

492
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,720
This place

493
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,110
is no different from any other world.

494
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Don't you understand yet?

495
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,240
I don't!

496
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,720
Is there really no other way?

497
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,080
No.

498
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,200
All you can do

499
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,640
is treat every moment as the last.

500
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,560
Feng.

501
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,590
Don't be sad.

502
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,200
No matter what,

503
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,510
until we finally part,

504
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,350
I'll stay with you.

505
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,030
Coming here was

506
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,790
completely unexpected.

507
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,960
Meeting you

508
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,110
was an even greater, unexpected joy.

509
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,160
So,

510
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,960
why not treat every moment we share

511
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,830
as a blessing?

512
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,910
Here.

513
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,510
Remember this.

514
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,240
This blade

515
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,400
is meant to carve the finest,
most gentle jade in the world.

516
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,350
I believe in you.

517
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,160
You'll definitely be able

518
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,310
to carve the most
exquisite piece with it.

519
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,800
I'm sorry.

520
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,680
I meant to help you clear your head.

521
00:28:01,777 --> 00:28:03,830
I didn't expect you
to witness something like this.

522
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,830
Maybe from the very beginning,

523
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,880
I shouldn't have involved you at all.

524
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,030
I'm fine.

525
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,440
They didn't mean to hurt me anyway.

526
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,510
They just wanted to be together.

527
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,720
I can understand that.

528
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,150
But

529
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,270
the Market Lord caught them.

530
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,590
Will they be okay?

531
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,590
They will.

532
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,830
They'll return to their own eras.

533
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,110
Then, won't they see each other again?

534
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,640
People from different eras

535
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,880
are destined to part.

536
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,630
How about this?

537
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,000
To make it up to you,

538
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,070
I'll treat you to a meal.

539
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,350
Sure.

540
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,240
Barbecue?

541
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,480
Since it's to make amends,

542
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:59,030
we should get something good.

543
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,520
Let's go.

544
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,720
So, what are we having?

545
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,760
Western food?

546
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,720
Chinese food? Japanese food?

547
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,750
That ninety-nine yuan
all-you-can-eat salmon place?

548
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,540
(As Time Passes, the Stars Shift)

549
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,720
Market Lord.

550
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,200
What is it?

551
00:29:34,311 --> 00:29:36,480
I've verified the identities
of that man and woman.

552
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:37,640
It was indeed an elopement.

553
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,830
Nothing unusual.

554
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,590
That's good.

555
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,000
These are their identity records.

556
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,350
Please take a look.

557
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,350
Xia Zelan.

558
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,240
Lu Feng?

559
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,110
So that person just now was Lu Feng?

560
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,100
(Year 2024)

561
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,100
(Huayang City)

562
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,480
So refined.

563
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,840
Sir.

564
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,510
This is your pre-meal champagne.

565
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,550
Can I start eating?

566
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,400
This place is so luxurious.

567
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,510
It must be expensive.

568
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:45,110
I haven't been back
to Huayang in a long time.

569
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,480
You brought me to Huayang.

570
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,640
There must be a reason, right?

571
00:30:48,244 --> 00:30:49,880
Are you here to recover an artifact?

572
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,240
What is it? Where are we getting it?

573
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,080
And from whom?

574
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,640
All these years,

575
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,510
I've travelled through time alone

576
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,110
in search of ancient objects.

577
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,480
I've gotten used to it.

578
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,440
Getting you involved

579
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,350
was regretful.

580
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:08,590
Everything that's happened

581
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,510
might affect the course of your life.

582
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,870
So...

583
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,880
So, you're trying to thank me?

584
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,750
Thank me for my selfless spirit?

585
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,720
It's okay.

586
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,200
If this happens again,

587
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,070
I'll still help you without hesitation.

588
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,640
This beef...

589
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,830
Look at the marbling.

590
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,960
What I meant

591
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,920
was actually...

592
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,400
I understand.

593
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,240
You're saying I eat too roughly, right?

594
00:31:42,377 --> 00:31:43,520
I'll take smaller bites.

595
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,190
Go on, eat.

596
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,590
Eating

597
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,680
is meant to be an enjoyment.

598
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,110
As long as you're happy.

599
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,350
Watch your step.

600
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,000
Mr. Lu, please.

601
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,110
Is he the person you're looking for?

602
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,310
I think so.

603
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,240
It's him!

604
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,640
You know him?

605
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,310
He's the one from Tianguang Market.

606
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,480
The one who held me hostage.

607
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,750
He was wearing a mask,

608
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,911
so you didn't recognize him.

609
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,670
But...

610
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,110
Why does he

611
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,590
look so much older?

612
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,070
Time is frozen in Tianguang Market.

613
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,750
There would be no change when he left.

614
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,080
I suppose

615
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:45,240
he must have left
more than ten years ago.

616
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,920
So that's how it is.

617
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,000
He's making it all so romantic.

618
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:55,550
Do you think he might have

619
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,777
brought his girlfriend
from Tianguang Market with him?

620
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,040
Lu Feng.

621
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,910
Nana.

622
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,830
You're dressed beautifully.

623
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,070
Come, sit.

624
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,160
That's not the woman
from Tianguang Market.

625
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,920
Why does she look so familiar?

626
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,350
I feel like I've seen her before.

627
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,310
Isn't she that influencer, Nana?

628
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,830
She's actually here?

629
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,870
She...

630
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,840
Na...

631
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,870
Nana.

632
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,030
She's a really famous influencer.

633
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,000
How did those two end up together?

634
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,960
You'd never have guessed it.

635
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,030
I didn't realize you were this gossipy.

636
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,240
This is truffle foie gras.

637
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,310
Please enjoy.

638
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,000
This place is really hard to book.

639
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:46,733
You really went to a lot of trouble.

640
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,350
You said you liked
their truffle dishes.

641
00:33:49,555 --> 00:33:50,820
Even if it's hard to get a table,

642
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,533
I still wanted to
make it happen for you.

643
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:53,350
Then, I'll try it.

644
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,350
Go on, have a taste.

645
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,550
I've got a solo exhibition tomorrow.

646
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,830
You'll come, right?

647
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,710
What I want most

648
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,150
is for you to be standing by my side.

649
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,390
Really?

650
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,030
Does an artist like you
really need me there?

651
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,880
I don't buy it.

652
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,430
Nana,

653
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,880
you might think I know a lot of people,

654
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,230
but to me,

655
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,550
you're one of a kind.

656
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,320
You know,

657
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,320
in our line of work, there's a lot
of fake smiles and flattery.

658
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,200
But with you,

659
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,880
I mean it.

660
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,760
What a jerk.

661
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,480
I never said I wasn't going.

662
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,480
Stop scrolling on your phone.

663
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,390
Come on, cheers.

664
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,030
I'll try some too.

665
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,800
That wasn't meant for me, was it?

666
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,540
(See you tomorrow.
If we don't meet again, I'll miss you.)

667
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,960
"See you tomorrow."

668
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,150
"If we don't meet again,

669
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,510
I'll miss you."

670
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,760
I didn't write that.
It must've been my assistant.

671
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,977
It was sent to a group, right?

672
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,360
How many did you send it to?

673
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,350
Nana.

674
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,550
I'll make sure
they're more careful next time.

675
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,510
Your assistant really knows you well.

676
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,440
This...

677
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,550
The truffles aren't fresh.

678
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,760
I can't eat this.

679
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,670
I'm leaving.

680
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,510
Nana!

681
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,470
Nana!

682
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,480
Was that Nana?

683
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,960
She got that upset already?

684
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,920
Shouldn't we...

685
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,160
Nana.

686
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,190
Nana, hear me out.

687
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,920
Nana. Nana, let me explain.

688
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,030
Don't touch me.

689
00:36:01,555 --> 00:36:03,480
If you really want to go back,
take my car.

690
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,360
I'll call a ride.

691
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,070
Nana.

692
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,550
You've really misunderstood me.

693
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,440
Everyone's under
huge pressure for this exhibition.

694
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,590
That message was sent

695
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,590
just to get more guests

696
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,000
to show up and support me.

697
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,590
It was sent out in bulk.

698
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,480
But you

699
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,377
were the only one
I came to invite in person.

700
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:23,710
Doesn't that show how I feel?

701
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:29,880
Nana, you'll come
to my exhibition tomorrow, right?

702
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,030
Drive safe, please.

703
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,960
Zhang, go settle the bill.

704
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,222
Have the car come pick me up.

705
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,680
Lu Feng.

706
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
Do you remember me?

707
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,800
You are...

708
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,630
We met at Tianguang Market.

709
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,960
Where?

710
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,480
We were rowing on the river.

711
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,510
You even...

712
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,160
Nice to meet you.

713
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,160
Nice to meet you.

714
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,230
My friend and I wanted to talk to you.

715
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,230
Do you have a moment?

716
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,670
My car's here.

717
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,066
I've got an exhibition tomorrow.

718
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:09,480
Add my assistant on WeChat.

719
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,644
We'll get in touch later.

720
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,550
No, wait.

721
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,710
Sorry, Mr. Lu is in a hurry.

722
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,044
Let's exchange contact details.

723
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,760
Sorry about that.

724
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,720
Don't forget.

725
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,030
Why did he act like
he didn't know me at all?

726
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:29,360
He definitely doesn't remember you.

727
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,360
People who leave Tianguang Market
lose their memories.

728
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,670
That really happens?

729
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,550
Tianguang Market is a time rift.

730
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,420
Strictly speaking,

731
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,110
what happens there
doesn't belong to any timeline.

732
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,590
But I went there, too.

733
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,711
Why didn't I forget anything?

734
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,550
You entered through Yashe.

735
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:49,000
That's different from people
who wander in by accident.

736
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,400
Do you think he'll contact us?

737
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:54,070
If you're waiting for him to reach out,

738
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,480
you'll probably be disappointed.

739
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
What do we do?

740
00:37:57,022 --> 00:37:58,400
There's nothing we can do.

741
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,710
We came all this way

742
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,550
for nothing?

743
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,920
Since we're already here,

744
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,840
take a look around.

745
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,510
Big cities really are different.

746
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,800
Huayang has changed so much.

747
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,990
Bizhi.

748
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,320
The future...

749
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,670
What's it like?

750
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,190
Is it like sci-fi movies,

751
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,590
with cars flying through the sky?

752
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,070
No, wait, maybe it's more like

753
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,880
every household has its own aircraft.

754
00:38:33,555 --> 00:38:34,550
Instant teleportation?

755
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,550
Then, what are future homes like?

756
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,590
Are they all really tall?

757
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,510
So tall they disappear into the clouds?

758
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,230
And housing prices
must be expensive, right?

759
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,110
Do you own a place?

760
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,510
How many rooms?

761
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,350
Is it...

762
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,760
I have one room.

763
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,840
There's a bed,

764
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,630
a chair,

765
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,590
and a window.

766
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,120
That's it?

767
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,550
Bare walls and nothing else.

768
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,440
But technology lets me
have anything I want.

769
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,550
That still sounds boring.

770
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,710
I think the present is more interesting.

771
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,230
It feels alive.

772
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,720
Look.

773
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,590
I can scroll on my phone.

774
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,630
All these cats and dogs,

775
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,710
and funny clips

776
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,670
are great.

777
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,440
Once you start scrolling,
you can't stop.

778
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,030
(Top influencer Nana has recently been
revealed to have a new relationship.)

779
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,960
(So, she has been taken.)

780
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,000
Isn't that Lu Feng?

781
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,840
(This lucky man)

782
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,550
(is an artist named Lu Feng.)

783
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,230
(The two were photographed dining
together at a high-end restaurant.)

784
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,710
That's Lu Feng!

785
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,960
