00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,740
(Yashe)

5
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,280
Yashe?

6
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,630
Open the door!

7
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,680
Is anyone there?

8
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,150
Are you

9
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,520
a customer?

10
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,590
This is interesting.

11
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,800
Are you guys

12
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,240
not accepting any customers?

13
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,710
We are.

14
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,750
Please come inside.

15
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,000
How long

16
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,710
has this shop been operating?

17
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,550
I have no idea.

18
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,840
Aren't you the owner?

19
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,680
I'm not.

20
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,240
He went out for some business.

21
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,990
I'm just watching over
the shop on his behalf.

22
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,310
Take a look around for now.

23
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,030
I don't know about the prices either.

24
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,730
You can inquire about them
when he's back.

25
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,710
Isn't this a Northern Song Dynasty
Ru Ware Sky-Blue Glaze Large Dish?

26
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,750
There are barely 100 Northern Song Ru
ware pieces left in the world.

27
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,870
How come a tiny shop like this
has one of them?

28
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,150
Is it that rare?

29
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,710
But I don't see
anything special about it.

30
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,190
We use the same plates
for our meals at home.

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,960
But I believe that Mister
won't sell any knockoffs.

32
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,870
People say that
the antique trade is a mixed bag.

33
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,870
I'm sure it's because people like you

34
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,800
spoiled our reputation!

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,590
A Northern Song Dynasty Ru Ware
Sky-Blue Glaze Large Dish?

36
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,680
Listen,

37
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
this isn't even a high-quality knockoff!

38
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,230
If it's genuine,
I'll swallow it in front of you!

39
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,360
Call your boss here.

40
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560
I'll reason with him!

41
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,400
- That's not it...
- Were you looking for me?

42
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,800
Bizhi, you've finally returned.

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,470
He said that you sold knockoffs.

44
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,910
Mr. Bi,

45
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,800
I didn't know that this was your shop.

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,470
It's impossible for you
to sell knockoffs. I was plain wrong.

47
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,310
There are plenty of treasures here.

48
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,760
Some of them are so rare
that I don't even know their names.

49
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,100
Is that made of agarwood?

50
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,800
It is, huh?

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,030
I was wondering about the fragrant scent
upon entering the shop.

52
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,120
This is excellent.

53
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
It's quite expensive.

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,240
No.

55
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,870
This can no longer be measured in money.

56
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,960
It's such a huge piece.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,840
Have some tea.

58
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,680
Okay.

59
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,280
Just look at the tea cup.

60
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,510
It has a crystal-clear warmth
and a rouge-like purple tint to it.

61
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,240
Don't tell me

62
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,360
it's a piece of Jun Kiln.

63
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,000
Really?

64
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,560
How could you use this for tea?

65
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,950
We have to frame it and worship it,

66
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,790
you know?

67
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,750
Mr. Bi,

68
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,830
to be honest with you,

69
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,670
I do have

70
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,560
a tiny collection as well.

71
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,870
If you have the time,

72
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,190
please check them out

73
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,240
and tell me what you think.

74
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,710
Why don't we head to my place today?

75
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,750
Today?

76
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,160
Yeah, you're right.
I shouldn't trouble you.

77
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,560
I should bring them here
and show them to you instead.

78
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,710
What about this?

79
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,920
I'll go and get them right now.

80
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,240
Please wait for me.

81
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,390
- Just a moment. I'll return soon.
- I...

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,560
Where did you go just now?

83
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,720
Where else?

84
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,590
I went out to find a present for
that picky person from Tianguang Market.

85
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,500
When you leave, hang up
the "Closed" wooden sign for me.

86
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,950
I'm not leaving.

87
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,630
I wish to head to Tianguang Market
and thank her myself.

88
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,210
I would've had to struggle on that river

89
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,870
for some time
if it weren't for her back then.

90
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,680
My milk tea order hasn't arrived yet.

91
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,960
I'll order an extra cup for her.

92
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,480
With extra sugar and boba.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,750
Are you sure
you don't need to work today?

94
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,240
I still have some annual leave left.

95
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,560
Besides,

96
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
time stands still within
Tianguang Market.

97
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,070
You can also manipulate Yashe

98
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,560
and make it so that I enter and leave

99
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,190
at the same time.

100
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,160
And, I can come back to you
when I need extra sleep in the future.

101
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,950
During our search for the Kunwu Blade,

102
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,970
Market Lord,
I didn't present you with any gifts.

103
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,310
This time, I'm making up for it.

104
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,560
This agate is of excellent quality.

105
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,680
It has a fine color as well.

106
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,830
However...

107
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,360
What's wrong?

108
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,720
I haven't had the best appetite lately.

109
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,830
I've lost some weight.

110
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,630
I don't think these earrings
are a good fit for me.

111
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,680
You know?

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,510
But Market Lord, why do I feel like

113
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,560
your face has become more rounded?

114
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,520
Don't you agree?

115
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,270
Who said so?

116
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,710
Isn't that the case?

117
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,560
Why would you grow rounder
if you didn't have an appetite?

118
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,200
A face as round as a silver plate

119
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,240
will serve to
demonstrate one's prosperity.

120
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,680
Shut up if you don't know what to say.

121
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,240
I don't like them! I'm not taking them!

122
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,190
It was just a joke.

123
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,560
Why are you so petty?

124
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,830
Of course I understood
what you meant, Market Lord.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,810
I already prepared
something else in advance.

126
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,960
Su Beilu.

127
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,030
Coming.

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,360
I just happened to bring four cups.

129
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,510
One for each of us.

130
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,560
Aren't you...

131
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,480
What are you doing here?

132
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,910
Chu Qiu,

133
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,720
is anyone allowed
to enter Luoxia Manor now?

134
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,120
Not if they're empty-handed.

135
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,650
That's right.

136
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,510
I came here to bring you
some boba milk tea.

137
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,970
It's a popular beverage in our era.
They sell this everywhere.

138
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,920
And, this shop sells the best boba.

139
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,030
Hurry and try it.

140
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,590
You think you can brush me off
with such an ordinary beverage?

141
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,040
I'll take it if you don't want it.

142
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,470
Since you've gone through
all the effort to bring this here,

143
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,360
I... I suppose I can give it a try.

144
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,440
Wait.

145
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,120
I have to test any food
that's brought here

146
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,040
for poison before
Market Lord tries them.

147
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,880
How is it?

148
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,320
Wait a little longer.

149
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,240
Are you done?

150
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,430
The onset of toxin takes time.

151
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,830
Just tell us directly if you want one.

152
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,190
Don't leave Market Lord hanging.

153
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,870
Just drink it. I wouldn't poison you.

154
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,750
Precisely.

155
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,000
It's so delicious.

156
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,510
This is called
Glutinous Bubble Milk Foam

157
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,040
Popping Tea with Sesame,
Berry, Mango, and Peach.

158
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,990
Can you actually
repeat the name perfectly

159
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,390
if you were to say it again?

160
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,390
Glutinous Bubble Milk Foam Popping Tea
with Sesame, Berry, Mango, and Peach.

161
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,910
Glutinous...

162
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,960
Popping...

163
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,200
I can't remember the name.

164
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,670
It's delicious. Let's have a toast.

165
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,760
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

166
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,200
Market Lord, since you've enjoyed
the delicious drink we brought,

167
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,040
if so,

168
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,120
about the item we desire...

169
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,120
I almost forgot about it.

170
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,270
Thank you, Market Lord.

171
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,840
Repeat the name.

172
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,720
Mermaid Candle? Chan?

173
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,030
Mister,

174
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,750
please spare us some food.

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
Mister,

176
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,480
- please spare us some food.
- Please spare us some food.

177
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,320
We're here to distribute rations.

178
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,080
(Ration)

179
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,360
We're here to distribute rations.

180
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,260
Gather around.
We're here to distribute rations.

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
Don't fight.

182
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,690
Do not cause any commotion.

183
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,500
Be quiet. Go and line up.

184
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,000
Sir, please give me some!

185
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,670
Stop stealing it!

186
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,510
Scram!

187
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,230
How dare you steal?

188
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,350
You deserve this!

189
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,710
Go and line up!

190
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,790
Next.

191
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,630
Line up!

192
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,320
Line up!

193
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,370
My grain!

194
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,360
My grain!

195
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,620
- That's enough. Next.
- Of the 3,000 bushels of state grain,

196
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,240
now that they've arrived here,

197
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,870
is there even 30 left?

198
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,550
Though 10,000 palaces

199
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,720
now lie in dust,

200
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,030
how much gold

201
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,240
was taken by greed?

202
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,840
And how much famine grain

203
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,550
was consumed by corruption?

204
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,440
What a sin.

205
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,440
What a sin...

206
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,380
Stop stealing.

207
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,390
Line up.

208
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,120
Stop stealing!

209
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,200
Go and line up!

210
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,270
(Ration)

211
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,110
Scram!

212
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,080
It seems I'm still one step too late.

213
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,840
(In a chaotic world such as this,)

214
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,200
(if this tiny candle
can serve its purpose,)

215
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,470
(I suppose it counts as
a virtuous deed as well.)

216
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,870
(Forget it.)

217
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,080
(When the time comes,)

218
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,510
(I'm sure we'll meet again.)

219
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,460
(Chan)

220
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,100
How come it's still the same size
even after burning all night?

221
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,870
This is great.

222
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,670
I can use this candle again tonight.

223
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,990
We're here to distribute rations.

224
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,470
We're here to distribute rations.

225
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,320
No stealing allowed.

226
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,960
All of you are like mad dogs.
Stop stealing.

227
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,800
Don't be impatient.

228
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,650
Go and line up.

229
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,160
Stop stealing!

230
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,630
Stop stealing!

231
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,320
Stop squeezing!

232
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,170
Please give me some!

233
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,510
Go and line up!

234
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,790
Stop squeezing!

235
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,080
Here. Just leave already.

236
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,570
Go and line up at the back.

237
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,960
Give it to me!

238
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,680
Who are you?

239
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,880
I'm the Mermaid of Dongting.

240
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,310
A mermaid?

241
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,200
Young girl,

242
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,030
why were you crying

243
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,030
just now?

244
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,310
I went out to get some rations.

245
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,110
I lost

246
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,350
my only flatbread.

247
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
A bad guy snatched it from me.

248
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,030
And, he broke my basket as well.

249
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,240
Eat up.

250
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,880
Is that a flatbread?

251
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,590
Thank you.

252
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,840
Sit down.

253
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,790
There's no rush.

254
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,920
Take your time.

255
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,950
Have some water.

256
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,680
Chan, there's no rush.

257
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,150
Drink it slowly.

258
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,550
How did you know that my name was Chan?

259
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,160
I'm the millennium mermaid
of Lake Dongting, you know?

260
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,550
I know everything about the world.

261
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,070
If so, I have a question for you.

262
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,480
Ask away.

263
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,440
Miss Mermaid,

264
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,970
please tell me.

265
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,680
How can I continue
to survive in this world?

266
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,510
You're so young,

267
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,790
yet you're asking me
such a deep question.

268
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,310
Chan,

269
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,350
listen.

270
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,040
Life

271
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,790
is all about the food we have.

272
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,680
Chan,

273
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,640
you'll understand it naturally

274
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,640
once you grow up.

275
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,320
Eat up.

276
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,830
Miss Mermaid,

277
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,790
you're so nice to me.

278
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,000
Chan, it's because

279
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,920
you released me from the candle.

280
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,110
From now on,

281
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,510
I'll always keep you company

282
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,070
as long as the candle flame is there.

283
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,240
Eat up.

284
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,190
Are you cold?

285
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,590
I am.

286
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,070
Your clothing is so thin.

287
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,110
Aren't you cold?

288
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,430
Wow.

289
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,310
Your body is so warm.

290
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,590
Can I sleep next to you?

291
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,920
Miss Mermaid,

292
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,400
what's your name?

293
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,310
My name, huh?

294
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,070
My name is whatever

295
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,160
you wish to call me.

296
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,430
What about Nuan?

297
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,920
What do you think?

298
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,510
It's because you're so warm.

299
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,070
Nuan, huh?

300
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,680
Nuan?

301
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,270
Nuan.

302
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,040
Nuan,

303
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,400
it turns out
that you can fix baskets, huh?

304
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,680
There are even pears inside.

305
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,750
This is great!

306
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,510
It's been so long since I had pears.

307
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,880
Nuan,

308
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,240
how did you create them?

309
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,160
It's a piece of cake for me.

310
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,240
I've never tried a pear
this sweet before!

311
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,350
Thank you, Nuan.

312
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,830
Nuan, you're so mystical.

313
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,640
Nuan,

314
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,400
your outfit looks so pretty.

315
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,950
Do you like it?

316
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,680
I do.

317
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,520
Put it on, then.

318
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,310
Yan's outfit is so difficult to wash.

319
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,400
Luckily, we washed it clean yesterday.

320
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,960
She treasures this outfit very much.

321
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,980
I'm sure she'll be happy
when she receives it.

322
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,960
Last night, we worked so hard

323
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,270
to make all those scented sachets.

324
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,500
There will be plenty
of customers in the house today.

325
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,400
I hope we can sell more of them.

326
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,720
But the floor manager
is annoying, though.

327
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,880
He'd better pray
that he doesn't encounter me today.

328
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,310
If I do encounter him again,

329
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,110
I'll surely tell him off.

330
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,080
Nuan.

331
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,000
It's been so many years, you know?

332
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,750
How come you're still the same?

333
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,880
You're indeed the Mermaid of Dongting.

334
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
You never age.

335
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,030
If only I could be as beautiful as you.

336
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,870
No.

337
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,890
One-third. Just having
your one-third is enough.

338
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,680
I'll stop here. I need
to make some money.

339
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,450
Making a living is
the most important thing.

340
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,200
This looks pretty.

341
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,060
Try one.

342
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,940
How much?

343
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,200
It's cheap. Just 100 wen.

344
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,030
- Does it look good?
- Yeah. It looks great on you.

345
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,920
I'll take this, then.

346
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Please come again.

347
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,960
Miss.

348
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,310
Please check out our hairpins.

349
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,920
Check out this
Red Jade Plum Blossom Hairpin.

350
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,200
It's perfect for you.

351
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,960
Come on. It's okay
even if you're not buying anything.

352
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,530
It doesn't cost anything to try them on.

353
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,510
Let me put it on for you.

354
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,920
It suits you perfectly.

355
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,110
It looks great on you.

356
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
How much for this hairpin?

357
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
50 wen.

358
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,880
It's fine. Thank you.

359
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,070
But Miss, you look great
with that hairpin.

360
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,350
I'm telling the truth.

361
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,920
Where exactly is the Mermaid Candle?

362
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,630
We've arrived.

363
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,880
Zuichun House?

364
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,000
Is it a restaurant?

365
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,110
Not entirely.

366
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,720
Mister, come on.

367
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,680
Yeah, mister.

368
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,790
I'll serve you well tonight.

369
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,070
Don't tell me it's the kind of house
I'm imagining.

370
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,590
I think so.

371
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,790
- Just look at us.
- Come on.

372
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,750
This won't do.

373
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,350
I'm considered
a promising young talent, you know?

374
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,590
I mustn't visit such a place.

375
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,580
Since we're already here,
we should make the best of it.

376
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,270
Hey, this place doesn't
suit our status at all.

377
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,400
(Zuichun House)
We're already here, you know?

378
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,720
Misters!

379
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,830
Don't touch him!

380
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,350
- He'll pay tonight.
- Don't come near!

381
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,510
Don't touch me either!

382
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,830
Don't be shy.

383
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,240
Come on.

384
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,550
Scented sachet for sale.

385
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,440
10 wen each.

386
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,350
Just 10 wen each.

387
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,590
Plum blossom, gardenia,
and jasmine-scented sachets.

388
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,680
We sell all kinds of scents.

389
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,200
Don't miss out on them!

390
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,480
Stop harassing our customers!

391
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,070
Your customers can buy
my scented sachets for the girls.

392
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,030
That'll make them happy.

393
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,790
It's something that both parties desire.
How am I harassing them?

394
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,980
I'm helping out with
Zuichun House's business too.

395
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,550
Lass, you got quite
the sharp tongue, don't you?

396
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,310
Although you're the local laundress,

397
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,750
no one said
that you could sell your trinkets here.

398
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,710
Hurry to the backyard
and bring in the laundry.

399
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,790
If not, I'll report you
to our superiors.

400
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,000
By then, you'll lose your job!

401
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,720
Can't you see
that I'm here to deliver the laundry?

402
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,560
Stop rushing me!

403
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,410
Just go already.

404
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,790
He's so detestable.
Business is already terrible today.

405
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,740
I didn't sell a single scented sachet.

406
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,790
And, that stupid floor manager
just chased me away.

407
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,720
You've finally arrived.

408
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,920
Hurry and bring in the laundry.

409
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,350
By the way, these are Yan's outfits.

410
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,450
Please deliver them to her.

411
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,950
Yan?

412
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,480
You didn't know?

413
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,790
She ran away.

414
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,960
She ran away?

415
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,680
It happened this morning.

416
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,030
Yan didn't wake up.

417
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,070
My sister went to find her.

418
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,370
Only then did she realize
that the room was already empty.

419
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,590
Everyone said

420
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,200
that she eloped with a man.

421
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,070
How could that be?

422
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,000
Yan treasures this outfit the most.

423
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,830
Why would she run away
without telling us?

424
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,720
Just take the outfit. I'll take it as if
this encounter never took place.

425
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,200
I still have a lot of laundry to do.

426
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,270
I'll resume my work first.

427
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,830
Sir, watch out!

428
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,680
Are you okay?

429
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,400
Go and call for help.

430
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,390
What are you doing?

431
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,030
Young girl,

432
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,110
you're pretty cute.

433
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,340
- Let me have some fun...
- What are you doing?

434
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,430
What am I doing?

435
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,240
To think that they're hiding
such a cute girl like you.

436
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,920
I'm not one of them.

437
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,590
I'm just a worker.

438
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,790
You're a worker, huh?

439
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,310
Does that explain why
I cannot have fun with you?

440
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Don't come near me!

441
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,760
I'm coming!

442
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,620
- Don't come near me!
- Sir!

443
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,990
So what if you're an official?
I'll report you to the yamen!

444
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,300
Hey, how dare you
speak to Sir like that?

445
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,750
Sir, she's just a worker.

446
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,110
She's not good enough for you.

447
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,800
Let's head inside.
There are better girls.

448
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,000
Let's go.

449
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:31,880
Let's go.

450
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,510
She said she wanted
to report me to the yamen!

451
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,910
She doesn't dare to do so.
If she dares, I'll break her legs.

452
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,310
Please don't let her get to you.

453
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,790
We shall drink with you.

454
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,630
Let's go.

455
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,720
Can you still drink?

456
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,760
Let's drink a little more.

457
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,110
- Come on.
- No.

458
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,000
Again.

459
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,440
I'm drinking too much.

460
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,280
One more sip.

461
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,550
One more sip.

462
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,120
Drink up.

463
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,750
- One more sip.
- One more sip.

464
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,550
One more cup.

465
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,440
Come on, drink up.

466
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,510
One more round!

467
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,790
Okay!

468
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,590
Two little bees,

469
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,270
flying into the trees.

470
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,270
Flying left and right...

471
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,550
You guys lost!

472
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,200
All of you have to drink!

473
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,270
- Let's drink.
- Ladies, make him drink.

474
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,520
Miss,

475
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,750
all of them lost.

476
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,480
Bring me the lady I desire!

477
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,680
Okay.

478
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,420
I will.

479
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,740
(Zuichun House)

480
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,110
Ladies, all of you may leave.

481
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,680
You should have some water to sober up.

482
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,440
Misters, you two
have excellent taste indeed.

483
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,440
Chan is our top performer here.

484
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,720
Greetings, misters.

485
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,030
What do you two

486
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,270
wish to do today?

487
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,040
That's not it.

488
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,440
Please don't misunderstand us.

489
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,790
We're here to inquire about something.

490
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,880
Have you ever heard of
the Mermaid Candle?

491
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,590
What is that?

492
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,310
It's a blue candle
that can last forever.

493
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,350
It's very precious to me.

494
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,510
Mister,

495
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,310
are you kidding me?

496
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,110
How can a candle

497
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,830
last forever?

498
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,960
Please try to recall every detail.

499
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,880
I'm begging you here.

500
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,790
I drank so much just now.

501
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,000
I didn't lie to you

502
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,510
or keep anything from you.

503
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,240
Mister,

504
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,960
if you don't trust me,

505
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,790
you can search my body.

506
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,590
You can search

507
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,790
- every inch of my body.
- Don't.

508
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,440
Is she the only person named Chan here?

509
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,880
Indeed.

510
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,350
Wait.

511
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,440
Who's Chan?

512
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,160
I'm Chang'e.

513
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,310
You're Chang'e?

514
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,440
We're looking for Chan.

515
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,830
This is Chang'e,
the person you were looking for,

516
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,200
not Chan.

517
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,270
Isn't your accent too thick?

518
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,110
We were looking for Chan.

519
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,310
Can it be

520
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,720
that you guys are looking for

521
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,400
that Chan?

522
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,000
Which Chan?

523
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,480
Chan

524
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,440
isn't one of the courtesans here.

525
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,110
She's just a worker
who does our laundry.

526
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,150
Where is she?

527
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,000
She was here to pick up
the dirty laundry just now.

528
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,680
But she has already left.

529
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,590
Why don't you two come over tomorrow?

530
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,070
I'm not coming tomorrow.

531
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,000
Tomorrow...

532
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,830
Mister, don't leave me.

533
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,090
Report me to the local authority, huh?

534
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,110
I'm the local authority.

535
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,670
Come.

536
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,790
- Come into my arms!
- Don't come near me!

537
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,920
Help!

538
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,550
How dare you bite me?

539
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,110
Help!

540
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,400
Come here!

541
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,240
Help!

542
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,350
Come here!

543
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,640
Who are you?

544
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,030
That's Mr. Jiang Ling.

545
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,480
Who?

546
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,200
Mr. Jiang Ling.

547
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,790
Mr. Jiang Ling?

548
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,240
I...

549
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
I was drunk just now.

550
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,490
Please pardon me for my rudeness.

551
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,480
Scram.

552
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,080
Miss.

553
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,760
Are you okay?

554
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,960
Mr. Jiang Ling,
thank you for rescuing me.

555
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,950
You're walking alone
in the middle of the night.

556
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,590
Do you need me to send you home?

557
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,080
It's okay.

558
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,190
I live nearby.

559
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,510
Farewell.

560
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:43,670
Chan.

561
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,510
Nuan?

562
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,400
What are you doing here?

563
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,440
I was worried about you.

564
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,360
How could you not come home this late?

565
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,330
Don't you know that it's dangerous
for you to be out there until this hour?

566
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,000
I did come home late tonight.

567
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,350
Just now, I...

568
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,030
- I...
- Let's go home.

569
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,910
Chan,

570
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,390
come here.

571
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
Look closely.

572
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,760
This is a person's vital spot.

573
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,840
Remember this.

574
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,000
If anyone dares to hurt you,

575
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,360
you must repay the favor.

576
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,280
Here.

577
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,550
What are you doing?

578
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,390
What's wrong?

579
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,510
Are you scared?

580
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,800
Remember this.

581
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,230
If you wish to survive
in this chaotic world,

582
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,360
you have to learn
how to protect yourself.

583
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,520
Relying on yourself
is better than relying on others.

584
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,960
When you face villains,

585
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,190
if you don't dare to act,

586
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,070
you'll be the only one

587
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,030
who will be hurt.

588
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,840
I hope

589
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,550
never to see the day

590
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,000
when you never return home again.

591
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,460
Understood.

592
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,140
Many years ago,

593
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,700
you once asked me

594
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,340
how you should survive in this world.

595
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,820
In a world like this,

596
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,500
those who are soft-hearted

597
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,820
cannot survive.

598
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,180
Life is

599
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,300
a matter between good and evil.

600
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,980
What happened to him?

601
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,940
This is terrible.

602
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,980
It's a murder.

603
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,380
Strange things
have been happening lately.

604
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,860
First, a young girl went missing.

605
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,100
And now, there's a murder.

606
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,500
I heard that this man
used to harass women.

607
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,060
He received his just deserts.

608
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,860
You should stop.

609
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,420
Make way!

610
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,860
Things haven't been too peaceful lately.

611
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,880
We have to be more careful
when we leave the house.

612
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,060
Who actually has he offended?

613
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,020
That was ruthless.

614
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,380
Let's go.

615
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,060
Mister, I want this.

616
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,580
- Wrap it for me.
- All right.

617
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,250
Miss, do you want
to check out our kites?

618
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,820
Freshly brewed liquor for sale.

619
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:22,820
Do you want one?

620
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,660
Next time.

621
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,300
Miss.

622
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,540
(Zuichun House)

623
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,380
Miss.

624
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,820
Mr. Jiang Ling?

625
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,580
I didn't expect

626
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,900
to see you again today.

627
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,700
I suppose we're destined to meet.

628
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,140
You look pale.

629
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,500
Are you sick?

630
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,180
That's not it.

631
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,860
I'm glad to hear that.

632
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,740
Next time, you must be careful
when you walk alone at night.

633
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,500
I heard that they found someone dead
by the lakeside last night.

634
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,460
And, it was an official.

635
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,740
Is that so?

636
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,320
Next time, when you walk alone at night,
you can tell me about it.

637
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,420
My guard can escort you home.

638
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,260
Thank you, Mr. Jiang Ling.

639
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,100
Farewell.

640
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,180
Wait.

641
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,300
Mr. Jiang Ling,
I haven't repaid your favor yet.

642
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,720
Although these scented sachets
are nothing precious,

643
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,020
please take some of them.

644
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,340
Mr. Jiang Ling, I'm sure
you're used to exquisite wares.

645
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,940
My needlework is rather clumsy.

646
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,420
I hope you don't mind.

647
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,220
"A red ribbon
and a brocade scented sachet,

648
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,820
given to show my affection to you,

649
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,460
dear young sir".

650
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,540
I heard that one buys scented sachets
for the people they fancy.

651
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,620
Your needlework is exquisite.

652
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,500
And, the scent is unique.

653
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,860
What kind of scent is this?

654
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,400
I made this scent from
the flowers growing in my backyard.

655
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,340
They're merely cheap wildflowers.

656
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,060
There's only one person in my heart.

657
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,420
Therefore, I only need
one scented sachet.

658
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,620
Here you go.

659
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,260
Mister, you don't have to.

660
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,380
It's a gift from me.

661
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,660
Just take it.

662
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,940
Thank you, Mr. Jiang Ling.

663
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,180
By the way, I haven't had the pleasure
of learning your name yet.

664
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,340
I'm Chan.

665
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,460
Chan?

666
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,140
Chan.

667
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,380
Tomorrow night, there will be
a poetry gathering by Lake Dongting.

668
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,220
I'm the organizer.

669
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,060
Chan, I hope you can make it.

670
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,700
When you're there,
just show them this scented sachet.

671
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,180
They'll allow you to go upstairs.

672
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,580
I shall make a move first.
