(Chongle Pet Hospital)

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,879
(Two Years Ago)

6
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,560
Good boy.

7
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,599
It'll be done soon.

8
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,719
Hold it steady, Chun Ge.

9
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,200
Come on.

10
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,280
Stretch your leg out.

11
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,840
Disinfect it.

12
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,980
It hasn't been disinfected.

13
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,079
You do it.

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's switch places.

15
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,760
Hold it. Here.

16
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,040
- Don't move, Eddie.
- I'll do it.

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,080
Who are you?

18
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,080
I'm a nurse.

19
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,479
What's its name?

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,199
Eddie.

21
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Eddie.

22
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,400
Good boy, Eddie.

23
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,639
Sweetheart.

24
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,400
Needle.

25
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,080
Hold it.

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,690
Be good, Eddie. Don't move.

27
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,960
It'll be done soon.

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,879
Don't look.

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,159
Relax.

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,080
All done.

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,599
Done.

32
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,479
It's drawn?

33
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,240
Hold this.

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,439
It doesn't hurt now, Eddie.

35
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,360
Thanks.

36
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,240
Are you

37
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,199
today's

38
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,120
new nurse?

39
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,439
I'm Ren Xiaomin.

40
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,879
I'm Su Beilu.

41
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,240
He's Chun Ge.

42
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,639
We've been at Chongle for a year.

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,120
If you have any questions,

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,879
just ask us.

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,000
Hello, everyone.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,120
My name is Ren Xiaomin.

47
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,240
Let's work together from today on.

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
As a veterinarian,

49
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,439
I'll protect

50
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,960
every furry kid's health.

51
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,039
Well said.

52
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,439
Don't just say it's well said.

53
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,960
Learn properly from her.

54
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,520
Alright.

55
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,780
Meeting adjourned. Get to work.

56
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,240
I wasn't late today.

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,439
This place doesn't look great,

58
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,680
but it tastes amazing.

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,599
Especially this burger.

60
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,599
Eat it while it's hot.

61
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,599
I think it's good.

62
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,599
Nothing's wrong with it.

63
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,280
The roast chicken's good too.

64
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,120
Wait.

65
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,800
Let me take a photo first.

66
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,439
Go ahead.

67
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,400
It's to mark our first meal together.

68
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,280
Let's take a selfie.

69
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:34,960
Sure.

70
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,479
Come on.

71
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,000
One, two, three.

72
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,039
Let me see.

73
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,039
Did I close my eyes?

74
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,800
No.

75
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,800
I'll make a group chat. Send it there.

76
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,520
Sure.

77
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,560
By the way, what is
the group chat called?

78
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,639
It's called

79
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,960
Survived Another Dog Day.

80
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,159
That's good.

81
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,400
Then the group chat is called

82
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,479
- Survived Another Dog Day.
- Survived Another Dog Day.

83
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,400
- Woof.
- Woof.

84
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,879
Okay, no problem.

85
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,420
(Year 2024)

86
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,840
Made it.

87
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,879
Morning, Sir.

88
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,039
What time is it?

89
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,919
30 seconds past nine.

90
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,360
Let me clock in.

91
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,040
What 30 seconds?

92
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,280
Not even one second is allowed.

93
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,839
Alright.

94
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,790
Third time this month.
You finished your quota.

95
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,260
You'll get fined if you're late again.

96
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,199
Sir, just let me clock in.

97
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,720
Clock in?

98
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,800
I'd clock you instead.

99
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,199
Did you plan this with Su Beilu?

100
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,450
You're taking turns to annoy me.

101
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,040
Morning, Sir.

102
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
Learn from Xiaomin.

103
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,720
Were you late again?

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,959
Come earlier next time.

105
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,000
Why are you so late?

106
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,079
(Survived Another Dog Day)
(Su Beilu isn't around this year.)

107
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,839
(Is tomorrow's badminton match doomed?)

108
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,519
(Let that fat jerk regret it.)

109
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,240
(He fired a great employee like me.)

110
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,279
(Who's competing this year?)

111
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,720
(The buff Sailor Moon,)

112
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,000
(Me, Xiaomin.)

113
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
(Don't worry.)

114
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
(We'll fight for good results.)

115
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,480
Get high!

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,639
Chongle.

117
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,079
Great performance.

118
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,560
Chongle.

119
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,160
Sports are joy.

120
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,720
Shout.

121
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,800
Louder, come on.

122
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,800
- Chongle.
- Chongle.

123
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,350
- Great performance.
- Great performance.

124
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,639
- Chongle.
- Chongle.

125
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,240
- Sports are joy.
- Sports are joy.

126
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,639
Get out.

127
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,040
Or you're disqualified.

128
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,560
It's fine, relax.

129
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,199
Play your best.

130
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,480
Your results affect your bonus.

131
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Well...

132
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,000
Good luck!

133
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,120
Good luck.

134
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,199
Ignore him.

135
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,720
It's fine.

136
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,240
Good luck.

137
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:14,839
Good luck.

138
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,199
Relax.

139
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,600
Players, please take the court.

140
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,439
Give it your best.

141
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:24,879
It's fine.

142
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,199
Match starts.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,399
They might be nervous at first.

144
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,079
That's normal.

145
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,839
Normal.

146
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,879
Was that out?

147
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,240
Referee.

148
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,120
That shot.

149
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,079
It's fine, you couldn't see.

150
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,890
It might have been...

151
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,199
Give it your best!

152
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,399
Yes, play like that.

153
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,790
- Give it your best.
- That's it.

154
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,399
What's wrong?

155
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,120
Did you twist your ankle?

156
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,600
Are you okay? Let me see.

157
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,639
An old injury.

158
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,820
It's always like this. I'm fine.

159
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,680
Let me rest a bit.

160
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:23,959
How are you?

161
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,720
Can you stand?

162
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,240
Why are you here?

163
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:26,800
Well...

164
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,519
Well...

165
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,120
I mean,

166
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,560
we can call a substitute.

167
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,319
A secret weapon.

168
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,120
Chun Ge, stop playing.

169
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,000
Go rest for a bit.

170
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,850
The match isn't over.

171
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,639
How can I rest?

172
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,399
Leave it to me.

173
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,199
Go.

174
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,000
Go.

175
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:39,920
Come on.

176
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,000
Leave it to me.

177
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,390
I'm fine.

178
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,910
No substitute needed. I can still play.

179
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,160
- Play?
- Play?

180
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,040
- Your ankle's twisted.
- Exactly. Sit down.

181
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,600
Lingering injury would be troublesome.

182
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,399
- I'm really fine.
- Stop being stubborn.

183
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,160
Sit down.

184
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,839
Go ask if we can have a substitution.

185
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,720
Referee!

186
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,600
Substitution.

187
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,240
His ankle...

188
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,120
Go back.

189
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,279
Sorry.

190
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,199
Substitution approved.

191
00:07:59,199 --> 00:07:59,759
Okay.

192
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,759
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

193
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,990
Players, please take the court.

194
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,580
Good luck.

195
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,560
Spray it.

196
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,040
Ice pack.

197
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,879
It's a little cold.

198
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,639
Careful.

199
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,040
Go.

200
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,240
It's fine.

201
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,160
Watch for a bit.

202
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:19,720
Nice.

203
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,250
Well played.

204
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:20,800
Great shot.

205
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,480
Not bad.

206
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,800
Pretty good.

207
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,720
Great shot.

208
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,200
Sorry.

209
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,039
I didn't mean it.

210
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,159
Press it yourself.

211
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,390
I'll watch the match for a bit.

212
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,000
Su Beilu

213
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,159
left the clinic. Why can he represent?

214
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,679
We said before

215
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,039
that he can play
within six months after leaving.

216
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,240
I asked him to come.

217
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,919
It's not over.

218
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,919
Keep going.

219
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,799
Hurry.

220
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,000
This kid has the flair
I had back in the day.

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Of course.

222
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,519
Feeling better?

223
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,759
Chun Ge.

224
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,960
Is your foot okay now?

225
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,759
Really?

226
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,799
I'm okay.

227
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:52,759
Look.

228
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
I can stand.

229
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,720
Let's eat together tonight.

230
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,440
We'll celebrate today's win.

231
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,559
Sichuan boiled fish.

232
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,879
There's a new place by the plaza.

233
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,039
Let's eat that.

234
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:03,480
Okay.

235
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,159
I don't eat fish.

236
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,360
I forgot.

237
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,080
Then...

238
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,240
Lamb pot?

239
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,799
I don't eat that either.

240
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,639
Chun Ge.

241
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,320
Didn't you eat lamb skewers?

242
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,080
Yeah.

243
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,200
I eat grilled ones,

244
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,679
but not lamb pot.

245
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,039
My mom said

246
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,000
it's too heaty,

247
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,159
so she doesn't let me eat it.

248
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,559
You're really not going?

249
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,080
Xiaomin has special plans today.

250
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,440
Chun Ge is injured.

251
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,399
Don't push him.

252
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,720
Rest well, Chun Ge.

253
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,639
You really not going?

254
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,080
It's fine.

255
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,360
You go without me.

256
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,200
Don't worry about me.

257
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,320
Go on.

258
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,159
Go on.

259
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,320
Don't worry about me. Really.

260
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,240
My mom cooked for me.

261
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,120
Rest well then.

262
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,990
Don't forget
to apply ointment on your foot.

263
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,559
We're off.

264
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,480
Bye.

265
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,159
Bye.

266
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,799
Bye.

267
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,840
So

268
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,990
Sichuan boiled fish then.

269
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,720
Okay.

270
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Lamb pot is good too.

271
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,559
No.

272
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,780
The newly opened fish restaurant
is offering discounts.

273
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,380
We'll get 50 back for spending 100.
And 100 back for spending 200.

274
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,639
We need you.

275
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,180
(You haven't logged into
Magic Sword Cangqiong for three days.)

276
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,240
(The wuxia world is waiting
for you to protect it.)

277
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,279
(Junior Brother.)

278
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,519
(You're slacking again.)

279
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,919
(Senior Sister.)

280
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,039
(I'm not.)

281
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,919
(No matter how much I train,)

282
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,279
(I can't reach
Sword Immortal Bai Qiongyu.)

283
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,519
(Don't say that.)

284
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,519
(To me,)

285
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,240
(you are Cangqiong Sect's hope.)

286
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,879
I succeeded.

287
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,240
Alright.

288
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,960
One more.

289
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,200
Son.

290
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,519
Dinner's ready.

291
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,600
Come eat.

292
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,360
Son...

293
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,840
Stop playing.

294
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
- The sea cucumber porridge is ready.
- Mom, wait.

295
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,240
Eat it while it's hot.

296
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,799
No, Mom.

297
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,679
I said no.

298
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,240
I won't drink it.

299
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,039
Go out and eat.

300
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,080
Dad.

301
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,759
Can I skip it?

302
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,200
Go out and drink it now.

303
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,799
Dad.

304
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,399
I've had this porridge all my life.

305
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,639
I never missed a meal.

306
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,919
I'm sick of it.

307
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,639
I don't want it anymore, okay?

308
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:06,039
Your mom cooks for over an hour daily.

309
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:06,860
Is that easy for her?

310
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,480
Can't you appreciate her effort?

311
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,720
You're tired
of the sea cucumber porridge?

312
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,240
That's because you were weak as a kid.

313
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,399
It was for your health.

314
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,879
Look at you now.

315
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,519
You just play games when you're home.

316
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,320
Or you play with your junk.

317
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,600
What else can you do?

318
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,000
Now you won't even eat properly.

319
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,360
You're useless.

320
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,159
What are you doing?

321
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,360
Yes.

322
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,279
I'm useless.

323
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,840
In your eyes,

324
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,600
haven't I always been useless?

325
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:38,960
I'm weak.

326
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,600
But I don't want to be!

327
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,960
I see them play on the court.

328
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,159
Do you think I'm not jealous?

329
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,919
I want to join them too.

330
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,000
Why must I be a wallflower?

331
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,440
I don't want that!

332
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,320
What's wrong with games?

333
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,480
What's wrong with figurines?

334
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,679
They're my hobbies.

335
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,039
Why...

336
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,600
Why can't you respect me a bit?

337
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,759
I'm already an adult.

338
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,320
Dad.

339
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,360
I don't even

340
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,840
have

341
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,799
the right to skip a meal
once in a while.

342
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,679
Why is it like this?

343
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,600
Dad.

344
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,440
I really don't understand.

345
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,190
I don't want this anymore.

346
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
I've had enough.

347
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,600
Son.

348
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,720
What are you doing?

349
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,399
Son.

350
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,360
Son.

351
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,519
Stop chasing him.

352
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,399
Let him go.

353
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,279
Dad didn't mean that, Son.

354
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,440
Let's eat.

355
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,759
What are you doing?

356
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,519
He hasn't eaten yet.

357
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,660
Whether he eats is up to him.

358
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,360
Come on, follow me.

359
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:51,639
Take this.

360
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,820
(Yashe)

361
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,559
Good evening, Boss.

362
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,360
Sorry to bother you.

363
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,159
Chun Ge?

364
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,260
Are you looking for Su Beilu?

365
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,399
He's off work already.

366
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,240
No.

367
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,840
I'm not...

368
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,480
Is it closing time?

369
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,000
Then I won't disturb you.

370
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,039
It's fine.

371
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,759
What's wrong?

372
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,440
You look troubled.

373
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,919
What is it?

374
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,919
No, I just

375
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,360
passed by.

376
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,990
I came in to take a look
since I'm already here.

377
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,679
What's wrong with your leg?

378
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,840
Are you hurt?

379
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,799
I twisted it playing badminton.

380
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,759
It's fine.

381
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:16,320
It's fine.

382
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,879
Really.

383
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,519
Seems things aren't going well.

384
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,360
Anything I can help with?

385
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,480
It's nothing.

386
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,799
I see.

387
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,039
Come with me.

388
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,120
I have a daybed here.

389
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,919
You can rest here.

390
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,559
Think about life.

391
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,120
I've heard a saying.

392
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,279
No matter how big the trouble,

393
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,440
sleep it off.

394
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,080
After you wake up,

395
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,440
it might be solved.

396
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,759
Boss, don't bother.

397
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,879
I'll just sit for a bit.

398
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,750
Make yourself at home.

399
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,159
Thanks, Boss.

400
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,240
You're welcome.

401
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,079
An ancient pillow?

402
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,079
It's so hard.

403
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,079
Can anyone sleep on this?

404
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,680
Sleeping like this must have been
torture to ancient people.

405
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,200
Can you even fall asleep like this?

406
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,519
Where am I?

407
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,960
Lanfeng Pavilion?

408
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,319
I can see clearly now.

409
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,079
You're awake.

410
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,839
Boss.

411
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,880
Why are you cosplaying?

412
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,119
I almost didn't recognize you.

413
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,359
Why am I dressed like this?

414
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,960
My hair is long too.

415
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,240
Disciple of Cangqiong Sect, listen up.

416
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,640
Cangqiong Sect?

417
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,839
Magic Sword Cangqiong?

418
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,279
I'm inside the game world?

419
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,119
You fell off a cliff.

420
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,519
To save your life,

421
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,359
I transferred my inner power to you.

422
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,920
You transferred

423
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,519
your inner power to me?

424
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,640
Boss, stop joking.

425
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,290
I barely have strength
to play badminton.

426
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,960
How would I have inner power?

427
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,359
I shattered this?

428
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,880
More precisely,

429
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,440
you shattered it with my inner power.

430
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,559
Boss, no.

431
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,480
That's too big.

432
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:47,920
Quick.

433
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,640
Put it down.

434
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,119
Boss. Listen to me. Put it down.

435
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,160
Try it.

436
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,359
(Chun Ge,
Combat Power)

437
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,839
I can use martial arts now?

438
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,480
I've become stronger.

439
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,559
I'm really stronger.

440
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,240
This feels amazing.

441
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:53,960
Wait.

442
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,119
If I'm a Cangqiong Sect disciple,

443
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,480
then you're Sword Immortal Bai Qiongyu.

444
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,279
Sword Immortal.

445
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,000
Sword Immortal.

446
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,200
Sword Immortal!

447
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:25,079
Only the benevolent are invincible.

448
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,839
(Sword Immortal's Sword)
Only the brave are fearless.

449
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,519
Use this inner power
for something meaningful.

450
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,559
Do not betray my trust.

451
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,960
It really is Sword Immortal Bai Qiongyu.

452
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,480
Cangqiong Sect.

453
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,599
This entrance looks grander
than in the game.

454
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:00,799
Wait.

455
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,200
Where are they all going?

456
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,079
Get lost.

457
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,680
What's with that attitude?

458
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,000
Bro.

459
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,279
Can you tell me what's happening?

460
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,240
Even if I told you,

461
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
what could you do?

462
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,160
Stop causing trouble.

463
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,960
Exactly.

464
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,319
They treat me the same in the game.

465
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,820
(Tang Yansheng,
Cangqiong Sect Leader)

466
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,960
Dr. Tang?

467
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,240
What nonsense are you saying?

468
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,090
Where's the physician?

469
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,140
(Min
Cangqiong Sect Senior Sister)

470
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,960
Xiaomin?

471
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:48,960
You're here too?

472
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,920
Of course I am.

473
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,820
You, on the other hand,

474
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,460
I told you to fetch a physician
for three days. Where are they now?

475
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,440
I don't know.

476
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,400
Min, don't blame him.

477
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:58,400
Father.

478
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,720
Father.

479
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,599
He became your father?

480
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,799
He's your master.

481
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,000
Now he's my master too?

482
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,039
Did you lose your memory,
or are you playing dumb?

483
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,000
He was injured a few days ago
by Long Zhentian, head of Tianlong Cult.

484
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,119
He's badly hurt now.

485
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,920
Yet you couldn't even find a physician.

486
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,000
Head of Tianlong Cult?

487
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,799
I haven't played that part yet.

488
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,599
Chun is back.

489
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,920
Su Beilu?

490
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,390
- Senior Brother.
- Senior Brother.

491
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,160
Senior Brother.

492
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,600
Su Beilu, you're Senior Brother now?

493
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,900
(Su Beilu,
Senior Brother of Cangqiong Sect)

494
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,400
Impressive.

495
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,440
What are you doing?

496
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,390
This is your Senior Brother,
call him Senior Brother Su.

497
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,519
There's no time to explain.

498
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,680
Bao Wuji of the Tianlong Cult
is attacking.

499
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,400
- He's at the mountain entrance.
- What?

500
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,759
Bao Wuji?

501
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,720
How could this be?

502
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:43,839
Father.

503
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:48,279
Bao Wuji has mastered
Tianlong Cult's Purple Toad Skill.

504
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,359
You're no match for him.

505
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,599
I'll go fight him myself.

506
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,400
Father.

507
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,799
Don't go.

508
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,319
It's too dangerous for you.

509
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,319
Don't go.

510
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,079
Master.

511
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,200
Rest and recover.

512
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,279
Don't hurt yourself again.

513
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,079
I request to lead the disciples
to face the enemy.

514
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:04,960
Go ahead.

515
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,440
Yes.

516
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,440
Chun.

517
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,119
Min.

518
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,240
Take good care of Master.

519
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,720
The rest of you, follow me.

520
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,519
- Yes.
- Yes.

521
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,200
This...

522
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,839
Senior Brother Su. I'll go with you.

523
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:16,319
No.

524
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:17,660
I'm going too.

525
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,220
(Bao Wuji
Tianlong Cult Protector)

526
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:39,799
Bao Wuji.

527
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,000
Our sect has no grudge
against Tianlong Cult.

528
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,599
Besides, we've always kept to ourselves.

529
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,880
Why are you so relentless?

530
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,839
Why?

531
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,359
Recently,

532
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,319
Cangqiong Sect

533
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,680
have secretly allied with other sects,

534
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,559
planning to unite against Tianlong Cult.

535
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,039
Do you think we didn't know?

536
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,079
Your leader Long Zhentian
injured my master,

537
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,799
and now you come here with your people.

538
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,799
You repeatedly provoked us.

539
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,599
Why is that?

540
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,240
You were unjust first.

541
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,680
Don't blame me for being unrighteous.

542
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,039
Sir?

543
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:12,480
Chun? Weren't you supposed
to take care of Master?

544
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,520
Why are you adding trouble?

545
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,799
It really is you.

546
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,119
But what's with that outfit

547
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,000
And your eyes

548
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,680
and hair.

549
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,559
It's ridiculous.

550
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,480
Why are you also a villain here?

551
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,079
Silence.

552
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,880
Where did this brat come from?

553
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,880
How dare you act
so presumptuously in front of me?

554
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,279
Watch me...

555
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,079
I've long been annoyed by you.

556
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,279
You flaunt your power
in front of us every day,

557
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,839
making us clock in.

558
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:39,680
Clock in.

559
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,359
Clock in?

560
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,480
What?

561
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,079
I should be clocking you.

562
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,960
That's what you said outside!

563
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,359
Attack!

564
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,359
Don't come closer!

565
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,160
Chun.

566
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,960
When did you master such inner power?

567
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,279
Don't ask.

568
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,119
I just learned it.

569
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,960
You've gone too far.

570
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,519
Forcing me to make a move?

571
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,200
Junior Brother, step back.

572
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,160
You can't beat him.

573
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,200
Disciples.

574
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,720
Beware of his Purple Toad Skill.

575
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,200
Today I was careless.

576
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:16,680
Just you wait.

577
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,480
I will return!

578
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,240
Retreat!

579
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,279
Hold on.

580
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,390
Don't chase a fleeing enemy.

581
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,920
I'll hit you every time you come.

582
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,359
Amazing, Chun Ge.

583
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,519
When did you get this strong?

584
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:33,359
Yes.

585
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,400
I didn't even see that move clearly.

586
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,519
Exactly, Chun.

587
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,279
How did you even do it?

588
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,640
Chun.

589
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,240
Thank you for helping.

590
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:43,359
No.

591
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:44,960
More precisely,

592
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,960
you turned the tide.

593
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,519
You exaggerated.

594
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,039
I...

595
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,519
I just thought

596
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,160
they shouldn't be
making a move at our entrance.

597
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:55,279
Besides,

598
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:56,799
they injured Senior Brother,

599
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,440
and Xiaomin was next.

600
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,279
I couldn't allow that.

601
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,799
But you can't just
put yourself in front of me either.

602
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,279
What if you got hurt?

603
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,400
I will never let them touch you.

604
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,079
In fact,

605
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,240
not only did you not lose,

606
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,470
- Sect Leader.
- Sect Leader.

607
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,839
but you actually won.

608
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,599
And you did so with great honor.

609
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,960
Chun, come.

610
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,200
Chun.

611
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,200
I underestimated you.

612
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,240
I didn't expect you
to be such a martial prodigy.

613
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,960
You secretly mastered
such profound inner power.

614
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,880
Tell me

615
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:37,960
how you

616
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,559
master this inner power?

617
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,960
Share a bit

618
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,240
with your fellow disciples.

619
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,119
- Yes.
- Yes.

620
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,130
- Share it.
- Share it.

621
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,920
Actually, I...

622
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,839
I

623
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,920
haven't really trained much.

624
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,039
You're too modest.

625
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,039
Teach us when you're free.

626
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:57,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

627
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,000
- Teach us.
- Teach us.

628
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,079
Alright.

629
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,000
Winning this battle

630
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,680
and defending the sect's honor are good.

631
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,559
As for the process...

632
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,440
You should all learn from Chun Ge.

633
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,359
Train in private

634
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,720
and do it diligently.

635
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,119
One day,

636
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,279
you too will have your moment like him.

637
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,640
- Master.
- Master.

638
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,359
Yes.

639
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,359
Master.

640
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,319
How about you head back and rest first?

641
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,000
Alright.

642
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,240
Disperse.

643
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

644
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,519
Chun.

645
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,759
Come with me.

646
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,160
I have an important task for you.

647
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,000
Recently,

648
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,319
Tianlong Cult has been
causing trouble repeatedly.

649
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,799
The Five Great Sects

650
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:47,039
are also greatly disturbed.

651
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,200
I

652
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,400
have secretly negotiated multiple times

653
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:52,319
with the other sect leaders,

654
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,960
preparing to form an alliance

655
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,119
to resist Tianlong Cult together.

656
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,000
So that Bao guy

657
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,480
was telling the truth.

658
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,079
Actually, tomorrow

659
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,799
I have already arranged

660
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,759
to meet with the leaders
of all major sects

661
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,400
at Zongyu Mountain of Langya Sect

662
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,240
to discuss attacking Tianlong Cult.

663
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,880
But with my current health...

664
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,400
Chun.

665
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,240
Could you

666
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,519
represent Cangqiong Sect

667
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,200
and attend the meeting in my place?

668
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,839
Me?

669
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,519
Master.

670
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,160
Don't kid me.

671
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,799
I think

672
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,759
something this important

673
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,160
would be more suitable
for Senior Brother.

674
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,279
No.

675
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:47,920
Master.

676
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:49,440
I'm serious.

677
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,480
Think about it.

678
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
I'm just a nobody.

679
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,160
If I go there,

680
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,680
no one will listen to me.

681
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,799
They don't care about me.

682
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,720
And if I say the wrong thing,

683
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,559
I could embarrass our sect.

684
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,240
Right?

685
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,400
Master, you...

686
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,680
You should reconsider.

687
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,759
Who said you're a nobody?

688
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,400
Chun.

689
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,559
Kneel.

690
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,640
I, Tang Yansheng,
third leader of Cangqiong Sect,

691
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,160
appoint Chun Ge, fourth-generation
disciple of Cangqiong Sect,

692
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,440
to temporarily assume

693
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,000
the position of Sect Leader.

694
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,839
Chun Ge.

695
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,400
Receive the leader's seal.

696
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,759
This way,

697
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,480
no one will underestimate you
as the acting sect leader.

698
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,119
You can now

699
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:47,440
legitimately attend the meeting.

700
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,319
Master.

701
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,039
This seems even less appropriate.

702
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,960
Senior Brother should be the one
inheriting the sect leader's seal.

703
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,519
No,

704
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,200
you are.

705
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,680
Master once said

706
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:03,079
whoever first masters
the ten-level inner power technique

707
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,279
will inherit the sect leader position.

708
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,000
Your inner power

709
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,440
is clearly above mine.

710
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,000
This seal

711
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,799
rightfully belongs to you.

712
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,240
I won't make the wrong judgment.

713
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,640
Take the seal.

714
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,440
Master, I...

715
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:26,799
Chun.

716
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,440
Please take the seal.

717
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,620
(Cangqiong Sect Seal,
Prestige)

718
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,279
Sorry.

719
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,319
I admit

720
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,960
I was a bit harsh before.

721
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,359
I didn't expect

722
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,559
you would improve so quickly.

723
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,559
What?

724
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,580
You're not happy being the sect leader?

725
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,279
No.

726
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,440
Master wants me to represent our sect

727
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,039
and attend some…

728
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,880
Five Great Sects' secret meeting.

729
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:17,519
Isn't that a good thing?

730
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,759
You don't want to go?

731
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,799
Not exactly.

732
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,160
Look.

733
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,690
I don't understand martial world rules.

734
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,839
I don't even know the names

735
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,000
of those sects.

736
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:29,119
Thinking about it makes me more nervous.

737
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,960
When I was little and went with Father

738
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,839
to martial arts tournaments,
I felt the same.

739
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,839
I was nervous.

740
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:36,839
But don't worry,

741
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,519
the sect leaders

742
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,319
are all loyal and righteous.

743
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,100
They won't
make things difficult for you.

744
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,039
How about this?

745
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,960
Aren't you worried?

746
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,400
I'll go with you tomorrow.

747
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,039
Really?

748
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,839
I'm already familiar with it anyway.

749
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,400
Besides, I've met those sect leaders
a few times.

750
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,559
With me introducing you,

751
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,240
it will indeed be safer.

752
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,599
Then,

753
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:04,960
it's settled.

754
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,920
Thank you so much.

755
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,480
Why are you so polite?

756
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,239
Sect Leader

757
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,000
Chun.

758
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:14,990
Rest early. See you tomorrow.

759
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,199
See you tomorrow.

760
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,140
(Intimacy)

761
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,220
(Zongyu Mountain)

762
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,639
We're approaching Zongyu Mountain.

763
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,519
The path is muddy.

764
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,800
Let the horses rest.

765
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,480
Wait.

766
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,840
These hoof prints are unusual.

767
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,519
This is considered a key route.

768
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,639
Seeing hoof prints on the ground
should be usual.

769
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,119
No.

770
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,960
These are Tianlong Cult's
distinctive horseshoes.

771
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,760
They're here.

772
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,360
I've heard about it.

773
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,360
On the way back last time,

774
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,440
Tang

775
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
(Linglong Sect, Sect Leader Shi)
ran into Long Zhentian head-on.

776
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,119
(Youyou Sect, Qiao, Langya Sect, Lu)
Who knows what happened?

777
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:39,800
Could it be

778
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,440
nothing's left?

779
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,480
Don't talk nonsense.

780
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,440
(Qinghe Sect Leader Ye)
Sect Leader Tang is experienced.

781
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,039
If they do meet,

782
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:48,119
Long Zhentian will likely suffer.

783
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:53,440
If nothing happens, he should appear.

784
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,280
Look at the time.

785
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,320
No more waiting.

786
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,519
We're here.

787
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,559
Cangqiong Sect disciple, Chun Ge.

788
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,119
Min.

789
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,559
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

790
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,519
Where is your master?

791
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,159
Master is unwell
and is in seclusion to recuperate.

792
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:10,599
As the acting sect leader,

793
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,320
I've come specifically

794
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,440
to meet with you.

795
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,920
What did I say?

796
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,519
Trouble is imminent.

797
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,159
Did your master encounter danger?

798
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,480
Is he seriously injured?

799
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,079
He's fine.

800
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,440
What matters now

801
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:25,199
is for you to leave.

802
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,199
This secret meeting spot
may have been exposed.

803
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,760
Staying longer could be dangerous.

804
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,000
Sect Leaders.

805
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,320
On our way here,

806
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,079
we found traces
of Tianlong Cult cavalry.

807
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,079
What?

808
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,880
Could some information have leaked?

809
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,079
Even if what you say is true,

810
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,519
Tianlong Cult is nothing to fear.

811
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,599
If they cause trouble
on Zongyu Mountain,

812
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,800
I'll make sure they go back dead.

813
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,239
Sect Leader Lu.

814
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,960
Now is not the time to be rash.

815
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,920
Although we are sect leaders,

816
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,400
the enemy is strong in manpower.

817
00:36:58,639 --> 00:36:59,679
And they're in hiding.

818
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,239
If they trap us deep in these mountains,

819
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,239
just with Langya Sect disciples

820
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,400
and us together,

821
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,159
we may not escape.

822
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,559
I'll wait here for them.

823
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,719
Let's see
what Tianlong Cult can do to me.

824
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,039
What do you think, Sect Leader Qiao?

825
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,360
Asleep again?

826
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,320
Old man.

827
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,559
Wake up.

828
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:21,280
Time to rise.

829
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,400
Sect Leader Qiao.

830
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:29,800
Sect Leader Qiao.

831
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,599
What's going on?

832
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:41,920
This tea is poisoned.

833
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Judging by his symptoms,

834
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,450
it should be Tianlong Cult's
Bone-Melting Tendon‑Softening Poison.

835
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,920
Bao Wuji?

836
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,360
You again?

837
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,960
You poisoned him?

838
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,480
Exactly.

839
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,760
Langya Sect's disciples

840
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,239
aren't that loyal.

841
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,880
Traitors.

842
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,639
I'll slaughter you all.

843
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:29,880
Sect Leader Lu.

844
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,000
We're doomed.

845
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:40,480
Ambushed in our own home.

846
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,280
You great sects are
secretly conspiring here,

847
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,719
completely disregarding Tianlong Cult,
the supreme of the martial world.

848
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,440
Today,

849
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,360
I, on behalf of the cult leader,

850
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,119
will wipe out

851
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,599
all you crooked sects.

852
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,320
Who are you calling a crooked sect?

853
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,079
You're the crooked sect.

854
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,760
Why is it you again?

855
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,119
Why can't it be me?

856
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,599
Perfect timing.

857
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,559
I'll wipe you out too.

858
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:09,920
Min.

859
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,000
Take care of the sect leaders.

860
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,800
Leave the rest

861
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,679
to me.
