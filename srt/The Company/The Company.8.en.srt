After today,

00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,040
we will be

00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,439
officially graduated.

9
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,480
Come.

10
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,519
Let's take a picture together.

11
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,560
We graduated!

12
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,280
Su Beilu,

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,479
please report
to the HR department next Monday.

14
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,759
What does it mean?

15
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,520
Are you a fool?

16
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,039
You are hired!

17
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,520
Me?

18
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,439
I've been hired?

19
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,879
You found a job!

20
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,360
I found a job!

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,080
Yes!

22
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,400
I found a job!

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,080
I found a job!

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,560
I'm the only one without a job now.

25
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,120
It's fine.

26
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,000
I can transfer my luck to you.

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,039
Get ready!

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,560
Wait.

29
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,520
Congratulations.

30
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,199
I...

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,680
I am hired too!

32
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,599
We are colleagues!

33
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,879
Colleagues!

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,479
We are colleagues!

35
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,120
Thank you.

36
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,260
If you hadn't brought be
to interview at Chongle Hospital,

37
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,830
I wouldn't have gotten this opportunity.

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,919
We will surely cherish it,

39
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,599
right?

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,400
You're welcome!

41
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,199
We are buddies, after all!

42
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,919
Come on.

43
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,919
Give me a hug!

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,360
Give me a hug!

45
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,560
My son!

46
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
Mom!

47
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:17,080
You are my pride.

48
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,479
Here.

49
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,080
Flowers.

50
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,199
Mom.

51
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:19,960
You must feel hot.

52
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,759
When I make money,

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,879
I will surely buy you

54
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,960
delicious food,

55
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,340
warm clothes, and useful things.

56
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,479
Silly Child.

57
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,159
I just want you to be healthy,

58
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,159
safe and happy.

59
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,520
Mrs. Chun.

60
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,439
Here.

61
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,000
It's yours.

62
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,360
I have one too?

63
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,639
Of course.

64
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,759
From now on,

65
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,080
both of you must help each other

66
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,560
to strive forward steadfastly

67
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,639
on the path of medicine to become a respected,

68
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,599
benevolent, and compassionate doctor.

69
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,759
Mom.

70
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,360
College of Veterinary Medicine.

71
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,240
We are learning to become a veterinary.

72
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,080
We don't treat people.

73
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,199
You are still doctors.

74
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:52,960
They are all lives.

75
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,759
Right, Beilu?

76
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,560
Come. Let me take a photo for both of you.

77
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,240
Come.

78
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,000
Sure.

79
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,360
One, two, three.

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,360
Great.

81
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,280
Let's take a photo together.

82
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,719
One, two, three.

83
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,840
Help me and my son take a photo.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,479
All right.

85
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,319
Come on.

86
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,080
Come.

87
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,620
(Year 2017)

88
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,720
Hurry.

89
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,820
The teacher is coming soon.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,240
Why is this so high?

91
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,000
Hurry up.

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,279
Hua is giving birth.

93
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:30,879
Hurry!

94
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,319
Hurry!

95
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,000
Wait for me.

96
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,759
I told you to jump down
using that as a cushion

97
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,720
but you just had to jump down directly.

98
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,040
I'm afraid of heights.

99
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,199
I didn't even dare look down.

100
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,591
I think I sprained my ankle.

101
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,600
Seriously.

102
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,800
We said

103
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,439
we'd witness Hua give birth to puppies.

104
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,160
In your condition,
should we get you treated or go see Hua?

105
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,720
Why don't...

106
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,279
Why don't you leave me here

107
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,360
and go alone?

108
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800
Go on.

109
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:01,680
Go.

110
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:03,879
Come on.

111
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,920
I'll carry you.

112
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,040
Get up.

113
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,399
Where are we going?

114
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Going to the front door?

115
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,240
If you go to the front door,
we'll be scolded.

116
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,439
Whatever.

117
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,879
Just tell them
I was the one who told you to jump.

118
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,820
(Year 2007)

119
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,879
What...

120
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,759
What do you want to do?

121
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,879
Do you see what's on Long?

122
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,720
There's a grain of rice

123
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,000
on his face.

124
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
We are talking about his arm.

125
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,600
Su Beilu,

126
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,480
show him!

127
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,639
(Is this the real Su Beilu?)

128
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,439
Green Dragon on the left.

129
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,920
White Tiger on the right.

130
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,079
Do you know how great I am know?

131
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,839
What should you call me?

132
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,040
Long...

133
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,560
Goodie Long!

134
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,079
- Granny!
- Goodie Long!

135
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,959
Goodie Long.

136
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,279
I finally found you.
Come home with me quickly.

137
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,820
Otherwise, your father will beat you up.

138
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,839
All of you should go back too.

139
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,560
- No.
- Go back.

140
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,360
No!

141
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,439
No.

142
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,240
Listen to me.

143
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,800
Good boy.

144
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,800
I'm not going back.

145
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,620
If you don't go back,
what if your father beats you?

146
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,360
No!

147
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,240
Listen to me.

148
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,000
Good boy.

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,839
No!

150
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,079
- No!
- Listen to me.

151
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,120
You scared me.

152
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
I was so scared.

153
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Let me out!

154
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,839
Open the door!

155
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,680
Let me out!

156
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,639
Hey!

157
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,639
Can you not open the door?

158
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,879
Hey,

159
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,600
you need to calm down.

160
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,759
I want my mom!

161
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,879
I don't want to be calm!

162
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,560
If you don't stay calm, I'm leaving.

163
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't!

164
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll stop knocking, all right?

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,600
Go to the window first.

166
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,720
You tried to open from the inside
but it didn't work, right?

167
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,839
I did.

168
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,720
It didn't work.

169
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,240
That means
it is locked from the outside.

170
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,360
Do you have a piece of card that's hard?

171
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,839
What are you trying to do?

172
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,639
Open the lock and save you.

173
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,600
I learned it from the movies.

174
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,319
This is the hardest one I have.

175
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,000
Hurry!

176
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,480
It really works!

177
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
The movie doesn't lie.

178
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,480
Thank you.

179
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,360
You are my savior.

180
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,920
I broke your card.

181
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,360
It's fine.

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,120
Let's go home together.

183
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,360
That's right.

184
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,879
Your name is Su Beilu, right?

185
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,040
I am Chun Ge.

186
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,279
Chun Ge?

187
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,839
Your name is so weird.

188
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,079
(Su Beilu is Su Beilu.)

189
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,600
(He is indeed unrelated to Qin.)

190
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,920
(Whatever. I should watch everything.)

191
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,140
(Year 2006)

192
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,560
Chen!

193
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,730
Give me a bottle of soy sauce.

194
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,120
Please wait.

195
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,919
Two yuan.

196
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,080
Put it on my tab.

197
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,480
Your granny knows what to do.

198
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,290
Where's your granny?

199
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,519
She went to take stock.

200
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,639
She's not back yet?

201
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,080
I guess she didn't catch the bus.

202
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,799
If she hasn't returned by tonight

203
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,720
and you feel hungry,

204
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,960
come and eat at my place.

205
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,799
Are you alone as well?

206
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,240
Celebrate my birthday with me, then.

207
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,279
I made a puppy for myself.

208
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,799
Now that I have you with me,

209
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,480
I'll give you this puppy.

210
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,279
What is your name?

211
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,080
I don't think you have a name.

212
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,200
I'll call you Yellow.

213
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,960
When Granny comes back,
we'll have delicious food.

214
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,399
I'll share some with you.

215
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,260
(Year 2005)

216
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,600
(I was here before.)

217
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,720
(What does Su Beilu
have to do with this?)

218
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,919
(This is bad.)

219
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,240
(I'll meet myself from the past.)

220
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,279
Is the person inside all right?

221
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,200
Is anyone alive?

222
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,320
How are you?

223
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,919
He's dying.

224
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:50,679
Come on.

225
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,799
Don't fall asleep.

226
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,279
Someone will come and save you.

227
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,720
Hurry.

228
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,279
(Su Beilu was the child
I rescued many years ago?)

229
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,120
(Su Beilu's resemblance to Qin
is just a coincidence.)

230
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:31,720
(What am I)

231
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,399
(actually hoping for?)

232
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,480
It's raining so heavily.
Why are you here?

233
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,480
Can you first
let me come inside for shelter?

234
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,360
Thank you.

235
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,020
(Yashe)

236
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,799
That's right.

237
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,279
I'm returning this to you.

238
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,200
Why are you giving me money?

239
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:00,519
I was chased out by my landlady.

240
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,900
She returned me my deposit
so I can return the money to you.

241
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,330
You got chased out by your landlady?

242
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,720
Why?

243
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,120
Because of it.

244
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,360
Don't be afraid.

245
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,279
It is just a puppy.

246
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,010
The landlady chased me out

247
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,990
because she found out
that I was keeping a puppy.

248
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,799
Why are you keeping a dog?

249
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,399
Its owner brought it
to the hospital for treatment.

250
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,279
(Chongle Pet Hospital)
What are you doing? Give it to me.

251
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:27,960
Move!

252
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,320
X-ray doesn't lie!
There's bone callus formation.

253
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,120
That means it's an old injury.
It wasn't hit by a car.

254
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,000
It was beaten by you!

255
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,799
Nonsense!

256
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,720
I didn't!

257
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,840
Move!

258
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,360
He hit me!

259
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,240
Everyone saw it!

260
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,279
He hit me!

261
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,360
Manager, he was lying!

262
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,279
Move!

263
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,360
He hit me!

264
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,600
I'm going to report all of you!

265
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,159
Go on.

266
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,000
Dog Torturer!

267
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,750
Apologize to him first.

268
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,240
No!

269
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,950
I didn't do anything wrong!

270
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,600
Many people are watching.
Apologize to him first.

271
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,080
- I didn't do anything wrong!
- Su Beilu!

272
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,679
I exposed him
for torturing a dog in public.

273
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,279
Later,

274
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,720
the manager fired me.

275
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,919
Next, I adopted it

276
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,360
and gave it a name, Tuanzi.

277
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,080
I saved a life.

278
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,480
It's worth it to be fired
because of you, Tuanzi.

279
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:07,879
Here.

280
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,679
Eat more.

281
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,879
You are quite optimistic.

282
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,039
I'm already used to it.

283
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,840
Whenever I am late,

284
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,000
my superior will be early.

285
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,960
When I try to dry my blanket,
it starts raining.

286
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,320
When I change to another line
while queuing up,

287
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,759
the original line goes faster.

288
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,840
There's one more thing

289
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,440
that I haven't told you.

290
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,159
When I was young,

291
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,679
my parents passed away.

292
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,440
I was raised by my granny.

293
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,759
A few years ago, she passed away as well.

294
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,279
You said I had a good attitude,

295
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,480
but if I don't

296
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:44,679
live optimistically,

297
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,039
I would never live at all.

298
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,840
Bad days will eventually pass.

299
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,559
You are so strong and optimistic.

300
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,320
It'll surely get better.

301
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,240
Have some hot water.

302
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,160
I think the rain has stopped.

303
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,440
We'll head back first.

304
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,850
Thank you for your hot water
and your encouragement.

305
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,039
Tuanzi,

306
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,320
let's go.

307
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Bye.

308
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,360
Why don't you stay a night here?

309
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,679
I have a bed here.

310
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,240
It's fine.

311
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,799
I promised my friend.

312
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,120
You will catch a cold
when you're drenched like this.

313
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,960
Your dog, too.

314
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,200
Let me get you a blanket and a towel.

315
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,480
I feel really bad about troubling you.

316
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,360
Thank you.

317
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,039
Tuanzi,

318
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,240
let's sleep here tonight. All right?

319
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,680
You are right.

320
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,839
Life will be better.

321
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:17,799
See?

322
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,599
It's already better.

323
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,200
That's right.

324
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,799
Can I charge my device anywhere?

325
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,000
My phone is dead.

326
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,680
Can you help me

327
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,440
charge my phone?

328
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,359
Give it to me.

329
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,640
Thank you.

330
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,000
My little Tuanzi.

331
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,400
Rest early.

332
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,359
Good night.

333
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,160
Good night.

334
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,960
Are you full?

335
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,039
Do you want to eat more?

336
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,140
(Yashe)

337
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,200
(Thank you for last night.)

338
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,440
(Tuanzi and I will leave first.)

339
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,640
(The breakfast
is my payment for my stay.)

340
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,880
Hello.

341
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,119
I'm the owner of this phone.

342
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,440
Did you pick up my phone?

343
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,119
Where are you?

344
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,390
I'll come and get it from you right away.

345
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,079
It's me, Bizhi.

346
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,440
I left my phone
charging at your place last night.

347
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,079
That's great.

348
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,279
I thought I lost my phone.

349
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,759
Can you deliver my phone to me?

350
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Where are you?

351
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,960
My address is...

352
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,000
If you take a taxi,
you need to go to the junction and...

353
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,160
Yellow, let me see
if your eyes are getting better.

354
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,119
We just need to put some eye drops

355
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,480
and you'll almost be fine.

356
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,359
Good boy.

357
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,839
Let me see

358
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,000
if you have any ear mites.

359
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Looks good over here.

360
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,680
Let's look at your other ear.

361
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,279
No ear mites over here too.

362
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,079
Here.

363
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,920
Drink this.

364
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,400
Hello.

365
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,400
Hello.

366
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,279
Are you here to adopt or donate?

367
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,519
I'm here to see him.

368
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,759
Dr. Su?

369
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,000
He usually runs free clinics here.

370
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,920
Look at my adoption center.

371
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,000
It's not for profit.

372
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,190
We are only depending
on the donation of kind people.

373
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,279
Moreover, Dr. Su's salary isn't high.

374
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:26,400
I heard he even lost his job recently.

375
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,559
But these dog food

376
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,319
and medicine

377
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,440
for cats and dogs

378
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,880
were all provided by Dr. Su.

379
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,440
He's such a good kid.

380
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,359
Bizhi!

381
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,690
I'll leave you two alone.

382
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,200
Thank you.

383
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,839
You're welcome.

384
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,599
I'm sorry for troubling you to come here.

385
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,960
Thank you.

386
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,519
Come in.

387
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,480
There's no need.

388
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,160
Do you

389
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,839
plan to work here in the future?

390
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,359
This place is good.

391
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,720
Besides, this is
the only thing I'm good at.

392
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,359
But this job doesn't pay.

393
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,500
How do you plan to survive?

394
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,759
For some reason, the nearby pet shops
haven't been hiring recently.

395
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,480
I saw recruitment notices
on the internet.

396
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,370
I called them
and they said they were hiring,

397
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,160
but after I submitted by details,

398
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,680
they said they weren't hiring anymore.

399
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,980
When are we going back
to the past again?

400
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,190
I've been quite free recently.

401
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,599
Perhaps I can still remember something.

402
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,500
You don't need to do this anymore.

403
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,599
You are not him.

404
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,279
You know everything?

405
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm just curious.

406
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,690
I want to go back
to the past to have fun.

407
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,960
Sorry.

408
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,440
Am I prohibited

409
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,440
from going to Yashe anymore?

410
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,240
No.

411
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,440
You must come every day.

412
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm planning to give you a job

413
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,799
as an assistant at Yashe.

414
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:12,680
Are you interested?

415
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,079
Yes!

416
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,920
Do I help you sell antiques?

417
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,920
Does selling antiques
make a lot of money?

418
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,960
But I'm bad at history.

419
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,119
I'm a science student.

420
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,480
Moreover, I have low EQ.

421
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,519
I might offend customers.

422
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,640
That was how I lost my previous job.

423
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,599
But you don't have a phone.

424
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,960
Why don't I buy one for you, Bizhi?

425
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:28,759
Oh,

426
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,839
I can't call you Bizhi.

427
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,240
You are my boss now.

428
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,390
I'll call you Mister from now on.

429
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,240
Is that fine, Mister?

430
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,599
I regret it a little now.

431
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,119
Let me consider it.

432
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,240
Don't regret it!

433
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,680
I'll surely do my best!

434
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,400
I'll let every customer feel like home!

435
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,230
Tomorrow at ten in the morning.
Don't be late.

436
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,640
All right!

437
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,839
Ten in the morning!

438
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,839
I'll be punctual!

439
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,640
Yellow!

440
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,119
I found a job!

441
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,319
(Home of Love)
What do you want to eat?

442
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,480
Ice cream.

443
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,680
Ice cream!

444
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,359
All right!

445
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,370
I'll buy for all of you!

446
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,759
Welcome to Yashe.

447
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,799
(Welcome)
I'm your guide, Su Beilu.

448
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,000
(Welcome)
If you need anything,

449
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,480
you can ask me about it.

450
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,440
What are you doing?

451
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,319
What is this you're wearing?

452
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,680
What do you think?
I asked them for an expedited delivery.

453
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,559
Take it off.

454
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,279
Take it off now!

455
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,799
You are my boss.

456
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,079
You call the shots.

457
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:34,680
Anyone?

458
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,799
Welcome.

459
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,240
Master Dong?

460
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,119
You, again?

461
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,359
Are you surprised?

462
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,680
I'm an official employee of Yashe now.

463
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,599
You are an employee?

464
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,079
Wait...

465
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,759
With your quality,

466
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,359
can you even become an employee here?

467
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,599
I graduate
with a bachelor's degree after all.

468
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,400
Fine.

469
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,803
Let me give you a test.

470
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,720
Take this chair, for example.

471
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,039
Tell me about this chair's material,

472
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:04,759
workmanship,

473
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:05,759
and era.

474
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,640
Explain it to me.

475
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,680
Today is his first day at work.
He doesn't know anything.

476
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,599
Master Dong, please forgive him.

477
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,359
Mister,

478
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,279
I was just fooling around with him.

479
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,799
Where's the floor cleaner?

480
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:29,480
This place is huge.

481
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,519
Is this a warehouse?

482
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,680
Don't move.

483
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,160
You are not allowed to enter this room.

484
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,880
I...

485
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,599
I'm finding a cleaner for Xuanwu.

486
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,119
I thought this was the warehouse.

487
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,799
This is not a warehouse.

488
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,720
Anyway, you are not supposed

489
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,079
to enter this room.

490
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,039
Yes.

491
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,519
Sorry.

492
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,359
Follow me.

493
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,000
There's also a yard here?

494
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,240
I've always wanted a yard
since I was young

495
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,680
so I can bathe in the sun
and keep a dog.

496
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,160
Read this.

497
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,140
(5,000 Years of China)

498
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,119
Are you scolding me?

499
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,200
Studying requires
a step-by-step approach.

500
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,610
Then, you won't be in trouble when you
deal with customers like Master Dong.

501
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,799
Study well.

502
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,820
(5,000 Years of China)

503
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,200
What are you doing?

504
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,480
Wake up and go to work.

505
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,720
There are no customers.

506
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,160
Do you think it's easy to make money?

507
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,839
Your work isn't just to watch the shop.

508
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,559
Work is here.

509
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,240
You talk a lot.

510
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,119
Follow me.

511
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,200
Your remote control has three rings.

512
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,440
What does this mean?

513
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,480
Time, location,
and geographical position.

514
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,839
How do you use it?

515
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,599
Teach me.

516
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,240
You don't need to know.

517
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,079
When we go, you must...

518
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:38,640
I know.

519
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:39,920
Three promises.

520
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,880
One,

521
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,039
don't run around.

522
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:42,680
Two,

523
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,640
don't shout.

524
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,759
Three, don't disturb
the lives of ancient people.

525
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:46,960
I remember everything.

526
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,519
There's also the most important thing.

527
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,880
Don't change other people's fate?

528
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,960
It's be careful.

529
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,480
Safety first.

530
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,480
Understood.

531
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,839
Let's go!

532
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,880
Are you sure
the coordinates are correct?

533
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:17,079
Who's staying here?

534
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,440
We even have to come here at night.

535
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,599
I'm sure it's here.

536
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,039
Do you...

537
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,559
Do you feel

538
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,799
it's getting emptier

539
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,559
and creepier?

540
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,599
Are you sure this is the place?

541
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:48,559
I think

542
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,920
it's this place.

543
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,039
Why don't you confirm it again?

544
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,440
Liuqing Comb.

545
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,359
Gu Huaijin.

546
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,400
We need to walk ten li southeast

547
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,920
from this bamboo forest.

548
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,559
Gu Huaijin's grave?

549
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,680
Ghost!

550
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,400
Su Beilu.

551
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,240
Come back, Su Beilu!

552
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,799
Wait for me!

553
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,119
Su Beilu!

554
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:35,880
Madam,

555
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,640
we are leaving.

556
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,359
Sure.

557
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,039
Take care.

558
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,440
Why are you running?

559
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,559
Both of us went there
without doing anything wrong.

560
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,400
Why did you run?

561
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,960
I am the boss and I didn't even run.

562
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,640
Why did you run?

563
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,160
No.

564
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,559
You asked me to go after the general,

565
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,570
save someone
from jumping down a building,

566
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,440
or go into a fire and that's fine.

567
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
But you didn't tell me
there were ghost stories

568
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,359
among the missions.

569
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
There aren't any ghosts!

570
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,000
There are no ghosts!

571
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,319
How are there ghosts
in this time and age?

572
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,650
We are going to search for clues.

573
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,640
That is a grave.

574
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,000
Tianguang Market's Little Ancestor
is never wrong.

575
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,680
You were startled

576
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,759
and made me find nothing.

577
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,559
That was a dead person.

578
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:15,799
Tailor Du, you're here.

579
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:16,160
I'm here.

580
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,880
The same?

581
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,599
Yes. The same.

582
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:18,079
Sure.

583
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:18,720
Keep the money.

584
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,160
All right.

585
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,839
Come back again.

586
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:20,480
Sure.

587
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:22,720
Madam,

588
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,440
I'm leaving.

589
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,880
Zhang, you're done?

590
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:25,839
Sure.

591
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:26,920
Come back again.

592
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,279
Madam.

593
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,039
How long have you been opened?

594
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,079
Probably

595
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,079
15 or 16 years.

596
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,400
Can I ask you about someone?

597
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,640
Sure.

598
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:39,160
Her name is Gu Huaijin.

599
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,519
She's also from Qinghe City.

600
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,880
Why are you asking about her?

601
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,580
It's useless to ask like this.

602
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:50,039
Madam, give me a basket of meatbuns.

603
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,039
A basket?

604
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,240
A whole basket.

605
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,680
Coming!

606
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,960
A whole basket.

607
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,240
What a big basket.

608
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,680
Can you finish them all?
Don't waste them.

609
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,480
Madam,

610
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,920
look.

611
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,440
We've bought so many meatbuns.

612
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,920
Just tell us something.

613
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,559
Hold on.

614
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,240
What are you both doing?

615
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,880
We write storybooks.

616
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,720
We just want to write
about Gu Huaijin's story.

617
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,319
That's right.

618
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,160
Well,

619
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,920
I can reveal something.

620
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,519
What happened to the Gu family back then

621
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,839
was too cruel.

622
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,559
Gu Huaijin was the daughter
of the escort leader, Gu Xuantong.

623
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,921
The Gu family went everywhere
without failing their missions.

624
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,839
However, during an escort mission,

625
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,880
she was killed by bandits.

626
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,359
Only the young master,

627
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:51,319
Gu Bingyu was left in the family.

628
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:55,660
(Escort Agency Gu)

629
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,359
Both of you are...

630
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,200
We are businessmen from a foreign land
and are drawn by this place's fame.

631
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,990
We are looking for
Young Master Gu Bingyu.

632
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,680
May I know

633
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,799
if he's in?

634
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,359
Young Master went on an escort mission.

635
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,279
He won't be back for some time.

636
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,000
Both of you,

637
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,359
please come back again.

638
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,319
Why are both of you

639
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,200
(Pu Jingtang)

640
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,359
looking for Young Master Gu?

641
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,440
We have some items

642
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:24,799
to show Young Master Gu.

643
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,160
It's fine.

644
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,359
We will come back another day.

645
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,300
(Escort Agency Gu)

646
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,740
(Gu Bingyu)

647
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,119
Everyone,

648
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,039
let's rest up.

649
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,079
Peng.

650
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,720
Leader.

651
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,720
I'm not familiar with the routes here.

652
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,000
I want to scout ahead.

653
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,880
I'll leave the goods

654
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,920
in your care.

655
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,400
Sure.

656
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,039
No problem.

657
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,400
Don't worry, Leader.

658
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,599
Master Peng.

659
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,119
Have a pastry.

660
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:25,839
Yes.

661
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:35,799
Si!

662
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,480
Si!

663
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,599
The wine from the post house just now

664
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,359
must be poisoned.

665
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,599
Si!

666
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,640
Si!

667
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:49,119
Er!

668
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:51,880
San!

669
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,160
Stop, all of you!

670
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:37,839
Don't move!

671
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,400
It seems like

672
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,039
you are prepared.

673
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,279
Tell us who your employer is.

674
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,640
I'll spare you.

675
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,319
Do whatever you want

676
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,920
with me!

677
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,200
Get up!

678
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,359
Why is there a woman?

679
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,799
Leader, what should we do with them?

680
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:07,839
Release them.

681
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:08,760
Release them?

682
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,480
Why?

683
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,239
- We're just releasing them?
- We're just releasing them?

684
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,239
Release them!

685
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,199
Get lost!

686
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,679
Get lost!

687
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,519
I don't understand.

688
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,199
Since you killed some of them,

689
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,960
why did you leave some alive?

690
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,400
If they are just a few ordinary bandits,

691
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,760
we don't have to worry.

692
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,920
However,
these people pretend to be bandits

693
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,199
yet they act like our peers.

694
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,679
Peng, think about it.

695
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:45,920
Bribing post houses

696
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,119
isn't something
that ordinary bandits are capable of.

697
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:51,400
So, I'm sure

698
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,519
the robbery

699
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,519
must be organized
by another escort agency.

700
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,599
So, not only are we sparing their lives

701
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,719
to relay the information

702
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,639
but also to warn them?

703
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,400
That's right.

704
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,159
We need to show them

705
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:09,320
that the Gu family of Qinghe City
isn't as declined as they imagined.

706
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,760
Everyone who offends us

707
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,519
will be killed.

708
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,140
(Escort Agency Gu)

709
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,800
My sister was dead for three years

710
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,840
and you've played the zither here
for three years.

711
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,119
That person is gone.

712
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,920
Meeting and separation is fleeting.

713
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:58,559
Life and death is like an illusion.

714
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,400
Why do you...

715
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,239
I came back from an escort

716
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,519
I'm tired.

717
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:11,039
You should rest early, Pu.

718
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,880
The magnolias are blooming again.

719
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,760
It's Huaijin's

720
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,519
favorite season again.

721
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,800
For the outer strings one and two,
use a light strum

722
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:53,199
or a heavy plucking.

723
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,559
For the inner strings six and seven,
use a light stroke

724
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,639
or a heavy...

725
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,599
Huaijin.

726
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,159
(Gu Huaijin)

727
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,320
Can you

728
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,480
be calm for a moment?

729
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,400
I'm quite calm.

730
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,199
I'm calmly
listening to you play the zither

731
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,119
and calmly practicing my swordsmanship.

732
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,230
Your father asked me
to teach you how to play zither

733
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,800
just to calm your temper

734
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:19,800
and be elegant.

735
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,960
My father asked you to teach me these

736
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,199
for noble reasons

737
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,360
but in truth,

738
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,719
he just wants
to raise an obedient sheep.

739
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,639
When I'm at the age of marriage,

740
00:37:30,646 --> 00:37:33,320
he will marry me to a good family
to serve other people's parents,

741
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,639
my husband and teach my children.

742
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,920
But that's not what I want.

743
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,880
I don't want to become
an obedient livestock.

744
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,960
What do you want?

745
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,199
I want to become a fit eagle

746
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,400
to roam the martial world.

747
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,360
I don't want to become somebody's wife.

748
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,440
Pu Jingtang,

749
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,679
do you want me
to become someone else's wife?

750
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,679
Your lesson today isn't over yet.

751
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,400
That's enough.

752
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,320
Stop it, Huaijin.

753
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:58,400
The escort team
will depart in 15 minutes.

754
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,990
Whose goods are you escorting today?

755
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,719
I know.

756
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,239
Escort Agency Gu keeps its secrets.

757
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,320
But I already saw it.

758
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,250
You are escorting goods
for the Du residence of Cangzhou, right?

759
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,960
You are amazing.

760
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,700
You can already lead an escort
for the most noble family in Cangzhou.

761
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,039
Unlike me.

762
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:32,719
Bingyu,

763
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,079
I'm already familiar

764
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,790
with the few moves
you taught me in secret.

765
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,790
When are you
going to teach me the other moves?

766
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,679
You should

767
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,000
focus on practicing zither instead.

768
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,719
Jingtang is too nice

769
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
and has spoiled you.

770
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:45,880
Him?

771
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,639
Of course, he can't control me.

772
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,000
Honestly speaking,

773
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,719
I don't know if it's right or wrong

774
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,880
to teach you these ways of killing.

775
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,840
What's wrong?

776
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,480
Did Mother scold you?

777
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,679
Or have you regretted it?

778
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,519
You are courageous

779
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:14,880
and intelligent.

780
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:16,719
You are way better than me.

781
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,599
We are just a year apart.

782
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,880
Right now,

783
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,840
you are the face of the Gu family

784
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,960
and the leader of all heroes.

785
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,639
However, I'm just trapped.

786
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,590
The Gu family has never allowed a woman
to be the chief escort.

787
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,239
If I get to decide my own life,

788
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,880
even if

789
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,360
my life is full of dangers,

790
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,239
I'm still willing to accept it.

791
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,980
Take these sword manuals and scriptures

792
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:22,559
and study them.

793
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,599
Remember.

794
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,280
Don't let Mother find out.

795
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:27,559
Sure.

796
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,950
I'll spar with you when you return.

797
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,159
Thank you, Bingyu.

798
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:31,400
I promise you.

799
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,060
When you achieved success in learning,

800
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,600
we will run escort missions together.

801
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,719
If you hadn't spoiled Huaijin

802
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:51,199
and let her run escort missions,

803
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,000
she wouldn't be dead.

804
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,159
Who ordered you to rob us?

806
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,320
(Huaijin,)

807
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,000
(no one will force you
to play the zither anymore.)

808
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:49,639
Right now,

809
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,320
you only care
about bringing honor to the ancestors

810
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,519
and reviving the Gu family.

811
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,840
It's all right.

812
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,760
I, Pu Jingtang,

813
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,880
will avenge Huaijin.

814
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,760
How do you know

815
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,360
that I won't be taking revenge?
