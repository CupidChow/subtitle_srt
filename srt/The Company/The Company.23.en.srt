2
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,860
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,140
=Episode 23=

4
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,359
Gu Zhiqian's paintings

5
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:49,000
are full of liveliness and energy.

6
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,200
He must have been someone
who roamed freely

7
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,519
among mountains and rivers.

8
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,239
I don't know why he became
like this now.

9
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,680
Then I also ask you,

10
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,439
I am also lively and energetic.

11
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,680
If this continues,

12
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,879
I'll end up just like him.

13
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,879
If you don't want to study,

14
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,360
then go to sleep quickly.

15
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,120
I need to close the window,

16
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,599
so he won't notice.

17
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,800
It's strange.

18
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,680
What is it?

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,840
He…

20
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,039
The light in his study is out.

21
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,919
It was on just now.

22
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,560
Didn't he say
he'd study through the night?

23
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,439
Brother, this painting is excellent.

24
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,680
Truly excellent.

25
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,919
Wait...

26
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,680
Brother?

27
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,439
What does this painting

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,080
still lack?

29
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,879
Who is he talking to?

30
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,479
Autumn has deepened,

31
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,800
the mountains lie desolate.

32
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,560
It feels truly cold and lonely.

33
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,960
This hint of human presence here

34
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,599
is perfect.

35
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,439
Perfect, indeed.

36
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,159
Did you see that?

37
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,840
That painting is moving.

38
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,759
"My master has gone to gather herbs,

39
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,520
somewhere within these mountains.

40
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,479
The clouds are too thick
to see through."

41
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,240
In that case,

42
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,039
then I'll paint the man who asks the boy
for directions under the pines.

43
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,080
Brother, are you a hermit?

44
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,400
To me,

45
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,719
you are like an apothecary
hidden in the mountains.

46
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,599
Though we are separated

47
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,800
by life and death,

48
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,080
my heart still yearns for you.

49
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,199
"The Five Peaks stand
at the heart of heaven and earth.

50
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,720
I hear that you remain,

51
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
still upon the highest summit."

52
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,279
Brother, that ease of spirit

53
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,040
is something I, Gu Zhiqian,

54
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,879
will never master in this lifetime.

55
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,160
What's going on here?

56
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,279
Is someone painting together with him?

57
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,519
Could it be…

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,079
Zhao Wanli.

59
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,460
(Youlan Alley)

60
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,279
Serves you right.

61
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,759
I told you not to mess
with that hole on the roof.

62
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,480
You just wouldn't listen.

63
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,519
Clumsy as ever.

64
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,290
Do you think
you're some sky-leaping monkey?

65
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,360
I've got it.

66
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,600
I've got it.

67
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,000
Got what?

68
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,639
Look.

69
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,680
The storm over Jiang City has passed,

70
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,319
by dusk, brush and ink turn cool.

71
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,560
Gu just wrote this.

72
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,199
Who's Gu?

73
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,720
I've waited over half a month for him.

74
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,560
It nearly drove me mad.

75
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,160
I need to head back.

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,839
I need to answer this.

77
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,639
Watch where you're going.

78
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,639
The storm over Jiang City has passed,

79
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,439
by dusk, brush and ink turn cool.

80
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,399
The storm over Jiang City has passed,

81
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,360
by dusk, brush and ink turn cool.

82
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,990
Though my hair is white,
my spirit is still strong,

83
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,920
my ambition for the clouds
remains unfulfilled.

84
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,680
I've got it.

85
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,399
I've got it!

86
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,120
Though my hair is white,
my spirit is still strong,

87
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,319
my ambition for the clouds
remains unfulfilled.

88
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,399
Gu,

89
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,519
are you satisfied with this?

90
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,800
It's finally finished.

91
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,680
Gu,

92
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,120
is that you?

93
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,920
Indeed, it is I.

94
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,959
Who might you be?

95
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,160
I am Zhao Wanli.

96
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:28,839
To meet you today

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,839
is truly my great fortune.

98
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,519
Zhao!

99
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,200
Gu.

100
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,600
You went silent for over half a month.

101
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,200
Have you been well?

102
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,600
I was painting in the courtyard,

103
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,679
then fell asleep in the pavilion.

104
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,120
I caught a chill because of that.

105
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,519
Thank you for your concern, Zhao.

106
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,000
As long as you're well.

107
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,720
As long as you're well.

108
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,159
An Autumn Twilight Painting.

109
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,279
The scenery truly is breathtaking.

110
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,919
To see it today,

111
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,720
I could die without regret.

112
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:11,080
Alas, time so easily casts people aside.

113
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,360
Now it is already the sun sinking
at the edge of the abyss.

114
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,679
It's late into autumn.

115
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,399
Gu, I must disagree.

116
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,720
Liu Mengde once wrote,

117
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,399
"Since ancient times,
people mourn autumn's desolation.

118
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,240
I say autumn surpasses
the spring morning."

119
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,480
Look at today's autumn scenery.

120
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,320
It's filled with autumn's colors.

121
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,279
How is it any less
than the splendor of youth?

122
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,519
Gu,

123
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,039
your brushwork is superb.

124
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,159
Look at my leg.

125
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,919
I can no longer seek famous mountains,

126
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,279
nor visit scenic wonders.

127
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,799
This painting

128
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,960
was done beside
a ruined pond in my courtyard,

129
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,519
painted after broken stones
and withered trees.

130
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,159
I have long been trapped in here.

131
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,519
I'm of no use anymore.

132
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,720
Gu, that is even more mistaken.

133
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,360
When I was young,

134
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,000
a mountain was simply a mountain.

135
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,840
After years of life,

136
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,679
a mountain was no longer a mountain,

137
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,399
as though lost in mist.

138
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,080
And now, Gu,

139
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,679
to be able to paint,

140
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,159
from a ruined pond, such beauty,

141
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,440
it turns out a mountain is
still a mountain,

142
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,879
only that it is no longer the same one.

143
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,080
You've long surpassed

144
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,919
that youth who once
trusted only his soaring brush.

145
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,519
Zhao, you truly understand me.

146
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,159
It was not in vain

147
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,799
that fate allowed you and me to meet.

148
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,879
The storm over Jiang City has passed,

149
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,919
by dusk, brush and ink turn cool.

150
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,390
Though my hair is white,
my spirit is still strong,

151
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,919
my ambition for the clouds
remains unfulfilled.

152
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:23,679
Zhao.

153
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,240
At my age now,

154
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,639
with nothing to my name,

155
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,720
can my spirit still be strong?

156
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,120
In my lifetime, I have seen countless
works of calligraphy and painting.

157
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,759
Yet among them all,

158
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,960
only your paintings are
my greatest love.

159
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,639
I believe that
if your heart remains strong,

160
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,000
your name will endure through the ages,

161
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,559
never fading away!

162
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,480
All my life, I, Gu Zhiqian,

163
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:01,320
chased fame and glory,

164
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,759
and squandered my youth.

165
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,360
Worse still,
I failed those who loved me.

166
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,120
I once thought that my life

167
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,679
would amount to nothing at all.

168
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,759
But I never expected

169
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,080
to meet a confidant like you, Zhao.

170
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,840
As long as even
one true confidant remains,

171
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,039
then I, Gu Zhiqian,

172
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:34,600
have not lived this life in vain.

173
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,399
Zhao,

174
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,879
thank you.

175
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,360
Zhao Wanli!

176
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,320
Gu!

177
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,440
Gu!

178
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,879
You're finally awake.

179
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,679
Why…

180
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,799
Why am I here?

181
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,919
You reckless fool.

182
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,279
I told you not to drink so much.

183
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,559
You'll drink yourself to death!

184
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,720
You weren't breathing.

185
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,080
I called, but you wouldn't wake up.

186
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:09,960
I thought…

187
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,919
I thought…

188
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,840
You nearly scared me to death.

189
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,240
Alright.

190
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,080
Don't cry now.

191
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,159
Don't cry.

192
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,240
I beg you,

193
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,480
please don't cry.

194
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,159
Alright?

195
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,240
You…

196
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,240
Don't cry.

197
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,759
I'm perfectly fine, see?

198
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,360
Don't cry.

199
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,240
Don't cry.

200
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,360
You absolute fool.

201
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,000
I was so worried!

202
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,679
You fool!

203
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,799
I'm a fool.

204
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,840
I'm a fool.

205
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:06,799
I'm a fool.

206
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,120
I've let you down all these years.

207
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,600
I'm a fool

208
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,240
for making you wait until now.

209
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,720
I was a fool for thinking
only of my own prospects

210
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,759
and freedom.

211
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,519
In the end, I've let you down.

212
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,180
What nonsense are you talking about?

213
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,720
Zhou'er.

214
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,600
Zhou'er.

215
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,480
Zhou'er.

216
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,639
Just now, a friend of mine told me

217
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,720
that he spent his life chasing fame,

218
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,159
only to squander his youth,

219
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,720
and let those who loved him down.

220
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,320
Now, he regrets it.

221
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,200
I don't want to repeat his mistake.

222
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,519
I want to be with you.

223
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,840
Stop talking.

224
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,679
I'm not ready yet.

225
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,480
Alright.

226
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,279
It was too sudden.

227
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,399
It really was.

228
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,559
From this day on,

229
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,240
I'll treat you well.

230
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,100
I'll do good where I can,

231
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,879
and not ask about the future.

232
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,639
How's that?

233
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,600
You're smiling.

234
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,159
That's good.

235
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,679
That's good.

236
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,279
Come.

237
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,159
I promise you,

238
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,240
I'll never drink again.

239
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,279
All that wine was a family heirloom.

240
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,919
My father saved it back then,
thinking I'd marry one day.

241
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,159
You drank it all dry.

242
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,159
There's not even a drop left.

243
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:39,600
Yes.

244
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,840
Not a single jug left.

245
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,600
Not even a drop?

246
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,679
You just promised
you wouldn't drink again.

247
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:48,919
You fool.

248
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:49,879
You're a cursed fool!

249
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:50,480
My dear,

250
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,799
I was just joking.

251
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:52,720
Just kidding.

252
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,879
I won't drink again. Never.

253
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,720
I've drunk the wine
meant for your marriage,

254
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,720
then you belong to me.

255
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,399
Isn't that simply fate at work?

256
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,799
Who says we're a match made by heaven?

257
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,000
My dear.

258
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,799
My dear!

259
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:24,919
Coming.

260
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,759
Scholar Zhao is here.

261
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,519
I came.

262
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,279
An Autumn Gift to a Friend.

263
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,919
This is Gu's original work.

264
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,399
Gu painted me.

265
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,480
Not just you.

266
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,679
He also said

267
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,279
you were the only
true confidant of his life.

268
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,880
You two...

269
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,480
How did you know?

270
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,599
Well, you never told us

271
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,079
how you became his confidant.

272
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,559
May I

273
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,680
keep this painting?

274
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,720
Of course.

275
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,759
Thank you.

276
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,799
Thank you.

277
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,920
To be honest,

278
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,440
we've already uncovered the secret
of the Autumn Twilight Painting.

279
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,079
We understand
the bond between you and Gu.

280
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
But the Liangzhu silk used
for the Autumn Twilight Painting

281
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,160
once belonged to a friend of ours.

282
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,720
That bond,

283
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,480
we hope you'll honor as well.

284
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,000
To me,

285
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,960
the painting is already complete.

286
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,079
And this painting

287
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,599
is Gu's token of friendship to me.

288
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,400
Alright.

289
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,720
I'll exchange
the Autumn Twilight Painting with you.

290
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,519
Please accept it.

291
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,440
Thank you.

292
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,799
As a gesture of thanks,

293
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,039
we also gave Madam Ran a sum of money.

294
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,440
You can renovate 3,000 Drunken Tavern

295
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,559
inside and out.

296
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,039
From now on,

297
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,720
plan your livelihood.

298
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,720
In that case,

299
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,119
many thanks to you both.

300
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,119
Take care.

301
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,039
Take care.

302
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,920
He's just asleep.

303
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,119
Zhao Wanli wasn't
talking nonsense after all.

304
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,000
He was telling the truth.

305
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,799
I never imagined this Liangzhu silk

306
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,319
could be so extraordinary.

307
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,920
For a solitary scholar,

308
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,960
being able to paint together
with Zhao Wanli

309
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,839
within this artwork,

310
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,390
their hearts perfectly in sync,

311
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,480
must have been the happiest time
of Gu Zhiqian's life.

312
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,039
I get what you mean,

313
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,759
but right now,

314
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,400
this is also the best moment for us

315
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,090
to take back
the Autumn Twilight Painting.

316
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,559
If we take it back now,

317
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,559
Zhao Wanli will never truly possess it,

318
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,640
and the world will never have this
peerless work painted by the two minds.

319
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,880
Then…

320
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,960
What should we do now?

321
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,599
Wait until he wakes up,

322
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,799
and ask him for a painting.

323
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,780
(Yashe)

324
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:16,160
Hey.

325
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,160
Su Beilu,

326
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,039
what are you thinking about?

327
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,039
For some reason,

328
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,279
the image of Zhao Wanli looking at
Autumn Gift to a Friend

329
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,000
while laughing and crying

330
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,279
just keeps replaying in my mind.

331
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,880
The two of them never even met,

332
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,680
they didn't exchange a single word.

333
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,279
Yet, through painting,

334
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,680
and through poetry,

335
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,400
they became each other's
only confidant for life.

336
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,079
The bonds between people

337
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,599
really are something magical.

338
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,119
They are.

339
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,960
Throughout one's life,

340
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,240
true friends and confidants

341
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,400
are incredibly rare.

342
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,319
And you?

343
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,960
Don't ask whether I've had one.

344
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,559
I did, once.

345
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,720
He's gone now.

346
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,799
But still,

347
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,920
I've gained another good friend.

348
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,400
Actually,

349
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,160
all those years in the past,

350
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,160
I'd always been on my own,

351
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,839
travelling to search
for those lost artifacts.

352
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Every place I went,

353
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,400
once I found what I was looking for,

354
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,680
I would leave immediately,

355
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,359
never staying a moment longer.

356
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,920
This era is actually

357
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,079
the one I stayed in the longest.

358
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,480
Ninghai,

359
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,480
an island resting on a calm sea.

360
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,319
Truly beautiful.

361
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,359
Anyone there?

362
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,000
Is the boss in?

363
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:28,599
There's a customer.

364
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:29,720
I'll go.

365
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:31,839
Coming.

366
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:29,039
Energy anomaly eliminated.

367
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,400
(This was the final piece.)

368
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,920
(I've completed my atonement.)

369
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,559
(It's time to return Yashe)

370
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,200
(and go back to my own era.)

371
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,200
Display my time travel return point.

372
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,079
Eleven years.

373
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,799
Every era has too many adverts.

374
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,480
Boss, could you come over?

375
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,960
A customer wants to buy something.

376
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:51,799
Coming.

377
00:25:54,100 --> 00:26:00,660
(Dushan Jade. A witness to dynasties.
Over 3000 years old.)

00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,900
(Year 3089)

379
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,740
(Fusheng Hall)

380
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:29,200
Esteemed collectors
from around the world,

381
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:32,759
I'm Ye Liangyin,
auctioneer of Fusheng Hall.

382
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,720
This auction will take place
at the end of the month.

383
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:39,319
This is the item up for auction.

384
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,519
To obtain it,

385
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,799
we paid an enormous price.

386
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:44,880
Now,

387
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,160
please enjoy this exceptionally
well-preserved treasure.

388
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:56,140
(Ye Liangyin,
Auctioneer of Fusheng Hall)

389
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,039
(Today)

390
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,640
(is the day of farewell.)

391
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:52,920
Su Beilu?

392
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,160
Su Beilu?

393
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,319
Tuanzi.

394
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,240
Su Beilu?

395
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,480
There's something
very important to tell you.

396
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,519
I never told you

397
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,759
about this surprise.

398
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,160
A surprise?

399
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,880
So?

400
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,200
Is it comfortable to sit in?

401
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,079
Does it look cool?

402
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,599
Master Dong,

403
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,519
no one says "cool" like that anymore.

404
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,480
Really?

405
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,079
No way.

406
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:02,720
Wait.

407
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,680
See?

408
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,119
Mr. Bi gets me.

409
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:05,759
Right?

410
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,400
No.

411
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,240
So where exactly are we going?

412
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,680
Xiasha Island.

413
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,400
Su Beilu said you wanted to go out,
so we picked Xiasha Island.

414
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,240
I wanted to go out?

415
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,440
Just pretend I did.

416
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:19,519
It's the weekend anyway,
everyone's free.

417
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,920
Think of it as team bonding.

418
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
I've always wanted
to go to Xiasha Island.

419
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,160
Come to think of it,
I've never been camping.

420
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,359
Let's make some good memories together.

421
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,640
The sea!

422
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,519
I'm here!

423
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,240
The sea!

424
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,240
I'm here!

425
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,160
Tuanzi, let's go.

426
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,519
Why the rush?

427
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,559
Wait for me!

428
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:57,319
Look at the boss, he's so composed.

429
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,200
Why are you all rushing?

430
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,720
That's wrong.

431
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:19,240
Wrong!

432
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,440
You did it wrong.

433
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,599
The instructions say

434
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,359
you have to do it

435
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,000
like this,

436
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,359
insert it at an angle.

437
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,759
Do you camp often?

438
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:30,640
Of course not.

439
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,240
If we camped all the time,

440
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,759
we wouldn't even
struggle to pitch a tent.

441
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,960
Most days,

442
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,480
we live in cities

443
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,240
of steel and concrete,

444
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,720
everything cold and rigid.

445
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,400
It's nothing like this.

446
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,279
Now, it's sunshine and beaches,

447
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,279
and sea breeze!

448
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,000
It just lifts your mood.

449
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,119
Yeah.

450
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,079
Pity chances like this
are getting rarer.

451
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,319
Come on.

452
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,839
Do it with me.

453
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:10,680
Like this.

454
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,480
What are you doing?

455
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,480
Just try it.

456
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,680
No, it's too silly.

457
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,799
Hurry up.

458
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,599
That's it.

459
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,680
So?

460
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,240
Doesn't it...

461
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,680
feel really nice?

462
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,240
Super relaxing.

463
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:40,920
It feels like

464
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,759
you've become part of nature.

465
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,480
You don't like it?

466
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,839
No, I really like it.

467
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:08,079
I like how the sand
slowly slips through my fingers.

468
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,079
The gentle sea breeze
brushes past my face.

469
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,319
My sweat

470
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,680
mixed with fine grains of sand.

471
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,839
I also like

472
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,440
this terribly put-together tent.

473
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,200
I like everything here, Su Beilu.

474
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,240
Thank you.

475
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,920
That's more like it.

476
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,440
Come on.

477
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,240
Let's finish setting up the tent,

478
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,039
or we'll have nowhere to sleep tonight.

479
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,519
Come on.

480
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,880
Lift this side.

481
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,240
Are you two a couple?

482
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,880
Couples get half price.

483
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,519
Yes.

484
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,359
Still missing something.

485
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,839
Still not quite there.

486
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,359
Alright, hold that pose and don't move.

487
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,000
Thirty minutes.

488
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,039
Thirty minutes?

489
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,039
Miss,

490
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,880
I'm painting, not taking photos.

491
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,599
Thirty minutes will fly by.
Hang in there.

492
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,039
Yeah.

493
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,640
It'll be done soon.

494
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:57,319
Just hold on.

495
00:33:57,799 --> 00:33:58,480
Okay.

496
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:01,559
Don't move.

497
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,319
Hold the same pose as before.

498
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,119
It's actually pretty cute.

499
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,920
You know what,
it really does look like you.

500
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,079
You look like it too.

501
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,159
Look at those big eyes.

502
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,559
Time to pay.

503
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,280
- I'll pay.
- I will.

504
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,119
- I'll do it.
- Me.

505
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:36,920
I've got it.

506
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,679
Let me pay for it.

507
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,519
No, I asked you to draw this.

508
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:40,599
I can't let you pay too.

509
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,119
It's scanned.

510
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,039
Alright, you go ahead.

511
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,639
Done pretending after it's done?

512
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,400
I...

513
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,480
This is just how we usually get along.

514
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,280
Yeah.

515
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,320
That's nice.

516
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,800
Honestly, you two suit each other.

517
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,239
Alright then, we'll get going.

518
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,800
- Thanks.
- Thank you so much.

519
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,440
Go on.

520
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,679
Wait.

521
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,039
Love bubbles.

522
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,039
For couples only.

523
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:14,920
Have fun.

524
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,400
Thank you.

525
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,519
You're welcome.

526
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,320
Thanks a lot.

527
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,480
Who'd play with something this childish?

528
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:37,960
Why does he like
bubble solution so much?

529
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:39,920
Come to think of it,

530
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,560
he's been like this since he was little.

531
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,920
This kid is really something.

532
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,320
One bottle of bubbles and he's gone.

533
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,400
Miss,

534
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,800
do I get bubble solution with a drawing?

535
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,000
Do one for me.

536
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,400
Sir,

537
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:14,000
it's for couples only.

538
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,119
Couples only?

539
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,039
Fine, forget it.

540
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,400
Looking down on single people, huh?
