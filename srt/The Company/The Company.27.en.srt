00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:41,140
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,140
=Episode 27=

4
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,400
Enjoy.

5
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,879
Please enjoy your tea.

6
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,599
Excellent tea.

7
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,680
I see you know a thing or two
about tea as well, Miss Ye.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,519
I only know a little.

9
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,840
You're far too modest.

10
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,800
By the way, Master Dong,

11
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:11,879
I've heard

12
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,120
you have a gallery

13
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,400
with quite a collection.

14
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,759
Could I see it?

15
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
I didn't think you'd know

16
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,000
about my little private gallery.

17
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,639
Of course, you can.

18
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,560
Is it far?

19
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,680
It's in the back hall.

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,039
If it isn't too much trouble...

21
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,199
Not at all!

22
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,560
We can go right now.

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,360
Please, Miss Ye.

24
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,479
This way.

25
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,439
Miss Ye,

26
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,400
please come in.

27
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,120
It's too messy.

28
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:46,560
Master Dong,
you really have a lot of collectibles.

29
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,120
Bronze items,

30
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,719
porcelain, clocks,

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,759
and everything.

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,439
It's all small stuff,

33
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,280
nothing major.

34
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,199
You are being too modest.

35
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,120
Not at all.

36
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:58,866
Miss Ye, look,
this Xing Kiln Water Vessel,

37
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:00,330
and the double-handled incense burner,

38
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,080
plus these Yuan dynasty
blue-and-white porcelains.

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,479
They're all my labor of love.

40
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,479
Often, some collectors

41
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,319
come here

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,840
to buy and take home.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,479
Just a few days ago,
I sold a bronze sword.

44
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,189
Miss Ye, feel free to look around.

45
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,088
If something catches your eye,
just let me know.

46
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:15,200
We can negotiate the price.

47
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,759
Great!

48
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,319
But Master Dong,

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,039
why do I only see objects,

50
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,560
and no calligraphy or paintings?

51
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,879
Miss Ye,
do you like calligraphy and paintings?

52
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,599
They are downstairs.

53
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,360
I'll take you to see them. Come.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,400
Miss Ye,

55
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,199
come.

56
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,159
This entire room is full
of calligraphy and paintings.

57
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,199
Feel free to look.

58
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,000
Miss Ye,

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
don't mind this place.

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,599
It's a bit worn,

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,080
but these are marks of time.

62
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,159
Even my old house

63
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,560
is part of my collection.

64
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,919
This house itself

65
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,639
is truly an authentic ancient residence.

66
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,240
How is it?

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,680
Master Dong,

68
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,560
where did you

69
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,000
get this painting?

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,879
I found it at a street stall.

71
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,070
All these are worthless.
The valuable ones are here.

72
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,079
Miss Ye, come over.

73
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,319
Look at these.

74
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,839
These are all genuine works.

75
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:35,430
I've already seen all of these.

76
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:36,680
Thank you, Master Dong.

77
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,279
You've seen it all?

78
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,279
Miss Ye,

79
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,279
you didn't like any of them, huh?

80
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,800
I still have better ones.

81
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,480
Please, Miss Ye.

82
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,920
Miss Ye,

83
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,120
take care.

84
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,519
Master Dong.

85
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,399
Young man,

86
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,000
you're here.

87
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,044
I brought you some fruit.

88
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,680
You're thoughtful.

89
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,720
I'll take it.

90
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,700
(Rain Manor)

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,829
Miss Ye.

92
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,480
The Spring Stream Painting is inside.

93
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,519
We can prepare to act.

94
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,600
I've checked.

95
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,911
This city has exceptional
geographic advantages.

96
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,290
The weather is favorable all year.
No disasters or hardships.

97
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,560
This building is a one-story house
built in the late 1970s.

98
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:25,155
Very solid.

99
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:27,666
Even if an earthquake occurs,
it would be counterproductive.

100
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,800
No need for drastic measures.

101
00:05:32,888 --> 00:05:34,630
The owner of the Spring Stream Painting

102
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,879
doesn't even know
that he has a genuine piece.

103
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,160
We just need to create some

104
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,079
minor, trivial incidents.

105
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,560
This...

106
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,977
You even have to think about this?

107
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,439
Drive.

108
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,399
Yes.

109
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,480
Why did my water pipe burst?

110
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,439
My precious!

111
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,600
It's all ruined!

112
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,519
The treasures I've collected
for 30 years!

113
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,160
They're all flooded!

114
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,288
Can you stop crying?

115
00:06:09,311 --> 00:06:10,720
You've been crying all night!

116
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,079
You really give me a headache.

117
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,959
Didn't I tell you it's not serious?

118
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,959
How is it not serious?

119
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,439
It's already like this.

120
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:18,270
I've looked at these paintings of yours.

121
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,560
None of them is genuine.

122
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,600
The most damaged items are just these.

123
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,879
I have a way to fix the rest.

124
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,759
What way?

125
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,800
Two hundred yuan?

126
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,399
If so, I might as well hire a cleaner.

127
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,279
You actually think 200 yuan is enough?

128
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,600
I've been busy all night.

129
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,439
Two thousand yuan.

130
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,120
Two thousand yuan?

131
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,829
This entire room isn't worth 2,000 yuan.

132
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,355
And you're asking me for 2,000 yuan?

133
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:41,750
What are you scheming?

134
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,720
Fine.

135
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,279
Then tidy it up yourself.

136
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,879
Let's do it together.

137
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,639
Can I offer you 1,000 yuan?

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,920
I'll help you.

139
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,399
Just by breaking one water pipe,

140
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,560
we replaced the painting.

141
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Miss Ye's plan is indeed brilliant.

142
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,519
Miss Ye,

143
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,279
it's genuine.

144
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,399
Good.

145
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:11,377
Well done.

146
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:13,680
Actually, that person
doesn't understand paintings at all.

147
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,079
Why didn't you just buy it?

148
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,399
At Fusheng Hall,

149
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,720
we never alter fixed points in history.

150
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,519
In history,

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,480
Master Dong did not sell this painting.

152
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,519
To avoid the oversight
of the Time Administration,

153
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,319
we had to swap it stealthily.

154
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,120
Though it's troublesome,

155
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,399
it's also safe.

156
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,439
The Spring Stream.

157
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
The Summer Cooling.

158
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,680
The Winter Chill.

159
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,079
Perfect.

160
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,510
Only the
Autumn Twilight Painting remains.

161
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,160
Yun,

162
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,720
put these three paintings
in the warehouse.

163
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,199
Then I'll go out first.

164
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,879
Miss Ye,

165
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,160
which warehouse
should these paintings go into?

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,519
Then put them

167
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,079
in the 25th-century warehouse.

168
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:17,639
Alright.

169
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,480
By the way,

170
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,399
recently, the Time Administration
has made new moves.

171
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,800
Be very careful when you send them
to the warehouse.

172
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,920
Understood.

173
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,320
By the way, Miss Ye,

174
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,879
a few days ago, a guest said

175
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:36,711
that he has
the Autumn Twilight Painting.

176
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,600
(If Dushan Jade)

177
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,000
(also obtained by Fusheng Hall)

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,399
(using the same method as the
Coiled Dragon Bronze Tripod Cauldron,)

179
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,480
(then)

180
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,600
(did someone kill Ziyi)

181
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,480
(before the fire?)

182
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,440
Mr. Bizhi,

183
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,000
may I invite you to bring
the Autumn Twilight Painting

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,799
and meet us offline?

185
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,960
Yes.

186
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
You choose the location.

187
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,440
The address has been sent.

188
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,870
(The fate of interfering with history)

189
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,840
(and harming the innocent...)

190
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,039
(You will know it sooner or later.)

191
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,799
Mr. Bizhi,

192
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,159
we meet again.

193
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,279
This place is really hard to find.

194
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,279
Of course.

195
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,629
The Autumn Twilight Painting

196
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,560
is a legendary treasure
in the collecting world.

197
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,240
If we go somewhere public,

198
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,159
it might be discovered
by someone with ulterior motives.

199
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,320
A legendary treasure.

200
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,879
Now it's in my hands.

201
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
You don't care

202
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,519
how I got it?

203
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,639
As long as what you bring is genuine,

204
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,279
Fusheng Hall never asks
how you obtained it.

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,320
Whether it's genuine,

206
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,200
can you tell?

207
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,159
Of course.

208
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,000
Please wait a little longer.

209
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,039
Of course.

210
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,789
Last time,
in Fusheng Hall's exhibit list,

211
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,755
I saw the Coiled Dragon Bronze
Tripod Cauldron.

212
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,559
You must have spent a lot on it.

213
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,639
Yes.

214
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,600
How did you get it?

215
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,480
That Coiled Dragon Bronze
Tripod Cauldron

216
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,279
was originally a cherished item
of an old collector in the past era.

217
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,279
Since information was scarce back then,

218
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,639
it was kept well hidden.

219
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,960
Later, due to an earthquake,

220
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,799
it left the original owner's hands.

221
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,559
Passing through many hands,

222
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,240
our colleagues managed to track it down.

223
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,360
That was indeed not easy.

224
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,240
How about the Dushan Jade?

225
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,679
Has it found a new owner?

226
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,080
Sorry.

227
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,080
Pardon me.

228
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,399
But I'm very interested in that piece.

229
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,080
I can hardly find any information on it.

230
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,399
Could it be

231
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,320
that it doesn't exist at all?

232
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
Or rather,

233
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,120
Fusheng Hall

234
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
intentionally fabricated its background?

235
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,519
We value our reputation
above everything.

236
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,080
How could we fabricate a background?

237
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,679
How did you get

238
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,639
that Dushan Jade?

239
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,360
That Dushan Jade

240
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,279
was the family seal of a prestigious
Han dynasty household,

241
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,759
passed down for a thousand years,

242
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,840
surviving many disasters.

243
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,559
Eventually, the descendants
took it overseas.

244
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,120
We also acquired it
at an astronomical price,

245
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,799
so it's not easily auctioned.

246
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,080
Astronomical price?

247
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,799
You probably didn't pay a single cent,
did you?

248
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,519
That prestigious family

249
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,720
was surnamed Qin.

250
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,480
That jade could have saved the life
of Young Master Qin.

251
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,960
But the envoy delivering
the jade was killed.

252
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,399
Young Master Qin

253
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,200
also died in the fire.

254
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,759
Or rather,

255
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,600
he was killed by someone
not belonging to that era.

256
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,000
You're asking too much.

257
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:11,679
Hello.

258
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,000
Mr. Bizhi.

259
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,519
Miss Ning?

260
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,360
If so,

261
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,120
how could Fusheng Hall sell fakes?

262
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,200
After all, these are genuine pieces
you took from different eras.

263
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,399
Exactly.

264
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:29,955
We got the Coiled Dragon Bronze
Tripod Cauldron

265
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,320
directly from Rain Manor.

266
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,120
The Dushan Jade

267
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,200
was transported from Luoyang.

268
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,759
If these are fake,

269
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
then nothing is real.

270
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,480
About the Autumn Twilight Painting
you brought,

271
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,360
I admit,

272
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,399
it's a good replica,

273
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,399
but it still can't fool me.

274
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:01,390
You can tell it's fake
just by touching it?

275
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,440
Have you seen the original?

276
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,639
Of course I have.

277
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,919
I even saw the painter. His name was...

278
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
What was it?

279
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,600
Gu Zhiqian.

280
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,279
Yes.

281
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,759
Gu Zhiqian.

282
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,039
How did he die?

283
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,120
After getting drunk,

284
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:22,320
he fell into a pond and drowned.

285
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,679
You killed Gu Zhiqian.

286
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No way.

287
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,399
He drowned.

288
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,320
It's recorded in history.

289
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,555
The Summer Cooling and the Winter Chill
were taken from him by you!

290
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,480
These two paintings

291
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,080
were already missing

292
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,240
from historical records.

293
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,840
At Fusheng Hall,

294
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,720
we return the collections to the last
moment before they were destroyed,

295
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,759
bringing them back intact.

296
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,759
The collections?

297
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,440
To me, they are nothing
but stolen goods.

298
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,559
Behind these rare treasures,

299
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,120
who knows how many lives were lost?

300
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,600
To obtain these rare treasures,

301
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,639
you killed and robbed.

302
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,279
Do you think just Gu Zhiqian alone

303
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,279
could secure his place in history?

304
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,960
The value of art is not only
in the object itself.

305
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,879
We were his patrons.

306
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,440
If we hadn't pushed him forward
across different eras,

307
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,799
his reputation

308
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,440
would be nothing more than that

309
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,559
of a struggling, ordinary painter.

310
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,399
Our existence

311
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,039
helped him fulfill his greatest wish,

312
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,200
to be remembered after death.

313
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,759
What about the Dushan Jade?

314
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,120
Did you kill Young Master Qin

315
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,559
and his maid Caiwei?

316
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,360
The Dushan Jade?

317
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,080
That happened a long time ago.

318
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,559
I don't remember.

319
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,360
How did the owner
of the Dushan Jade die?

320
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,919
Does it really matter?

321
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,440
No matter what,

322
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,840
these people are

323
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,960
already dead to us.

324
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,440
So, does it matter how they died?

325
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,039
Or do you want to go to a specific era

326
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,360
and have some
rare encounters with the dead?

327
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,399
That doesn't comply

328
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,639
with your Time Administration's rules.

329
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,519
Mr. Commissioner.

330
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,879
What do you mean?

331
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,720
I never meant to harm you,

332
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,639
but the Time Administration

333
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,240
won't leave us alone.

334
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,159
So,

335
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,000
don't blame me for being ruthless.

336
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,279
Handle it cleanly.

337
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,920
Kill him!

338
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,279
Make sure to find him.

339
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,720
Yes.

340
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:36,420
(Yashe)

341
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:54,680
Look over there.

342
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,119
Why is someone lying ahead?

343
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:56,839
How is he injured?

344
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,960
Why is there so much blood?

345
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,740
(Rosy Clouds)

346
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,920
After all, we all know each other.

347
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,359
We can't just leave him like this.

348
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:13,160
Tianguang Market isn't a rescue station.

349
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,279
He got himself into trouble.

350
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,119
Before the facts are clear,

351
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,240
we can't let him stay here.

352
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,799
But Bizhi was so good to us.

353
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,119
Besides, he's also someone
who repays kindness.

354
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,559
We saved him once.

355
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,160
Saving a life is better
than building a seven-story pagoda.

356
00:19:29,488 --> 00:19:31,400
We're doing good deeds,
and accumulating merit.

357
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,599
Why can't we do that?

358
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:42,000
He's already wearing protective gear,

359
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,720
and has saved his life.

360
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,160
Ordinary injuries can self-heal,

361
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,920
but now he still can't recover,

362
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:50,440
which indicates he was hurt
by weapons from his own era.

363
00:19:51,822 --> 00:19:54,000
Although we don't know
what he got involved in,

364
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,319
we must never bring any armed force

365
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,400
into Tianguang Market.

366
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,359
There are many innocent civilians there.

367
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,119
We absolutely cannot put them in danger.

368
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,440
It's just saving a friend.

369
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Do you have to be so naggy?

370
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,680
As a supervisor
of the Time Administration,

371
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,599
I have to remind you,

372
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,279
not to forget your identity,

373
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,200
and your promise.

374
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,559
I will report this to
the Time Administration.

375
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:41,079
In the meantime, think carefully.

376
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,279
When I return,

377
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,880
I don't want to see anyone unrelated
to Tianguang Market

378
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,519
at Luoxia Manor.

379
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,039
Miss Ye,

380
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,680
we've found the person's hiding place.

381
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:17,799
Where is he?

382
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,920
That place

383
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,119
is not a normal shop.

384
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,440
It's an abandoned time elevator.

385
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,119
He escaped using the elevator.

386
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,799
A time elevator?

387
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,680
And it's abandoned?

388
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,599
That elevator was not registered.

389
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,480
So the person using
this abandoned elevator

390
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,160
is not from the Time Administration.

391
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,799
His identity

392
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:53,480
is just an old city land
redevelopment planner.

393
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,440
An old city land redevelopment planner

394
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,960
actually has a time elevator?

395
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,200
Truly unbelievable.

396
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,069
Since he used the time elevator,

397
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,110
we should be able to track
the destination, right?

398
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,759
We checked.

399
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,279
But we don't know where he went.

400
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:13,750
Because the destination's
space-time coordinates

401
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,111
are just a bunch of gibberish.

402
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,119
How is that possible?

403
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:20,000
It's the first time
we've encountered this situation.

404
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,480
Dad.

405
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:35,680
Mom.

406
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,119
I came to see you.

407
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,680
I've learned to swim.

408
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,160
Since I can remember,

409
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,400
you've always been very busy.

410
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,720
I used to complain about you, too.

411
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,240
But now I understand.

412
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,720
You have your own lives,

413
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,559
and your own matters.

414
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,759
Just like now,

415
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,640
I've returned to work
at the pet hospital.

416
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,720
And I also signed up

417
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,559
for the pet veterinarian exam.

418
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,240
I've made myself very busy,

419
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,400
very busy.

420
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,400
That way, I don't have time
to think about the past.

421
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,880
Bizhi has gone back.

422
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,680
He told me

423
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,960
that he had something to do

424
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:17,622
with our car accident.

425
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,119
But I believe

426
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,960
the accident was not caused by him.

427
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:32,880
It wasn't

428
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,160
his intention, either.

429
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,480
So I don't blame him at all.

430
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,599
I guess you don't, either.

431
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,880
At least, his appearance

432
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,440
lets me see you once more.

433
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,519
There are so many people
in this world who've lost loved ones.

434
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,160
I'm the lucky one

435
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,880
to reunite with you.

436
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,240
But he's gone.

437
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,960
Maybe it's better for me.

438
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,799
I'm not from the same era as him.

439
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,880
One day,

440
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,160
we have to part.

441
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,640
When I was young, it was you two.

442
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,799
Then grandma.

443
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:35,359
Finally, him.

444
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,759
The people who supported me
are all gone.

445
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,880
It's time for me to grow up, too.

446
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:51,240
Alright.

447
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,119
I'm going back to work.

448
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,000
I'll come see you again.

449
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:03,510
You're manager, right?

450
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:03,920
Yes.

451
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,111
I want to complain about him.

452
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,359
Ou is my dog.
The adoption procedure is complete.

453
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,240
And now you want to take him
back to the shelter?

454
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,799
Miss Li, you know better than anyone
how this dog was raised.

455
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,799
Dogs can't speak,

456
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,839
but we can tell.

457
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,119
What do you mean?

458
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:16,720
Are you saying it's my responsibility?

459
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,359
What?

460
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,240
Your dog has a problem,

461
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,200
and now you blame me?

462
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,720
Miss Li, we're not blaming you.

463
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,200
My colleague may have spoken harshly,

464
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,759
but we're here to solve the problem.

465
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,160
I adopted the dog from you,

466
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,279
and now it has a problem.

467
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,720
Your vet says it's my fault.

468
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,119
What?

469
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,000
What do you mean?

470
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,839
Listen!

471
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,960
I have many fans,
and I can expose your shady clinic!

472
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,590
We're handling it.

473
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,519
What are you saying?

474
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,359
Let me handle it.

475
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,160
Was I wrong?

476
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,119
You must speak with facts and evidence.

477
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,319
Every dog adopted from us...

478
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,079
Calm down.

479
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,220
We treat them wholeheartedly!

480
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,839
Miss Li, right?

481
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,680
Who are you?

482
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,200
I'm a doctor here.

483
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,880
Can I see the dog first?

484
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:52,720
(Shedding this badly)

485
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,400
(should be due to malnutrition.)

486
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,279
Your puppy likely has

487
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,319
Salmonella spiralis rabies.

488
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,359
That's why it has digestive issues

489
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,480
and looks weak.

490
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,200
Rabies?

491
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,200
Could it infect me?

492
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:08,720
If you live together,
there's a high chance of transmission.

493
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,160
Also, this disease is quite difficult
to treat.

494
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,400
It would probably

495
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
cost a lot of money.

496
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:19,279
Yes.

497
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,599
Last month, we treated one

498
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,400
and spent

499
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,079
30 thousand yuan.

500
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,000
You're mistaken.

501
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,039
Including post-op care,

502
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,160
it was over 50 thousand yuan.

503
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,839
That much?

504
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,799
Fifty thousand yuan.

505
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:30,288
Fifty thousand yuan.

506
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,559
What now?

507
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,640
Do I have to pay this?

508
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,799
No.

509
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:36,680
As long as you terminate the adoption,

510
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,333
you won't be responsible for the cost.

511
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,599
It's not really about the money.

512
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,359
I just don't feel comfortable leaving it

513
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,119
at another clinic.

514
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,799
I'll leave it to you.

515
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,480
Isn't that better?

516
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:49,880
Su.

517
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,288
Take Miss Li to sign
the adoption termination agreement.

518
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,240
This way, please.

519
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,920
Done.

520
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:58,839
Everyone, disperse.

521
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,400
Disperse.

522
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh my goodness.

523
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:03,160
Not bad, Su Beilu.

524
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,240
You've improved.

525
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,720
Now you have skills.

526
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,279
Wait,

527
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,839
what you said just now,

528
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,559
the Salmonella spiralis...

529
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,759
I made it up.

530
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:13,519
I knew it.

531
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,000
I never studied this in school.

532
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:15,839
Enough.

533
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,599
Give it to me.

534
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,359
I'll communicate with the shelter.

535
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,240
Wait a moment, Su Beilu.

536
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,200
A lady upstairs is waiting for you.

537
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:25,839
Waiting for me?

538
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,960
Hello.

539
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,119
Ning?

540
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,079
You should call me

541
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,480
Miss Ye now.

542
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,039
You're not from this era.

543
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,400
Not from this era,

544
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:53,750
does that mean
I can't bring pets to the clinic?

545
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,079
Of course, you can.

546
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,279
I believe Miss Ye didn't come here

547
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,759
just to treat a snake, right?

548
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:08,920
Correct.

549
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,920
I want to ask,

550
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,559
your good friend Bizhi...

551
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,400
Where did he go?

552
00:29:22,777 --> 00:29:24,155
What's your relationship with him?

553
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,480
We're from the same era.

554
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,039
He's my friend.

555
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,839
But I haven't seen him in the future.

556
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,680
So,

557
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,880
do you know where he went?

558
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,519
He's gone.

559
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:44,599
He's gone?

560
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,279
He's not my friend, either.

561
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,799
Maybe just my boss.

562
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,960
His work here is done.

563
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,079
So he left.

564
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,279
The house here,

565
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,359
and the shop

566
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,559
are all vacated.

567
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,039
He didn't tell you

568
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,240
how to find him?

569
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,799
How could I contact him?

570
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,680
I'm someone from here.

571
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,119
During this time,

572
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,799
did he contact you?

573
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,160
No.

574
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,680
Before he left,

575
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,319
didn't he tell you anything?

576
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,799
You're from the same era.

577
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,160
It should be fine to tell you, right?

578
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,400
He just said he wouldn't come back,

579
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,279
so it's like he said nothing.

580
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,880
Miss Ye,

581
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,279
your pet snake is fine.

582
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,319
It's just

583
00:31:08,355 --> 00:31:09,750
that it's about to shed its skin.

584
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,440
The snake

585
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,079
can be very aggressive during shedding.

586
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,319
Be very careful.

587
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:20,839
Understood.

588
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:22,880
Then I'll trouble Dr. Su.

589
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,519
If your good friend Bizhi contacts you,

590
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,960
please let me know.

591
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,359
I'm also worried about him.

592
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,680
Miss Ye,

593
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,960
do I need to handle that doctor?

594
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:51,880
No need.

595
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,319
He didn't lie.

596
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,119
Maybe Bizhi didn't tell him anything

597
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:58,759
to protect him.

598
00:31:58,777 --> 00:32:00,400
Then we'll head back to headquarters.

599
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,279
Why?

600
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:03,920
The Hall Master wants you back.

601
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,759
The Time Administration
has been strict lately.

602
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:08,720
Our actions have already
drawn their attention.

603
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,720
To ensure the safety of each warehouse,

604
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:12,600
the Hall Master asks you
to return immediately.

605
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,799
Understood.

606
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,759
Miss Ye claims to be Bizhi's friend,

607
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,160
but on that day at Rain Manor,

608
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,960
Bizhi had no reaction when he saw her.

609
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,480
They didn't look like they
even knew each other.

610
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,160
That woman

611
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,680
must be lying.

612
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,200
Right?

613
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,559
That woman isn't just lying.

614
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,480
She also tried to prick me
with a needle.

615
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,119
But if Bizhi is in the future,

616
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,119
Miss Ye wouldn't be searching
for him everywhere.

617
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,279
But if Bizhi isn't in the future,

618
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,279
then where would he be?

619
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:44,279
Tuanzi,

620
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:46,600
you feel something's wrong, too, right?

621
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,359
Bizhi might be in danger.

622
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,119
Su?

623
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,840
You want to enter Tianguang Market?

624
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,000
I want to ask you

625
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,480
