4
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,879
Su Beilu.

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,439
I'm telling you,

6
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,680
you guys must not go to Ninghai today.

7
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,079
When your parents come back,

8
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,239
just throw a tantrum.

9
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,359
A huge tantrum.

10
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,319
Tell them you don't want to go, okay?

11
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,239
You're not a teacher!

12
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:04,159
I've never seen you in the kindergarten!

13
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,040
Dad!

14
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,560
Mom!

15
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,960
- Mom!
- Bei!

16
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,840
What is wrong, Bei?

17
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,479
What's wrong, Bei? Why are you crying?

18
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,960
What happened, sweetheart?

19
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,800
There's a kidnapper.

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,080
Kidnapper?

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,319
Where?

22
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,199
Honey,

23
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:20,919
let's go.

24
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,159
I don't think it's safe here.

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,800
Don't go!

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,479
Honey.

27
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,039
We crashed.

28
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,599
Honey.

29
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,240
Are you alright?

30
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,280
Bei, are you okay?

31
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,080
I am fine.

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,360
How are you driving?

33
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,560
There is a child in the car.

34
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,439
Get out.

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,840
Why is it you again?

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,360
Do not go to Ninghai.

37
00:03:02,377 --> 00:03:03,900
I am begging you. Do not go to Ninghai.

38
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,470
What? Have you lost your mind?

39
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:07,220
You will get into a car accident today.

40
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,360
A car will crash into you on the road!

41
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,039
Both of you will be killed.

42
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,360
Only Bei will survive.

43
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:13,520
He will become an orphan.

44
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:15,630
What kind of nonsense is that?

45
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,879
Who are you, exactly?

46
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Su Huabin.

47
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,639
I am your son.

48
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,280
I am Su Beilu
from twenty years in the future.

49
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,439
For these twenty years,

50
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,599
every single day,

51
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,960
I have been thinking about you.

52
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,933
You have been gone
from my life for twenty years.

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,080
And Grandma...

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,199
She is gone too.

55
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,120
I am all alone now.

56
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,240
I don't want you to die.

57
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,159
Wait.

58
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,759
My son

59
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,360
is in the car right now.

60
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,159
Whoever you are,

61
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,199
please don't joke with me like this.

62
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,960
I know you don't believe me,

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,919
but I truly regret it.

64
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:02,400
If it were not for me being reckless,

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,639
insisting on going to
that Beach Carnival,

66
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,800
you would never have died.

67
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,360
It was me.

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,560
I am the one who got you killed.

69
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:17,239
Bei.

70
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,950
Don't go over there.

71
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,480
Bei.

72
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:18,949
Bei.

73
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,133
- Calm down.
- I am begging you.

74
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,869
Please don't go to Ninghai today.

75
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,680
If you don't go today,

76
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,600
there will be many chances
to go in the future.

77
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,000
But if you go today,

78
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,920
there will never be another chance.

79
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,680
Do not be so naughty, okay?

80
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,839
I am not being naughty.

81
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,279
I just want to spend the weekend
with Mom and Dad.

82
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,720
I have not spent a weekend
with them in a long time.

83
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:52,000
You are the one
at the kindergarten gate.

84
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,920
You are not a trainee teacher.

85
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,120
Who are you, really?

86
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,680
I really am Su Beilu.

87
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,360
I am Su Beilu
from twenty years in the future.

88
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,720
I like origami.

89
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,480
I like puppies.

90
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,240
I like "The Monkey King".

91
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,879
At home, there are also three

92
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,720
Golden Cudgels.

93
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,360
You and Grandma gave them to me, right?

94
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,079
I...

95
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,680
Can you please not go to Ninghai?

96
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,120
None of you goes to Ninghai.

97
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,879
Do not go to Ninghai.

98
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,079
Alright.

99
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,439
Thank you, Mom.

100
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,040
Thank you.

101
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,759
This is wonderful.

102
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,439
Being able to save you

103
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,639
is truly wonderful.

104
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,240
I never thought something
so unbelievable

105
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,560
would be believed by you.

106
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,000
Blood really is thicker than water.

107
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,879
It is such a relief
that you have calmed down.

108
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,040
Dad, Mom,

109
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,439
I may have to leave very soon.

110
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,399
But I believe

111
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,720
we will meet again
in the future very soon.

112
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,720
And you.

113
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,311
Remember to listen to Mom and Dad.

114
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,600
Get in the car.

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,279
Okay.

116
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,920
Let's go, Bei.

117
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,079
Mom, where are you going?

118
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,040
Wait.

119
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,680
We are leaving.

120
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,711
Get in the car, quick.

121
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,639
Dr. Su.

122
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,629
Is this a patient?

123
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,844
He was just in a car accident.

124
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:51,750
He hit his head.

125
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,079
Dad, I am fine.

126
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:53,920
Listen to me.

127
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,920
I am a doctor.

128
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,759
A head injury

129
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,199
is a very serious matter.

130
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,199
I think you

131
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,800
should get a scan,

132
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,560
just to check

133
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,160
whether there are other issues, alright?

134
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,199
But I am fine right now.

135
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,199
I feel perfectly fine.

136
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,759
I know you have been through things

137
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,319
that I might not be able to imagine,

138
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,759
but I believe you are strong.

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,222
And I don't want you

140
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,190
to be left with any aftereffects,

141
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,120
alright?

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,040
Song.

143
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,319
Take him to the car.

144
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:16,800
Okay.

145
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:17,859
Dad, I really am fine.

146
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,319
I will be in Ninghai for the weekend.

147
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,399
Call me if anything comes up.

148
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,839
Dad, we agreed not to go to Ninghai!

149
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:22,911
Sir. Calm down.

150
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,070
You cannot go to Ninghai.

151
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,200
Something will really happen.

152
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,600
Why won't you believe me?

153
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,519
Dad!

154
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,040
You really cannot go to Ninghai!

155
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,439
Dad!

156
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,160
Come with me.

157
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:30,800
Dad!

158
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,639
Let's go to the hospital
for a checkup, Sir.

159
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,319
Dad!

160
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,319
You know,

161
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,639
just now,

162
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,920
for a brief moment,

163
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,800
I almost believed

164
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,879
that young man was telling the truth.

165
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,720
But still,

166
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,560
how could that be possible?

167
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,639
Even though he looked a bit unhinged,

168
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,639
how did he know

169
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,639
that our family
has three Golden Cudgels?

170
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,439
Sir. Please calm down.

171
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,079
Open the door!

172
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:04,959
Su Beilu!

173
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,399
Come with us for a checkup, Sir.
Do not be so impulsive!

174
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,160
Su Beilu!

175
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,720
Leave him to me.

176
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,639
I am his family.

177
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,199
Bizhi.

178
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,439
You must have a way, right?

179
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,160
Please help me.
My parents are good people.

180
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,550
They'll be in a car accident.

181
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:18,480
Please help me, alright?

182
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Calm down, Su Beilu.

183
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,439
I can't calm down!

184
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,439
Please help me!

185
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,759
Let's go home, Su Beilu.

186
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:24,600
What?

187
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,240
A car accident?

188
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,240
We are nearby.

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Take care of him.
We are going to rescue people.

190
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,519
What happened?

191
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,759
A sedan was hit.
Two adults and one child inside. Hurry!

192
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,759
What sedan?

193
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,320
What color was the car?

194
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:38,639
Go.

195
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,600
Say something!

196
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:41,000
Let me get in the car.

197
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,559
Bizhi.

198
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:08,080
The accident has already happened.

199
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:09,970
You are the only one
who can save my parents now.

200
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:10,630
Please help me.

201
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,799
Please help me!

202
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,279
Let's go home, Su Beilu.

203
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,159
What home?

204
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,559
This is my home.

205
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,919
They are my family.

206
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,519
If they are gone, where do I have to go?

207
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,399
We can go back two hours earlier.

208
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,120
Let me try one more time.

209
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,559
One more time.
I can save them this time, okay?

210
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,639
Let me try again!

211
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,440
If the Time Administration
finds out what you did,

212
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,480
we will never be able
to time-travel again.

213
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,120
Su Beilu.

214
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,320
They are already dead.

215
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
You are still young.

216
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,799
You are good-looking and capable.

217
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,200
If you walk the right path,

218
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,066
I believe you could
become a great person.

219
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,639
Tuanzi.

220
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:56,480
Let's go.

221
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,120
Do your injuries need treatment?

222
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,039
No.

223
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:53,111
(A devoted father. Su Huabin)
Su Beilu.

224
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,120
Why did you go back to Ninghai?

225
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,639
Why did you insist on
going back to Ninghai?

226
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,159
Why?

227
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,919
Why?

228
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,360
I am so useless.

229
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,360
I clearly had one chance,

230
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,960
and still could not do it right.

231
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,080
I don't understand.

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,440
They clearly contributed
far more to society.

233
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,840
They were
outstanding doctors and nurses.

234
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,279
I am just worthless.

235
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,559
So why was I the only one who survived?

236
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,600
Or was all of this just a mistake?

237
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,600
Maybe the one
who should have died was me.

238
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,240
If they were alive,

239
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,600
they could have saved
so many more lives.

240
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,840
The past cannot be changed.

241
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,519
But why can't I try just once more?

242
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,679
Let me try one more time.

243
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,799
I can save them. Just once.

244
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,000
Come with me, Su Beilu.

245
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,720
Here...

246
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,440
I'm not allowed to enter this place...

247
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,000
So this is where you put
all the antiques you retrieved.

248
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,639
Did you collect
all of these by yourself?

249
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,000
You have always been curious

250
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,039
why I went to such lengths
to find these artifacts.

251
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,360
You said

252
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,000
they were the belongings
of a close friend.

253
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,519
So...

254
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,559
That was not wrong.

255
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,519
But it was not accurate.

256
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,399
The reason I collect these artifacts

257
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,039
is that I made a terrible mistake.

258
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,879
And then kept repeating it.

259
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,840
Now I speak of redemption,

260
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:31,390
but it is nothing more than seeking
a bit of comfort for my conscience.

261
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,919
What exactly happened?

262
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,720
(Ten years ago,)

263
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,159
(all I wanted was to escape my own era.)

264
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,320
(So)

265
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,279
(I used this time elevator)

266
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,799
(and arrived in Luoyang
thousands of years ago.)

267
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,399
Sorry.

268
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,960
(There...)

269
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,039
I met a friend.

270
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,639
His surname was Qin.

271
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,360
His given name was Ziyi.

272
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,960
Who says we lack clothing?

273
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,160
I will share my robe with you.

274
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,839
A friend

275
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,240
is a companion who walks
the road of life with you.

276
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,240
Even if the journey is short,

277
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,000
it is still a rare blessing.

278
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,039
My friend.

279
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:19,680
(Though separated
by thousands of years,)

280
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,309
(Ziyi and I
understood each other deeply.)

281
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,220
(We felt like old friends
at the first meeting.)

282
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,759
(Only later did I learn)

283
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,279
(that Ziyi came from a noble lineage.)

284
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,640
(He was gentle by nature
and disliked conflict.)

285
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,279
To the world, elite heritage
was a badge of honor.

286
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,480
But to me,

287
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,759
those illustrious families

288
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,160
were nothing more than shackles.

289
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:48,759
He said he was a bird trapped in a cage,

290
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,960
but I was also a prisoner
locked in a cell.

291
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,039
(That shared fate
made us kindred spirits.)

292
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,920
(I decided to stay)

293
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,400
(and live on in this living world.)

294
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,960
Bizhi!

295
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:28,680
Bizhi!

296
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,400
Are you alright?

297
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,480
I am fine.

298
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,079
What is this?

299
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:34,590
There are wolf packs in this area.

300
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:36,444
It should be a trap set by local hunters

301
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:37,720
to hunt wild wolves.

302
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,960
Can you stand up?

303
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,440
I think my leg is injured.

304
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,559
I will try.

305
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,960
Hold on to the bow.

306
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,839
I will pull you up.

307
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,720
It is getting late.

308
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,680
You should go back first.

309
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:03,000
It is dangerous here.
There may be wild beasts.

310
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,720
I can handle it on my own.

311
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,160
Go.

312
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,799
Go.

313
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,079
Ziyi?

314
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,559
Why did you come down?

315
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,440
Sit down first.

316
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:01,759
Sit down first.

317
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:05,160
Watch your step.

318
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,440
Your foot is injured.

319
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,759
If we run into wolves,

320
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:12,644
you would not be able to fight them off.

321
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,880
I have all my limbs intact.

322
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:14,990
If we encounter a wolf pack,

323
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,200
I can still protect myself.

324
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,119
Besides, I left markers along the way.

325
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,920
Huo Shu will find us.

326
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,799
I told you I could handle it.

327
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,759
Why did you jump down?

328
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,160
Because you are my friend.

329
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,680
I would never leave you behind.

330
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,799
Bear with it.

331
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,599
(Ziyi said)

332
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,559
(because I am his friend,)

333
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,119
(but what he didn't know was)

334
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,880
(that in this world,)

335
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,240
(he was my only friend.)

336
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,300
(Ya)

337
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,700
(She)

338
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,020
(Yashe)

339
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,180
(Yashe)

340
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,799
In the end, Ziyi could not escape
his family's internal strife.

341
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,511
(A great fire consumed his residence,)

342
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,920
(destroying all the treasures
of the Treasure Trove,)

343
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,160
(and taking the life
of my only close friend.)

344
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,000
(Of course, I knew)

345
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,240
(that changing history)

346
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,519
(is the greatest taboo of time travel.)

347
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,640
I had long grown used to being alone,

348
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,720
until I went to that era

349
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,799
and found a friend,

350
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
and found a bond.

351
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,559
But one great fire
burned everything away.

352
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,400
(And I was alone again.)

353
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,440
(I would not accept it.)

354
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,359
(I would not accept it.)

355
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,640
I decided to rewrite
the ending of the story.

356
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,279
(I returned to the night before Ziyi
was placed under house arrest.)

357
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,039
Stop!

358
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,480
Ziyi.

359
00:22:58,759 --> 00:22:59,880
I seek an audience.

360
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,640
Bizhi?

361
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,039
Why are you here?

362
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,880
Ziyi.

363
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:08,400
I suddenly remembered

364
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:10,420
there is an estate
on the outskirts of the city.

365
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,240
Though simple,

366
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,733
it has refined mountains and waters.

367
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,240
Since we are in the mood tonight,

368
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,480
why not go together

369
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,519
and stay a few days?

370
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,030
Thank you for your kindness.

371
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,359
But it is already late.

372
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,799
Let's discuss it tomorrow.

373
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,359
No.

374
00:23:21,488 --> 00:23:23,044
Tomorrow, there may be trivial matters,

375
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:24,270
and we may not be able to go.

376
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,240
We should leave now.

377
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,720
Bizhi, do you have something to say?

378
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,799
If you insist on returning
to the residence tonight,

379
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,359
your life may be in danger.

380
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,279
I know you worry
about the injustice done to me.

381
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,359
Tonight,

382
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,799
a witness

383
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,880
has traveled a great distance
to help me.

384
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,440
How could I refuse to see him?

385
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,039
I am trying to save you.

386
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,640
You must come with me.

387
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:07,200
Please come with me, Ziyi.

388
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:08,680
I am begging you.

389
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:09,960
I am from the future...

390
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,400
Bizhi, there is no need to say more.

391
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,400
No matter who you are,

392
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,039
I won't go with you at this moment.

393
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
I am not the one who clings
to life at any cost.

394
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,799
Whatever may happen in the future,

395
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,400
I will face it on my own.

396
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:35,880
What I seek

397
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,160
is an upright and honorable freedom.

398
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,200
That is my conviction.

399
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,160
I believe you should understand me.

400
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:54,839
Farewell.

401
00:25:03,555 --> 00:25:04,640
Return to the residence.

402
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,920
Yes.

403
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,440
(I thought that as long as
he didn't return to the residence,)

404
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,039
(he would be able to avoid that fire.)

405
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,599
(However, Ziyi had already
made up his mind.)

406
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,759
(And at that moment,)

407
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,119
(how could I possibly tell him)

408
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,200
(that what awaited him
was a raging fire?)

409
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,759
(All I could do was hope)

410
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,039
(that the witness Ziyi spoke of)

411
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:46,160
(would arrive from Shouyang Mountain
as promised,)

412
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,240
(and clear him of all false charges.)

413
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,079
(Clinging to a sliver of hope,
I waited until that day.)

414
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,839
(But the outcome didn't change at all.)

415
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,200
(Yashe)

416
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
(As snowflakes slowly drifted down,)

417
00:26:10,755 --> 00:26:13,070
(I knew the great fire
at his residence)

418
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,319
(had already burst into fierce flames.)

419
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,440
(Ziyi was once again
consumed by the fire.)

420
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,279
(The people I sent
to Shouyang Mountain to seek testimony,)

421
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,599
(and those I dispatched afterward,)

422
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,880
(all vanished without a trace.)

423
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,920
(Their fates are unknown.)

424
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,920
(Only then did I realize...)

425
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,839
That it had been
a meticulously planned purge.

426
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,880
That witness could never
have reached Luoyang.

427
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,039
To save Ziyi,

428
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,319
relying on my strength alone

429
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,720
was utterly insufficient.

430
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,880
So I used Yashe to return
once more to before the fire.

431
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,400
I sought out General Huo Shu.

432
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:01,110
(And told him that no matter what,
he must stay by Ziyi's side)

433
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,400
(and ensure his safety.)

434
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,400
General Huo,

435
00:27:04,511 --> 00:27:06,622
you must find a way to infiltrate
the Qin Residence

436
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,960
and protect him at all costs.

437
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:08,799
Rest assured.

438
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:11,044
Young Master
once showed me great kindness.

439
00:27:11,155 --> 00:27:13,244
No matter what, I, Huo Shu,
will ensure his safety.

440
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,720
I am counting on you.

441
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,340
(Qin Residence)

442
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,820
(Qin Residence)

443
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,340
(Qin Residence)

444
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:36,960
(After helping General Huo infiltrate
the Qin Residence,)

445
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,350
(I set off for Shouyang Mountain
to seek testimony.)

446
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:44,000
(Who would have thought)

447
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,000
(that Ziyi was also concerned
for my safety,)

448
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:48,070
(and actually sent General Huo
to protect me.)

449
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:49,799
Go!

450
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,279
Over there!

451
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
(General Huo)

452
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,799
(had died in my place, in vain.)

453
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,780
(Treasure Trove)

454
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,960
(Tracing the current upstream,)

455
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,000
(the path is blocked and long.)

456
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,759
(So what if I failed?)

457
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,519
(I believed I still had a chance.)

458
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:56,920
(This time,)

459
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,422
(I noticed that inside the school
beside the Qin Residence,)

460
00:28:59,422 --> 00:29:00,910
(there were several large water vats.)

461
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:02,439
(They were likely prepared for fires.)

462
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,000
(I filled them with water in advance,)

463
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:06,044
(thinking I might be able
to contain the blaze.)

464
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,680
The weather is dry.

465
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,039
Please make sure these vats
are kept full of water,

466
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,440
in case of an emergency.

467
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,559
Young Master has spared
no expense for the school,

468
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,160
and secured prospects for the students.

469
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,720
I will certainly safeguard
the Qin Residence.

470
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,599
Then I leave it to you, Sir.

471
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,519
I will repay you in the future.

472
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,039
Very well. No need for thanks.

473
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,240
(I chose a narrow path.)

474
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,549
(It was winding,)

475
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,488
(but it allowed me
to avoid the assassins.)

476
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,799
(However,)

477
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,319
(by the time I returned to Luoyang...)

478
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,580
(Yashe)

479
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,640
(This time, I changed my strategy.)

480
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,319
(Official Sima at court
had long been close to Ziyi)

481
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,622
(and wielded considerable power.)

482
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,510
(I decided to have Young Lady Caiwei
make a trip on Ziyi's behalf,)

483
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,839
(to seek Mr. Sima's protection.)

484
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,720
To ensure nothing went wrong,

485
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,839
I sent Caiwei to Ziyi

486
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,960
to obtain a token.

487
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,799
It was Dushan Jade,

488
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,111
the supreme emblem
of honor of the Qin Residence.

489
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:11,920
My friend,

490
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,000
please look.

491
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,839
This Dushan Jade mountain carving

492
00:31:16,911 --> 00:31:18,377
is a treasured heirloom of my family,

493
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,079
our one and only family token.

494
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:21,759
Whoever sees this jade

495
00:31:21,888 --> 00:31:23,666
may treat it as seeing me in person.

496
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,559
With this item,

497
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,039
Mr. Sima will surely
understand Ziyi's resolve

498
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,440
and will not stand idly by.

499
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,799
Young Lady Caiwei.

500
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,839
You must deliver
this letter to Mr. Sima,

501
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,519
and take the Dushan Jade with you.

502
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:39,680
Yes.

503
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,440
To ensure nothing went wrong,

504
00:31:43,577 --> 00:31:46,350
I went to Shouyang Mountain a day
in advance to seek testimony,

505
00:31:46,422 --> 00:31:48,160
and returned early
to Luoyang to prepare.

506
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,759
However,

507
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,119
I was still ambushed.

508
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,140
The fire burned
for three days and three nights.

509
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,420
(Qin Residence)

510
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:35,400
(When I dragged myself back to
the Qin Residence with an arrow wound,)

511
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:36,799
(the Qin Residence)

512
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,440
(had already been reduced to ruins.)

513
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,160
(Caiwei may also have met
with misfortune.)

514
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,319
(Mr. Sima)

515
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,519
(never appeared.)

516
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
(From that point on,)

517
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,200
(I was like a gambler
who had lost all reason,)

518
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,440
(pushing open the door
of Yashe again and again,)

519
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,880
(only to wager on winning once,)

520
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,200
(to return everything
that was lost to its place.)

521
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,680
(Until I finally realized)

522
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,559
(that my stubborn defiance)

523
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,039
(not only failed to save Ziyi,)

524
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,559
(but instead implicated
even more innocent people,)

525
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:43,359
(causing their deaths
for no reason at all.)

526
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,000
(Tracing the current upstream,)

527
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:52,880
(the path is blocked and long.)

528
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:57,160
(Tracing the current upstream,)

529
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,440
(the path is steep and difficult.)

530
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,440
(Tracing the current upstream,)

531
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,199
(the path twists to the right.)

532
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,599
I walked every path there was.

533
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,199
In the end, I could only accept

534
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,519
that fate cannot be defied.

535
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,960
Schemes exhausted to the utmost,

536
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,440
yet cleverness proved vain.
