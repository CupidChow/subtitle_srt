of the same title.)

=Episode 13=

4
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,040
Thank you

5
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,120
for letting me stay at Yashe.

6
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,319
Thank you

7
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,799
for letting me stay here.

8
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,239
Cheers.

9
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,879
My Qing dynasty rosary!

10
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,319
What did you do to it?

11
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,159
Let me see.

12
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,719
Grab some tissue.

13
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,560
This is basically

14
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,360
ruined for good.

15
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,759
This thing can't get wet.

16
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,080
Sorry, Master Dong.

17
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,879
This is nice.

18
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,000
Bizhi.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,680
You're getting bolder these days.

20
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,960
You even dare to fool me now?

21
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,280
Careful what you say.

22
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,120
Market Lord.

23
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
I wasn't fooling you.

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,439
At most, I was buying time.

25
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,355
All that repainting was for you.

26
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,840
You knew he was just an ordinary person.

27
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,039
So why didn't you tell me?

28
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,680
Finding out now isn't too late.

29
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,199
Do you know
how much risk I took to help you?

30
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,680
You were playing with fire.

31
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,080
Calm down.

32
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,080
You'll get dark circles and fine lines.

33
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,240
If you'd cut ties with Su Beilu earlier,

34
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,800
he wouldn't have
taken the chance to use Yashe.

35
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,439
You almost caused a real disaster.

36
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,159
I was the one who cleared things up
with the Time Administration.

37
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,319
Otherwise, you'd already
have been taken away.

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,919
That's why it has to be you.

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,919
Tianguang Market depends on you.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,199
Who else could handle this?

41
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,039
Market Lord?

42
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,840
I doubt I can
keep that title much longer.

43
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,800
Find someone else.

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,639
You should go.

45
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,159
Tell me.

46
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,080
If I really went and found someone else,

47
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,560
who would I give all these gifts to?

48
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,759
What gifts?

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,159
The most fashionable

50
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,199
rouge and face powders around right now.

51
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,680
They can cover up any flaw.

52
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,520
It's a remarkable product.

53
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,840
Don't you want to try it, Market Lord?

54
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,840
Let me see it.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
You've got taste.

56
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,720
Actually,

57
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,720
this is a gesture from Su Beilu.

58
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,480
Look here.

59
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,240
This one is contour.

60
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,319
This one is a highlight.

61
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,822
These two matte shades are blush,

62
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:37,750
and these two shimmery ones
are eyeshadow.

63
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,639
Got it?

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,959
Aren't these two colors
almost the same?

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,519
They are.

66
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,879
Not even close, okay?

67
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,279
This one's for the face,

68
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,560
and these two are for the eyes.

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,920
And these here.

70
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,319
This is the blush brush,

71
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,720
and this is for contour.

72
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,240
These really look the same, though.

73
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,399
They're obviously different.

74
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,399
Never thought that guy
who's usually so clueless

75
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:01,120
would actually be this thoughtful.

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,519
He's got a sharp eye.

77
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,639
Sit down.

78
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,759
Thank you, Market Lord.

79
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,040
Are you planning
to keep him by your side?

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,600
Didn't you just say he's thoughtful?

81
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,079
An extra person means extra help.

82
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
Have you forgotten
the advice I gave you?

83
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,480
I wouldn't forget.

84
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,879
It's just that...

85
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,319
Just what?

86
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,680
It's just

87
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,120
even though he's not Ziyi,

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,279
he's still my friend.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,319
And once I finish
collecting these artifacts,

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,959
I'll be returning to my own time.

91
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,560
(But you still only need three antiques)

92
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,879
(to collect.)

93
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:51,660
(Treasure Trove)

94
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,000
Sorry, Tuanzi.

95
00:06:25,822 --> 00:06:26,680
It's not your fault.

96
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,155
I just...

97
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,399
I'm still not quite used to it.

98
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:01,750
Even if I'm not used to it,

99
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,920
it's still good.

100
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,879
Time to eat.

101
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,639
Coming.

102
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,759
No takeaway today.

103
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,680
I made everything myself.

104
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,879
Thanks.

105
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:15,959
You worked hard.

106
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,800
I left your milk on the counter.

107
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:21,879
Thanks.

108
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,240
Seafood noodles are ready.

109
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,120
Healthier than instant noodles.

110
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,839
Come try some.

111
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,120
Looks good.

112
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,560
Tuanzi.

113
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,160
Breakfast time.

114
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,160
Tuanzi.

115
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,800
There's an extra treat today.

116
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,240
I swear I grabbed two just now.

117
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,040
Here.

118
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,600
Tuanzi.

119
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Your chew stick.

120
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:17,390
Stop standing there.

121
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,360
Eat up.

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,680
Okay.

123
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,120
Try it.

124
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,120
I went to the market early
for the seafood.

125
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,260
I cleaned out the shrimp veins.

126
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:33,790
Really?

127
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,039
It tastes good.

128
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:45,311
Didn't expect someone
who's usually so scatterbrained

129
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,039
to be a decent cook.

130
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,390
I only know
how to make this one noodle dish.

131
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,399
Nothing else.

132
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,279
Why not?

133
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,440
When I was little, my grandma told me

134
00:08:55,822 --> 00:08:57,444
that as long as I could make this,

135
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,960
I'd never go hungry again.

136
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,279
Once I learned it,

137
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,200
she finally felt at ease.

138
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:08,799
It's good.

139
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,200
Su Beilu,

140
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
your phone's ringing.

141
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,480
Who is it?

142
00:09:35,222 --> 00:09:36,200
(Your Good Friend)

143
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,000
Your good friend.

144
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,440
Can you pick it up for me?

145
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,600
I'm a bit busy right now.

146
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,500
(Your Good Friend)

147
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,360
Mister!

148
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:47,629
See?

149
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,355
Using a phone isn't that hard, is it?

150
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,200
That phone is the gift I gave you.

151
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,480
And, well,

152
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,080
your good friend

153
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,919
is me.

154
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,919
I've got

155
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,840
your number, too,

156
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,480
so now we can keep in touch anytime.

157
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,679
I don't need this.

158
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,519
You can't say you don't need it.

159
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,240
I saved up for it by working part-time.

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,919
Part-time?

161
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,679
You might be from the future,

162
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,759
but still,

163
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,120
you don't have to look down
on our modern communication.

164
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,000
Do you even know

165
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,720
how to use it?

166
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,840
It's too simple for someone like me.

167
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:50,960
What's so hard about it?

168
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,200
There are buttons.

169
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,279
It shut down.

170
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,080
It's okay.

171
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,120
I'll use mine to show you.

172
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,840
It's simple.

173
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:05,360
Look.

174
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,840
With this yellow one,

175
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,960
you can order food.

176
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,600
This green one

177
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,080
is how we can chat.

178
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,039
And this one with three colors,

179
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,440
that's for watching shows and movies.

180
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,120
Most importantly,

181
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,733
even though you're from the future,

182
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,919
once you've got this phone,

183
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,399
you're officially

184
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,919
a proper modern person.

185
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,360
So you can't refuse it.

186
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,120
Thank you.

187
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,600
I'll make good use of it.

188
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,799
How do I turn it on?

189
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,879
You...

190
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:45,120
The same button you used to turn it off.

191
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:45,750
This button?

192
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,480
Yeah.

193
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,200
It's on.

194
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,679
(Luoxia Manor)

195
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,240
Three pairs.

196
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:56,720
Nope.

197
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,399
Pass.

198
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,919
Straight.

199
00:11:59,039 --> 00:11:59,600
Pass.

200
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,240
Pass.

201
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,559
No one's playing, right?

202
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,639
Double jokers.

203
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,320
Who's supposed to beat that?

204
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,919
Bizhi.

205
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,960
A single three.

206
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,360
Double tribute.

207
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,559
I'm done playing.

208
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,080
Come on, one more round.

209
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,279
Can't handle losing, huh?

210
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,490
Have you played this before?

211
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,159
No.

212
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,279
Are you from the twenty-first century?

213
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,960
Of course...

214
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,159
not.

215
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,279
How are you so good at this game?

216
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,120
He's clueless.

217
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,509
I mean he is very smart.

218
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,622
He just wasn't as good
as me when he first started.

219
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,960
Do you count cards or something?

220
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:33,440
The Market Lord excels at calculations

221
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,577
with photographic memory.

222
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,519
That figures.

223
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,480
No wonder you're the Market Lord.

224
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,360
Come on, one more round.

225
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,879
No more.

226
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:41,879
We're done.

227
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,879
Don't give them a chance to get even.

228
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,600
The two of us have
business to attend to.

229
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,759
Market Lord.

230
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,039
Thanks, Market Lord.

231
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,559
Boring.

232
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,240
Wait.

233
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,600
Haven't you been
getting a bit distracted lately?

234
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,399
No, I haven't.

235
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,519
You still deny it?

236
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,120
Just look at the clues
you've been writing.

237
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,799
Each one's simpler than the last,

238
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,360
and vaguer, too.

239
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,440
Now there's not even
a surname or a name.

240
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,622
How are we supposed to search?

241
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,120
The year and the location
are written right there.

242
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,919
Isn't that way easier
than blindly searching like before?

243
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,600
Providing clues is your responsibility.

244
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,559
Besides,

245
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,600
you've already taken the gift.

246
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,869
Once you get to that place,

247
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,000
just look into the owner
of the item, and you'll know.

248
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,000
Besides,

249
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,240
you're not fighting this alone anymore.

250
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,039
Right?

251
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:35,840
Butler Su?

252
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,240
I'm not a butler.

253
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,039
I'm a partner.

254
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,879
A partner?

255
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,559
Market Lord,

256
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,200
that Wu Blade

257
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,639
slipped away right under your nose.

258
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,355
(Lu Feng, living in the 21st century)
Xia Zelan.

259
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:49,333
Lu Feng.

260
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,399
So that was Lu Feng just now.

261
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,799
If this Kun Blade gets away again...

262
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,440
Enough.

263
00:13:55,977 --> 00:13:57,270
This time, I won't charge you.

264
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:57,799
Satisfied?

265
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,720
Is this really about payment?

266
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,159
The Kunwu Blade?

267
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,360
That womanizing artist?

268
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,320
That's him.

269
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,799
(No matter what the cost,)

270
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,120
(I'll find you.)

271
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,799
(Lan.)

272
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,820
(Kun Blade, Qinglong era, Lin'an City)

273
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,000
This information is way too vague.

274
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,000
There's not even a clear location.

275
00:15:18,155 --> 00:15:19,440
How am I supposed to find it?

276
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,000
We're closed today.
Come back another time.

277
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,519
It's me.

278
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:38,840
Sorry to bother you.

279
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,720
Do you remember me?

280
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,879
I'm Lu Feng.

281
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,320
Of course.

282
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,377
How could I forget?

283
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,519
Mr. Lu.

284
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:48,030
What brings you here?

285
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,960
Mister,

286
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,679
about that Wu Blade

287
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,320
I gave you before...

288
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,559
Have you changed your mind?

289
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:55,600
No.

290
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,679
Once I give something away,

291
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,320
I never think about taking it back.

292
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,559
I just wanted to tell you

293
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,879
that this Wu Blade

294
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,200
was given to me
by someone very important.

295
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,559
It's basically a token of our love.

296
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,790
Come in and have some tea.

297
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,660
(Yashe)

298
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:27,720
Please, have a seat.

299
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,240
Mister,

300
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,399
I remember
what happened in Tianguang Market.

301
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:40,960
I remember him, too.

302
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:42,960
Mr. Su.

303
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,960
I kidnapped you.

304
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm sorry.

305
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,879
And I also know

306
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,360
that people who leave Tianguang Market

307
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,759
lose part of their memories.

308
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,120
But the two of you clearly didn't.

309
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,480
Which means

310
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,919
you're regulars at Tianguang Market.

311
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,559
Is that

312
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:07,880
a fair assumption?

313
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,319
There are many
strange places in this world.

314
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,480
Most of them feel unreal.

315
00:17:13,977 --> 00:17:15,510
It's better to treat it as a dream.

316
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:16,519
It wasn't a dream.

317
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,279
Lan was real.

318
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,359
Because of her encouragement,

319
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,480
her support,

320
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,799
and her care,

321
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,160
I became who I am today.

322
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:29,110
Now that you've gained
both fame and fortune,

323
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,519
why cling to the past?

324
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,200
Because this isn't the life I want.

325
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,079
The old me...

326
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:44,110
was a complete scoundrel.

327
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,640
I've donated all my assets.

328
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,559
I only kept a small studio
in the countryside.

329
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,079
Now I just want to create.

330
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,359
But I have one wish.

331
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,599
I want to see Lan one more time.

332
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,839
Just once.

333
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,079
She's from the past.

334
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,039
You're from the present.

335
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,440
You can't meet again.

336
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,240
If you're regulars at Tianguang Market,

337
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,119
then you must
have a way to enter it freely.

338
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,519
I'm begging you.

339
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,279
Please, let me see Lan one last time.

340
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,480
That's impossible.

341
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,519
I just remembered something.

342
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,519
Didn't Lan

343
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,319
also carry a blade

344
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,079
on her?

345
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,240
It looks like the Wu Blade.

346
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:34,600
That was the Kun Blade.

347
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,880
Lan's family heirloom.

348
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,039
She gave the blade to me

349
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,359
as a token of our love.

350
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
So that means

351
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,240
there's a good chance
the Kun Blade is still with Lan.

352
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,640
Do you know her full name?

353
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:51,680
Xia Zelan.

354
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,519
Then,

355
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,599
based on what you know about her,

356
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:58,440
do you know which dynasty

357
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,680
she lived in,

358
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,640
and where?

359
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,920
The Qinglong era, Lin'an City,
Guangling Residence.

360
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,599
See?

361
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,680
This time, the clue the Market Lord gave

362
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:17,400
just happens to be missing the owner.

363
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:19,160
And the time and place
line up perfectly.

364
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,319
Taking him along won't do any harm.

365
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,960
It might even make things easier.

366
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,759
Mister,

367
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,400
I know neither of you is ordinary.

368
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:30,750
You don't want me
knowing too many secrets.

369
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,559
But honestly,

370
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:34,240
I'm not interested in any of that.

371
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,440
I just want to see Lan once.

372
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,119
I know

373
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:39,590
you have your concerns.

374
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,440
I can more or less guess
what you're worried about.

375
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,240
But please trust me.

376
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
Just let me see Lan once.

377
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,039
Once is enough.

378
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,160
I'll be happy just seeing her from afar.

379
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:51,480
Besides,

380
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,160
by now,

381
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,440
she probably

382
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,240
doesn't remember me either.

383
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:04,720
See,

384
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
after Lan left Tianguang Market,

385
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,380
she must've lost her memories.

386
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,480
So things like last time,

387
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,599
the kidnapping,

388
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,440
or eloping, won't happen again.

389
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:15,030
He said it himself.

390
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,559
He'll just look from afar,

391
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,559
and he won't do anything.

392
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:18,960
So nothing will change.

393
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,359
And with his personality,

394
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,759
if we don't take him along,

395
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,680
he won't let this go.

396
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,720
He'll start asking around everywhere.

397
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,640
And who knows,

398
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,839
the whole Tianguang Market

399
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,000
might end up exposed.

400
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,039
Mister...

401
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,830
I'm begging you.
Let me see Lan just once.

402
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,160
After that,
that's all I want in this life.

403
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,359
Alright.

404
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,720
I can take you there.

405
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,759
But promise me one thing.

406
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,920
You must not change history.

407
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
You must not alter anyone's life path.

408
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,839
And you must leave no trace in the past.

409
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,920
You were never here.

410
00:20:57,955 --> 00:21:00,111
And afterwards,
you are not to mention this to anyone.

411
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:00,640
Okay.

412
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:01,680
I understand.

413
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,400
What happens next

414
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,839
may be beyond anything you know.

415
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,319
Prepare yourself.

416
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
And understand that

417
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,111
you are nothing more than
a grain of sand in the river of time,

418
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,119
utterly insignificant.

419
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,359
If I can send you back to the past,

420
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,759
then I can also
make you forget everything,

421
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,759
and forget Xia Zelan.

422
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,079
When that happens,
you'll truly have nothing left.

423
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,160
I understand.

424
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:27,960
I get it.

425
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,240
Thank you, Mister.

426
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,359
Su Beilu.

427
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,799
I'll take you somewhere that will
shatter what you think you know.

428
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,880
Let's go.

429
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,720
Listen carefully.

430
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,480
No matter what happens later,

431
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,359
do not move.

432
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,029
Otherwise, you'll regret it forever.

433
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,555
The kind of regret you can't undo.

434
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,640
(Back Kitchen of Guangling Residence)

435
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,480
Order's up.

436
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,559
Coming.

437
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,559
This heat!

438
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,559
I dropped an egg yesterday

439
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,880
right onto the stone slabs
in front of the door.

440
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
It started sizzling.

441
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,480
It became half-cooked on the spot.

442
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,839
Tell me about it.

443
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,279
Forget frying eggs on the road.

444
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,559
Working in this back kitchen
in this weather,

445
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,440
I swear,

446
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,559
I'm basically

447
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,880
a big steamed bun in a steamer.

448
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:40,960
Why didn't you add the ice?

449
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,319
It wasn't me.

450
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,160
Then, what do we do now?

451
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,466
- Deputy Chef.
- Deputy Chef.

452
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,160
What's going on?

453
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,400
Useless girl.

454
00:22:53,444 --> 00:22:55,240
We're about to
put the pork tripe in the pot.

455
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,920
We have no time to get more!

456
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,359
This is Madam's favorite soup.

457
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,920
If the Master blames us,

458
00:23:00,977 --> 00:23:02,310
can you bear the consequences,

459
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:03,480
you little fool?

460
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,839
I had a stomachache last night

461
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
and went home early.

462
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,799
Oh?

463
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,400
Talking back now, are you?

464
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
When I have you thrown out

465
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,240
and sold to a brothel,

466
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:17,711
let's see how tough you sound then.

467
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:19,200
What's going on here?

468
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,640
- Chef Xia.
- Chef Xia.

469
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,960
Chef Xia.

470
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:27,960
(Xia Zelan, Chef of Guangling Residence)

471
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,839
Get back to your work.

472
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

473
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,559
Chef Xia,

474
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,160
Cui forgot to add the ice.

475
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:38,350
The pork tripe's gone bad.

476
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,377
It can't be used anymore.

477
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,069
Madam ordered pork tripe soup,

478
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,580
but we couldn't find fresh ingredients.

479
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,599
Since it's come to this,

480
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,519
blame and excuses won't help.

481
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:50,550
We'll have to think of another way.

482
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:51,480
Yes.

483
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,079
Cui.

484
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,039
Catch a fish.

485
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,079
She's amazing.

486
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,240
That cut is so clean.

487
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,759
Her hands are unbelievably steady.

488
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,240
Cui.

489
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,039
You serve it.

490
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:22,459
Stop staring.

491
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,910
Don't you have other dishes to make?

492
00:25:23,911 --> 00:25:24,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

493
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,079
You stay behind.

494
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,070
If this was just to save face,

495
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,119
you really didn't need to.

496
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,559
You can't fool me.

497
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,480
All it does is invite ridicule
from the juniors.

498
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:43,519
Chef Xia,

499
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:45,119
what exactly are you implying here?

500
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,119
I already told you privately

501
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:50,155
that I had to go out yesterday
to restock supplies.

502
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,240
You were the only one
overseeing the back kitchen.

503
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,200
If you chose not to speak up, fine.

504
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:55,866
But why did you have to bully Cui?

505
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,440
It's her fault
for having a stomachache.

506
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,440
A stomachache?

507
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,680
How did she get a stomach ache?

508
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,720
Because you wouldn't
let her eat on time.

509
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,680
The food had gone bad.

510
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,279
You're the Deputy Chef.

511
00:26:15,311 --> 00:26:16,888
One of the old hands in this household.

512
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:18,022
Let this be the last time.

513
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,960
Understood?

514
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,279
Yes.

515
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,240
Get back to work.

516
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,759
Hurry and send it to Madam.

517
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,240
What are you standing around for? Go.

518
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:42,599
Chef Xia,

519
00:26:43,022 --> 00:26:45,133
Master ordered pork tripe soup.

520
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,000
Now it's suddenly fish soup instead,

521
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,160
both Master
and Madam might blame us.

522
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,440
Alright.

523
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:56,440
I'll send it myself.

524
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:17,920
Sister.

525
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:18,599
Have some tea.

526
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,480
Madam, your meal is ready.

527
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:26,070
The soup should be taken while it's hot.

528
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,400
Once it cools, it develops a stench,

529
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,977
which may not suit a pregnant woman.

530
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:30,822
(Sun Zhiyun, Madam of Guangling)
Bring it up.

531
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,039
I am still

532
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,240
in mourning.

533
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:35,440
It wouldn't be appropriate.

534
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,319
My condolences.

535
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,000
You're pregnant as well.

536
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:40,355
I don't mind such formalities.

537
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,599
Come a little closer.

538
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,039
Yes.

539
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,110
(Sun Zhixuan,
Madam of Guangling's younger sister)

540
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,119
Let me take a look.

541
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,799
What good stuff
has the kitchen made today?

542
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,279
That fish soup smells amazing.

543
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,039
I'll taste it for you first,
just in case.

544
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,720
What do you mean?

545
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,160
You just want to have a bite.

546
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,222
With an appetite like that,
how can you slim down?

547
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,079
Sister!

548
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,240
Absolutely exquisite.

549
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,200
You're truly skilled.

550
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,920
So fresh and delicate.

551
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,759
I'd drink it even if it were poisoned.

552
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,559
Did you make this soup?

553
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,759
Yes, Madam.

554
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:25,680
I did.

555
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,440
Sister, have some soup.

556
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:37,510
As expected of the Head Chef.

557
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,920
Your cooking is truly exceptional.

558
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,039
From now on, when you cook,

559
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,440
send a portion to her as well.

560
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,920
Xuan comes to our residence every summer

561
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,680
to escape the heat.

562
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,319
Lin'an is scorching this year.

563
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,119
Xuan craves cold foods,

564
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,880
and her body runs cold.

565
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,599
Unlike me, now that I'm pregnant,

566
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,240
my body feels overheated all the time.

567
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,680
Make sure the kitchen doesn't
indulge her recklessly.

568
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:02,640
Yes.

569
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,720
Sister.

570
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,000
Remember to reward
Chef Xia with some silver.

571
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,319
Yes.

572
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:11,240
Your skills are outstanding,

573
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,440
and you're capable and refined.

574
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,480
It's a pity your husband
has just passed.

575
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,319
Such hardships

576
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,160
are difficult for outsiders to imagine.

577
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,799
For the sake of your unborn child,

578
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,599
save as much silver as you can.

579
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,119
It'll be useful in the future.

580
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,240
Thank you, Madam.

581
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,359
It's hot.

582
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,599
Sister, have another iced tea.

583
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,160
Alright.

584
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,680
What are you doing?

585
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,400
Take her away.

586
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,920
Wait.

587
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,119
Why are you taking me?

588
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,400
Sister!

589
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,200
Get out.

590
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,200
Get out.

591
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,640
Sister!

592
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:32,880
My beloved wife.

593
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,510
(Xiao Zhao, Prince of Guangling)
And my child.

594
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,688
(Xiao Zhao, Prince of Guangling)

595
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,680
How is this happening?

596
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,000
Sister!

597
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:44,920
Chef Xia has arrived.

598
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,559
You vile woman.

599
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,079
You killed my beloved wife.

600
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,599
I'll make you pay with your life!

601
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,720
Madam?

602
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,440
How did she...

603
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,000
Master.

604
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,000
Madam showed me great kindness.

605
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,799
How could I ever harm her?

606
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:08,350
I beg you to seek the truth.

607
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,680
Madam consumed
licorice and carp together.

608
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,160
These two ingredients conflict.

609
00:31:12,222 --> 00:31:13,600
In mild cases, it causes poisoning.

610
00:31:13,644 --> 00:31:14,844
In severe cases, it is fatal.

611
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:16,240
Madam was already frail.

612
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,039
That is why the poisoning took her life.

613
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,160
Licorice?

614
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,109
Madam recently
suffered from heatstroke.

615
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,930
She had been drinking
licorice tea to recover.

616
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:24,680
How could the kitchen not know this?

617
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,079
No one informed us.

618
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,599
Then, why was it carp soup?

619
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,759
Why carp soup?

620
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,279
I clearly ordered pork tripe soup!

621
00:31:50,822 --> 00:31:52,680
It's true Master
ordered pork tripe soup.

622
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,599
Chef Xia changed it to carp soup.

623
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,920
But only because
the pork tripe had spoiled.

624
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,640
And who caused the pork tripe to spoil?

625
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,160
All the kitchen maids were there.

626
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,799
They can all testify.

627
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,519
Who switched it to carp soup?

628
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,880
Speak.

629
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,480
Speak!

630
00:32:15,022 --> 00:32:15,911
- It was...
- It...

631
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,440
- It was Chef Xia.
- Chef Xia.

632
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,119
Master...

633
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:39,079
So it really was your doing.

634
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,599
Take her away.

635
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,799
Beat her to death.

636
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:46,559
Master!

637
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,559
I've been framed.

638
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,640
Master!

639
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:51,759
Framed!

640
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,079
I've truly been framed!

641
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,920
Master!

642
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,519
I'm innocent!

643
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,440
I really am innocent!

644
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
I swear I've been wronged!

645
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,240
No!

646
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,799
My child will be born any day now.

647
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:09,920
Please, let me go.

648
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,759
I beg you!

649
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:13,160
Please, let me go!

650
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,839
So?

651
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:32,400
This should be mind-blowing enough.

652
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,000
I was the same the first time.

653
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,160
You'll get used to it.

654
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,359
But remember this.

655
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,640
Talk less,

656
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,599
and be careful.

657
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:44,266
People in this era
don't use that gesture.

658
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,279
Keep it in mind.

659
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,079
Do as you're told, and take advice.

660
00:33:47,977 --> 00:33:49,550
Let's head to Guangling Residence.

661
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,488
Lan said the Prince of Guangling
holds immense power.

662
00:34:05,488 --> 00:34:07,044
Looks like she wasn't exaggerating.

663
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,311
Security must be tight.

664
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,039
How do we get in?

665
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,480
What if we hide in this barrel?

666
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:16,960
It reeks.

667
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,000
This is slop.

668
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,199
We won't fit.

669
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,070
You two look way too practiced at this.

670
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,840
Do you do this often?

671
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,239
How else do you sneak in
without climbing walls?

672
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,639
And we got lucky today.

673
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,760
We didn't run
into any patrolling guards.

674
00:34:43,111 --> 00:34:44,311
We're in the back kitchen.

675
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,239
The back kitchen?

676
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,440
Lan.

677
00:34:53,622 --> 00:34:54,760
We'll head out first then.

678
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,519
We're off.

679
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,039
Let's go.

680
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,400
Poor Princess.

681
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,639
Her father died young.

682
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,360
No one's been there to protect her.

683
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,200
Now she has to marry off to some
desolate place as a political bride.

684
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:07,000
Yeah.

685
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,777
She's still
her granddaughter, after all.

686
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,440
How could Old Madam bear to do this?

687
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,110
To avoid the political marriage,

688
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,088
Princess keeps eating
things that cause rashes.

689
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,511
Her whole body turns red and itchy.

690
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,320
Old Madam finally found out.

691
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,119
And who do you think got blamed?

692
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Life's only going
to get harder from here.

693
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,600
Even this scented tea
doesn't smell as good as it used to.

694
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,760
You didn't know?

695
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,639
The tea supplier fell seriously ill.

696
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:30,280
This batch comes
from a different grower now.

697
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,400
Let's go.

698
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,679
Was Miss Xia
among those kitchen maids just now?

699
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,840
The duty roster?

700
00:35:58,577 --> 00:36:00,580
It's all classical script.
I can't really read it.

701
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,440
Help me look.

702
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,199
Xia, as in summer.

703
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,079
Ze, as in marsh.

704
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,039
Lan, as in orchid.

705
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,519
She's not here either.

706
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,440
Are you sure Miss Xia

707
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,880
was serving in Guangling Residence?

708
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,559
Lan told me herself.

709
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,510
She said she'd settle
in Guangling Residence,

710
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:18,070
working her way up
to become a head chef.

711
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:18,840
It has to be here.

712
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:25,511
You even brought the Wu Blade with you.

713
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,488
The Kun Blade and the Wu Blade were
forged from the same piece of dark iron.

714
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,755
They resonate with each other.

715
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,280
Follow me.

716
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,559
I knew Lan would be here.

717
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,679
