00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:40,860
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

3
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 20=

4
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,000
(Wei Zhuoran, Wu Yunong)
(I hope that couple)

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,159
(Wei Zhuoran, Wu Yunong)
(is truly as loving as they appear.)

6
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,480
Zhuoran.

7
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,040
Yunong.

8
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,920
Don't worry.

9
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,920
No matter which of us
makes it to the end,

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,760
we'll still get
the 10,000 silver dollars.

11
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,520
Then you won't have to go out singing

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,560
and putting yourself on display anymore.

13
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,280
Your godfather

14
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,919
is such a philanthropist.

15
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,960
I don't mind working.

16
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,879
You're the one who minds.

17
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,000
What do you mean by that?

18
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,039
If I minded, why would I show up
to support you in person?

19
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,560
You went because you had no choice.

20
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,319
Or because you're afraid
other people might get ideas about me.

21
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,439
And are my fears unfounded?

22
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,240
Who sent those flowers the other day?

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,479
Flowers?

24
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,960
That was my comeback performance.
I'm supposed to get flowers.

25
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,639
I could ask you the same thing.

26
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,919
I thought they were from you,

27
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,719
but they weren't.

28
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,080
I was surprised to learn that too.

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,479
Zhuoran.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,039
I genuinely love singing.

31
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,120
I love the stage.

32
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,719
I'm doing what I love

33
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,199
and making an honest living.

34
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,520
If other people don't get it, fine.

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,879
But you don't understand me either?

36
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,479
I understand you.

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,680
But who understands me?

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,159
Do you have any idea
how they laugh at me?

39
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,879
They say I live off my wife.

40
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,639
That I'm a kept man.

41
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,039
Have you ever thought
about how that feels?

42
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,479
But…

43
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,719
Enough. Stop talking.

44
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,639
Once we get the 10,000 silver dollars,

45
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,639
you're done singing.

46
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,560
Zhuoran.

47
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,039
Miss Wu.

48
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,000
Mr. Wei.

49
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,479
This is a letter
Master wanted you both to have.

50
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,879
You read it.

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,960
Addressed to Yunong.

52
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,000
"I plan to leave with Mingxuan
on the ship departing on the 19th.

53
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,400
Here is some money enclosed.

54
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,080
I can't come out myself.

55
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,439
Please help me buy

56
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,480
two tickets."

57
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,439
Xiuyun's letter.

58
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:20,839
Yes.

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Master said to leave it with you
as a keepsake.

60
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,639
He also wanted me to tell you

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,720
that on September 17th
three years ago,

62
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,879
Xiuyun had wanted
to send this letter to you.

63
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,199
But that day

64
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,759
you happened to be traveling
with Mr. Wei,

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,199
so the letter was returned.

66
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,600
He also said

67
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,480
that if you had bought the tickets,

68
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,959
they would've taken the ship on the 19th

69
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,639
and wouldn't have run
into the shipwreck.

70
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,670
But no one can blame you
for what you didn't know.

71
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,480
Traveling with your fiancé

72
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
was perfectly reasonable.

73
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,600
All right.

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,160
The choice is yours now.

75
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,519
Who leaves,

76
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,480
and who stays.

77
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,199
Zhuoran.

78
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,879
Let me see that letter.

79
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,040
What's wrong?

80
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,319
If I remember correctly,

81
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,319
that shipwreck happened
in September three years ago.

82
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,199
That September,

83
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,079
I went to Beiping alone
on a business trip.

84
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,480
I was gone for two whole months.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,970
And you mean to tell me
I was traveling with you?

86
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,680
I…

87
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,759
I might've remembered it wrong.

88
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,759
Zhuoran,

89
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,079
you stay.

90
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,199
I'll go.

91
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,600
Then you must not
have been in town either.

92
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,600
Otherwise the letter
wouldn't have been returned.

93
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,079
Everyone knew your name.

94
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,900
There's no way
the postman couldn't find you.

95
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,279
Who were you traveling with?

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,040
No one.

97
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,439
Then where did you go?

98
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:10,920
Fine.

99
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,319
I went out of town to perform.

100
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,360
It was a private performance.
I couldn't talk about it publicly.

101
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,600
That's why I told the public
I was traveling with you.

102
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,800
A private performance?

103
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,519
Then tell me.

104
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,800
What kind of private performance

105
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,519
was it?

106
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,319
I sang for them.
It was a birthday banquet. I entertained guests.

107
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:35,959
What's wrong

108
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,920
with that?

109
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,600
I took those jobs
because the money was fast.

110
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,480
We weren't married yet.

111
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,839
We had a wedding to prepare,

112
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,079
and a house to buy.

113
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,319
Even our honeymoon was paid for by me.

114
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,600
If I didn't make money,

115
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,040
where would it come from?
Fall from the sky?

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,879
Money, money, money.

117
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,079
That's all you ever talk about.

118
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,639
Sometimes I wonder

119
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,040
whether it's money you love,

120
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,839
or the attention you get from men.

121
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,920
Do you hear yourself?

122
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,000
You know exactly what I mean.

123
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,759
After we got married,
you were always gloomy.

124
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,690
Always complaining
that I didn't earn enough.

125
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm a doctor who studied abroad.

126
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,790
Even if I don't make much, it's enough
to keep you fed and warm.

127
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,439
And yet you insist

128
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,000
on the most expensive of everything.

129
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,399
You couldn't leave the glamorous life.

130
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,820
That's why you couldn't settle down
and went back to singing.

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,759
I love a glamorous life?

132
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,120
You knew from the first day you met me
that I love singing.

133
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,279
You don't love singing.

134
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,879
You love having men fawn over you.

135
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,040
You can't stand being
without men around you.

136
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,079
And just now you were flirting
with that Mr. Pan…

137
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,160
Wei Zhuoran!

138
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:50,800
Have…

139
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,360
Have you no heart?

140
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,800
You say you make money.

141
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,920
What's that money even enough for?

142
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,959
It doesn't even cover the clinic's rent.

143
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,199
If it weren't for me,

144
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,240
you'd have been thrown out
by the landlord long ago!

145
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,519
So you think I'm useless too.

146
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,560
Aren't you?

147
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,079
Say that again.

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,600
You're useless.

149
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,079
Say it again!

150
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,879
You're useless.

151
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,279
Utterly useless!

152
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,879
You'll shut up once I get that money.

153
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,279
That money should've been mine
in the first place.

154
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,080
Elder Yu is my godfather.

155
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,879
If it weren't for me,
do you think you'd even be here?

156
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,399
Godfather, my foot!

157
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,159
I bet he was just
another one of your callers.

158
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,360
Wei Zhuoran!

159
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,240
Don't you talk nonsense!

160
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,080
Are you out of your mind?

161
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,700
Don't you dare say that! How dare you!

162
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,590
You've lost your mind!

163
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,720
How dare you!

164
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,039
Zhuoran…

165
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,440
Zhuoran…

166
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,320
Zhuoran, what's wrong?

167
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,159
Are you all right?

168
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,399
You're bleeding.

169
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,120
Can you get up?

170
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,159
Can you get up?

171
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Easy there.

172
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Yunong…

173
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,679
Yunong…

174
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,360
What just happened?

175
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
I don't know.

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,960
I don't know what came over me.

177
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,480
I saw…

178
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,720
the Hong family's Second Master
on the ground,

179
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:33,240
but some force kept pushing me forward.

180
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,320
I didn't stop at all.

181
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,440
This isn't a game.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,480
Chess do get taken.

183
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,639
You have to make it to the end.

184
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,159
You hear me?

185
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,679
You have to…

186
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,639
Zhuoran.

187
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,679
Zhuoran, wake up.

188
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,519
Don't scare me.

189
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,039
Zhuoran!

190
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,080
Zhuoran!

191
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,480
Is anyone here?

192
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,159
Anyone?

193
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,240
Help!

194
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,279
Someone!

195
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,480
Anyone!

196
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,120
Miss Wu.

197
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,600
Help!

198
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,260
(Wei Zhuoran)

199
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,159
That woman

200
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,399
knows what she's doing.

201
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,879
She actually won.

202
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,120
Looks like that loving couple

203
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,679
was all just an act.

204
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,519
She's your goddaughter.

205
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,519
Why would you do this to her?

206
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,919
My goddaughter?

207
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,159
Right.

208
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,000
When she was young,

209
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,279
I treated her well.

210
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,440
I introduced Xiuyun

211
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,279
to her,

212
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,039
and they got along wonderfully.

213
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,399
They were as close as sisters.

214
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,759
It warmed my heart.

215
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,000
But

216
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,399
she turned her back on us.

217
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,919
Not only

218
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,080
did she fail to stop Xiuyun
from secretly meeting that Zhou fellow,

219
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,639
she even volunteered

220
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,879
to help them elope!

221
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,960
She was so busy chasing
her own romance, travel, and dreams

222
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,799
that she completely
ignored Xiuyun's plea!

223
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,120
My poor Xiuyun

224
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,759
ended up buying the tickets
just two days late

225
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,159
and

226
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,039
boarded that ship

227
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,720
of no return.

228
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,399
It's my fault.

229
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,600
I must've failed as a father.

230
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,240
I raised her

231
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,879
the wrong way.

232
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,279
That's why Xiuyun was so naive,

233
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,000
so pure,

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
so easy to deceive.

235
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,240
Do you know what I did?

236
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,399
Before she left,

237
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,279
I went to Zhou's hometown.

238
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,799
He already had a wife.

239
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,279
He even had a son.

240
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,159
He was a liar!

241
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,440
How could I

242
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,600
possibly tell her the truth?

243
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,159
For a child that innocent,

244
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,720
it would've destroyed her.

245
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,919
I had no choice.

246
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,480
I decided I'd be

247
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,200
the villain myself.

248
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,039
Get in here!

249
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:23,720
Father…

250
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:24,360
Get in!

251
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,879
Father…

252
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,840
You stay right here.

253
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,039
You're not going anywhere.

254
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,559
Father.

255
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,919
Father, I'm begging you.

256
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,720
Mingxuan isn't who you think he is.

257
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,960
Please, go meet him.

258
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,600
Father.

259
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,360
Xiuyun.

260
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,240
You…

261
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,080
You're too kind.
Kind to the point of being foolish.

262
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,360
- You're not thinking straight.
- That's not true.

263
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,519
Mingxuan isn't that kind of person.

264
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,519
Father, you're biased against him.

265
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,879
Xiuyun.

266
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,039
Why would I ever hurt you,
my own flesh and blood?

267
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,000
Watch her.

268
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
Father!

269
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,159
Father!

270
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,320
Father!

271
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,519
Father, let me out!

272
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,279
Father!

273
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,240
Father!

274
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,200
Father…

275
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,440
She's too naive.

276
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,399
Chasing trends.

277
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,799
Learning modern nonsense.

278
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,440
Talking about freedom in love.

279
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,759
Absurd ideas!

280
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,919
I couldn't tell her.

281
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,840
And…

282
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,879
And she…

283
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,039
Xiuyun…

284
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,860
(To: Father)

285
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,799
(Father,)

286
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,000
(when you read this letter,)

287
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,879
(I'll already be on an ocean liner
bound for England.)

288
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:36,879
(I'm sorry.)

289
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,799
(I chose to be willful again.)

290
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,159
(I want to fight for my life just once.)

291
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,120
(I know)

292
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,639
(you don't like Mingxuan,)

293
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,039
(but I've already chosen him.)

294
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,559
(He's promised)

295
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,399
(to support my studies overseas.)

296
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,159
(When I complete my studies and return,)

297
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,519
(we'll see each other again.)

298
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,960
(Take care, Father.)

299
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:03,679
Hong Chi!

300
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:05,960
Hong Chi!

301
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,279
Hong Lie!

302
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,159
Hong Chi! Hong Lie!
Get up! Help me go after Xiuyun!

303
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:12,960
Master!

304
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:13,960
Master.

305
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,720
What happened?

306
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,560
Where are they?

307
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,600
(Butler Li)
They moved out of Rain Manor ages ago.

308
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,360
Why?

309
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,840
Well…

310
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,480
Master Pan Jingting set them up
with a martial arts center in the city.

311
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,759
It's about to open,

312
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,399
so all their attention's there.

313
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,559
Why would they come back now?

314
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,190
I raised those useless brats
for nothing.

315
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,159
Why did this have to happen now?

316
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:31,519
Follow me!

317
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,039
Hurry!

318
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,039
Master, slow down.
Be careful. Don't fall! Master!

319
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:39,180
(Eastern Ferry Sank In The Atlantic.
Passengers And Crew Lost. Condolences.)

320
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,639
Xiuyun…

321
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,320
I knew this would happen…

322
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,759
I knew it…

323
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,120
Xiuyun…

324
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,200
My Xiuyun…

325
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:05,759
Master…

326
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,039
Master, you must be strong.

327
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,559
You… You mustn't let this affect your health.

328
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,480
Xiuyun…

329
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:32,140
(Rain Manor)

330
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,460
(One Year Later)

331
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Xiuyun…

332
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,159
(Spirit Tablet of Yu Xiuyun)
She came to me in my later years.

333
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,480
She was a caring daughter.

334
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,320
As they got older,

335
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,759
other girls

336
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,440
ran after trends

337
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,639
and longed for the city's glamour.

338
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:32,799
Only she seemed

339
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,799
afraid I'd be lonely.

340
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,879
She stayed with me every day
at Rain Manor,

341
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
playing chess,

342
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,799
taking walks,

343
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,720
singing with me.

344
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,200
Where else

345
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,879
would you find a child like that?

346
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,240
Why did you stop?

347
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,600
Play your move.

348
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,000
Move!

349
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,559
I'll make them pay.

350
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,840
I'll make them understand

351
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,399
what it means to kill Xiuyun!

352
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,720
Come on!

353
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,200
Make your move!

354
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,319
Miss Wu!

355
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,319
Miss Wu!

356
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,400
Miss Wu!

357
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
What happened?

358
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,839
What happened to Mr. Wei?

359
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,720
I'm sorry, Xiuyun.

360
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,400
I should've bought you the tickets.

361
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,720
What are you talking about?

362
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,640
I'm sorry…

363
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,480
I'm sorry…

364
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,480
I'm sorry…

365
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,920
What in the world is going on?

366
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,759
I'm sorry, Xiuyun.

367
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:33,559
Is anyone there?

368
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,279
Help!

369
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,000
Someone! Anyone!

370
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,160
(This nameless chess is Scrappy. )

371
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,240
(I can't let him
run into the black chess.)

372
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,860
(Pan Jingting)

373
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,880
White Chess No. 3

374
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,160
will take three steps.

375
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,500
(Pan Yunzhe)

376
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,440
Miss Ning?

377
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:38,960
Mr. Pan.

378
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,759
Elder Yu has a gift for you.

379
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,599
Father.

380
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,519
You may leave.

381
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,720
You've come to take me out, have you?

382
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,359
How disrespectful you've become.

383
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,640
Talking to your own father like this.

384
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,960
It's the rules of the game.

385
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,079
Father,

386
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,119
don't you want me to get
the 10,000 silver dollars?

387
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,400
So you can

388
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,480
blow it all?

389
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,519
Don't even think about it.

390
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,720
We agreed

391
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,519
to come to dinner.

392
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,079
No arguing.

393
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,920
You're the one asking to borrow money.

394
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,920
Whether I lend it or not is up to me.

395
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:32,559
Why would I need to argue with you?

396
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,480
So you really won't lend it to me?

397
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,039
Lend it so you can buy useless junk,

398
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,720
or waste it drinking and fooling around?

399
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,680
Father!

400
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,279
I need the money to grease the wheels.

401
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,960
The underworld, the authorities,
customs, the chamber of commerce.

402
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,559
You're in business too.

403
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,440
Surely you understand.

404
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,559
Grease the wheels?

405
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:58,920
More like an excuse for smoking opium
and pursuing women!

406
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:03,740
No matter what, I'd never force

407
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,200
an innocent woman into a tragedy.

408
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,599
Especially not a friend's daughter.

409
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,160
What did you just say?

410
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,799
Do you recognize this fan?

411
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,319
No.

412
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,880
It's Xiuyun's fan.

413
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,319
Zhou Mingxuan met Yu Xiuyun

414
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,000
because of this fan.

415
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,079
(Back then,)

416
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,390
(Zhou Mingxuan was a senior manager
at a trading company.)

417
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:49,400
(He told you the story behind this fan.)

418
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,200
(You knew its owner was Xiuyun.)

419
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,079
(But you never bothered to investigate
whether he already had a family)

420
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,000
(before introducing Xiuyun to him.)

421
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,519
(I was completely)

422
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,640
(in the dark.)

423
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,319
(I was the one
who personally asked Xiuyun out.)

424
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,599
Let me introduce you.

425
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,160
This is Zhou Mingxuan
from Overseas Trade.

426
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,920
Mr. Zhou.

427
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,079
Hello.

428
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,920
This is Miss Xiuyun.

429
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,160
Hello.

430
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,160
Miss Xiuyun, please have a seat.

431
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,279
Mr. Zhou.

432
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,640
Yunzhe and I have something
to attend to.

433
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,319
We'll excuse ourselves first.

434
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:27,799
All right.

435
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,640
Please, go ahead.

436
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,890
We'll get together another day.

437
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,839
Miss Xiuyun, you two enjoy yourselves.

438
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,000
Father.

439
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,440
Let's go.

440
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,759
What was that about?

441
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,519
Nice to meet you, Miss Xiuyun.

442
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,720
They call you Mr. Zhou?

443
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,160
You can call me Mingxuan.

444
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,119
Mingxuan.

445
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,559
All right.

446
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,279
You left

447
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,799
this fan behind.

448
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,790
I finally have a chance
to return it to you.

449
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,279
So it was with you.

450
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
I've been looking for it everywhere.

451
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,559
Thank you.

452
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,440
You're welcome.

453
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,640
Elder Yu

454
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,559
is your old friend.

455
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,319
What you did was too much!

456
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,960
Zhou Mingxuan isn't a bad man.

457
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:17,559
Besides,

458
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,960
do you think I got close to him

459
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,319
for myself?

460
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,759
I did it for you.

461
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,240
You listened to your so-called friends

462
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,880
and imported a batch of defective goods.

463
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,799
If Zhou Mingxuan's company
hadn't helped you handle the returns,

464
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,680
do you have any idea
how much you'd have lost?

465
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,119
Could you even afford it?

466
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:34,279
You never trusted me.

467
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,480
That shipment wasn't defective at all.

468
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,920
It was cheap,

469
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,599
high volume,

470
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,599
and perfectly fixable with machines.

471
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,200
I had my reasons.

472
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,400
But you never once cared
about how I felt!

473
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,640
You're uneducated, useless,

474
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,759
and going nowhere in life!

475
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:48,880
If it weren't for me,

476
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,839
you'd be broke
and sleeping on the streets by now.

477
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,400
And you think you're any better?

478
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,340
You're just living off
your father's inheritance.

479
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:58,260
And if it weren't for my grandpa,
would you even have this family fortune?

480
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,480
Father?

481
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,599
Father.

482
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,519
Get away from me!

483
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,359
Even if I die,

484
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,559
you won't get

485
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,599
a single cent of my inheritance.

486
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,240
We'll see

487
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,599
whether I've got what it takes.

488
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,559
You killed my Xiuyun.

489
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:31,519
So I'll let your son
torment you in return.

490
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,440
That's fair.

491
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,160
An eye for an eye!

492
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Allow me.

493
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,799
Nobody move!

494
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,240
Strike the alms bowl! Now!

495
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,920
Keep striking. Don't stop!

496
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,759
Keep your hand on him.

497
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:04,759
I'll be right back.

498
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,440
Pan Yunzhe!

499
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,480
Stay away!

500
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,799
Come to your senses!

501
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,559
What happened here?

502
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Can anyone please explain?

503
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,920
Leave this to me.

504
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,400
You showed up just in time.

505
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,690
I don't know what came over them.

506
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,000
Why did they start fighting?

507
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,400
And Miss Wu and her husband…

508
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,039
There was an accident.

509
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,279
Perhaps the prize was too tempting.

510
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,400
People got carried away.

511
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,790
You call this getting carried away?

512
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,160
Mr. Wei hurt his head!

513
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,359
- You need to get someone to save him!
- I know.

514
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,319
However, Mr. Su,

515
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,480
if you break the rules of the game,

516
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,119
you won't win the prize.

517
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,519
Forget about the prize!

518
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,960
You might not even be able

519
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,200
to leave Rain Manor.

520
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,640
So this was all premeditated.

521
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,720
What are your intentions?

522
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,799
I suggest

523
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
you return to your place.

524
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,000
Your friend's still playing.

525
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,079
Master said

526
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,799
only obedient chess

527
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,880
keep the players safe.

528
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,279
You and your friend are outsiders.

529
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,190
As long as you comply
and finish the game with Master,

530
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,200
you'll leave safely.

531
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,359
Stop striking.

532
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:43,599
Mr. Bizhi,

533
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,279
you mustn't do this.

534
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,759
Don't forget

535
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,240
that your friend's still on the board.

536
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,680
I suggest

537
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,400
you sit back down.

538
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,119
Otherwise…

539
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,039
Do as she says.

540
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:01,880
Return to your seat

541
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:04,519
and finish the game.

542
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,720
(Pan Yunzhe, Pan Jingting)
These two have forfeited the match.

543
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,359
Like father, like son.

544
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,559
A pair of useless cowards.

545
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,759
Pathetic.

546
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:42,440
Now there's only your friend left.

547
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,799
Let's see how lucky he is.

548
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,440
White Chess No. 4 will take one step.

549
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,079
(Su Beilu)
Black Chess No. 4 will take three steps.

550
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,119
Chongyang.

551
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,160
It's you.

552
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,279
Just call me Scrappy.

553
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,200
You're not scrappy at all.

554
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,519
I was way scrappier than you

555
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:52,480
when I was a kid.

556
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,000
I think

557
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,599
I'll call you Chongyang instead.

558
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:57,599
Thank you.

559
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Are you here to take me out?

560
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,920
Looks like it.

561
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,680
All right.

562
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,480
Then sit with me and talk to me.

563
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,119
You're the only person
who's spoken to me tonight.

564
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,559
Is Grandpa unhappy tonight?

565
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:21,759
Elder Yu?

566
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,599
He doesn't let me call him that.

567
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,799
But I do consider him my grandpa.

568
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:31,440
That means your mother is his daughter.

569
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,839
Where is your mother?

570
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,960
My mother isn't his daughter.

571
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,720
I'm a child nobody wanted.

572
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,000
My father died at sea.

573
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,359
My mother couldn't afford to raise me,

574
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,640
so she left me at Rain Manor's entrance.

575
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,880
Grandpa took me in.

576
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,720
I know he didn't like my father.

577
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,440
But he was willing to raise me,

578
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,599
and I'm grateful for that.

579
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,920
I don't want him to be unhappy.

580
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:01,519
If he raised you

581
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,400
all these years,

582
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:05,839
he must

583
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,839
care about you.

584
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,400
He must have

585
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,920
his reasons.

586
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,079
Really?

587
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,480
My parents passed away

588
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,680
when I was little too.

589
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,559
My grandmother raised me.

590
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,920
She was always busy.

591
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,400
I used to resent her.

592
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,279
Then I grew up

593
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,200
and realized

594
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,839
she was working herself sick

595
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,400
just to earn money.

596
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,839
I regret

597
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,119
not treating her better.

598
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,839
Listen.

599
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,880
If you have no family left

600
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,640
in this world,

601
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,960
then the person who treats you best

602
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,960
is your family.

603
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,680
You have to be good to them,

604
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,759
okay?

605
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Hong Lie?

606
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,599
(Hong Lie)
White Chess No. 2 will take five steps.

607
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,279
(Su Beilu,)

608
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,519
(be safe.)

609
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,119
The prize is mine.

610
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,039
I won't give it to you.

611
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,759
I'm going to use it

612
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,240
to revive the martial arts center!

613
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,839
Go to the courtyard right now.
Find the young man playing chess

614
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,880
and tell him where I am.

615
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,079
The draw.

616
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:29,759
Once played,

617
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,559
the two chess in conflict must cease,

618
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,759
and neither will be harmed.

619
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,279
Those were your rules,

620
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:34,839
Elder Yu.

621
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,759
Go!

622
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,930
White Chess No. 2 will take three steps.

623
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,799
Black Chess No. 4 will take four steps.

624
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,400
How exciting.

625
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,240
(Hong Lie, Su Beilu)
Now it's getting interesting.

626
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,640
I wonder if your friend

627
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,240
has the strength left
to finish these last few moves.

628
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,319
All of this was your setup.

629
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,759
You knew the Liubo Chess
could manipulate minds.

630
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,890
When you're inside the game,

631
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,359
it fuels obsession,
even turning family against each other.

632
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,759
You chose Xiuyun's birthday

633
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,359
to take revenge on everyone
connected to her death.

634
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,839
But Elder Yu, don't forget this.

635
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,440
Xiuyun died

636
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,480
in a shipwreck during a storm.

637
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,279
That was a natural disaster.

638
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:43,839
Wrong.

639
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,039
Xiuyun didn't die

640
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,880
because of nature.

641
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,200
Every one of them is a murderer!

642
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,519
You're blaming everyone else.

643
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,519
But have you ever thought
about your own fault?

644
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:56,960
My fault?

645
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,960
Why did Xiuyun elope
without telling you?

646
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:01,599
Wasn't your love a form of control?

647
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,279
How much freedom did you ever give her?

648
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,480
Don't talk to me about freedom!

649
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:05,720
What is freedom?

650
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,119
Wasn't my love enough?

651
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,079
I gave her everything!

652
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,440
Enough.

653
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,000
Play.

654
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,079
Play!

655
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,839
No one's leaving Rain Manor tonight

656
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,359
until this game is finished.

657
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:20,440
Play!

658
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,599
I win.

659
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,440
Master.

660
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,839
I remember Aunt Xiuyun.

661
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,359
What did you say?

662
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,640
I remember Aunt Xiuyun.

663
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,400
You met her?

664
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,279
Impossible.

665
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,839
Father took me to a coffee shop

666
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,200
to meet her.

667
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,279
She said I looked like a little snowman.

668
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:06,160
She said they'd study abroad together,

669
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,199
and we'd all live together
when they returned.

670
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,079
She…

671
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,880
She knew about you?

672
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:19,159
I remember Aunt Xiuyun loved cream cake

673
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,280
with red berries.

674
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,480
Just like this.

675
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,360
Master,

676
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,400
you never eat these.

677
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,519
But Aunt Xiuyun liked them.

678
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,480
Xiuyun…

679
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,400
You're too kind.

680
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,480
You knew everything all along.

681
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,719
Zhou told you everything too.

682
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,960
I don't understand

683
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,960
why you'd still choose this dead end.

684
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,159
They showed no care at all

685
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,679
when you died.

686
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,119
They never once meant

687
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,920
to hurt Xiuyun.

688
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:19,920
In fact, they've been remembering her
in their own ways.

689
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,559
That cake was from Wu Yunong.

690
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,840
Even though Hong Lie and Hong Chi

691
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,760
are barely getting by,

692
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,440
they still insist on running
a woman's swimming class.

693
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,840
That's for Xiuyun too.

694
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:35,480
The money backing them
comes from Pan Jingting.

695
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,840
Master Pan wanted
to do his part for her.

696
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,039
Stop.

697
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,039
Say no more.

698
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,760
Elder Yu,

699
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,500
obsession is like a disease
that clings to your bones.

700
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,599
It's trapped you here in Rain Manor

701
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,719
all these years.

702
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:04,800
Please try to let it go.

703
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,239
Your friend asked me to tell you

704
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,480
he's over there.

705
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,039
Look after Elder Yu.

706
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,559
Master.

707
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,760
Su Beilu!

708
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,800
Su Beilu!

709
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,760
Su Beilu.

710
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:36,920
Su Beilu!

711
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,039
Over here!

712
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,800
Are you all right?

713
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,760
I'm fine.

714
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,039
Master Hong,

715
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:45,360
are you all right?

716
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,079
What happened to me?

717
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,519
Can you get up?

718
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,679
How are you feeling?

719
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,700
Something's wrong.

720
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,039
I think I might've hurt my brother.

721
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,000
I need to find him.

722
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,599
Based on the board,

723
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,880
he should be over that way.

724
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,360
Thank you.

725
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,880
I thought you'd never get back up.

726
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:30,199
You scared me.

727
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,199
I'm sorry,

728
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:34,800
Zhuoran.

729
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm sorry.

730
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,320
I won't sing anymore.

731
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,880
I'll stay home with you.

732
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,199
I was being petty before.

733
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:48,199
I'm sorry, Yunong.

734
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,800
You were born for the stage.

735
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:55,320
How could you ever leave it?

736
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,000
I was wrong, Yunong.

737
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,199
I'm sorry.

738
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,280
Don't cry.

739
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,960
There, there…

740
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:23,440
Father.

741
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,079
Father.

742
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,280
Are you all right?

743
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,119
I'm fine.

744
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,800
What about you?

745
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,519
I'm all right.

746
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,000
Good.

747
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,920
Father.

748
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:40,639
I was wrong.

749
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,000
Chi!

750
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,000
Lie.

751
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,239
Chi!

752
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,559
I'm here, Lie.

753
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,880
Chi.

754
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,119
I'm fine, Lie.

755
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,119
Chi.

756
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,440
I don't know what got into me.

757
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,679
I'm so sorry.

758
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,719
Lie.

759
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,360
I don't know
what came over me just now.

760
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:14,960
All these years,

761
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,199
I've been too stubborn, too controlling.

762
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,360
I wanted to fight
for everything for you.

763
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,840
I never realized

764
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,679
how badly you misunderstood me.

765
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,760
I'm sorry.

766
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:28,519
Lie,

767
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,920
you've had it hard all these years.

768
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,440
I just didn't want to be

769
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,920
the little brother
who always needs your protection.

770
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,660
I wanted to carry
some of the weight too.

771
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,480
Here.

772
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,360
Come on.

773
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,400
Let's go.

774
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,519
How are you holding up?

775
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,250
Are you all right?

776
00:39:59,039 --> 00:39:59,960
I'm fine.

777
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,679
You won, right?

778
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,960
I thought it'd just be
a simple game of Liubo Chess.

779
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,199
I never expected it
to spiral into all this chaos.

780
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,599
They were all bewitched
by the power of the Chess.

781
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,400
But you won in the end.
That's what matters.

782
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,119
We've got the Liubo Chess back as well.

783
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:17,400
Let's go home.

784
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,440
Let's go.

785
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,800
Are you sure you're fine?

786
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,679
Yes.

787
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:24,370
You lasted a few rounds
against Master Hong.

788
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,199
Not bad.

789
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,159
I underestimated you.

790
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,119
Su Beilu!

791
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,119
Su Beilu!

792
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,400
I was trying to play the hero…

793
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,480
Guess I couldn't pull it off…

794
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,000
Su Beilu.

795
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,320
Su Beilu!

796
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,199
Su Beilu, stay with me!
