2
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:40,860
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

3
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 12=

4
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,360
Do you know what you did wrong?

5
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:29,150
Because I kept traveling back and forth
through the same timeline

6
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,000
to save my friend,

7
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,520
a lot of innocent people

8
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,400
ended up dying.

9
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:36,879
That's not all.

10
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,719
Your repeated crossings

11
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,240
warped that timeline.

12
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,759
The distortion caused energy anomalies

13
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,360
that affected the items
in Qin Ziyi's Treasure Trove.

14
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:52,511
Those objects were thrown into timelines
where they never should've existed.

15
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,080
Do you understand what that leads to?

16
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,280
No, I don't.

17
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,599
Should these objects emerge
in other timelines without detection,

18
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,960
the risk remains limited.

19
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,759
But once someone
picks them up or uses them,

20
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,400
it introduces variables into their fate.

21
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,080
Their life path shifts.

22
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,639
That shift can be small or massive.

23
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,759
It's like throwing a stone

24
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,439
into calm water.

25
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,120
The ripples keep spreading,

26
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,439
one turning into many,

27
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,400
many turning into countless,

28
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,639
and eventually, countless lives
are affected.

29
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,280
It wasn't
until I reached Tianguang Market

30
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,470
that I realized
the timeline tied to Yashe

31
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,800
had already been torn to shreds

32
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,719
because of

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,080
my selfishness and obsession.

34
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,879
Order collapsed.
Time itself was thrown into chaos.

35
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,159
This is the gravest taboo
in time travel.

36
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,599
My sins run deep.

37
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,039
I ask you

38
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
to give me a chance

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,719
to make things right.

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,759
Though I'm the Market Lord here,

41
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,759
I'm also part
of the Time Administration.

42
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,040
Seeing that you truly repent,

43
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,360
I can offer you a chance

44
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,600
to redeem yourself on their behalf.

45
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,040
Thank you, Market Lord.

46
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,639
You may use the time elevator
to retrieve the scattered artifacts

47
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,399
from the wrong timelines

48
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,560
and return them where they belong

49
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
to minimize further damage.

50
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,279
Can you do that?

51
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,279
Yes,

52
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,560
I can.

53
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,920
Market Lord,

54
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,839
this goes against
Time Administration protocol.

55
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,560
Let him earn redemption
through merit, just this once.

56
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,439
Bring the prepared items.

57
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,120
Guards.

58
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,480
This outfit will keep you alive.

59
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,920
(I finally understood.)

60
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,720
(The mistakes of the past)

61
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,319
(can't be undone.)

62
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,800
(The dead can never be brought back.)

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,839
(From that moment on,)

64
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,040
(my mission began.)

65
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,680
(I traveled through
countless timelines,)

66
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,319
(searching for Ziyi's treasures.)

67
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,079
I built this Treasure Trove.

68
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
Once it's filled,

69
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:29,360
my journey through time ends.

70
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,959
(Treasure Trove)
That's why

71
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,360
I can't allow anyone

72
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,360
to repeat my mistake.

73
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,319
I didn't know
you carried a past like that.

74
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,480
I thought someone as powerful as you

75
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,399
wouldn't have worries.

76
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,800
I shouldn't have used Yashe
without permission.

78
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,839
I was wrong.

79
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,519
I won't do it again.

80
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,920
Let me stay with you

81
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:28,360
and help you finish what you need to do.

82
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,720
Please?

83
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,000
Even if everything I do

84
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,360
brings misfortune to others,

85
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,720
even if I have to leave in the end,

86
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,399
would you still want to stay?

87
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,920
You could stay here, too.

88
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,319
It's fine as long as we don't alter
the fate of historical figures, right?

89
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,519
I'm not some figure of history.

90
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,160
I don't have a destiny worth changing.

91
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,800
Once everything's over,

92
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,120
you could live

93
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,199
in our era

94
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,720
and experience life here.

95
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,120
You still don't understand.

96
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,800
Come with me.

97
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Are you taking me to see someone?

98
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,039
What is this place?

99
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,799
This is Huai City.

100
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,639
When spring is at its best,

101
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,440
scholars from the Imperial Academy
gather here,

102
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,240
carrying their scrolls, trading books,

103
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,720
and debating ideas.

104
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,120
Huai City...

105
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,200
Are those locust trees?

106
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,720
Yes.

107
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,960
In mid-spring,

108
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,399
white petals

109
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,879
fill the city

110
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,440
like falling frost.

111
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,480
So...

112
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
you brought me here to see the flowers?

113
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,919
Is he dead?

114
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,519
That's the carriage and coachman
from Qin Residence.

115
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,919
Why did you bring me here?

116
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,759
I need you to understand

117
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,039
why the past can't be changed.

118
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:59,911
Back then, I was the one
who sent Caiwei with the message.

119
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,039
It led to her death here.

120
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,679
I never even
had the chance to look for her.

121
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,120
To save one person,

122
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,679
so many innocent lives were lost.

123
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,519
Let's bury her together.

124
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,799
Caiwei!

125
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,799
Caiwei!

126
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,279
Young Master...

127
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,559
You saved our young master.

128
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,559
Thank goodness...

129
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,639
I'm sorry

130
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,440
I failed your trust.

131
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,919
The Dushan Jade

132
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,080
was stolen by thieves.

133
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,879
Please

134
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,519
look after

135
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,840
our young master...

136
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,679
Do I really look

137
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,840
that much like Mr. Qin?

138
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,039
Look over there.

139
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,580
(Yashe)

140
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,639
You should go.

141
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,080
Then...

142
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,840
I'll head back and walk Tuanzi.

143
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,240
Su Beilu.

144
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,000
Don't stay at Yashe anymore.

145
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,039
I...

146
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,000
I know what I did wrong.

147
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,960
I won't do it again.

148
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,159
Please

149
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,799
don't make me leave.

150
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,799
You can live in that apartment.

151
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,866
Take your time finding another job.

152
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,519
This job matters a lot to me.

153
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,000
I mean,

154
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,240
we've been
working better together, haven't we?

155
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,360
You even praised me last time.

156
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,360
Can't you give me another chance?

157
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,799
How many chances
have I already given you?

158
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,240
Do you not understand what I'm saying?

159
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,279
I'm telling you to leave.

160
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,320
Go.

161
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,000
Leave this place. Leave Yashe.

162
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,200
What have you ever brought me

163
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,440
other than trouble?

164
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,440
I know.

165
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,360
I know you took me back

166
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,799
so I'd understand

167
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,960
how serious the consequences
of changing the past are.

168
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
I didn't know so many people would die.

169
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,679
Now I do.

170
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,879
I swear I'll never do it again.

171
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,600
You still don't get it!

172
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,200
This is all my fault.

173
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,000
I was wrong.

174
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,320
It's my fault.

175
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:16,600
I never should've dragged you into this.

176
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,399
Go.

177
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,840
Leave.

178
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,519
Get out of here!

179
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:33,879
Tuanzi,

180
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,240
I can spend the whole day
with you today.

181
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,399
Happy?

182
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,159
Actually,

183
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,879
I'll be able to spend every day
with you from now on.

184
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,200
I lost my job again.

185
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,639
You don't have to comfort me.

186
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,879
It's not the first time anyway.

187
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,960
Everything I do

188
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,159
turns into a mess.

189
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,200
I can't do anything right,

190
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,920
so maybe it's better
not to do anything at all.

191
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:10,911
If I don't do anything,
I can't mess it up.

192
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,799
Right, Tuanzi?

193
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,079
(Not even junk food
gives me joy anymore.)

194
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,640
Tuanzi,

195
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,279
do you want to go outside?

196
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,533
This way. Go straight,
and then turn right.

197
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:17,720
(Chongle Pet Hospital)

198
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,519
Hello.

199
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:26,759
Tuanzi,

200
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,680
do you miss the people at the hospital?

201
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Forget it.

202
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,400
Let's not bother them.

203
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,640
Come on.

204
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,160
Min,

205
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,599
help me register this.

206
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,680
Su Beilu!

207
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,359
Why didn't you come in?

208
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,880
Have you eaten yet?

209
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,279
It's my treat.

210
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,039
Order whatever you want.

211
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:15,640
Come on.

212
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Order anything you want.

213
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,500
(Luosifen Combo)

214
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,920
Sir,

215
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,359
you're too generous.

216
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,039
You're my student.

217
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,480
Don't be polite with me.

218
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,039
Take a seat.

219
00:19:31,844 --> 00:19:32,688
Order what you want.

220
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,119
Anything is fine.

221
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,799
We're ready to order.

222
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:37,599
Go ahead.

223
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,359
Two bowls of Luosifen.

224
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,400
Got it.

225
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,920
Add fried egg,

226
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,680
beef balls,

227
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,030
duck feet, and pig trotters.

228
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:44,440
Sir,

229
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,519
that's too much.

230
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,720
Don't hold back.

231
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,640
We want the everything combo!

232
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:50,110
Sure thing.

233
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,319
And stir-fry some greens.

234
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,559
Two sodas, too.

235
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,680
You want yours cold or room temperature?

236
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,440
We can't eat that much.

237
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,200
Make it chilled!

238
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:02,777
Here you go.

239
00:20:02,777 --> 00:20:03,480
Enjoy.

240
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,240
Thank you.

241
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,799
Thanks.

242
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,079
Sir, the thing is,

243
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,279
I'm out of a job again.

244
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,319
Don't address me so politely.

245
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,359
In this area,

246
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,799
you're my master.

247
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,680
Here.

248
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,960
Congratulations on job hunting again.

249
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,519
Sir.

250
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,680
Am I really

251
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,880
that useless?

252
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,440
I used to not think much.

253
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,599
You told me what to do
and I just did it.

254
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,119
The vet exam

255
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,720
was for work,

256
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:53,920
so I took it.

257
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,559
But...

258
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,400
But I'm not smart enough.

259
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,480
I couldn't pass.

260
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,799
I didn't think I was useless.

261
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,119
I just thought

262
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,880
I hadn't worked hard enough.

263
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,480
After leaving the hospital,

264
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,799
I fixed a lot of my bad habits.

265
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,799
I wanted to do well at my new job.

266
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:21,319
But in the end,

267
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,720
I still messed it up.

268
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,279
Sir.

269
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,720
Do you think I'm a failure, too?

270
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:42,759
Su.

271
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:43,680
Here.

272
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,200
Look at this bowl of Luosifen.

273
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,599
What would a rich person say?

274
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,000
They'd say,

275
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,200
"Tang,

276
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,559
you're treating us

277
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,559
and this is all you ordered?"

278
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,279
What would someone without money say?

279
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:57,720
They'd say,

280
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,110
"It's just a bowl of noodles.

281
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,440
Why did you order all the extras

282
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,160
and waste money?"

283
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,519
But

284
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,119
how does it feel after eating it?

285
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,079
I decide that.

286
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,400
It's good,

287
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:14,839
it's worth it,

288
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,480
and I'm happy.

289
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,160
So am I useless or not?

290
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,759
Why do you care so much
about what I think?

291
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,960
It doesn't matter whether others think
you're useless or not.

292
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,079
That's just their version of you.

293
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,279
You should live as the kind of person
you don't think is useless.

294
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,480
If it's not enough yet,

295
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,000
then keep working at it.

296
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,160
That's all there is to it.

297
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,559
Got it, boy?

298
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:47,640
Eat up.

299
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Have some vegetables.

300
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,440
Thank you, Sir.

301
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:51,839
Here.

302
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,000
(Spicy Or Not, It's Your Call)

303
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,759
Have some vegetables too, Sir.

304
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,640
Tuanzi,

305
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,920
you don't want to leave either, do you?

306
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,000
But we've got to rely on ourselves.

307
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,359
We can't depend on others forever.

308
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,799
Don't worry.

309
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:23,200
I'll find a better job

310
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,680
on my own

311
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,440
and get you a nicer place to live.

312
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,160
All right.

313
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,559
I'm packing up now.

314
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,720
Go play outside.

315
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,319
Go on.

316
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,480
What a clever dog.

317
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,640
You even know to tell me

318
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,920
to pack your toys.

319
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,799
Go and play.

320
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,359
Tuanzi!

321
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:12,799
Tuanzi!

322
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,119
That's Bizhi's.

323
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:18,240
I know you'll miss Bizhi, too,

324
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,200
but we can't keep bothering him.

325
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,200
Tuanzi!

326
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,440
That's Bizhi's, too.

327
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,720
What's wrong with you?

328
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,240
We're leaving, you know that?

329
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,279
We have to rely on ourselves now.

330
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,119
We're on our own now.

331
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,519
All right.

332
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,200
Go play.

333
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,160
Tuanzi!

334
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,279
Oh, no.

335
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,599
Don't chew that!

336
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,400
Move over.

337
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,119
Here.

338
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,119
Don't fall asleep.

339
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,200
Don't move.

340
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,920
Help is on the way.

341
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,100
(Yashe)

342
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,039
Is anyone in?

343
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,519
Bizhi!

344
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,119
Bizhi, are you in there?

345
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,440
Bizhi, I need to talk to you.

346
00:26:59,119 --> 00:26:59,920
Bizhi!

347
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,400
Bizhi, are you in there?

348
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,440
Open up!

349
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,440
Is anyone in?

350
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,160
Bizhi!

351
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,620
(Yashe)

352
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,400
Bizhi.

353
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,559
Bizhi.

354
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,880
You didn't leave.

355
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,759
When I went back,

356
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,119
Tuanzi kept barking,

357
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,759
so I had to bring him out.

358
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,720
That person was you,

359
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,079
wasn't it?

360
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,440
The man who pulled me out of the car

361
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:11,680
was you,

362
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,599
wasn't it?

363
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,079
I never thought

364
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,039
that kid from back then was you.

365
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,279
I always believed

366
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,279
I was the unluckiest guy in the world.

367
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,759
But starting today,

368
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,000
I don't think that anymore.

369
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,200
You wanted to push me away

370
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,039
because you were afraid
you'd bring me misfortune,

371
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:49,440
like what happened to Caiwei.

372
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,599
Don't talk about yourself like that.

373
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,279
You're a good man.

374
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:54,759
You matter.

375
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,119
Without you,

376
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,160
there wouldn't be
someone called Su Beilu,

377
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,119
and Tuanzi wouldn't be

378
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,400
this healthy.

379
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:10,079
Chun Ge and Min

380
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,400
would've lost a friend.

381
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
And you wouldn't have

382
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,559
had such an easy time
collecting antiques either.

383
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,440
Right?

384
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,960
Let's say that's true.

385
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,160
Save me some pride.

386
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,599
I didn't drive you away

387
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,160
because you used Yashe
without permission,

388
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
or because I was afraid
of bringing you bad luck.

389
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,960
I was afraid
you'd become who I used to be.

390
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,319
You had already forgotten the past.

391
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,400
My appearance

392
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,680
gave you hope again.

393
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,160
When I looked at you that day,

394
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,119
it was like seeing my old self.

395
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,000
I was afraid you'd live

396
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,200
your whole life burdened by the regret
of not saving your parents.

397
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,480
Honestly,

398
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,240
if I could,

399
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,279
I'd still want to save my parents.

400
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,480
But now I know

401
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,359
that if I went back,

402
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,400
I'd change so much
of what's happening now.

403
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,799
I want my parents to live,

404
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:02,960
but that

405
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,119
would mean

406
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,759
I wouldn't return to Ninghai,

407
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,160
wouldn't live with my grandmother,

408
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,680
and wouldn't meet you.

409
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,799
I'm just an ordinary person.

410
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,000
My life's nothing special.

411
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,640
But

412
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,599
I've had a lot of happy

413
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,000
and unforgettable moments.

414
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:33,590
Those moments are what made me

415
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,680
who I am.

416
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,319
So

417
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,640
I don't want to change the past anymore.

418
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,599
Let's let go

419
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,759
of our obsessions together.

420
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,720

the meaning of life

431
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,279

The meatballs are nice.

You guys have no manners at all.

531
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,719
Bizhi hasn't even said anything yet.

532
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,920
Look at you all,
already helping yourselves to the food.

533
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,199
It's fine. Don't be polite.

534
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:01,920
Dig in.

535
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,480
Bizhi,

536
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,280
shouldn't you say something

537
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,533
on such a happy occasion?

538
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,039
Say something.

539
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:07,639

What do you mean?

542
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,800
It means you, as the host,
should toast everyone.

543
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:14,360
How about this?

544
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,840

No problem.

All right then.
Let's all raise a glass to Bizhi.

564

Best wishes to you.

567
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:47,230
Congratulations, Bizhi.

568
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,280
Best wishes to you, Bizhi.

569
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,559
Thank you, everyone.

570
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,679
For Doucai porcelain,

571
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,400
you first outline the pattern

572
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,400
in blue underglaze

573
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,280
on the white body.

574
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,599
Then you fill it in with red, yellow,

575
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,000
green, and purple pigments.

576
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:08,639
Then, it's fired at a low temperature,

577
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,719
around 700-800 degrees.

578
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,719
That's how it's made.

579
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,440
Wow.

580
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,119
Impressive.

581
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:13,760
Master Dong,

582
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,159
how do you know so much?

583
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:16,559
I've much to learn still.

584
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,559
I've got Bizhi to thank

585
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:20,119
for broadening my horizons.

586
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,920
I have

587
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,199
a Phoenix Eye Bodhi Seed Rosary.

588
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,320
Let me show it to you guys.

589
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,199
Where's my rosary?

590
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,480
Master Dong, is that it?

591
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,599
My Phoenix Eye Bodhi Seed Rosary!

592
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,480
Tuanzi!

593
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,159
My Phoenix Eye Bodhi Seed Rosary!

594
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,880
What's it doing in Tuanzi's mouth?

595
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,599
Tuanzi!

596
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,320
Good Tuanzi.

597
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,840
Quick!

598
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,488
Open your mouth!

599
00:37:42,488 --> 00:37:43,320
Spit it out!

600
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,199
Mister.

601
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,920
Thank you.

602
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,599
Thank you

603
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,679
for letting me stay at Yashe.

604
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,880
Thank you

605
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,360
for letting me stay here.

606
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,800
Cheers!

607
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:07,440
My Qing dynasty rosary!

608
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,880
What did you do to it?

609
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,719
Let me see.

610
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:11,280
Grab some tissue.

611
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,119
This is basically

612
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,920
ruined for good.

613
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,320
This thing can't get wet.

614
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,639
Sorry, Master Dong.

615
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,440
This is nice.
