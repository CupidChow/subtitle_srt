00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:41,260
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,140
=Episode 3=

4
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,120
Yao,

5
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,150
it's time to get up.

6
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,540
Hello?

7
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,280
It was just a hallucination.

8
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,377
Hey, ghost.

9
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,710
Ghost?

10
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,710
Is that you?

11
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,870
Hey!

12
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,870
Yes, it's me...

13
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,360
This must be a magic mirror.

14
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,310
I thought yesterday
was just my imagination.

15
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,590
What imagination?

16
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,430
You were talking to me
from inside the mirror.

17
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't know why you're in there,

18
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,870
but thank you.

19
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,590
If it weren't for you yesterday,

20
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,710
I...

21
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,680
I wouldn't be here anymore.

22
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,310
It was nothing.

23
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,466
It's not worth mentioning.

24
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
I never thought

25
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,310
I'd see you again.

26
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,150
Look.

27
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,560
My wounds have almost healed.

28
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,150
That day,

29
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,590
reinforcements did come.

30
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,840
I guess

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,590
I owe it to you, Miss Ghost.

32
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,430
Looks like

33
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,800
you're doing fine, too.

34
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,710
Good.

35
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,680
I'm glad.

36
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,630
I'm not a ghost.

37
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,630
I'm still alive.

38
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,430
Don't ever call me that again.

39
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,590
Then what should I call you?

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,920
A woman?

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,000
That's even worse than a ghost.

42
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,910
Are you really

43
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,150
from ancient times?

44
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,280
Ancient?

45
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,680
What ancient times?

46
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,470
I'm a Captain of Valiant Cavalry.

47
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,470
Li Yansheng

48
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,870
is my name.

49
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,590
Captain?

50
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,680
Are you

51
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,150
a general?

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,630
A captain isn't a general.

53
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,360
I'll be one soon enough.

54
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,030
Wait.

55
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,630
Are you not Han?

56
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,800
I...

57
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,200
I'm Han,

58
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,120
in a way.

59
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,760
More precisely,

60
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,270
I'm Han Chinese.

61
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,390
You wouldn't get it.

62
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,920
Yao, breakfast is ready!

63
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,310
Coming!

64
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,830
If you really are from the past,

65
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,066
the medical care in your era

66
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:34,360
must be seriously underdeveloped.

67
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,600
In my era?

68
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,310
You need to keep your wounds clean.

69
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,390
Don't let them get infected.

70
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,270
Eat more meat.

71
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,190
I don't know

72
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,040
if you have eggs or milk in your time,

73
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,600
but if you do, have more.

74
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,040
It'll help you recover faster.

75
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,630
And sleep more,

76
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,270
and drink plenty of water.

77
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,430
I have to go.

78
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,270
Goodbye.

79
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,360
She really seems to care about me.

80
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,720
Our army

81
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,630
will press forward in one decisive push

82
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:35,460
and strike straight
at the enemy's stronghold!

83
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,510
We set out tomorrow.

84
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,950
Didn't you just come off
the battlefield that night?

85
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,190
You're heading out again already?

86
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,030
You...

87
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,440
Never mind.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,840
Do you mean

89
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,040
the night

90
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,510
we met?

91
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,350
Yes.

92
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,560
That was more than a month ago.

93
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,533
The wounds on my face
have healed completely.

94
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:57,270
See?

95
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,630
A month ago?

96
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,720
It's only been three days for me.

97
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,030
Woman,

98
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,830
could you be a fairy?

99
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,190
One day in heaven,

100
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,160
and ten days on earth.

101
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,830
Don't call me woman.

102
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,950
That's strange.

103
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,950
Just call me

104
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,270
He Yiyao.

105
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,240
He Yiyao?

106
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,390
So your name's He Yiyao.

107
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,870
You don't

108
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,750
look so well.

109
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,430
Why do you stay indoors all the time?

110
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,720
You should go out more,

111
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,040
as I do.

112
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,560
I'll show you.

113
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,040
This is the scenery of our desert.

114
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,480
What do you think?

115
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,320
Beautiful, isn't it?

116
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,040
You ought to get out more.

117
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,240
The world is vast.

118
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,750
There are wonders everywhere.

119
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,880
It...

120
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,630
It's not very convenient for me.

121
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,190
Why not?

122
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,560
It's hard for me to go out.

123
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,190
Even if you're a sheltered young lady

124
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,920
who can't leave her residence,

125
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,680
you could at least go
into the courtyard

126
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,955
to get some air and sunlight.

127
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,720
Staying inside all the time

128
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,800
will do you no good.

129
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,480
How dull and lifeless is that?

130
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,000
(Dull and lifeless...)

131
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,670
(Yes.)

132
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,240
(That's me.)

133
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,160
I can't go out.

134
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,190
Do you think I want this life?

135
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,830
Then why?

136
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,360
I'm not like you.

137
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,270
I don't have a healthy body

138
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,270
that can go wherever it wants.

139
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,560
I'm crippled.

140
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,360
I can only sit in this wheelchair

141
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,870
and be pushed around.

142
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,120
Even getting out
the door is a challenge.

143
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,070
That's why

144
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,070
you wanted

145
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,600
to end it all.

146
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,630
Dr. Zhao said

147
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,870
there was a chance I could
stand again after surgery.

148
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,840
I really wanted to see
the outside world.

149
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,320
See what's fun, and what's beautiful

150
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,870
out there.

151
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,510
But heaven didn't give me that chance.

152
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,160
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
I didn't know about your legs.

154
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,270
I was too careless.

155
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,630
I touched on something painful.

156
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,790
I really am sorry.

157
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,120
It's okay.

158
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,600
I'm the one who's too sensitive.

159
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,000
I...

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,670
I shouldn't have reacted like that.

161
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,030
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,080
You can yell at me

163
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,480
if it makes you feel better.

164
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,990
I...

165
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,840
I'm a little tired.

166
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,630
Let's...

167
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,270
Let's stop here for today.

168
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,380
(Inpatient)

169
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,000
Hello. I've paid the fees.

170
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,355
I'm here to pick up the receipt.

171
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,350
Wait here.

172
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:56,710
I'll go pick up the prescription.

173
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,750
Are you there?

174
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,870
He Yiyao?

175
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,960
He Yiyao?

176
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,030
Shh! Keep it down.

177
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,960
I'm at the hospital.

178
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,870
Look in the mirror.

179
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,040
Just one look.

180
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,270
Give me a moment.

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,240
Take one pill twice a day,

182
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,150
morning and night.

183
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,750
Are you there, He Yiyao?

184
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,080
He Yiyao!

185
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,240
What is it?

186
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,977
Keep your voice down.
I'm in a hospital.

187
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,480
I upset you last time.

188
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,960
So this time,
I've got a surprise for you.

189
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,040
Look.

190
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,200
Is this what mountains and rivers
looked like in ancient times?

191
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,160
Yes.

192
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,110
Li Yansheng,

193
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,360
what are you doing?

194
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:07,240
I had craftsmen modify it
just for this.

195
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,350
What do you think?

196
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,750
He Yiyao,

197
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,150
even if you can't walk,

198
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,150
you can still see this world.

199
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll be your legs.

200
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,440
I have to go out tomorrow.

201
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,910
I'll ask the granny next door
to look after you.

202
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,960
Mom,

203
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,910
I'll go with you.

204
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,800
Really?

205
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,240
You want to go out?

206
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,080
Okay.

207
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,870
I'll take you with me tomorrow.

208
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,280
Keep it flat and straight.

209
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,350
Look. These are millet cakes.

210
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,510
This is dried meat.

211
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,790
You can put the meat

212
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,840
inside the cake,

213
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,680
like this.

214
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,680
Like this?

215
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,550
This is called a hamburger.

216
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,030
It's food from our time.

217
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,320
It's good, right?

218
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,000
It is quite good.

219
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,440
What is this?

220
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,790
That's incredible.

221
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,480
This is a modern

222
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,920
desk lamp.

223
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,750
It's magical.

224
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,480
Does your mirror have
a scratch like this, too?

225
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,080
No.

226
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
What's this?

227
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,390
Look.

228
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,000
Don't these two dots look like eyes?

229
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,000
And this curve.

230
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:15,270
Doesn't it look like a mouth?

231
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,280
It does.

232
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,270
I'm going to sleep now.

233
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,670
I'm on duty tonight.

234
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,200
Get some rest.

235
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:43,510
So pretty...

236
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,400
This is a modern way of getting around.

237
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,270
It's a bicycle.

238
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,270
This is my horse.

239
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,360
Its name is Feiying.

240
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,870
It's nice to meet you, Feiying.

241
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,040
Did you know?

242
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,150
After Feiying's full,
it likes to dance.

243
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,440
Dance?

244
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,550
That's impressive.

245
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,240
Wait. I'll make it dance for you.

246
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,510
Cute!

247
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,790
We've been watching her for days now.

248
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,480
She's gone from that state to this.

249
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,870
Bizhi,

250
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,150
can I ask you something?

251
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,960
Go ahead.

252
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,160
Look how happy

253
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,790
she is now.

254
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,750
Can you bear to take
that happiness away?

255
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,240
Well, can we

256
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,670
wait a little longer

257
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:06,270
before taking back
the Fish-patterned Mirror?

258
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,280
We can.

259
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,510
That's great!

260
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,750
I knew you were a good,

261
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,590
reasonable person.

262
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,600
But General Li

263
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,750
will die someday.

264
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,320
You've seen it.

265
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,720
Everyone and everything

266
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,240
must part someday.

267
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,390
You'll get used to it.

268
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,600
Li Yansheng,

269
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:54,670
there's something I want to say to you.

270
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,960
The thing is...

271
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,360
I...

272
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,030
You can feel it, right?

273
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,270
What I feel for you...

274
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,760
Yao.

275
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,150
- I...
- You...

276
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,400
You go first.

277
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,110
I've been promoted

278
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,240
to General of Valiant Cavalry.

279
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,480
Really?

280
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,510
That's amazing!

281
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,350
I led the troops
straight in and launched

282
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,955
a surprise attack on their stronghold.

283
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,030
Yao,

284
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,870
I did it.

285
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,240
You did it!

286
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,480
You're a general in name
and in fact now.

287
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,910
Of course.

288
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,560
Oh, right.

289
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,760
Look.

290
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,160
They're celebrating.

291
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,400
Our men fought bravely.

292
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,510
Never thought it'd go so well.

293
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,800
Right.

294
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,880
What were you about to say just now?

295
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,480
I wanted to say...

296
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,270
Actually...

297
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,270
I've been thinking about you.

298
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,530
- What I feel for you...
- Yao,

299
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,830
it's too noisy here.

300
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,960
I couldn't hear clearly.

301
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,270
What did you say?

302
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,630
Nothing.

303
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,630
It's not important.

304
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,310
We'll talk about it next time.

305
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,280
All right.

306
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,520
Behind you!

307
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,800
Li Yansheng!

308
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,800
Li Yansheng!

309
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,190
Li Yansheng?

310
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,080
Li Yansheng!

311
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,870
Are you there, Li Yansheng?

312
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,670
Li Yansheng!

313
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,110
Here's the book, Miss.

314
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,950
Thank you.

315
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,400
So

316
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,920
General Li is gone?

317
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,640
Should we tell her?

318
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:19,830
She needs to know sooner or later.

319
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,590
Are you okay?

320
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Let me help you up.

321
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,800
Careful.

322
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,800
Thank you.

323
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,110
Thank you.

324
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,750
It's you guys.

325
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,160
We're here for the mirror.

326
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,000
I expected this would be the ending.

327
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,640
I just didn't expect him

328
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,480
to leave so suddenly.

329
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,880
I know you must be hurting.

330
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,790
Cry if you need to.

331
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,680
He fulfilled his ideals

332
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,720
and lived out his ambitions.

333
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,440
I should be happy for him.

334
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,160
I should be.

335
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,960
I'm just angry at myself,

336
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,400
for not being braver,

337
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,640
for not being more honest.

338
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,640
If I'd told him sooner...

339
00:22:24,222 --> 00:22:25,640
I'll never have another chance.

340
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,200
He'll never know.

341
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,720
Even if he didn't know how you felt,

342
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,030
General Li treasured

343
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,400
that mirror.

344
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,510
It must've been because of you.

345
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,160
He may be gone,

346
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,830
but the mirror is my most
precious possession.

347
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,750
I don't want to give it to anyone.

348
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,640
But this mirror

349
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,510
doesn't belong in this era.

350
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,590
I'm sorry.

351
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,680
She loves Li Yansheng so much.

352
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,720
How could she possibly
give us the mirror?

353
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
He Yiyao!

354
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,422
Never mind the mirror.

355
00:23:31,422 --> 00:23:33,400
Whether we get it back
or not doesn't matter.

356
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,070
But I want you to know this.

357
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,200
If Li Yansheng could see you now,

358
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
he wouldn't want you to be

359
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,550
in so much pain.

360
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,160
He'd want you

361
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,110
to be happy.

362
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,310
You have to be happy!

363
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,590
I'm sorry.

364
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,270
I shouldn't have decided on my own.

365
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,160
You don't need to apologize to me.

366
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:19,350
All of this is because
the Fish-patterned Mirror

367
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,750
shouldn't link different timelines.

368
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,720
Even though it didn't harm He Yiyao,

369
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,240
it would alter her fate.

370
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,240
The butterfly effect

371
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,160
could even change
the course of history.

372
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,720
If someone's at fault,

373
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,960
it's me.

374
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,920
Why?

375
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,960
Where are you heading?

376
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,590
I don't know.

377
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,550
I'm just wandering.

378
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,440
Then, let's travel together.

379
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,000
Such fine days shouldn't be wasted.

380
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,790
I'll take you somewhere.

381
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,950
Come on!

382
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,430
This way.

383
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,880
Why did you stop?

384
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,160
What flowers are those?

385
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,880
Those are locust flowers.

386
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,400
This is Huai City.

387
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,510
Students from
the Imperial Academy live here,

388
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,830
each with their texts,

389
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,750
trading books,

390
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,000
lecturing, and debating ideas.

391
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,590
I like this place.

392
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,550
These are bamboo slips.

393
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,644
Embracing Sand, Crossing the River,

394
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:46,977
The Outpouring of Sad Thoughts,
and Thinking of a Fair One.

395
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,240
Have you read these works?

396
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,560
I have,

397
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,200
but not in this form.

398
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:00,070
This is Crossing the River.

399
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,920
It's my favorite.

400
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,000
If you're interested,

401
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,350
you should read it sometime.

402
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,590
Thank you.

403
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:38,950
Here you go.

404
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,480
We met by chance.

405
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,920
I wouldn't harm you.

406
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,760
Eat up.

407
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,920
You look like you've never eaten one.

408
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,040
Have some tea.

409
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,240
Be careful. It's hot.

410
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,160
I don't even know
how to address you yet.

411
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,030
I can tell you're from elsewhere.

412
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,670
Well, then.

413
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,270
Meeting is fate.

414
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,720
Let's call

415
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,310
each other friends.

416
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,150
What do you say?

417
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,920
Friends?

418
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:54,990
How shall it be said
that you have no clothes?

419
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,480
I will share my robes with you.

420
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,350
A friend is someone

421
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,030
who walks part of life's journey

422
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,400
with you.

423
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,270
Even if it's only for a short stretch,

424
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,310
it's a blessing.

425
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,870
To you, my friend.

426
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,070
To you, my friend.

427
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,880
(That night,)

428
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,350
(I tasted my first pastry,)

429
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,160
(my first sip of tea,)

430
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,920
(and made)

431
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,880
(my first friend.)

432
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,830
Fear not.

433
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,320
Stop!

434
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,750
We're searching for someone.

435
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,360
I didn't order you to draw your blades.

436
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,320
Put those away!

437
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,840
Young Master,

438
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,310
you really put me through a search.

439
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:05,920
After you left,

440
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,790
the residence fell into chaos.

441
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,790
Caiwei was severely punished
for covering for your escape.

442
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,040
Young Master,

443
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,200
please come back

444
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,070
with me.

445
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,160
Who might this be?

446
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,350
We're friends.

447
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,200
Ask no further.

448
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,480
Understood.

449
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,040
Young Master,
on the sixth day of next month,

450
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,790
you'll undergo your coming
of age ceremony.

451
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,310
The date's been set.

452
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,680
It can't be delayed.

453
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,840
Huo Shu.

454
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,790
Do you know why I ran away?

455
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,790
You have your own reasons.

456
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,240
I don't know them.

457
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,880
After the ceremony,

458
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,310
I'll have to shoulder my family's duty.

459
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:53,590
I'll never be able to live
as I please again.

460
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,110
You say you care about me,

461
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,350
so how can you push me
into a life of restriction?

462
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,000
Young Master,

463
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,310
my life is yours.

464
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,720
But I can't disobey

465
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,830
the late master's wishes.

466
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,000
If you refuse,

467
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,960
I'll have to bind you
and take you back.

468
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,550
Fine.

469
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,110
This trip's lasted over half a month.

470
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,240
There's nothing left for me to see.

471
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,750
It's time for me to go back.

472
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,720
Quick, help him mount the horse!

473
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,000
Please, Young Master.

474
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,070
I must return now.

475
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,400
We'll share liquor another day

476
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,510
and talk through the night.

477
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,440
On the seventh day of next month,

478
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:59,000
at Shuyu Restaurant in Luoyang,

479
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,030
ask for Willow Dweller.

480
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,920
Don't forget.

481
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,760
Let's go.

482
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,550
Take care.

483
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,620
(Shuyu Restaurant)

484
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,270
Is Willow Dweller here?

485
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,960
Please follow me, Sir.

486
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,080
Please, step into the carriage.

487
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,860
(Qin Residence)

488
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,380
(Qin Residence)

489
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,390
My friend!

490
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,790
I knew you'd keep your word.

491
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:43,590
Young Master, you've completed
your coming of age ceremony.

492
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,933
Please observe proper etiquette.

493
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,000
My friend, it's as if you've ascended
Kunlun and fed on jade essence.

494
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,510
May you share longevity
with heaven and earth

495
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,180
and shine as brightly
as the sun and moon.

496
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:03,270
You've already memorized

497
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,590
Crossing the River,

498
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,022
and now you're teasing me with it.

499
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,110
I'm not teasing.

500
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,790
Those are words from my heart.

501
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,550
You're a whole other person

502
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,480
since our last meeting.

503
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,350
Wait.

504
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,510
Let me take you somewhere first.

505
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,640
All right?

506
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,480
All right.

507
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,960
This is my treasure trove.

508
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,520
These are

509
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,110
all my collections from over the years.

510
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,960
I never expected you

511
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,550
to have collected
so many rare treasures.

512
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,920
I love collecting.

513
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,510
Everyone knows this about me.

514
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,240
They all think

515
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,830
I'm idle and unambitious.

516
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,480
You don't seem to care
about that reputation.

517
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,800
Why?

518
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,110
The world takes pride in noble lineage.

519
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,030
To me,

520
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,150
high-born families

521
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,480
are nothing but shackles.

522
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,280
Factional struggles

523
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,030
and clan wars

524
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,760
are just passing clouds.

525
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,630
All I hope for

526
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,400
is that one day,

527
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,230
I'll be free.

528
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,630
Break those chains,

529
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,190
and live as you please.

530
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,360
That is the life.

531
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,320
How odd.

532
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,400
With you, I can speak
my heart so easily.

533
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,670
You're different
from Huo Shu and Caiwei.

534
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,670
Whether in hardship

535
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,800
or in glory,

536
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,960
you don't seem to care.

537
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,360
As if you're not bound
by worldly rules at all.

538
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,840
I know you can't reveal your name.

539
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,400
But should you ever run into trouble,

540
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,000
come find me here
at the Qin Residence in Luoyang.

541
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,000
My surname is Qin.

542
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,030
My given name is Ziyi.

543
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,400
Ziyi.

544
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,510
My friend.

545
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,800
(What I'm looking for
are things that belong to you.)

546
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,190
Because I went back to the past

547
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,480
and disrupted the order of time,

548
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,110
they appeared in eras

549
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,760
where they didn't belong.

550
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,360
And because of me,
they developed abnormal energy.

551
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,550
I don't want them
to affect more people.

552
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,440
I must retrieve them.

553
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,630
That's why He Yiyao
and Li Yansheng were able

554
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,880
to see each other
through those two mirrors.

555
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,920
There was ever only one mirror.

556
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:00,780
Shouldn't there have been two?

557
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,630
No.

558
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,960
After Li Yansheng died, the mirror

559
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,150
passed into different hands,

560
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,320
and over the years,

561
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,030
it eventually ended up with He Yiyao.

562
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,120
Does that mean

563
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,670
I could also see people from the past

564
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,230
through that mirror?

565
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,070
No.

566
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,990
I understand.

567
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,070
The rules, right?

568
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:21,400
It's because people in the past
didn't have that mirror.

569
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,800
Then, if people in the past
also had the mirror,

570
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,230
would it work?

571
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,310
No.

572
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,150
Why not?

573
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,000
Because of the rules.

574
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,710
Do you think she'll give us the mirror?

575
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,320
Waiting here every day
isn't a solution.

576
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,680
Yao.

577
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,640
Mom,

578
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,190
I'd like to talk to them.

579
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,920
Could you reconsider?

580
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,320
Didn't you say

581
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,070
the mirror

582
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,400
was your most precious possession?

583
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,800
How could you...

584
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,440
(Does your mirror have
a scratch like this too?)

585
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,190
No.

586
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
What's this?

587
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,600
Look.

588
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,190
Don't these two dots look like eyes?

589
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,190
And this curve.

590
00:38:15,244 --> 00:38:16,480
Doesn't it look like a mouth?

591
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,670
(Yao,)

592
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,960
(even if I'm gone,)

593
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,440
(you have to keep living with a smile.)

594
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,000
Li Yansheng...

595
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,630
Did you carve this for me?

596
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,550
(That day, you told me)

597
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,590
that if Li Yansheng could see me,

598
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,190
he'd want me to be happy.

599
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,240
I think

600
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,000
what he wanted to tell me in the end

601
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,710
was that even if
he wasn't here anymore,

602
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,400
I could still face
the rest of my life with a smile.

603
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,400
So this mirror

604
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,280
should go to someone who needs it more.

605
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,110
I have no regrets left.

606
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,720
Thank you.

607
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,350
That's the spirit.

608
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,000
You should smile more.

609
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,000
Thank you.

610
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,480
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

611
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,760
I never properly thanked you
for saving me that day.

612
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,190
The one who actually saved you

613
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,710

(Yashe)

00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:38,355
We couldn't have recovered
the Fish-patterned Mirror

649
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,070
without your help.

650
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,480

651
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,400
