00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:41,140
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

3
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,140
=Episode 30=

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,000
The Dushan Jade

5
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,519
is a family heirloom that belonged
to your friend.

6
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,200
It's priceless.

7
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,840
I highly doubt

8
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,040
you'd actually smash it.

9
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,799
You're mistaken.

10
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,519
Compared to a life,

11
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,959
what does an object matter?

12
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,319
A life?

13
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,000
The value of a life is relative too.

14
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,199
Those people from the past

15
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,599
are nothing but fossils

16
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,840
in rock to us.

17
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,120
They're dead.

18
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,759
Do you feel sympathy for the dead?

19
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,159
This Dushan Jade, though,

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,639
can be passed down
for tens of thousands of years.

21
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,319
The longer it survives,

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,680
the richer its story becomes.

23
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,800
You would

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,759
never break it.

25
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,759
You'd be out of your mind.

26
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,039
Be it a life

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,759
or an artifact,

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,479
their value was never measured by time.

29
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,639
Their worth comes from mattering

30
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,680
in their brief existence.

31
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,639
I've spent over a decade
dealing with artifacts.

32
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,520
What's worth cherishing

33
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,560
are the living,
breathing people I've met

34
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,719
in my life.

35
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,000
If this jade

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,560
can save someone now,

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,719
then breaking it

38
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,919
gives it meaning.

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,800
Let's see if this changes your mind.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,599
Li.

41
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,960
What's the meaning of this?

42
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,560
Miao Tong.

43
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,360
I know you didn't come with me

44
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,439
to help me find Bizhi.

45
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,400
You're here to protect him.

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,000
Now, you must suffer.

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,960
You claim a life matters more.

48
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,680
So, trade the Dushan Jade for her life.

49
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,840
All right.

50
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,680
You have a deal.

51
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Move it.

52
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,360
Sir…

53
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Run, Bizhi!

54
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,920
Miao Tong!

55
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,160
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,279
I didn't listen to you.

57
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,399
But I did the right thing.

58
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,160
I sent Chu Qiu away to keep him alive.

59
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:29,920
Mr. Bizhi! Watch out!

60
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,199
Sir!

61
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,120
This is the price of betrayal.

62
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,720
Sir!

63
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,600
Bizhi…

64
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,480
Where's the defensive equipment
I gave you?

65
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,000
Are you all right?

66
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,720
I'm fine.

67
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,639
This is defensive equipment.

68
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,079
It's from your time.

69
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,279
We're not from the same time,

70
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,839
but we share a friend.

71
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,399
His name is Bizhi and he is in danger.

72
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
We have to save him.

73
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,879
I know you've lost your memory.

74
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,290
All this probably sounds impossible,

75
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:29,800
but can you

76
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,600
trust me just once?

77
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:38,920
All right.

78
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,040
I trust you.

79
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,399
But before I help you,

80
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,959
I have to warn the villagers
not to drink water from the well.

81
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,519
No!

82
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,279
You can't.

83
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,279
We can't alter history in any way.

84
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,759
Only by not changing the past

85
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,040
can the future be saved.

86
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,600
This is a mission across time.

87
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,240
Even the smallest deviation

88
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,480
could ruin everything.

89
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,399
Don't worry.

90
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,879
Someone will save the villagers.

91
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,860
We have something more important
to do right now.

92
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,839
That's the only reason
I came to find you.

93
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Then tell me.

94
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,600
What do you need me to do?

95
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,920
Do you have something that looks
like a metal button?

96
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,839
Sorry about this.

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,680
What…

98
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,790
What are you looking for?

99
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,560
Found it.

100
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,839
What's this?

101
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,639
It's a Time Administration
Commissioner's alarm device.

102
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,839
No matter where you are in time,
pressing it

103
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,199
sends your coordinates

104
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,319
to the Time Administration.

105
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,560
They'll arrive immediately.

106
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,360
But this alone isn't enough.

107
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,079
There's someone else we need to find.

108
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,399
Su Beilu needed it more.

109
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,399
Stall her.

110
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,759
The longer we hold on,

111
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,279
the better our odds.

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,480
What are we waiting for?

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,279
You'll know soon enough.

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,800
Miss Ye,

115
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,759
please, spare Bizhi.

116
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,199
I'm a time-space analyst.

117
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,639
I can work for you.

118
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,120
With me here,

119
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,639
the Time Administration
will never find you.

120
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,000
It's true you are capable of that.

121
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,759
But I have no use

122
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,679
for traitors.

123
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,879
Bizhi,

124
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,919
don't you think

125
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,320
the more advanced technology becomes,

126
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,799
the greater our responsibility is

127
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,320
to preserve the treasures

128
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,600
people once failed to protect?

129
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,679
Rest assured.

130
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,480
I'll find a worthy owner

131
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,279
for this Dushan Jade.

132
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,840
I won't disgrace such a fine treasure.

133
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,440
Su Beilu…

134
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,399
Please hurry…

135
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,519
Mother!

136
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,600
Mother, where are you?

137
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,519
Mother!

138
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,120
Thank you.

139
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,720
We finally found you, Miao Tong.

140
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,080
How do you know my name?

141
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,600
Who are you?

142
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,559
Have you seen my mother?

143
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,600
Don't worry.

144
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,639
Your mother's safe.

145
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,120
You'll get to know us soon enough.

146
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,240
Right now, there's something very
important we need your help with.

147
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,039
My help?

148
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,600
You're the only one

149
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,919
who can do this.

150
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,080
You have to believe every word I say.

151
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,919
From this moment on,

152
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,840
remember everything I tell you.

153
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,279
The Fusheng Hall

154
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,120
was behind everything.

155
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,039
I…

156
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,840
don't understand what you're saying.

157
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,120
One day, you will.

158
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,960
And when you do,

159
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,720
press this button.

160
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,000
It will save many lives.

161
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,039
And him.

162
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,120
Remember his face.

163
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,559
You'll meet again very soon.

164
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,320
When you see him again,

165
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,159
it'll prove
that everything I said was true.

166
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,360
Miao Tong,

167
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,559
you must keep this button safe.

168
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,519
Don't be afraid.

169
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,080
Remember.

170
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,480
Let everything run its course.

171
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,240
Ye Liangyin, stop right there!

172
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,879
The Fusheng Hall was behind everything.

173
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,480
The tragedy in Miao Village
was no natural disaster.

174
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,960
It was all you!

175
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,120
How do you know that?

176
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:54,759
No!

177
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,799
Kill her!

178
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,320
Miss Ye,

179
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,080
drop your weapon.

180
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,360
Commissioner.

181
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,879
I know I won't survive.

182
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,279
But he must die

183
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,240
before my eyes.

184
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,039
Why?

185
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,200
Bizhi!

186
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,799
Su Beilu,

187
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,679
you did it…

188
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,728
(All members of the Fusheng Hall
were arrested during the operation.)

189
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:42,576
(The time elevators they had
illegally possessed were confiscated.)

190
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:45,780
(The disrupted timelines
are now being restored…)

191
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,200
Su Beilu, born in the year 2000.

192
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,519
Due to your involvement in a case

193
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,519
originating from the future,

194
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,200
we need to ask you some questions.

195
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,960
Where's Bizhi?

196
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,279
Is he all right?

197
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,519
He's still unconscious.

198
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,080
His body needs time to recover.

199
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,000
We'll do everything we can.

200
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,159
After all,

201
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
he's also a victim
of those time-space criminals.

202
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,240
Then…

203
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,600
Are you sending me back now?

204
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,440
I'm sorry.

205
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,840
Not yet.

206
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,200
You must answer
our questions truthfully.

207
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,080
Before using Yashe to travel
through time at the Tianguang Market,

208
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,039
what did Bizhi say to you?

209
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,200
He told me to use Yashe

210
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,639
to return to Miao Village
in the Wanqi era

211
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,679
and find a commissioner named Chu Qiu.

212
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,120
He had lost his memory.

213
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,120
I was supposed to investigate the truth

214
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,480
behind the Miao Village epidemic

215
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,799
with him

216
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,759
and seal

217
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,640
an alarm device

218
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,680
inside Miao Tong's longevity lock.

219
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,160
She's the girl who later became
the Market Lord of the Tianguang Market.

220
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,519
Why did he want you to do that?

221
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,920
Because he knew

222
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,799
Miao Tong would protect him,

223
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,440
and that she would follow
Ye Liangyin back to the past.

224
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,079
After we complete the mission,

225
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,000
Miao Tong's memories will update.

226
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,400
That alarm device

227
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,160
will also be transmitted to the past.

228
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,359
In a crisis,

229
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,839
it'll be able to alert you

230
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,480
and save lives.

231
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,759
Why did you do what he said?

232
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:13,799
Because I trust him.

233
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,640
There had to be a lapse on your side.

234
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,599
Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone alone

235
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,880
to look for evidence
against the Fusheng Hall.

236
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,720
For the series of disruptions
caused by the Fusheng Hall,

237
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,039
we're doing everything we can
to make amends.

238
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,559
How?

239
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,440
For those in history
who were unlawfully killed

240
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,000
by the criminals,

241
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,160
we try to return to before the incident
and restore the situation.

242
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:48,720
However,

243
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,440
all of it

244
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,480
is carried out
under precise calculations,

245
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,640
to avoid causing even
greater disturbances to the timeline.

246
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,200
Before Bizhi sent you to Miao Village,

247
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,640
did he say anything else?

248
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,880
He said…

249
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,640
He said he had two pieces
of defensive equipment.

250
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,279
He lied.

251
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,039
Mr. Su Beilu,

252
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:25,440
we'll return you
to your original time shortly.

253
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,680
You may experience
some memory confusion,

254
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,920
but that is only temporary.

255
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,880
It happens because we're erasing
your memories of this incident.

256
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,519
Does that

257
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,480
include Bizhi?

258
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,960
Yes.

259
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Everything unraveled from the moment
he used Yashe to go back in time

260
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,599
to save Qin Ziyi.

261
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:55,390
This is a segment of history
that should've never existed.

262
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:56,880
Which means

263
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,799
you and he

264
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,359
can't meet.

265
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,960
Then…

266
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,160
Can I see him one last time?

267
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,799
No.

268
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:20,160
You can't see him
in your current identity.

269
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,119
That would violate our rules.

270
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,559
I won't interfere with your regulations.

271
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,920
I don't have to see him as who I am now.

272
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,240
Is that possible?

273
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:54,920
My friend.

274
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,000
What brings you here?

275
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,470
The weather couldn't be better today.

276
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,630
It'd be a shame to stay inside.

277
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,600
Let's go out for a walk.

278
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,839
All right.

279
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,200
How have you been lately?

280
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,440
I've set aside some money.

281
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,039
I'm preparing to settle down here.

282
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,559
You have a fine residence.

283
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,640
Once you're settled,

284
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,039
you could do some business

285
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
like the other merchants.

286
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,680
Maybe open a restaurant.

287
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,039
Luoyang doesn't have
many good teahouses.

288
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,720
You could

289
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,599
open one.

290
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,000
A teahouse?

291
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:42,839
Oh.

292
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,559
Do you like tea?

293
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,359
Why did you want us to come here for tea today?

294
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,039
It's not exactly tea season,

295
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,559
but tea is still healthier

296
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:10,279
than liquor.

297
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:14,400
Bizhi, it'd be better for you
to drink less going forward.

298
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,000
All right.

299
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:21,400
Bizhi,

300
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:25,240
let me wish you,
with tea in place of wine,

301
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,839
the strength to smile
through every challenge.

302
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,759
You will see

303
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,920
all your wishes fulfilled.

304
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,680
This is Huai City.

305
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,480
Scholars and literati

306
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,200
gather here,

307
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,440
carrying scrolls, trading books,

308
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,759
debating ideas.

309
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,000
My friend.

310
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,240
We've been here before.

311
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,000
I know.

312
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,839
You once said

313
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,119
that in mid-spring,
petals of the white locust blossoms

314
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,920
fill the city

315
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,920
like falling frost.

316
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,160
You were right.

317
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,519
Locust blossoms are edible too.

318
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,000
Is that so?

319
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,359
First, you steam the blossoms,

320
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,359
then serve them with sauce

321
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,200
and wheat rice.

322
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,279
They're snow-white, fragrant,

323
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,880
and have a pleasant aftertaste.

324
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,000
When I was little, my granny…

325
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,359
My grandmother would
prepare it for me often.

326
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,319
But

327
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,920
I don't know how to prepare it myself.

328
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,160
Thank you

329
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,359
for keeping me company today.

330
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,640
It's getting late.

331
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,390
You should return and get some rest.

332
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,440
Bizhi.

333
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,359
I enjoyed today as well.

334
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,079
Remember

335
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,079
to go out more when you can.

336
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,200
Drink less.

337
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,200
Make more friends.

338
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,200
Every flower

339
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,559
and blade of grass

340
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,440
in this world is lovely.

341
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,559
You were a little strange today,

342
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,039
but you seemed much more at ease

343
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,039
compared to your usual self.

344
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,720
I hope

345
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,079
you can always be this lighthearted.

346
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,680
If so,

347
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,279
then this journey was worth making.

348
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,559
Take care, my friend.

349
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,160
We'll meet again another day.

350
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,480
May we meet again.

351
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:23,759
Then let's pinky swear.

352
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,079
It's your form of etiquette.

353
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,319
I remember.

354
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,440
Goodbye.

355
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,079
Ready to go,

356
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,640
Mr. Su Beilu?

357
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,079
Get it! What are you waiting for?

358
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,599
Get it!

359
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,279
Xiaomin…

360
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,359
Xiaomin…

361
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,599
You're awake?

362
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,960
You're awake!

363
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,559
How are you feeling?

364
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,920
I'll get the doctor.

365
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:12,759
Doctor!

366
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:13,920
Doctor!

367
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,160
(Is that)

368
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,599
(Xiaomin?)

369
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,720
(She looks like a tomboy…)

370
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,660
(Mom)

371
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,860
Hello?

372
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,620
Hello?

373
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,559
Why aren't you saying anything?

374
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,980
Hello?

375
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,599
Can you hear me?

376
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,440
Mom…

377
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,880
Bei?

378
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,799
You're awake, Bei?

379
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,680
Bei!

380
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,319
Thank goodness!

381
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,119
Bei's awake?

382
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,039
Wait for us.

383
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,119
We'll be right there!

384
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,039
Bei,

385
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,440
wait for us.

386
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,319
We're on our way!

387
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,599
Dad…

388
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,440
Don't cry.

389
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,519
Don't cry, Bei.

390
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:04,960
We'll be right there.

391
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,039
Don't cry.

392
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,799
Come on! Hurry up!

393
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,860
Hello?

394
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,079
Who is this?

395
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,759
Oops, sorry Mr. and Mrs. Su.

396
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,279
Yes.

397
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,440
(Chun Ge?)

398
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,599
(He looks so much more mature
than I remember…)

399
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,759
All right. I'll see you in a bit.

400
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,640
Okay.

401
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,119
Answering calls as soon as you're awake.

402
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,900
Can't you let yourself rest for once?

403
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,079
Lie down.

404
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,160
Chun Ge!

405
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,799
The accident didn't happen…

406
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,200
My parents are alive…

407
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,240
I'm so glad…

408
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,640
What?

409
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,920
Enough.

410
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,119
What are you going on about?

411
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,839
Of course, they're fine.

412
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,480
You're the one who got

413
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,279
into a car accident.

414
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,200
I was in an accident?

415
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:19,920
Yes.

416
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,279
Don't you remember?

417
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,319
Don't scare me like that.

418
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:27,119
You were riding your bike to work

419
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,759
when a car ran a red light and hit you.

420
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,400
You don't remember that?

421
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,799
You've had a rough run of luck.

422
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,200
One second later
and you'd have been fine.

423
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,400
Here.

424
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:39,480
Let's get rid

425
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,319
of your bad luck.

426
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,039
Here.

427
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:41,599
Cut it out!

428
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,079
What about Bizhi? Where is he?

429
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:44,440
Who?

430
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,440
Bizhi?

431
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,839
Who's Bizhi?

432
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,200
Bizhi!

433
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,759
You have a friend named Bizhi?

434
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,839
I don't remember that.
What does he look like?

435
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,519
He…

436
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,359
Keep going.

437
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,559
I don't remember.

438
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,000
Do you remember him?

439
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,960
No.

440
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,759
Try to remember.

441
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,039
We're friends.

442
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,119
We

443
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:15,240
We even…

444
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,279
We even

445
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,960
worked together.

446
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
You worked together?

447
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:25,279
There's no one with the surname Bi
at Chongle Pet Hospital.

448
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,039
Not that I know of.

449
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,319
The doctor's here!

450
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,400
Doctor, quick!

451
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,559
Examine my friend!

452
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,400
He just woke up

453
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,839
and called home.

454
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,519
After that, he kept muttering
about someone named Bizhi.

455
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,720
We have no idea who Bizhi is.

456
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,000
Do you think

457
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,359
there's something wrong with his head?

458
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,839
It's not serious, right?

459
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,799
He just regained consciousness.

460
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,000
He's probably

461
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,400
still a little disoriented.

462
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,519
Let him rest some more.

463
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,319
I don't see any problems for now.

464
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,640
Nothing to worry about.

465
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:58,880
Thanks, doctor.

466
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,400
You heard what the doctor said.

467
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,119
You need rest.

468
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,119
Get under the blanket.

469
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:08,759
Rest.

470
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:09,359
No moving.

471
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,880
No using your phone.

472
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,480
Got it?

473
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,119
We're going to pick up your parents.

474
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:13,799
Come on.

475
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:14,519
Stay put.

476
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,119
- There's millet porridge there.
- We'll be right back.

477
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,039
It's still warm.

478
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,440
If you're hungry, eat it.

479
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,119
See you later!

480
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,580
(Chongle Pet Hospital)

481
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,319
Good morning, sir.

482
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,559
Be serious.

483
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,599
Does it still hurt?

484
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:00,559
Get to work, then.

485
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,440
Get a move on.

486
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,519
You haven't clocked in.

487
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,759
Oh, I forgot.

488
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,559
Su Beilu.

489
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,519
Sir, I was only two minutes late.

490
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,480
Just let me clock in.

491
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:17,440
Clocking in

492
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,039
is just a formality.

493
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,290
You were just discharged
from the hospital.

494
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,279
Don't do any heavy work.

495
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,000
If you're tired,

496
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,200
rest in my office.

497
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,240
Why are you standing there?

498
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,720
Go get changed.

499
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:32,119
Okay, but please remember
to clock me in.

500
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,359
You're still hung up on that?

501
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,839
No more punching the clock.

502
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:35,799
Go on.

503
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,480
Chun Ge, I just transferred
the money to you.

504
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,400
Remember to accept it.

505
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,880
No need. Why are you being so polite?

506
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,519
I should be.

507
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,960
Everything you ordered

508
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,300
isn't even what I like.

509
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,160
That's not what you said
when you were eating.

510
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,680
You looked like you were enjoying it.

511
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,559
That's because you ordered it.
I felt bad not eating it.

512
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,319
I didn't want to waste food.

513
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,279
You said the same thing yesterday.

514
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,400
But you ate the food today too.

515
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,519
I've always felt awkward about it.

516
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,839
I finally mustered courage to tell you,

517
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:04,960
but you'd already bought food again.

518
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,839
Hey, lovebirds. Stop arguing.
You'll hurt your relationship.

519
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
What's wrong with you?

520
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,319
As if I'd ever like her.

521
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,160
You think I'd like you?

522
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,440
As if I'd ever like you.

523
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,240
I've put the dog food here.

524
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,250
I'll check later to see
if we're missing anything.

525
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,440
Morning.

526
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,319
Sorry.

527
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,160
Don't worry about it.

528
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,200
Hey, Dad.

529
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:55,519
Bei.

530
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,079
I messaged you this morning.
Why didn't you reply?

531
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,440
Didn't see it earlier.

532
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:01,839
You know how it is.

533
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,480
Your mom keeps a tight rein on me.

534
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:07,519
My salary and bonuses,
all of it goes straight to her.

535
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,239
My wallet is empty.

536
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,960
Transfer me a thousand.

537
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:11,559
Got it?

538
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,760
I'm meeting Wang.

539
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,519
We're going

540
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,039
to have some tea and catch up.

541
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,400
Send me the money…

542
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,679
Why'd he hang up on me?

543
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,519
(Su Beilu transferred 1,000.)

544
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,360
Good boy.

545
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,199
That's my son.

546
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,239
Listen to this.

547
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,400
I picked up an artifact today.

548
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,159
Honoring heaven and earth,
offering sacrifices to spirits,

549
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,159
hosting honored guests,

550
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,119
none of it works without
what I'm holding here.

551
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,760
A Three-Legged Jue.

552
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,679
Let me see it.

553
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,440
What's wrong?

554
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,910
If you're not buying, don't touch it.

555
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,480
Break it and you pay.

556
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,679
This is a 3,000-year-old artifact.

557
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,840
3,000 years?

558
00:34:58,519 --> 00:34:59,320
For real?

559
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,480
Of course.

560
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,079
Just listen to him.

561
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,460
(Lin Zhong, Ninghai Art Exhibition)

562
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,360
My goddess is coming to Ninghai
to hold an exhibition.

563
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,280
Look.

564
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,440
Do you know Lin Zhong?

565
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,719
She's a famous artist.

566
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,119
We met at a wine party.

567
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,079
She messaged me herself

568
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,559
and invited me to her exhibition.

569
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:19,840
All right, folks.

570
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,159
I'm heading out.

571
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,440
See you around.

572
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,760
And he just left

573
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,039
a 3,000-year-old artifact here?

574
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:27,960
And you believe him?

575
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,280
It's fake.

576
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,440
If it were real,
he wouldn't leave it here.

577
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,320
Let's go.

578
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,320
Mr. Wang.

579
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:35,199
Let's check out that side.

580
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:44,900
(Little Fishing Island Bookstore)

581
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,320
Made a mess again.

582
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:08,960
Tuanzi.

583
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,119
Tuanzi.

584
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,800
Tuanzi.

585
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,079
Wait.

586
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:22,480
No, this is right.

587
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,079
You're black.

588
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,440
Tuanzi,

589
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,719
if you

590
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,159
misbehave again,

591
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:29,840
I'll…

592
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,760
I get it.

593
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,760
All right.

594
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,880
Go and play.

595
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,920
You even messed up the couch.

596
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,480
The vet licensing exam permit…

597
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:12,519
for yesterday?

598
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,679
Tuanzi,

599
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,159
I missed the exam again!

600
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:30,159
Commissioner Chu Qiu.

601
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,100
(Miao Village)

602
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,280
I'm your new colleague.

603
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,079
HQ sent me here to meet up with you.

604
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,639
Evidence of the Fusheng Hall's crimes
has been eliminated.

605
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,360
The villagers don't know anything
about the ancient tomb.

606
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,639
History is proceeding as normal.

607
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,079
I checked the water in the well too.

608
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,159
No poison detected.

609
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,520
My task here is complete.
I'm heading to the next location.

610
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,079
I'll go with you.

611
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,679
Do we…

612
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,480
know each other?

613
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,000
We do.

614
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,000
You're that girl

615
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,360
from Miao Village.

616
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,599
How did you end up
in the Time Administration?

617
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:30,559
That's a long story.

618
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,599
But

619
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,840
we've got plenty of time to talk.

620
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,760
Let's go.

621
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:36,360
Miss.

622
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,159
I don't think this is appropriate.

623
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,199
What's wrong?

624
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,960
We used to be like this too.

625
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:42,639
Oh, also,

626
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,480
you used to work
at the Tianguang Market.

627
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,000
Your memories were erased.

628
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,159
But that's all right.

629
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,559
I can tell you everything

630
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,159
about the Tianguang Market.

631
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,519
Anyway,

632
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:54,280
you used to be the one
keeping me company.

633
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,180
From now on, I'll be the one
staying with you.

634
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,079
Don't worry.

635
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,480
Come on.

636
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,519
We're going to the year 2023.

637
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:01,159
I know

638
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,800
a little about that year.

639
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:06,039
I haven't even asked your name yet.

640
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,599
My name's Miao Tong.

641
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:09,920
I'm Chu Qiu.

642
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:11,880
Let's go.

643
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,079
Do you know bubble tea?

644
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,360
I know a place there
that makes really good bubble tea.

645
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,199
I think it's…

646
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,920
"chewy mochi milk foam tea

647
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,199
with cheese cream,
berries, mango, and peach."

648
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,140
(One Year Later)

649
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,920
Took you long enough.

650
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,239
Come on.

651
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:32,000
Cheers!

652
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:32,880
Cheers!

653
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:34,559
Happy birthday, Dr. Su!

654
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:35,119
Thanks.

655
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,119
You're officially Dr. Su now.

656
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,079
Thanks,

657
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:38,880
Nurse Ren.

658
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,280
You're something else, though.

659
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,639
You passed on your first try.

660
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:45,480
If only he'd been this serious
back in school.

661
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,079
Right?

662
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,840
Was I really that lazy

663
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,800
in school?

664
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,159
That's what you told me.

665
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,199
You said

666
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,559
your parents spoiled you,

667
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,760
so you'd skip class

668
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,599
a lot.

669
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,900
You basically did everything
you weren't supposed to.

670
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,559
Hey, don't say that.

671
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,519
You're one to talk.

672
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,800
He definitely slacked off

673
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,079
instead of studying.

674
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,079
Isn't that right?

675
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,199
- I can tell.
- She talks like

676
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,239
she was right there with me.

677
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,079
How'd you know that?

678
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,800
I can picture it with my pinky.

679
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
I mean,

680
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,880
you're confident but soft.

681
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,320
Look at you, weak as a breeze.

682
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:13,840
Sit down.

683
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,639
You're like a chick.

684
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:15,000
Sit down.

685
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:15,920
A breeze could knock you down.

686
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,519
Sit down. Fine, you're the strong one.

687
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:18,880
You're the brainiac.

688
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,719
All right, all right.

689
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,390
- Let's have another toast.
- All right.

690
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,639
Bring it in.

691
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,400
Cheers!

692
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,639
Cheers!

693
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:30,880
I'm off.

694
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,519
Bye.

695
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,199
Be safe.

696
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,920
- Check in when you get home.
- Got it.

697
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,280
See you.

698
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,320
Happy birthday!

699
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,880
Bye.

700
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:40,840
Hello.

701
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,559
Is Xinyang Road that way?

702
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,000
You can use your phone to navigate.

703
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,119
I left my phone at home.

704
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,679
I'll look it up for you then.

705
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,239
Yes,

706
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,199
that's the way.

707
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:19,679
Thank you.

708
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,760
You're welcome.

709
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,519
Wait.

710
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,990
I'm going the same direction.
I'll walk with you.

711
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,860
- I wouldn't want to trouble you.
- No problem.

712
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:37,400
Thank you.

713
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,079
Do you work in Ninghai too?

714
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:43,639
I run a small shop.

715
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,400
What's it called?

716
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,000
Yashe.

Your antique shop is really nice.

766
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:55,600

That's a unique name.

Is that so?

You're welcome to drop by again anytime.

Oh, right.

00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:13,160
Can I get your contact?

My dad's a fan of antiques too.

776
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,881
Could you help him take a look sometime?

777
00:45:17,001 --> 00:45:18,401
I don't want him getting ripped off.

778
00:45:18,401 --> 00:45:19,120
Certainly.

779
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:25,401
Done.

780
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,001
I'm off, then.

00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,640
