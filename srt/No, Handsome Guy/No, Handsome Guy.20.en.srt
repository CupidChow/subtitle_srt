Stop looking, let's go.

00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,240
So many people are watching.

Ye Ran,

32
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,760
you should do the manga advertisement.

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,080
Can I really do it?

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,400
Yu Feng shot the advertisement
from our competitor.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,840
He hurt you,

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,200
so you should fight back fiercely.

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,760
But he's a mega internet celebrity,

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,160
and I'm just a nobody,

39
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,560
how can I win over him?

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
With your talent.

41
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,920
Ye Ran,

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,480
don't doubt yourself.

43
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,440
Beauty will fade eventually,

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,840
but talent is the eternal
competitive advantage.

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,440
Believe me,

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,920

Hello, everyone.

51
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,440
I'm the manga book author,

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,800
Bodhi Leaf.

53
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,480
Did you hear

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
about the scandal of Rainy Night?

55
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Of course.

56
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,600
He is so handsome,

57
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,440
yet his private life is so terrible.

58
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,040
He cheated and lived off women.

59
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,240
I wonder what his ex-girlfriend,

60
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,920
Gua Tiantian, saw in him.

61
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,360
You don't know?

62
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,600
Before Gua Tiantian,

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,960
he had an underground girlfriend.

64
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,800
He smeared her as a crazy fan in the end,

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,400
and she was cyberbullied for a long time.

66
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,560
Unfortunately, all related news
has been suppressed.

67
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,520
Now Rainy Night's fan group

68
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,720
is organizing an apology to that girl.

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,280
