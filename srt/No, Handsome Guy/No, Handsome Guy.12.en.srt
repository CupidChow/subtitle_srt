We should seize the opportunity.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,640
Right, boss?

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,360
Chen Erqiang,

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,040
you're actually an undercover agent.

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,240
This place is surrounded by our people.

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,040
Surrender now!

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,680
Dream on if you want me

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,960
to surrender.

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,760
Those who betray me

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
will die.

35
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,720
Don't move,

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,600
or I'll kill you right now

37
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,840
and avenge Tianming.

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,120
Meng Yuan was brought to justice.

39
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,160
Ye Xin and Chen Erqiang

40
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,120
started a new love and challenge.

41
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,480
Ye Ran,

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,280
didn't you want to avenge me?

43
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,840
Why hasn't the villain died?

44
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,960
I feel like it's a pity
for this character to die.

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,840
You're so ruthless towards the male lead

46
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,600
but soft-hearted towards the villain.

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,000
Why are you so serious?

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,760
By the way,

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,120
when are you going out to find a job?

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,760
Have you found an apartment yet?

51
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,360
What?

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,440
Ye Ran,

53
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,680
are you kicking me out?

54
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,800
I have a boyfriend now.

55
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,600
It's not proper for me
to live with you anymore.

56
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,960
What if Secretary Chen gets jealous?

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,560
Boyfriend?

58
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,040
Secretary Chen?

59
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,960
Calm down.

60
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,440
What's the big deal?

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,360
You said you're not a kid anymore.

62
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,400
Calm down.

63
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,800
Weren't we going
to invite everyone to dinner?

64
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,280
Why did we come here?

65
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,680
It's on the way.

66
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,160
There are many memories here.

67
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,480
Did you read
the updated manga last night?

68
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,440
How did you feel?

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,640
The manga?

70
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,880
It is pretty good.

71
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,450
- That's it?
- Don't run.

72
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,600
What I meant was,

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,240
any manga you draw is surely good.

74
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,680
Shoot him! Shoot him!

75
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,520
Look,

76
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,880
they are playing with water guns.

77
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
But love can't just rely on online chat,

78
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,880
the feelings in reality are also important.

79
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,040
So let me ask you,

80
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,360
does your heart beat faster

81
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,720
when he looks at you?

82
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,240
Do you feel flustered

83
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,560
when he gets closer to you?

84
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,800
(I'll have a test)

85
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,160
(and then I'll know.)

86
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,600
Secretary Chen.

87
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,120
Wait a moment.

88
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,440
Maybe you shouldn't wear the wig.

89
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,480
I think you looked pretty with short hair.

90
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,320
It hurts.

91
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
- It hurts?
- Be gentle.

92
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,800
Isn't this a wig?

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,120
Can't be real hair.

94
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,800
- It hurts.
- Impossible.

95
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,400
It can't grow so fast.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,280
How dare you bully my sister!

97
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
It's you!

98
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,320
Two Ye Rans?

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,720
What is going on?

100
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,440
Let me introduce.

101
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,520
This is my big sister,

102
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,480
Ye Dang.

103
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,880
- You fraud...
- Nice to meet you.

104
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,960
I'll drink this first.

105
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,040
Ye Dang, what do you do for work?

106
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm a martial arts coach.

107
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,480
That's so cool.

108
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,600
- Sounds great.
- Really cool.

109
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,560
Ye Dang,

110
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
why are you here?

111
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,960
Chi said you're in love.

112
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,240
He's almost dying of anxiety.

113
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,640
He asked me to come and check on you.

114
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,160
What a big mouth.

115
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,760
That brat.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Secretary Chen,

117
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,200
I'll toast to you.

118
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,200
Don't you dare
bully Ye Ran in the future.

119
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,960
- I...
- Fill it up.

120
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,600
Let me do it.

121
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,320
You tricked me last time

122
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,400
by pretending to be Ye Ran.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,320
There were reasons for that.

124
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,880
Don't tell Ye Ran about it.

125
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,880
Come on, let's toast to Ye Ran
and Secretary Chen together.

126
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,000
Wish them a sweet and

127
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,400
long-lasting love.

128
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,640
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

129
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Come on, Secretary Chen.

130
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

131
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,240
Let's play a game.

132
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,720
Truth or Dare?

133
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
- Okay.
- Okay, let's do it.

134
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,080
You lost!

135
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,680
Alright, alright, I lost.

136
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,720
I'll take a drink.

137
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,360
Hello?

138
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,560
Come on, another round.

139
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,920
Okay, I'll go first this time.

140
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,920
And you lost this round.

141
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,230
Okay, I'll drink.

142
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,800
I need to use the restroom.

143
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,070
This is delicious.

144
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,720
- Really? Let me try.
- Ye Ran,

145
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,160
what's going on with you two?

146
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,600
Why does it feel like

147
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,360
you're not in a relationship at all?

148
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,520
It's so awkward.

149
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,000
But seriously,

150
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,960
how far have you two progressed?

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,160
What are you thinking?

152
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,120
We've only been together for two days.

153
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,120
Why did you stop? Let's continue.

154
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,200
Come on, let's continue.

155
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,760
Ye Ran, it's your turn.

156
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,240
What do you choose?

157
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,130
I...

158
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,720
Dare, of course.

159
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,320
Dare is so much fun!

160
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,320
Isn't that a bit too much?

161
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,800
What a great opportunity.

162
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,720
Do you want a sweet relationship or not?

163
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,180
Don't chicken out, come on.

164
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,440
Listen,

165
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,360
there are footsteps.

166
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,760
He's here. Go!

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,440
Darling, give me a kiss.

168
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,640
Oh no,

169
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,680
you kissed the wrong person.

170
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,120
Mr. Meng.

171
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,400
Boss...

172
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,480
You're quite bold.

173
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,000
Boss, I'm sorry.

174
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,120
Let me explain.

175
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,080
Mr. Meng, I'm sorry.

176
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,560
We were playing Truth or Dare just now,

177
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,760
and it was my turn.

178
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,560
I just...

179
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,800
I got carried away and

180
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,080
made a mistake.

181
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,200
Aren't you angry?

182
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
How could I not be angry?

183
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,120
The second time.

184
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,920
This is the second time
you've offended me.

185
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,360
So,

186
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,960
you need to make it up to me again.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,560
How about
I draw a portrait for you again?

188
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,520
Why?

189
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,360
Do you really like drawing me that much?

190
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,000
No, it's not like that.

191
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,320
So, what you're saying is that

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,480
you're really disdainful of me
as a model?

193
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,000
No,

194
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,360
no.

195
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,440
Alright,

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,080
I won't make it difficult for you.

197
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,800
Just answer me one question.

198
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,040
Thank you, boss.

199
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,440
I'll tell you

200
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,400
everything.

201
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,520
Ye Ran,

202
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,640
why are you so afraid of me?

203
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,840
Because...

204
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,280
What do you want to say?

205
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,480
Ye Dang,

206
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,880
I need to talk to you.

207
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,240
Talk about what?

208
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,240
Just say it.
