42

Why would the boss want to talk to her?

43
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,240
Probably to scold her.

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,920
I heard she messed up
the posters last time

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,960
and offended the boss.

46
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,680
Meina,

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,880
why aren't you talking?

48
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,800
I'm holding a secret.

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
It's too hard.

50
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,200
Secret?

51
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,200
What time is it now?

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,360
Lunch break has been over
for half an hour.

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,400
How did I oversleep again?

54
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,840
I almost forgot.

55
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,040
What was I doing just now?

56
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,620
(A new message)

57
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,200
Secretary Chen,

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,960
I overslept yesterday.

59
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,920
I am so sorry.

60
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,920
Are you angry?

61
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,460
(No.)

62
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm really sorry.

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,640
(Silence)
I remember you said

64
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,000
you had something to tell me.

65
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,080
How about we reschedule?

66
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,840
I promise not to be late again.

67
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,800
(A Leaflet)

68
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's meet after work then.

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,940
(Let's meet after work then.)

70
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,320
This is the last time
I'll be acting as Secretary Chen.

71
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,640
It's time to tell you

72
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,880
who Silence really is.

73
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,720
Ye Ran.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,120
So, what do you want to tell me?

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,400
Last night, after I got back,

76
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,120
I couldn't sleep all night.

77
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,200
I found myself
thinking about you all the time.

78
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,720
Ye Ran,

79
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,920
you're right.

80
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,600
Maybe I should give us a chance.

81
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,560
I've decided.

82
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,240
I want to be your boyfriend.

83
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,760
That's great.

84
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:19,440
Is this the latest version?

85
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,720
Sent it last night.

86
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,600
Okay.

87
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,400
You look very handsome today.

88
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,920
Your hairpiece looks natural.

89
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,560
What's going on?

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,920
You two aren't...

91
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,600
You did a good job keeping it a secret.

92
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,920
Come clean.

93
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,110
When did you two start?

94
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,080
Who pursued who?

95
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,040
This calls for

96
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,280
a celebration.

97
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,240
No problem.

98
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,840
Tomorrow night,

99
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,120
I'll treat everyone to dinner.

100
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,760
Ignore them.

101
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,880
Let's go.

102
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,280
Okay.

103
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,560
Secretary Chen,

104
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,880
come with me.

105
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,520
Boss,

106
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,640
you said no overtime tonight.

107
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,240
Plans change.

108
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,120
It's okay.

109
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,920
I can wait for you here.

110
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,480
Boss doesn't seem happy, does he?

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,680
Lin Meina,

112
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,800
you usually talk the most.

113
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,280
Why aren't you saying anything today?

114
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,000
There's too much information.

115
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,360
I need to process them.

116
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,560
Boss,

117
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,360
what's going on?

118
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,360
Didn't you not like Ye Ran?

119
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,920
Why do you suddenly want
to be with her?

120
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,600
Originally, I really
didn't have any feelings for her.

121
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,640
But after seeing her alone last time,

122
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,920
I found out she had a completely
different side.

123
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,760
Cool,

124
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,320
elegant,

125
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,480
and very charming.

126
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
You've

127
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
seen her alone?

128
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,120
Sorry, boss,

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,720
I know you asked me to reject her last time

130
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,400
completely for my own good.

131
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,160
But rest assured,

132
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,960
I won't let love affect my work.

133
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,120
Are you

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,240
serious?

135
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,400
I used to only know work,

136
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,520
didn't know what love was.

137
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,040
But now I realize,

138
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,440
when the feeling comes,

139
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,800
it can't be stopped.

140
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,400
Moreover, Ye Ran likes me so much.

141
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
We belong to each other.

142
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,920
We should seize the opportunity.

143
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,000
Right, boss?

144
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,000
Boss, your hand...

145
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,240
Oh right,

146
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,280
why are you suddenly with Secretary Chen?

147
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,280
Suddenly?

148
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,480
Others don't know,

149
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,720
but you know that

150
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,200
I've liked Secretary Chen

151
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,440
for a long time.

152
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,080
I thought you had a better choice.

153
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,680
For me,

154
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,600
I think Secretary Chen is the best choice.

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,840
You see,

156
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,040
he looks ordinary,

157
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,160
has a gentle personality,

158
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,040
and is kind, warm-hearted, and reliable.

159
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,320
And he supports me in drawing manga.

160
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,920
Although we don't interact much usually,

161
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,720
we have endless conversations on WeChat,

162
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,960
and endless topics.

163
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,880
It feels like we've known each other
for a long time.

164
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,080
But love can't just rely on online chat,

165
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,880
the feelings in reality are also important.

166
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,080
So let me ask you,

167
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,240
does your heart beat faster

168
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,520
when he looks at you?

169
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,160
Do you feel flustered

170
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,320
when he gets closer to you?

171
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,320
Be careful.

172
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,080
Secretary Chen is indeed a good man,

173
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,160
but don't you think
the boss is also good?

174
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,480
Don't mention him to me.

175
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,720
In my heart,

176
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
he's a nightmare.

177
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,240
I'm afraid to

178
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,600
even get close to him,

179
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,560
let alone anything else.

180
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,160
As long as he stays away from me,

181
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,560
I'll be glad.

182
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,960
Is there even a slight possibility?

183
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
No.

184
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,000
Even if I have to be single
for the rest of my life,

185
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,480
I won't like him.

186
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,120
Ye Ran!

187
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,800
