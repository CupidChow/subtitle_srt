Have you heard?

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,700
The boss is back.

26
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,860
The boss?

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,900
Wasn't he always at the branch office?

28
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,780
(My name is Meng Zhao,)

29
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,220
(a miserable handsome guy.)

30
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,500
(I have a handsome appearance,)

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,980
(but also carry)

32
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,940
(a huge burden.)

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,800
Handsome, right?

34
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,600
So handsome. He looked at me.

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,900
He's so handsome.

36
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,940
Boss!

37
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,380
Stop drooling.

38
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,660
Mr. Meng is so handsome.

39
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,340
He must have had many girlfriends.

40
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,420
Come in.

41
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,900
Mr. Meng.

42
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,660
Your coffee.

43
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,980
Put it there.

44
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,300
(Oh no.)

45
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,940
(There it goes again.)

46
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,460
(I can't look at her)

47
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,540
(or smile.)

48
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,460
(I can't give her any wrong information.)

49
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,300
Mr. Meng, actually, I...

50
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,220
You may leave

51
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,700
if there's nothing else.

52
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,420
I have something to tell you.

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,340
Mr. Meng,

54
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,660
from the first day I met you,

55
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,060
I knew I was in trouble.

56
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,020
Mr. Meng,

57
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,340
I like you.

58
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,620
But...

59
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,420
I see.

60
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,420
I know I'm not worthy of you.

61
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,220
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,580
(President's Office)

63
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,060
(Who can save me?)

64
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,980
- Truly a scumbag.
- Shh...

65
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,820
Let's go.

66
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,500
(Shanghe Garment Group)

67
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,140
(No one knows)

68
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,500
(I love reading manga)

69
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,860
(and fond of a manga artist
named Bodhi Leaf.)

70
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,700
(Are you okay?)

71
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,740
(Stop!)
(Her stories always have strange twists.)

72
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,740
(They really resonate with me.)

73
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,580
Ye Ran, 26 years old,

74
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,460
joined the head office's design team
two years ago.

75
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,220
(Ye Ran)
This is her initial interview data.

76
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,020
It includes some of her hand-drawn works.

77
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,700
They are

78
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,820
the original manga manuscripts.

79
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,380
(The manga author I like)

80
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,540
(is actually right beside me.)

81
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,500
What? B-version poster?

82
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,260
Yeah, the marketing department
produced two posters

83
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,500
and ultimately chose the B version.

84
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,940
Didn't they tell you?

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,980
Then which one did you produce yesterday?

86
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,580
Oh no.

87
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,420
You haven't sent the email yet, have you?

88
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,340
I not only offended the boss,

89
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,900
but also made the wrong poster.

90
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,180
I am truly doomed.

91
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,980
Is the poster ready?

92
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,860
Mr. Meng, Manager Hao has
sent the poster to your email.

93
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,820
Hao.

94
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,340
(@Ye Ran, Interactive Entertainment)

95
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,100
Manager Hao,

96
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,060
why is this poster

97
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,380
different from
the marketing department's proposal?

98
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,860
Just some minor adjustments.

99
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,380
Boss, there're just a few slight adjustments.

100
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,620
What's wrong with Ye Ran?

101
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,060
- Quickly call her over.
- (Ye Ran?)

102
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,700
(That's Bodhi Leaf.)

103
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,000
She has to apologize for this.

104
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,010
(No way.)

105
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,860
I think the one who needs to apologize is you.

106
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,100
The content of the poster

107
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,660
was planned by the marketing department.

108
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,580
She's just a designer,

109
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,020
responsible for execution.

110
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,580
If she made a mistake with the poster,

111
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,580
it means that you didn't accurately
convey the requirements

112
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,220
or even provided incorrect information.

113
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,060
Yes, yes, yes.

114
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,180
Boss, it's my fault.

115
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,700
I'll talk with Ye Ran right away.

116
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,580
Tonight,

117
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,780
no matter how late it is,

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,290
we'll produce a new version of the poster.

119
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,850
(She has to work overtime again?)

120
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,140
You're wrong again.

121
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
We're a regular, humane company.

122
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,860
How could we exploit employees like this?

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,660
- Secretary Chen.
- Yes, yes, yes.

124
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,100
Reschedule the meeting
for the day after tomorrow.

125
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,260
Give the design team two days
to redo the poster.

126
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,220
- That's all.
- Okay, boss.

127
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,980
(No.)

128
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,740
(I need to send an email to Ye Ran.)

129
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,100
The meeting is rescheduled
for the day after tomorrow.

130
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,340
Submit the new poster
before the end of tomorrow.

131
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,100
(She seems to be very scared of me.)

132
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,380
(She must be terrified
when she receives my email.)

133
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,220
Secretary Chen.

134
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,020
(Protecting Bodhi Leaf)

135
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,300
(is my duty.)

136
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,220
The boss sent me an email.

137
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,980
I hope he's not calling me over to scold me.

138
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,300
Quick, open it and see.

139
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,980
Whatever.

140
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,020
The meeting is rescheduled
for the day after tomorrow.

141
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,140
Submit the new poster
before the end of tomorrow.

142
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,780
Secretary Chen.

143
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,300
That's great, Mr. Meng didn't see it.

144
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,700
That's right.

145
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,580
How could

146
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,980
a big boss like him
personally check all the emails?

147
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,460
I think this time,

148
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,540
you should thank Secretary Chen properly.

149
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,540
He must have noticed
that you sent the wrong poster,

150
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,620
so he helped you out.

151
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,860
He's really kind-hearted.

152
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,280
Yeah.

153
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,660
He's always so kind to anybody.

154
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,300
He's been with the boss for years,

155
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,300
honest and reliable,

156
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,500
earned the boss's trust.

157
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,860
You should thank him properly.

158
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,220
(Thank you, Secretary Chen.)

159
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,740
Why isn't there an update today?

160
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,900
Boss, all female secretaries
have been replaced.

161
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,540
From now on, I'll be making coffee for you.

162
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,820
(A new message from the author)

163
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,900
Notice of suspension.

164
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,580
(Bodhi Leaf (Author))
Sorry, everyone.

165
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,660
Due to my recent overtime at my main job,

166
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,830
I have to suspend updates for a day.

167
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,780
Suspension?

168
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,220
Today has been a roller coaster ride.

169
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,740
I really want to say

170
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,540
thank you to Secretary Chen
whom I've never met.

171
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,460
Secretary Chen?

172
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,460
Why is the coffee

173
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,900
you made today so hot?

174
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,060
- Hot?
- Make me another cup.

175
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,500
Time for her to get off work.

176
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,860
(Ye Ran,)

177
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,260
(I've graduated.)

178
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,500
(This time,)

179
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
(don't try to get rid of me.)

180
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,020
Handsome, are you a new intern?

181
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Or are you here for someone?

182
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,060
Go away.

183
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,580
Kids nowadays have no manners.

184
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,580
How rude.

185
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,660
Ye Ran.

186
