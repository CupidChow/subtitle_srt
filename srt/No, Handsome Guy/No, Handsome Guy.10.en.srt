Hello?

71
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
Mom,

72
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,840
I've already met
Ye Ran's potential partner.

73
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
He looks quite ordinary,

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,160
with a forgettable name

75
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,680
and background.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,160
Nothing special about him.

77
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,720
But he seems honest and reliable,

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,550
totally Ye Ran's type.

79
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,480
But he hasn't agreed
to be her boyfriend yet.

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,360
Ye Ran is still in unrequited love.

81
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,320
It's a tragedy.

82
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,000
Why has Ye Ran come to this?

83
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,280
It's all because of that person.

84
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,260
Shh...

85
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,400
Don't mention that name in front of her.

86
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,880
Keep an eye on Ye Ran.

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,640
She's just starting to move on,

88
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,280
and she can't afford to be hurt again.

89
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,400
Don't worry.

90
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,120
With Secretary's Chen small frame,

91
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,840
I could knock him down with one punch.

92
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,280
I guarantee I'll take care of him

93
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,800
and make him your son-in-law.

94
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
After all,

95
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,680
Ye Ran's wound has never healed.

96
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,040
What she needs isn't a person
who accompanies her,

97
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
but the one who heals her.

98
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,880
Wake up, wake up.

99
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
He's Tiger Meng,

100
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,280
the formidable Tiger Meng.

101
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,360
I really want some bubble tea.

102
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,200
You are listless.

103
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,640
What you need is coffee.

104
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,720
Coffee is too bitter,

105
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,200
I don't want to drink it.

106
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,120

109
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,400

113

Just right, there's an extra cup here.

114
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,960
- Here.
- Thanks.

115

- Wake her up.
