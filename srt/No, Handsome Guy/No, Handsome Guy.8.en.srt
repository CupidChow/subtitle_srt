I like you

25
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,300
sincerely.

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,260
(So nice.)

27
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,020
(You're still the same as before.)

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,340
Hello?

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,540
Sorry, I'm on my way to the office.

30
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,140
Okay, I'll be there soon.

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,540
Why are you rushing like

32
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,700
you're going to be reincarnated?

33
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,940
Sorry.

34
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,220
Take this.

35
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,220
It might rain soon.

36
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,460
Thanks.

37
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,300
Take a closer look

38
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,660
and see who I am.

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,540
Tiger Meng!

40
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,620
Oh no, oh no.

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,900
I can't afford to offend Tiger Meng.

42
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,700
I shouldn't have taken off

43
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,420
my contact lenses no matter what.

44
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,380
Stop hiding.

45
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,700
I can still see you even if you hide.

46
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,660
Boss.

47
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,420
Sorry.

48
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,020
Sorry for what?

49
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,940
Last night, I didn't mean

50
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,380
to do that

51
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,620
to you.

52
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,420
Do what?

53
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,820
Anyway, I didn't mean it.

54
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,060
I couldn't see clearly without my lenses,

55
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,420
so I mistook you.

56
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,540
Believe me,

57
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,660
I respect you greatly.

58
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,980
I have no improper intentions
towards you.

59
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,620
Are you saying

60
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,380
I should thank you
for not being interested in me?

61
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,140
That's not what I meant.

62
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,180
I offended you first.

63
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,540
If you feel uncomfortable,

64
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,940
feel free to make any request.

65
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,180
How could I dare?

66
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,260
I've become Tiger Meng now.

67
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,660
Secretary Chen, morning.

68
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,580
Morning.

69
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,020
Oh my,

70
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,620
what happened to your neck?

71
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,100
Forget it.

72
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,220
I'm having an allergic reaction.

73
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,820
I was on IV drips all night.

74
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,900
I almost had to be hospitalized.

75
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,580
It's that serious?

76
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,700
Get proper treatment.

77
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,810
- (No wonder he didn't come last night.)
- Or you won't find a girlfriend.

78
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,400
(He's sick.)

79
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,740
(It must be because
he's worried about me,)

80
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,660
(so he asked the boss to come to me.)

81
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,660
All because of that
cheap temporary tattoo.

82
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,460
It's fine.

83
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,260
Boss said it's covered by

84
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,940
workers' compensation.

85
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,380
Ye Ran, you're here.

86
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,860
Could you make me a cup of coffee?

87
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,780
I need to use the restroom.

88
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,900
Secretary Chen,

89
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,020
there's something I want to return to you.

90
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,740
Return it to me?

91
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,220
Ever since you lent me this umbrella
two years ago,

92
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,220
I've had feelings for you.

93
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,860
Even though you rejected me yesterday,

94
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,780
I won't give up.

95
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,980
I hope you can reconsider

96
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,500
and give us both a chance.

97
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,380
But this isn't my umbrella.

98
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,600
(2 years ago)
Why are you rushing like

99
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,780
you're going to be reincarnated?

100
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,900
Sorry.

101
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,700
Secretary Chen,

102
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,420
it's going to rain later.

103
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,980
Give my umbrella to that girl.

104
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,460

111

No one is.

112
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,860
Right.

113
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,100
Manga.

114
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,100
It's all about the manga.

115
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,980
I just like reading the manga she draws.

116
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,820
Zhuangzhuang,

117
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,220
how about having lunch

118
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,220
(Silence)
together tomorrow noon?

119
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,980
(Zhuangzhuang, how about having lunch
together tomorrow noon?)

120
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,260
I'll be busy.

121
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,540
Then dinner?

122
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,820
I have to work late.

123
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,420
What time will you be done?

124
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,660
How about I bring you some supper then?

125
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,740
You haven't updated your manga in days.

126
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,380
Instead of bringing supper,

127
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,780
why not focus on drawing manga?

128
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,020
Can you be more career-oriented

129
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
and less focused on romance?

130
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,300
I'm just an ordinary person.

131
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,300
Drawing manga can't be a career for me.

132
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,380
It's just a hobby.

133
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,220
Just a hobby?

134
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,220
After spending so much time,

135
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,460
don't you want
to become a real manga artist?

136
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,740
There are so many people
who can play the piano,

137
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,820
but not everyone becomes a pianist.

138
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,700
What twisted logic!

139
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,940
Just because it's a hobby,

140
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,300
you feel justified

141
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,540
in neglecting updates,

142
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,620
and

143
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,140
leaving things unfinished?

144
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,700
You don't care about it at all.

145
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,220
And your attitude

146
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,900
is disappointing those fans

147
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,300
who really support you.

148
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,380
I've been drawing for two years,

149
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,740
and I don't have many fans.

150
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,860
You've really disappointed me.

151
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,300
Turns out the manga
I've been waiting for every day

152
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,260
is so lightly regarded by the author herself.

153
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,700
Chi,

154
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,500
I want to see the comments on the manga.

155
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
But remember,

156
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,100
you're not drawing manga to make money,

157
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,020
so don't take any

158
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,500
negative comments to heart.

159
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,740
Here it is.

160
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,540
Ye Ran,

161
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,180
