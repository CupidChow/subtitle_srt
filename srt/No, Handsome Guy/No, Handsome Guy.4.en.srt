It's already midnight,

25
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,700
why isn't there an update?

26
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:35,180
(The manga you subscribed to
has been updated!)

27
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,740
It's been updated.

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,340
Ye Xin, I'm back.

29
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,180
Let her go.

30
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,140
Su Tianming.

31
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,100
Your Su family owes me.

32
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,140
I'll take back everything one by one,

33
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,260
starting

34
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,340
with this woman.

35
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,940
Owe you my foot!

36
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,700
(Owe you my foot!)

37
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,460
She actually portrayed me as the villain.

38
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,700
What is the boss thinking?

39
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,260
(What did I do)

40
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,020
(to make her hate me so much?)

41
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,380
(It's bad enough
she portrayed me as a villain,)

42
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,700
(but to make me a mindless one?)

43
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,380
No,

44
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,340
I must have
a straightforward talk with her

45
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,140
and make her change the plot.

46
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,820
That was the whole process.

47
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,220
It's so funny.

48
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,500
Secretary Chen, good morning.

49
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,500
Ye...

50
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,700
Ran...

51
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,180
What should we have
for dinner after work?

52
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,340
I know there's a nice restaurant

53
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,980
near our company.

54
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,900
Really?

55
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,820
- I'll take a call.
- Sure.

56
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,180
Help me brew a cup of coffee, thank you.

57
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,420
Hello?

58
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,700
Mr. Meng.

59
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,420
(Where is she?)

60
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,780
When others see the boss,

61
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,580
they're all eager to please,

62
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,500
but she

63
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,740
treats me like a ghost.

64
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,460
Am I that scary,

65
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,100
Zhuangzhuang?

66
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,380
Boss,

67
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,220
you're not scary at all.

68
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,540
It's just that you often have a stern face,

69
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,660
which may create a bit of

70
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,020
distance.

71
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,740
Distance?

72
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,020
(Xuncheng Shanghe Garment Group)

73
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,460
This Tiger Meng

74
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,540
is really persistent.

75
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,260
Is he trying to make me
compensate for his shoes?

76
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,300
Looks like I need to take a sick leave

77
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,900
to avoid this jinx.

78
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,300
Ye Ran.

79
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,300
(It's him again.)

80
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,460
(Now I am approachable enough, right?)

81
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,220
(My eyes...)

82
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,300
(It's so painful.)

83
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,260
I heard you're not feeling well.

84
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,100
Yes, I've had a headache
these past few days.

85
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,980
I want to take two days off.

86
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,220
(Headache?)

87
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,220
(Please don't lead to another suspension.)

88
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,900
A headache is not a minor issue.

89
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,780
Come on, I'll take you to the hospital.

90
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,260
No need, no need.

91
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,340
I'll just go home
and rest for a couple of days.

92
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,300
How can that be?

93
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,980
What if the pain persists for several days?

94
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,940
Then...

95
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,300
(Then the manga
will be suspended for long.)

96
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,500
It's okay, I'm really fine.

97
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,180
Let's go, to the hospital.

98
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,660
No need, no need.

99
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,820
I'm not in pain anymore.

100
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,020
I'm completely fine now.

101
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,460
Boss, the car is here.

102
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,820
Let's go.

103
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,420
(My lucky star.)

104
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,180
Suddenly, my head hurts so much.

105
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,060
Thank you, Secretary Chen,
for taking me to the hospital.

106
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,980
Let me hold you.

107
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,700
I'll do it.

108
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,140
(Contact with a handsome guy)

109
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,740
(will paralyze me.)

110
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,740
- (Good opportunity.)
- Let's go.

111
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,980
(I must change her impression of me.)

112
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,420
(Why isn't she speaking?)

113
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,420
(What if she falls for me
if I'm too good to her?)

114
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
(Tiger Meng,)

115
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,020
(I'll draw you to death tonight.)

116
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,300
I want to take the shotgun.

117
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,300
Sit in the back. It's more spacious.

118
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,500
My head suddenly hurts.

119
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,500
It's another reason
you should sit in the back.

120
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,500
The shotgun makes you dizzy.

121
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,220
You are not burning up.

122
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,780
Are you uncomfortable?

123
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,420
(I've never been)

124
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,820
(so uncomfortable ever.)

125
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,420
(She should be very touched.)

126
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,940
Don't be nervous.

127
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,380
Although I'm your boss,

128
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,940
I always separate
private matters from work

129
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
and never make things difficult
for my employees.

130
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,700
So,

131
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,220
you don't need to fear me in the future.

132
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,860
There's something

133
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,540
I've been wanting to talk to you about.

134
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,580
Actually,

135
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,060
I've been reading your...

136
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,020
Watch out.

137
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,460
Are you okay?

138
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,860
Stay away from me.

139
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,980
What did you say?

140
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,540
Stay...

141
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,660
away...

142
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,540
from...

143
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,700
me.

144
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,620
I need to talk to you.

145
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,220
Doctor, is she okay?

146
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,540
She's fine.

147
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,980
She's just been frightened.

148
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,260
Did she experience
something particularly terrifying?

149
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,340
Think about it carefully.

150
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,820
Frightened...

151
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,780
Terrifying...

152
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,260
Me?

153
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,900
You're awake.

154
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,980
Do you want some water?

155
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,060
Am I dreaming?

156
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,860
Of course not.

157
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,330
Here.

158
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,740
Thank you, Secretary Chen.

159
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,020
You're welcome.

160
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,740
I'm Chen Zhuangzhuang.

161
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,340
Just call me Zhuangzhuang.

Secretary Chen...

164
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,660
Sorry, Zhuangzhuang.

166
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,340
and I still don't have your WeChat.

167

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,300
My phone is dead.

I'll add you later.

171
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,660
