Why hasn't he added me on WeChat yet?

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,180
Ye Ran, are you tired?

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,740
Do you want me
to make you a midnight snack?

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,620
(Your request has been accepted)

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,700
He added me on WeChat.

30
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,260
Chi,

31
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,380
he added me on WeChat.

32
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,860
He added me on WeChat, he added me!

33
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,460
Secretary Chen added me on WeChat!

34
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,340
What's going on?

35
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,300
(A Leaflet)

36
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,100
(Hello.)

37
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,700
Hello.

38
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,740
Hello.

39
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,860
Why are you so afraid of the boss?

40
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,380
Should I tell him about

41
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,220
my phobia about handsome guys?

42
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,860
Forget it.

43
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,060
Let's not tell him.

44
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,060
I've vomited twice in front of him.

45
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,700
I'm afraid he'll hold it against me.

46
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,940
That's all?

47
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,180
Is that enough to make her faint?

48
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,060
The boss won't mind.

49
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,580
He's generous,

50
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,540
understanding,

51
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,780
fair, and just.

52
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,500
Zhuangzhuang,

53
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,660
you're truly kind.

54
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,980
If you interact with him more,

55
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,180
you'll know
I'm not just saying empty words.

56
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,900
No, I'm scared of him.

57
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,700
Time to talk business

58
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,580
and focus on the manga.

59
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,860
Ye Ran,

60
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,260
do you know about this manga?

61
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,140
(The Tyrant General Has a Problem)

62
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,700
This is my

63
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,220
"The Tyrant General Has a Problem".

64
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,370
Did Secretary Chen also read my manga?

65
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,940
Yes, I've read it.

66
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,220
Secretary Chen,
you also like reading manga?

67
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,060
Yes,

68
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,820
I've been following
this manga series recently.

69
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,020
Secretary Chen has also read my manga.

70
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,020
What a contrast!

71
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,100
I like manga too,

72
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,700
but some people say

73
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,380
it's childish to love manga

74
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,300
at my age.

75
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,420
The adult world is so tough.

76
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,700
Reading manga can relax
and bring joy to people.

77
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,140
This form of entertainment
is simple and green.

78
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,300
Why not enjoy it?

79
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,220
Which manga do you like the most?

80
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,700
Me too, me too.

81
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,100
Which character do you like the most?

82
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,180
I like him too, I like him too.

83
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,220
Secretary Chen is truly my soulmate.

84
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,140
This product has a unique appearance,

85
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,180
rich oil content,

86
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,300
crystal clear,

87
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,340
fragrant, and delicious.

88
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,700
It's the best choice for young people today.

89
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,260
Of course, there are
still some issues to deal with.

90
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,100
(I'm truly a genius.)

91
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,300
It's just entered the market,

92
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,260
so there are issues

93
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,340
with channels,

94
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,540
sales, and...

95
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,620
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

96
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,860
I did put a lot of effort

97
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,100
into this proposal.

98
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,340
You've worked hard.

99
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,540
The proposal isn't good enough,

100
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,820
redo it.

101
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,860
The meeting is adjourned.

102
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,860
What's going on?

103
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,700
I think it's pretty good.

104
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,340
How could...

105
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,860
Actually,

106
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,140
I quite like
"The Tyrant General Has a Problem".

107
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,380
Unfortunately,

108
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,220
the plot is a bit cliché

109
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,340
and lacks some unexpected elements.

110
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,100
Makes sense.

111
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,980
I quite like the villain character.

112
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,290
If only he were a bit smarter

113
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,700
and more complex,

114
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,940
that would be great.

115
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,740
(Now I shouldn't be portrayed as)

116
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,580
(so bad in the comic, right?)

117
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,420
Got it.

118
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,340
Ye Xin,

119
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,420
after this period of time,

120
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,340
let's get married.

121
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,100
Sorry, everyone,

122
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,820
get out of this place.

123
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,940
Tianming!

124
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,540
Tianming, Tianming!

125
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,660
This is such a nice place.

126
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,860
Ye Xin,

127
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,380
how does it feel to watch your beloved

128
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,420
die in front of you?

129
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,980
But

130
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,020
he didn't love you much,

131
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,540
or else how could he fall for

132
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,180
the woman I arranged?

133
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,820
Meng Yuan!

134
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,860
I'm going to kill you.

135
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,700
I'll definitely kill you.

136
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,540
How childish.

137
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,020
You should take a look

138
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,980
at your own eyes.

139
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,140
They're really charming.

140
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,980
I tell you,

141
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,580
I'm just returning the insults

142
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,660
you've all given me.

143
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,620
Let her go.

144
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,380
(Let her go.)

145
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,420
- Secretary Chen?
- Secretary Chen?

146
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,100
Boss,

147
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,300
is there something on my face?

148
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,100
Why have you been staring at me?

149
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,740
I just want to see

150
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,060
where you're better than me.

151
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,740
You are better than me in all aspects.

152
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,420
Do you usually read manga?

153
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,660
Boss, I swear,

154
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,900
I am only focused on work.

155
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,020
I don't have time or energy

156
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,980
for meaningless things like manga.

157
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,460
You don't even read manga.

158
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,340
I really don't know what she sees in you.

159
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,540
Secretary Chen,

160
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,740
did you watch the manga update
from last night?

161
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,780
Regardless of what she says,

162
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,300
just say yes.

163
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,780
Secretary Chen?

164
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,020
Yes, I did.

165
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,420
Did you find it surprising?

166
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,700
Yes.

167
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,940
There's something
I need to confess to you.

168
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,300
Actually, I'm the manga author,
Bodhi Leaf.

169
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,460
I knew that.

170
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,780
You knew that?

171
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,700
Your interview materials

172
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,220
have your manga manuscript, right?

173
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,460
I admire you more now.

174
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,180
You truly are the most careful,

175
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,340
kindest,

176
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,020
and smartest person in the whole company.

177
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,300
Ye Ran,

178
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,740
what exactly do you want to say?

179
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,500
Zhuangzhuang,

180
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
