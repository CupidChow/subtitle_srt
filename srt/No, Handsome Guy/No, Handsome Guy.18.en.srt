We recommend a popular

25
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,440
internet celebrity who has been

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,880
very popular on C-site.

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,160
Rainy Night,

28
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,400
also known as Yu Feng.

29
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,900
(Recommended Celebrity, Yu Feng)

30
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,540
You're going to become
an internet celebrity?

31
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,620
Being a model
isn't a viable option anymore.

32
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,140
Everyone is looking for a way out.

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,700
I can't just keep living off you.

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,180
I'm planning
to register an account on C-site,

35
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,980
but I can't think of a good username.

36
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,580
Let's go with Rainy Night.

37
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,660
I think that

38
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,780
is perfect for you.

39
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,860
He's already a sensation
on various platforms

40
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,660
with over ten million fans,

41
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,900
a former model

42
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,900
with outstanding looks

43
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,700
and photography experience.

44
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,140
Everyone has reviewed
the respective proposals,

45
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,300
what do you think?

46
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,220
I choose option one.

47
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,700
There are too many internet celebrity
advertisements nowadays.

48
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,300
Even if this Rainy Night is popular,

49
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,900
there may not be any surprises.

50
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,980
So, let's try something new.

51
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,260
Besides, don't you think

52
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,020
this Rainy Night looks like

53
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,020
a jinx from that drama?

54
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,420
Internet celebrities
are at least a safe bet.

55
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,180
Even if it's not perfect,
it won't be too bad.

56
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,420
A manga artist,

57
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,740
and a rookie one at that.

58
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,220
What if she messes up?

59
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,220
She won't.

60
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,860
As a rookie manga artist,

61
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,820
she'll definitely do her best

62
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,580
to cherish this opportunity

63
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,220
and give a hundred percent effort.

64
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,460
(Conference Room)

65
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,340
In the case
of a popular internet celebrity,

66
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,420
this might just be

67
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,620
one of the several ads

68
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,780
he shoots in a year.

69
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,980
But Mr. Meng,

70
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,940
Rainy Night is very eager to cooperate,

71
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,620
and he's very cooperative himself.

72
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,740
He even said that

73
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,180
even if we choose another option,

74
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,180
he's still willing to come.

75
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,380
How about

76
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,060
let him collaborate with Bodhi Leaf?

77
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,380
There might be a surprise.

78
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,580
Okay,

79
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,260
let's vote first.

80
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,220
Raise your hand if you choose Option A.

81
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,580
Raise your hand if you choose Option B.

82
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,700
Three to three.

83
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,540
Ye Ran,

84
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,100
which one do you choose?

85
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,580
I choose...

86
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,180
I choose Option B.

87

a rare opportunity for you.

89
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,900
Why are you giving up so easily?

90
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,980
I really can't do it.

91
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,380
Think about it again.

92
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,580
It's not too late to regret now.

93
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,820
No need.

94
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,300
I've made up my mind.

95
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,980
Ye Ran,

96
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,140
do you not believe in yourself

97
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,700
or me?

98
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,380
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,300
Mr. Meng.

100
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,660

Is that an important client?

113
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,740
