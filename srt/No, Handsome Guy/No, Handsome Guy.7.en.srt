(A Leaflet)
Secretary Chen, I want you.

25
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,180
Timid as a mouse in front of me,

26
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,380
but bold as a lion
in front of Secretary Chen.

27
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,540
What did I just send?

28
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,660
(Recalling...)

29
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,500
(You have recalled a message)

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,900
Don't misunderstand.
I sent the wrong message.

31
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,380
I meant to invite you
to dinner at my place.

32
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,150
Dinner?

33
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,620
Yeah, right.

34
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,740
This manga hasn't been updated
for two days.

35
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,940
Can't she have a bit of ambition?

36
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,750
No,

37
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,020
I can't let Bodhi Leaf

38
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,880
slack off like this anymore.

39
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,870
Boss,

40
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,030
she has

41
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,900
mustered the courage to confess.

42
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,620
Wouldn't it be too harsh to do this?

43
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,100
If you keep dragging it out,

44
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,790
giving her hope

45
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,940
without giving her an answer,

46
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,380
then you're the scumbag.

47
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,510
Remember,

48
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,820
you have to be cold
and ruthless to her later.

49
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,140
Draw a clear line

50
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,420
and express your attitude clearly.

51
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,820
Completely cut off
all her thoughts about you.

52
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,950
Understand?

53
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,590
Alright.

54
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,750
I'll try.

55
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,590
I'll definitely

56
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,700
do it.

57
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,870
Good luck.

58
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,790
Okay.

59
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,500
Secretary Chen,

60
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,580
did you specially invite me here

61
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,460
to tell me your answer?

62
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,110
Ye Ran,

63
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,700
you don't know me.

64
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,060
Saying "like" is too hasty.

65
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,900
Don't be fooled
by my usual gentle appearance.

66
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,780
In private,

67
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,020
I smoke and drink,

68
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,340
and I'm addicted to gambling.

69
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,870
It's okay.

70
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,590
Who doesn't have flaws?

71
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,390
As long as you're
fundamentally kind-hearted,

72
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,740
I don't see any major issues.

73
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,620
Kind-hearted?

74
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,030
Look here.

75
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,230
On the left is a dragon,

76
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,420
on the right is a phoenix.

77
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,590
I used to be a hooligan

78
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,500
in the streets.

79
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,030
Are you scared?

80
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,710
For someone with your background

81
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,150
to become a CEO's secretary,

82
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,990
it shows that you're not only hardworking

83
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,310
but also determined

84
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,180
and intelligent.

85
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,060
Impressive.

86
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,550
And I have 21

87
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,910
ambiguous ex-girlfriends.

88
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,150
I hang out all day long

89
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,140
and love easy money.

90
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,940
A standard playboy.

91
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,260
Secretary Chen,

92
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,940
I really admire and appreciate honesty.

93
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,790
Today, you actually told me

94
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,790
all your problems,

95
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,860
even about your personal life.

96
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,380
I genuinely admire you

97
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,660
and am deeply touched.

98
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,830
As long as
you're willing to be my boyfriend,

99
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,380
I won't hold anything against you.

100
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,180
And I'm not a perfect person either.

101
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,420
Please take care of me in the future.

102
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,030
Well,

103
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,900
do you really need me to be so direct?

104
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,550
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,750
I don't like you.

106
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,180
I can't be your boyfriend.

107
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,630
Miss,

108
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,340
you haven't paid the bill yet.

109
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,620
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

110
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,070
Secretary Chen,

111
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,020
where are you?

112
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,660
(Secretary Chen, where are you?)

113
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,900
(Since I'm going to be a scumbag,)

114
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,780
(I shouldn't be soft-hearted.)

115
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,900
I have something
very important to tell you.

116
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,700
I'll be waiting for you
at the park entrance.

117
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,860
Don't stand me up.

118
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,030
Ignore her.

119
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,380
As long as Secretary Chen
stands her up tonight,

120
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,980
it will make her give up completely.

121
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,140
She's a big girl.

122
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,540
On a rainy night,

123
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,580
she'll definitely go home.

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,940

like this.
