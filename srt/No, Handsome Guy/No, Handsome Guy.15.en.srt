24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,760
Hey,

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,080
how did it feel
when you kissed Mr. Meng yesterday?

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,360
It felt pretty good.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,400
His skin is nice,

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,520
and his lips are soft.

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,080
Lips?

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,480
Didn't you just kiss his cheek?

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,440
I did something weird to him again.

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,160
I'm doomed.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,360
I'm so doomed.

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,200
Oh, Ye Ran,

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,240
you should never drink again
in your life.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,160
No wonder he acted weird today.

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,280
Is he going to ask me
for compensation again?

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,920
How should I face him in the future?

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
Hello?

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,760
Ye Ran.

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,640
Tomorrow is the Saturday we agreed on.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,160
Are you bringing your boyfriend for lunch

43
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
or dinner?

44
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,680
Tomorrow

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,120
is Saturday?

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,280
(Oh no,)

47
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,560
(I totally forgot about this.)

48
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,920
You promised two weeks ago.

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,200
You didn't forget, did you?

50
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,920
He has to work overtime tomorrow.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,440
Shall we change the day then?

52
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,280
I've made it clear.

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,080
This is your last chance.

54
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,920
Understood.

55
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,800
I promise
you'll meet your future son-in-law.

56
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,160
Boyfriend...

57
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,160
Am I going crazy?

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,080
I can't possibly bring Tiger Meng.

59
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,160
I'll ask Chen Zhuangzhuang instead.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,160
Even if we broke up,

61
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,840
he should do me this favor.

62
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,620
I'll help him

63
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,800
pursue Ye Dang if needed.

64
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,900
(Silence)

65
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,400
Zhuangzhuang, are you asleep?

66
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,560
I need a favor.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,240
Why isn't he

68
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,560
replying to my messages.

69
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,640
Could he be bailing on me?

70
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,360
Ye Dang, it's urgent.

71
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
Do you know anyone

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
who could play my boyfriend?

73
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,520
I asked Secretary Chen,

74
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,240
but he hasn't shown up yet.

75
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,200
I'm near our place.

76
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,840
Please help me out.

77
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
Mr. Meng,

78
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
what brings you here?

79
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,560
I heard someone

80
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,440
urgently needs a boyfriend.

81
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,640
Look.

82
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,680
How about me?

83
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,520
No.

84
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,480
Why not?

85
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,760
You already exceed
the standards in appearance,

86
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,080
and you're well-dressed

87
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,360
with a nice car.

88
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,440
So,

89
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,440
what's the problem?

90
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,240
I told my mom

91
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,040
my boyfriend is a secretary,

92
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,920
average-looking

93
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,720
with normal conditions.

94
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,280
You don't seem like that.

95
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,280
Mr. Meng,

96
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,280
are you really here to help me?

97
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,920
Why else would I be here?

98
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,880
(Is he here to retaliate)

99
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,680
(for that night?)

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,400
(Did she remember something?)

101
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,280
So,

102
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,720
what should we do now?

103
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,120
(Forget it.)

104
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,000
(I'll just make the best
of a bad situation.)

105
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,440
Come with me.

106
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,240
What do you want from me?

107
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,920
Ye Dang,

108
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,160
Ye Ran and I have talked things out.

109
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,040
I want to pursue you.

110
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,800
I don't need a boyfriend.

111
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,560
Then can we start as friends?

112
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,680
Just ordinary friends.

113
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,760
I don't need a boyfriend,

114
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,400
but I do need a client.

115
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,360
How about becoming a member?

116
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,120
I'll give you a decent discount.

117
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,320
It's quite a good deal now.

118
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,340
(Chen)

119
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,560
When can we start training?

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,760
Anytime.

121
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,520
You can take your time.

122
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,600
I'll leave first.

123
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,920
Aren't you supposed to teach me?

124
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,600
I charge a lot.

125
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
You can't afford it.

126
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,400
I can pay more.

127
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,320
It's urgent.

128
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,360
Do you know anyone

129
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
who could play my boyfriend?

130
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,200
I asked Secretary Chen,

131
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,880
but he hasn't shown up yet.

132
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,840
He dared to

133
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,600
blow Ye Ran off again.

134
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,920
Is it okay now?

135
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,920
You still don't look ordinary enough.

136
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,160
If only I could cover this face
with something.

137
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,160
Oh, don't forget,

138
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,360
today you're playing

139
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,480
the most ordinary working-class guy.

140
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,240
Don't blow your cover.

141
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,400
Hello, ma'am.

142
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,880
I'm Ye Ran's boyfriend.

143
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,440
Chen Zhuangzhuang, right?

144
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,520
Yes.

145
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,360
He's had an allergic reaction
on his face,

146
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,640
covered in rashes.

147
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,560
So he can't take off his mask.

148
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,520
It doesn't matter.

149
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,960
There's nothing to see anyway.

150
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,080
Have some tea.

151
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,520
Thank you, ma'am.

152
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,040
Well...

153
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,800
Don't drink it then.

154
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,640
Zhuangzhuang,

155
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,360
have you bought a house?

156
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,960
Yes,

157
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,280
I've just paid the down payment.

158
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,880
It's a three-bedroom, two-bathroom place.

159
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,440
Do you have a car?

160
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,920
I have a used car,

161
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,120
but I don't drive it much.

162
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,760
People like us in the working class

163
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,800
prefer taking the subway.

164
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,560
What about

165
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,280
your plans and goals in life?

166
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,880
Just the two of us,

167
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,500
three meals a day,

168
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,600
spending all four seasons together.

169
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,800
I just want to live a simple

170
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,520
and happy life

171
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,320
with Ye Ran.

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,080
(That's a pretty piece of acting!)

173
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,400
(He deserves an Oscar!)

174
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,680
How many children
are you planning to have?

175
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,240
We still have a mortgage to pay off.

176
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,640
No rush.

177
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,120
It's up to Ye Ran.

178
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,880
That does sound pretty ordinary.

179
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,760
Hello?

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,880
Who is it?

181
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,160
Coming, coming.

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,320
Hello, ma'am. Is this Ye Ran's house?

183
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,760
Yes, you are?

184
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,950
