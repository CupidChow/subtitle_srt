I'm willing to change for you,

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,680
would you consider
getting back together with me?

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,240
Get lost, you're the villain.

28
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,200
Is a villain

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,920
destined to be unforgivable?

Ridiculous!

34
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,160
Why did I have such a terrifying dream?

35
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,640
Why were you laughing in your dream?

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,680
Who did you dream of?

37
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,680
Anyway, it's not you.

38
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,640
Is it Secretary Chen

39
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,600
or your meddlesome boss?

40
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,280
Why suddenly bring Mr. Meng up?

41
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,680
You said

42
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
he brought you back last night.

43
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,240
What did you guys do?

44
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,880
He brought me back last night?

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,400
Why can't I remember anything?

46
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,000
Anyway, stay away from him.

47
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,240
Morning.

48
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,720
Morning.

49
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,200
Need a lift?

50
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,920
I have just ten meters to go.

51
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,880
See you at the office.

52
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,400
Drive.

53
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,000
What's up with him today?

54
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,880
Ye Ran,

55
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,560
yesterday you suddenly broke up with me.

56
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,480
Was it because you overheard

57
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,520
my conversation with Ye Dang?

58
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,400
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
There's nothing to apologize for.

60
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,760
Liking someone

61
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,440
isn't something you can control.

62
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,240
You don't like me.

63
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,440
It's not your fault.

64
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,040
But I shouldn't have accepted you

65
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,200
without confirming

66
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,400
who I really liked.

67
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,200
I made you feel so bad.

68
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,720
You must have been upset yesterday.

69
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,440
I'm really sorry.

70
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,720
I was upset.

71
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,480
But not as much as you think.

72
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

73
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,800
Ye Ran,

74
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,800
you'll definitely meet someone

75
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,040
better than me in the future.

76
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,720
If you need anything,

77
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,360
just ask.

78
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,200
But you should worry about yourself first.

79
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,000
Ye Dang
is much harder to pursue than me.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,680
Here's Ye Dang's number.

81
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,320
That's all I can do for you.

82
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,240
Unfaithful man.

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,880
Thanks.

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,440
Oh,

85
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,240
and last night,
Mr. Meng brought you home, right?

86
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,560
He called me suddenly,

87
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,720
asking for your address.

88
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,640
It startled me.

89
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,040
There's something

90
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,440
I need to tell you.

92
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,360
Actually,

93
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,880
he's really handsome.

94
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,320
There you are.

95
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,760
Lisa asked me to get you to sign this.

96
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,880
(She even found an excuse.)

97
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,320
(How cute.)

98
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,000
Mr. Meng,

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,360
do you also like bubble tea?

100
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,160
Take it.

101
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,320
Are both cups for me?

102
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,040
I bought them specially for you.

103
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,920
This umbrella isn't actually mine.

104
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,000
It's Mr. Memg's.

105
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,600
Two years ago,
he asked me to give it to you.

106
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,600
He also covered it up for you

107
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,210
when you made that mistake
with the poster

108
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,160
and he gave you an extra two days.

109
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,120
That's just how he is,

110
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,840
kind and considerate,

111
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,440
but he never brags about it.

112
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,520
Mr. Meng,

113
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,080
thank you.

114
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,320
Don't mention it.

115
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,880
Actually, there are many things

116
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,920
I should thank you for.

117
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,160
Secretary Chen was right.

118
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,160

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,840

121
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,400
Are you done?

122
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,200
What else is there?

123
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
You just want to thank me

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,320
for what happened last night?

125
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,760

126
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,360
What happened last night?

127
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
I vaguely remember getting drunk

128
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,960
and going home early.

129
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,600
Right!

130
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,960
You finally remember now.

131
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,760
You brought me home.

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,880
Let me pay for the gas then.

133
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,000
You really don't remember?

134
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,840
Whatever happened,

135
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,040
