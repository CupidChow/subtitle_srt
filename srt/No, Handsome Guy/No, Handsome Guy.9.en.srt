(Bodhi Leaf (Author))
Hello everyone, I'm Bodhi Leaf.

50
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,250
Recently, I've been experiencing

51
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,500
some issues with my creative process.

52
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,260
I must apologize to all the fans

53
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,860
who have supported me
and waited for updates.

54
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,580
Starting tomorrow,
I'll strive to keep updating

55
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,740
and create a truly good work
with all my heart.

56
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,340
Finally,

57
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,900
I want to give special thanks to two people:

58
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,420
one is Leaf Dress Mask,
who has supported me

59
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,380
for the past two years,

60
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,000
and the other is Mr. Silence,
who has provided me

61
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,100
with many valuable suggestions.

62
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,860
I won't give up on my manga.

63
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,460
Please look forward
to a brand new version of Bodhi Leaf.

64
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,380
Ye Ran,

65
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,740
why are you so happy?

66
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,020
I'm going on a date with Secretary Chen.

67
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,540
What?

68
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,260
Which outfit looks better?

69
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,700
This one

70
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,820
or this one?

71
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,420
They're both good.

72
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,500
They're both bad.

73
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,900
I have to explain the umbrella thing
to Ye Ran today.

74
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,500
If she's been persistently pursuing me

75
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,580
because of that umbrella,

76
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,180
that would be a mistake.

77
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,980
Sir, I need your help.

78
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,180
What help do you need?

79
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,540
Hey! Come back!

80
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,380
Who are you?

81
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,580
Ye Ran?

82
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,740
Secretary Chen.

83
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,780
Did you get a haircut?

84
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,220
Do I look better than usual?

85
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,540
You twisted your foot?

86
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,820
I'll be fine in a minute.

87
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,460
No way. I'll take you to buy medicine.

88
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,740
It's almost noon.

89
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,300

(Silence)

91
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,420
Sorry,

92
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,260
I'm late.

93
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,700
Are you still at the park?

94
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,660
The park?

95
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,540
Wait,

96
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,380
she made plans with Secretary Chen,

97
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,420
not me.

98
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,420
Ye Ran,

99
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,940
I came to see you today for two reasons.

100
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,020
Firstly, I wanted to tell you that

101
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,500
the umbrella you returned to me
wasn't actually mine.

102
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,260
And secondly, I want to say that

103
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,180
you shouldn't waste your time
on me anymore.

104
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,780
Honestly, I don't have
any extra feelings for...

105
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,060
you.

106
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,860
No extra feelings?

107
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,460
Are you sure?

108
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,380
I think so.

109
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,100
So, you mean to say that

110
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,060
it's a one-sided love?

111
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,620
I...

112
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,260
You're not my boyfriend?

113
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,380
Well...

114
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,780
So, you really don't like me?

115
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,180
I've said everything I needed to say.

116
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,140
I'll go now.

117
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,100
Just kidding.

118
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,220
Let me take you home.

119
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,800
The user you're trying to reach
is unavailable.

120
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,970

121
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,100
Oh no,

122
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,780
I'm so late.

123
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,100
He must have left.

124
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,140
Mr. Meng?

125
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,180
What are you doing here?

126
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,300
Well,

127
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,500
I'm just out for a walk

128
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,660
on the weekend.

129
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,020
How about you?

130
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,700
I had plans with someone,

131
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,020
but I messed it up.

132
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,180
Mr. Meng,

133
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,780
I won't disturb you any longer.

134
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,140
Wait a moment.

135
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,380
If I remember correctly,

136
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,620
someone offended me here before.

137
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,980
And that same someone said

138
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,660
if I felt uncomfortable,

139
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,660
I could make any request.

140
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,660
So?

141
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,300
Mr. Meng, please have some water.

142
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,140
Let's get started.

143
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,300
Now?

144
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,620
What else?

145
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,500
I am not ready yet.

146
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,580
After all, it's my first time.

147
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,740
Practice

148
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,100
makes perfect.

149
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,500
Shall we

150
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,700
do it here

151
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,260
or there?

152
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,420
Or maybe...

153
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,340
Let's do it here.

154
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,060
I think it's fine.

155
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,140
Let's do it then.

156
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,140
Is my pose okay?

157
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,780
Are you sure you can

158
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,260
see clearly from there?

159
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,780
It's okay.

160
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,500
I can draw anyway.

161
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,060
Are you

162
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,700
drawing me as a tiger?

163
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,100
No,

164
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,220
that one doesn't count.

165
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,540
It was just a rough draft.

166
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,620
Come a bit closer.

167
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,660
I'm asking you to draw my portrait.

168
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,660
It doesn't count if it doesn't look like me.

169
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,700
Closer.

170
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,460
Closer.

171
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,940
No more closer.

172
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,140
