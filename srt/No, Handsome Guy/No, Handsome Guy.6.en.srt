24
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,500
Ye Ran,

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,100
what exactly do you want to say?

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,700
Zhuangzhuang, I like you.

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Not only do I want you to become

28
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,780
the main character of my manga,

29
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,260
but I also want you to become
the main character of my life.

30
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,900
So,

31
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,540
will you be my boyfriend?

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,700
(Boss.)

33
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,660
(Should I say yes to this too?)

34
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,460
- Ye Ran...
- Secretary Chen.

35
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,300
We'll be late for the meeting.

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,900
Right, right, Ye Ran,

37
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,940
we can talk about this after work.

38
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,580
But you haven't answered me yet.

39
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,540
It's work time,

40
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,260
have you completed all your tasks?

41
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,300
That was so embarrassing.

42
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,620
Why did you confess your love so early?

43
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,820
Ye Ran, this isn't like you at all.

44
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,700
I thought even if there were feelings,

45
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,980
you'd wait a couple of months
before acting.

46
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,100
I didn't want to do it so quickly either,

47
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,780
but the situation forced me.

48
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,220
Mom, why are you here?

49
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,940
I bought this house.

50
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,100
Why can't I come?

51
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,420
Pack up your things
and come home with me.

52
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,140
Now?

53
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,780
Sit down.

54
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,060
Ye Ran,

55
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,420
two years ago, you insisted on

56
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,700
coming out to be independent.

57
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
I agreed,

58
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,260
on the condition that

59
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,180
you find a boyfriend within two years.

60
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,620
And now?

61
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,820
Where is he?

62
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,500
Come home with me.

63
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,060
Mom, I'm not going back.

64
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,580
And who told you
I don't have a boyfriend?

65
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,460
Where is he?

66
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,660
You've spent the past two years

67
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,580
either working or drawing.

68
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,420
Your career hasn't progressed,

69
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,860
and you haven't even
found half a boyfriend.

70
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,300
Now, two years have passed.

71
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,180
Time to inherit the family business,

72
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,060
and go on blind dates.

73
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,420
Mom,

74
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,980
why are you worrying about me?

75
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,340
Why don't you go worry about Ye Dang?

76
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,020
Your sister is not like you.

77
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,820
She's carefree.

78
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,140
Besides,

79
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,180
she doesn't have a phobia
about handsome men,

80
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,900
nor does she keep thinking about
that guy called Yu Feng.

81
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,420
Mom...

82
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,780
Ye Ran,

83
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,460
Mom is genuinely worried about you.

84
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,300
It's for your own good.

85
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,780
Just come home with me.

86
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,660
The Saturday after next,

87
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,100
the Saturday after next,

88
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,940
I promise I'll bring my boyfriend home.

89
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,260
You really have a boyfriend?

90
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,940
Yes,

91
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,340
I really have a boyfriend,

92
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,980
and he's a wonderful person.

93
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,980
Fine,

94
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,780
I'll give you one last chance.

95
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,140
The Saturday after next,

96
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,660
bring your boyfriend home for dinner.

97
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,060
If you don't,

98
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,940
I'll rent out this house immediately.

99
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,380
The Saturday after next, then.

100
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,780
I'm leaving.

101
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,580
Where can I find a ready-made boyfriend?

102
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,820
He's right

103
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,180
before your eyes.

104
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,380
You're right.

105
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,740
I need to land Secretary Chen asap.

106
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,340
Secretary Chen?

107
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,940
Secretary Chen,

108
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,070
this is the final plan confirmed
by the marketing department.

109
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,140
You can organize it later.

110
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,060
(Conference Room)

111
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,660
What are you doing here again?

112
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,060
Boss,

113
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,340
it's lunchtime now,

114
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,780
and it won't affect work.

115
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,260
You've got some excuses.

116
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,580
I haven't finished talking yet.

117
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,380
Boss,

118
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,940
do you have anything else to say?

119
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,620
Look at me and talk to me.

120
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,060
Look at me.

121
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,700
Why do you keep

122
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,020
running away from me?

123
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,100
What?

124
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,460
You are afraid I might eat you alive?

125
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,980
Open your eyes.

126
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,940
Ye Ran.

127
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,180
I didn't see anything.

128
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,980
Boss, I'll go explain to her right now.

129
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,900
Hold on.

130
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,860
Confiscated.

131
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,460
You drew this more carefully

132
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,660
than your manga series.

133
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,980
Boss, this is the final plan confirmed
with the marketing department.

134
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,580
Leave it here.

135
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,940
Boss,

136
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,740
what was going on this morning?

137
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,940
Why did Ye Ran suddenly confess to me

138
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,940
and mention the comic?

139
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,940
It's the first time
someone has confessed to me,

140
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,260
and it's embarrassing.

141
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,980
Should I accept her?

142
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,900
Do you like her?

143
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,660
I've been busy with work all this time,

144
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,660
so I haven't thought about it before.

145
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,900
Are you saying you are starting

146
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,900
to think about it now?

147
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,580
Not really.

148
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,460
Then reject her.

149
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,060
If you don't like her,

150
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,260
there's no need to force it.

151
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,820
Okay.

152
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,180
Boss,

153
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,820
is another girl trying to

154
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,940
get close to you?

155
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,140
I'll take it away.

156
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,180

Will that

191
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,500
make him feel pressured?

192
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,220
Ye Ran, would you like some fruit?

194
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,860
