24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,560
Hello, ma'am.

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,080
Is this Ye Ran's house?

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,480
Yes, you are?

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm Ye Ran's boyfriend.

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,200
Another one?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,840
Boss,

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,240
why are you here?

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,760
Well...

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,280
Come in and let's talk.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,760
What took you so long?

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
Ye Dang asked me to come.

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
She said it's urgent.

36
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,480
Why is the boss here too?

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,320
Didn't you ask him to come?

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,520
Me?

39
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,000
Forget about that.

40
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,960
Just remember, today you're

41
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,360
Mr. Meng,

42
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,840
and he's you.

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,040
Wait.

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,880
Come on, let's go.

45
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,200
Mom, let me introduce.

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,640
This is our company's boss.

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,200
Zhuangzhuang,

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,440
say hello to Mr. Meng.

49
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,400
Hello, Mr. Meng.

50
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,690
Yeah, okay.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,960
Please sit, Mr. Meng.

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,640
Chen,

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,840
give your boss a seat.

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,640
He has no sense of occasion.

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,520
Indeed.

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,000
Sit down.

57
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,320
Please have a seat,

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,760
Mr. Meng.

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,320
Ye Ran,

60
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,720
who is your boyfriend?

61
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
I am.

62
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,840
Ma'am, actually, I'm Ye Ran's boyfriend.

63
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,840
What's going on?

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
I asked you to find a boyfriend,

65
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,680
not make things up.

66
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,160
I didn't...

67
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,920
Ma'am, it's all a misunderstanding.

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,760
Ma'am, I am Ye Ran's boyfriend.

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,720
Ma'am, they're lying.

70
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,600
Enough.

71
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,680
None of them is my boyfriend.

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,560
What are you saying?

73
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,720
Mom.

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,480
I lied to you.

76
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,200
What's your situation now?

77
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,600
Boss,

78
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,680
why are you here?

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
You're currently

80
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,520
lacking ambition in your work,

81
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
not pursuing love,

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,480
spending all day at home drawing,

83
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,520
and now you are deceiving me with acting.

84
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,640
Your father was worried about you
before he passed away,

85
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,560
hoping you'd get married

86
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
and have a happy life.

87
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,000
And you?

88
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,120
Mom, who said happiness
must come from marriage?

89
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,300
If it were Ye Dang,

90
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,680
I'd be perfectly fine with her
being single for the rest of her life.

91
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,920
But you can't.

92
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,840
Why?

93
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,880
Because you never let go of the past.

94
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,960
Ask yourself

95
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,040
how you got this phobia
about handsome guys.

96
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,640
Phobia about handsome guys?

97
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,320
No,

98
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,960
I can't let you continue to live

99
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,720
in denial and evasion.

100
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,240
You should resign.

101
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,720
I'll find someone to help you move out,

102
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,720
then you can help me
manage the martial arts gym.

103
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,320
Take the time to think about your issues.

104
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,640
Mom,

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,080
I'm an adult now.

106
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,360
You can't just arrange everything for me.

107
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,560
And I have my own career.

108
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,480
Career? What career?

109
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,840
You've been a junior employee
for two years

110
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,560
and haven't had a raise.

111
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,880
Mom,

112
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,680
I want to become a manga artist.

113
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,080
What nonsense are you talking about?

114
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,440
Do you even know what you're capable of?

115
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,240
Drawing some random stuff

116
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,340
and you want to be a manga artist?

117
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,480
Who would believe you?

118
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,480
I do.

119
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,160
Ma'am,

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,320
let me reintroduce myself.

121
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,920
I'm Ye Ran's boss,

122
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,920
Meng Zhao,

123
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,480
and also a loyal fan of her manga.

124
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,200
I've read all of her manga

125
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,120
in the past two years,

126
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,720
witnessing her rapid growth

127
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,160
and potential.

128
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,670
She's really amazing.

129
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,110
If given enough time and opportunity,

130
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,840
she'll surely impress you.

131
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,560
No,

132
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,920
I can't let her stay at home
drawing all the time.

133
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,280
Otherwise, her phobia

134
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,800
will never improve.

135
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,800
I'll help her.

136
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,080
Ma'am,

137
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,800
give me three months.

138
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,240
I'll definitely cure her phobia
about handsome guys.

139
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,680
Why are you helping her?

140
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,200
Because I like her.

141
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,680
So,

142
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,160
I want to cure her more than anyone else

143
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
and keep her by my side

144
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,560
more than anyone else.

145
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,080
Ma'am,

146
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,800
please believe me.

147
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,560
Alright,

148
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,800
I'll give you three months.

149
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,600
If you can't cure her by then,

150
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,800
I'll hold you accountable.

151
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,600
Deal.

152
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,120
Hello, Ye Dang,

153
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,280
I'm at your mom's place.

154
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,600
You won't believe what just happened.

155
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,160
Boss.

156
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,960
I want to thank you.

157
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Actually, you didn't have to
sacrifice so much for me.

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,840
Ye Ran,

159
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
have you remembered everything?

160
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,520
Remember what?

161
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,440
Don't play dumb.

00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,200

It's the third time.

165

You've offended me repeatedly,

always blaming it on being drunk.

167
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,680
What do you want me to do
to compensate you this time?

168
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,080

190
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,400
I want to be myself,

191
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,920
and I want to be with you.

192
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,160
Is that okay?

193
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,800
I...

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,960
Don't get too close to me.

195
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,760
Keep a distance of two meters.

196
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,480
So,

197
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,840
what's your answer?

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You heard it yourself.

199
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,160
I have a phobia about handsome guys.

200
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
It's even difficult for me
to be close to you,

201
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,640
let alone be with you.

202
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,640
So you mean

203
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,720
if I can cure your phobia,

204
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,000
you'll be with me?

205
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,640
I...

206
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,880
- I...
- Deal.

207
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
I'll definitely cure your phobia.
