I need to talk to you.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,760
Talk about what?

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,880
Just say it.

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,120
Ye Dang,

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,400
you lied to me.

29
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,040
I pretended to be Ye Ran
because I was worried

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,240
she might meet a scumbag,

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,680
so I just tested you a little bit.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,840
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,840
Alright?

34
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,040
But I thought she was you,

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
that's why I said yes to her.

36
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,160
What should I do now?

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,360
What do you mean?

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,080
You haven't lost anything.

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,800
Stop whining like a woman.

40
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,640
I must tell her the truth now.

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,880
Hold on.

42
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,400
What are you doing?

43
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,680
You just agreed to be with Ye Ran,

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,440
how can you back out now?

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,040
She won't be able to take it.

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,200
But I like you.

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,680
What nonsense are you talking about?

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,400
Although you and Ye Ran look alike,

49
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,800
the feeling you give me is different.

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,760
She's just an ordinary colleague to me,

51
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,480
but you...

52
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,960
Only you

53
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,200
made me realize

54
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,840
what it means to be in love.

55
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,720
Don't listen to him.

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Ye Ran. You're just a friend to me,

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,840
and a classmate.

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,360
I've never liked you.

59
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,920
Could you stop making assumptions?

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,080
You just want money, right?

61
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,520
It's all yours, okay?

62
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,760
Please stop bothering me.

63
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,560
I don't like you.

64
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,000
If you dare say a word to Ye Ran

65
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,120
and hurt her feelings,

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,600
I won't let you off the hook.

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,920

74

Do you want me to take you home?

75
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400

78
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,640
Boss,

79
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,310
thank you for today.

80
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,560
- Come on, let's drink.
- Cheers!

81
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,030
Fill it up. Keep drinking.

82
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,920
- Ye Ran.
- Come on, let's continue.

83
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
We've been waiting for you.

84
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,360
Boss.

85
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,360
They just said you came,
and I didn't believe it.

86
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,960
You said you weren't coming tonight.

87
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,720
I suddenly felt hungry

88
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,680
and remembered you were treating,

89
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,920
so I came to check it out.

90
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,080
Please eat.

91
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,560
Eat something.

92
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,160
What were you guys

93
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,400
doing just now?

94
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,560
It sounded so fun.

95
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,760
We were playing Truth or Dare.

96
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,440
Since everyone's back,

97
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,480
let's play together.

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,200
- Let's continue.
- Come on, let's continue.

99
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,720
I'm doing it.

100
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,230
- Secretary Chen.
- Secretary Chen,

101
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,280
it's your turn.

102
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,600
Secretary Chen,

103
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,200
will you choose Truth or Dare?

104
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,720
Definitely Dare!

105
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,440
Dare is much more interesting.

106
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,680
But,

107
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,840
considering that Secretary Chen

108
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,760
treated us to dinner today,

109
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,040
I'll give you a bonus.

110
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,880
How about kissing your girlfriend?

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,800
What do you all say?

112
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:09,280
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

113
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,400
- Ye Ran, actually I...
- I'm sorry,

114
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,720
Secretary Chen.

115
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,240
I can't accept your kiss.

116
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,520
I feel that, instead of being

117
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
in a relationship with you,

118
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,600
I'm more suited to being your friend.

119
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,080
Let's break up.

120
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,040
I'll drink this bottle for you.

121
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,920
Break up?

122
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,600
It's just breaking up.

123
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,510
Let me drink it.

124
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,640
Sorry, I need to use the restroom.

125
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,840
- Ye Ran, you...
- Ye Ran.

126
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,840
What is going on?

127
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,760
Secretary Chen,

128
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,800
are you okay?

129
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,080
I'm fine.

130
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,520
Tiger Meng,

131
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,560
why are you following me?

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
I...

133
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,640
I'm just afraid that

134
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,280
you might jump into a lake.

135
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,760
Chen Zhuangzhuang
just mistook me for someone.

136
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm not upset at all.

137
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,640
Yeah,

138
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,360
not upset at all.

139
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,600
But when you mistook me
for Chen Zhuangzhuang,

140
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,800
I was upset for half a day.

141
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,760
But why is it always me
who gets abandoned?

142
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,080
Is it because I lack charm?

143
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,760
It's not your fault.

144
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,040
Secretary Chen doesn't like you.

145
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,560
It's his lack of taste.

146
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,520
It's his lack of taste?

147
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,080
But do you have taste?

148
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,080
