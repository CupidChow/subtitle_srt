=Episode 1=

24
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,540
(She is the young lady of the Ye family
in the south of the city.)

25
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,460
(She was supposed to
accept the arranged marriage,)

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,260
(but she started to hope for love.)

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,900
(They always say)

28
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,300
(love is something you encounter.)

29
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,100
(Gradually,)

30
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,940
(she thought her life
would be like this forever.)

31
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,580
(Until this day...)

32
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,420
If I said

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,460
I'm willing to turn over a new leaf for you,

34
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,620
would you get back together with me?

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,240
Get lost.

36
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,180
You're the villain.

37
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,060
Does a villain

38
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,780
have to be irredeemable?

39
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,260
You like me?

40
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,860
(Ye Xin and Master Su
fell in love at first sight.)

41
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,100
(Their love story starts now.)

42
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,580
(A new chapter)

43
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,420
(is successfully completed.)

44
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,140
I'm going to be late.

45
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,940
(Are you okay?)

46
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,780
(In fact, my name is Ye Ran.)

47
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,060
(I'm not from a rich family.)

48
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,900
Sir, most of the company's projects
are completed.

49
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,980
You have an event in the afternoon.

50
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,060
You also have to meet with Mr. Zhang.

51
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,980
And there's a meeting.

52
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,380
It's at...

53
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,460
Four in the afternoon.

54
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,940
I admire you, sir.

55
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,860
You have a great memory.

56
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,900
Today is a day off.

57
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,260
You don't need to come this afternoon.

58
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,740
Go back and take some rest.

59
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,460
Okay, sir.

60
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,340
Thank you, sir.

61
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,420
Hi, Ye Ran.

62
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,380
I am not late, right?

63
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,980
It's fine. They haven't arrived yet.

64
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Dear God,

65
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,420
please don't let any handsome guys come
to the gathering today.

66
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,260
Dear God,

67
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,500
please don't listen to her.

68
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,700
Ye Ran.

69
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,980
Can't you have more courage?

70
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,740
I have very low standards.

71
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,340
Good character,

72
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,420
and not handsome.

73
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,220
How can you not like a handsome guy?

74
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,020
Good-looking men are all toxic.

75
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,860
What nonsense.

76
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,100
They're here.

77
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,740
Can I still catch a taxi and leave now?

78
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,020
They all meet one of my standards.

79
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,140
(I am the most ordinary girl)

80
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,500
(among the common people.)

81
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,340
(If you insist on finding)

82
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,140
(something uncommon about me,)

83
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,340
(that is…)

84
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,620
(I have a phobia about handsome guys.)

85
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,700
(Handsome guys to me are like fierce beasts.)

86
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,700
(The more handsome,)

87
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,540
(the scarier.)

88
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,620
Ye Ran, is the poster finished?

89
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,380
The boss has a meeting tomorrow.

90
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,380
It must be sent to his email before midnight.

91
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,740
Nothing good happens
whenever I encounter a handsome guy.

92
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,260
Not only was the gathering ruined,

93
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,780
I have to work overtime tonight.

94
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,740
Bad luck.

95
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,620
Don't let me see you again.

96
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,700
(The handsome guy I drew
will calm me down.)

97
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,940
(What's going on?)

98
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,620
(I'll take the initiative.)

99
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,980
Back off, back off!

100
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,780
Stop.

101
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,700
(It's that scary person.)

102
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,380
It's you?

103
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,820
Stop.

104
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,100
(Am I really that scary?)

105
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,300
(Why is she reacting like
she's facing a fierce beast?)

106
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,300
(Are you okay?)

107
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,540
(Are you okay?)

108
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,940
(This is)

109
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,820
(the manga I like.)

110
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,980
