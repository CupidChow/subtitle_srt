Mr. Meng, Secretary Chen.

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,180
(Secretary Chen?)

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,580
Oh my god.

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,980
Mr. Meng is actually smiling.

28
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,180
Secretary Chen, hello.

29
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,860
- Hello.
- It's so nice to see you.

30
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,140
Secretary Chen,

31
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,620
I'm Ye Ran from the design department.

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,180
Can I add you on WeChat?

33
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,540
(Why does she always ignore me?)

34
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,580
Mr. Meng.

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,620
Why are you keeping me away?

36
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,100
What's wrong?

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,020
Are you afraid of me?

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,900
- Ye Ran.
- Chi?

39
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,980
What are you doing here?

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,740
Wait a moment for me.

41
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,820
Chen,

42
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,340
let's go.

43
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,220
(I can't let them
add each other on WeChat.)

44
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,980
- Mr. Meng is so handsome.
- Ye Ran, let's go too.

45
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,620
Why did Mr. Meng leave?

46
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,220
Ye Ran,

47
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,300
how can you ask for another man's WeChat?

48
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,700
My mom is pressuring me to get married.

49
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,820
It's hard to find a decent guy.

50
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,460
Of course, I have to take the initiative.

51
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,780
I don't think Secretary Chen
is anything special.

52
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,100
A good man isn't judged by appearance,

53
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,700
but by character.

54
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,660
What about me?

55
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,580
What do you think about me?

56
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,780
You're like a little brother to me.

57
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,380
From the same neighborhood.

58
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,780
Still, a brother.

59
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,020
That's it?

60
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,580
You even took me
as the prototype for your manga.

61
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,860
That's because I haven't seen
many handsome guys,

62
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,940
so I used you
as a reference for my manga.

63
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,460
You have a phobia about handsome guys,

64
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,140
but you're not afraid of me.

65
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,740
Doesn't that mean

66
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,980
you see me differently?

67
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,260
Of course,

68
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,420
I've known you since

69
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,540
you wore diapers.

70
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,940
No matter how you look now,

71
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,020
in my heart,

72
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,220
you're still that snotty-nosed little brother.

73
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,370
I don't want to be a little brother.

74
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,460
A kid is a kid.

75
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,220
You're not going home?

76
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,180
I've graduated.

77
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,440
I'll stay at your place
for a couple of days.

78
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,700
Why is she ignoring me?

79
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,860
Is it because I made her

80
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,260
work overtime too much?

81
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,700
Oh well,

82
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,340
there's plenty of time in the future.

83
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,300
Now that I know who Bodhi Leaf is,

84
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,580
I won't worry about
not having manga to read.

85
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,260
(Fanhua M2 Smart Drawing Tablet)

86
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,900
A new digital tablet?

87
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,660
Top-of-the-line.

88
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,300
Ye Ran, you're so lucky.

89
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,500
Secretary Chen said you won

90
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,860
the boss's lucky employee award.

91
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,020
These are all prizes.

92
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,060
For me?

93
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,340
This is from the boss.

94
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,000
(Tranquil Brain Supplement)

95
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,980
Brain supplement?

96
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,500
Yeah,

97
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,660
why would the boss
give us brain supplements?

98
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,180
Is it because he thinks
we don't use our brains at work?

99
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,700
Who cares?

100
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,020
I love gifts.

101
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,860
Ever since Secretary Chen
returned to the head office,

102
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,660
good things
have been happening every day.

103
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,060
He's truly my lucky star.

104
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,380
Ye Ran, these tasks are for you.

105
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,540
But these aren't projects I'm responsible for.

106
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,020
I know.

107
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,350
The design department is short-staffed,

108
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,820
and the new person hasn't arrived yet.

109
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,340
But projects won't wait.

110
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,540
Thank you for your hard work.

111
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,900
But the workload is too much.

112
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,020
It might require working overnight.

113
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,380
Ye Ran,

114
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,900
during this special period,

115
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,820
you wouldn't refuse to cooperate, right?

116
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,860
But I...

117
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,580
Secretary Chen.

118
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,220
Why did you bring a lunchbox?

119
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,260
We're working late tonight,
so I prepared some food.

120
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,060
- I didn't know you could cook.
- (Secretary Chen also works overtime.)

121
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,100
Not bad.

122
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,340
I have to go.

123
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,780
Alright,

124
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,780
I'll do it.

125
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,700
It's just working overtime.

126
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,660
Leave it to me.

127
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,940
Good. Thank you.

128
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,580
(The manga you subscribed to
has been updated!)

129
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,340
(Bodhi Leaf (Author))
Notice of suspension.

130
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,020
I'm sorry, today is another overtime day.

131
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,260
What?

132
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,380
Another suspension?

133
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,620
Get Lisa in here.

134
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,300
Lisa?

135
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,220
Aren't you working overtime tonight?

136
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,460
Why are you putting on makeup?

137
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,580
Secretary Chen
is also working late tonight.

138
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,020
You don't really like him, do you?

139
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,100
I just want to know more about him.

140
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,500
Tonight,

141
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,300
I must add Secretary Chen on WeChat.

142
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,100
(It's Secretary Chen.)

143
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,100
(Now's my chance.)

144
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,020
Ye Ran.

145
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Mr. Meng.

146
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,020
- Well...
- Okay, no problem.

147
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,500
(Tiger Meng, please leave.)

148
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,460
You don't need to work overtime tonight.

149
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,860
The work-life balance is important.

150
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,380
In your spare time,

151
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,500
do something you enjoy.

152
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,140
I like working overtime.

153
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,940
You don't.

154
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,100
I do.

155
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,860
You don't.

156
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,540
Don't be afraid.

157
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,400
I'm not the kind of capitalist
who loves exploitation.

158
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,340
I firmly defend your right
not to work overtime

159
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,380
and support you
in developing personal interests.

160
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,410
Go home now.

161
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,340
Do you want me to drive you?

162
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,820
Not again.

163
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,140
Tell the administration

164
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,460
to prepare a new mug for Mr. Meng.

165
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
This Tiger Meng

166
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,700
is really a thorn in my side.

167
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,820
He's like a super villain.

168
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,300
He's the nemesis in my life.

169
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,060
I embarrassed myself
in front of Secretary Chen.

170
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,460
Ye Ran,

171
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,820
stop thinking about Secretary Chen.

172
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,220
Let me accompany you to draw manga.

173
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,100
I'm not in the mood.

174
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,060
Don't feel like drawing.

175
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,700
Are you out of ideas?

176
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,500
Do you want me to chat with you?

177
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,380
I think the main problem with this story

178
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,820
is the lack of a villain.
