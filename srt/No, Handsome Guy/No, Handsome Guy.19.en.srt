24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,680
Ye Dang.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,600
Mr. Meng,

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,800
are you here to become a member?

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,880
I'm here to ask you

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,760
about Ye Ran's phobia of handsome guys.

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,920
This is Ye Ran's privacy.

30
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,240
You should ask her about it.

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,600
I'm not in a position to tell you.

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,040
Does she know Rainy Night?

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,520
Ye Ran?

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,480
Long time no see.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,680
Rainy Night is Ye Ran's ex-boyfriend

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,360
and her first love.

37
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,320
Ye Ran has always been
particular about appearances.

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,840
She has liked beautiful things
since she was little

39
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,480
and is very picky about boys.

40
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,120
Yu Feng used to be the school's heartthrob.

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,940
Ye Ran fell in love with him at first sight.

42
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,000
He's looking at me.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,800
Many girls liked Yu Feng,

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,680
but Ye Ran was particularly persistent.

45
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,520
She pursued Yu Feng for a year

46
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,760
and finally got together with him.

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,000
Ye Ran treated Yu Feng very well,

48
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,560
almost giving

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,560
her heart and soul.

50
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,200
But Yu Feng is a very selfish man,

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920
making Ye Ran's life very difficult.

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,240
Yu Feng,

53
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,600
this is a manga I drew for you.

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,680
Do you like it?

55
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,400
You only know how to draw manga.

56
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,960
Do you really think you can succeed?

57
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,480
You can't.

58
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,640
You'd better spend your time with me

59
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,560
and help me edit videos.

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,200
I only have 20,000 fans now.

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,800
Do you know how much pressure I'm under?

62
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,120
But I also have my own dream.

63
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,160
Is your dream more important
than my livelihood?

64
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,280
If you continue to draw manga,

65
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,120
it means you don't care about me.

66
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,600
It's not like that.

67
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,920
Let's break up.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,840
No.

69
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,800
Then which do you choose,
me or the manga?

70
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
I...

71
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,440
I choose you.

72
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
Good girl.

73
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,360
You two know each other?

74
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,840
Yes, we do.

75
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,760
We were schoolmates.

76
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,560
You two were schoolmates?

77
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
What a coincidence.

78
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,150
Yes, we were

79
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,280
schoolmates for six years.

80
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,280
We had a deep friendship.

81
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,720
Sometimes,

82
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,560
I even miss the old times.

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,240
Can we talk alone for a moment?

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,800
Sure, excuse me.

85
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,680
Yu Feng,

86
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,400
why are you dating another girl again?

87
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,600
Are you filming videos again?

88
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,600
Yes, that's for hype.

89
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,240
Why do you need to do that
with another girl?

90
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,600
I'm your girlfriend, aren't I?

91
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,880
She has millions of fans,

92
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,000
what about you?

93
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,000
Do you even know your worth?

94
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,040
Even if I tell others
you are my girlfriend,

95
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,000
they won't believe me.

96
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,080
I don't care what others think.

97
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,440
I only care about your attitude.

98
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,600
Come on,

99
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,920
we've been together for so long.

100
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,840
No one can replace you

101
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,840
in my heart.

102
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,600
You go back first.
I'll talk to you after I finish my work.

103
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,480
Is that okay?

104
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,520
No,

105
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,640
you say this every time.

106
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,400
I won't believe you anymore.

107
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,560
Where are you going?

108
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,160
I'll go with you.

109
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,760
Ye Ran,

110
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,000
be good and listen to me.

111
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,360
Don't take any pictures.

112
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,120
Afterwards, Yu Feng
never contacted Ye Ran again.

113
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,600
He didn't even say sorry.

114
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,760
Later, she was misunderstood by his fans

115
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,560
and was cyberbullied for several months.

116
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,680
But he never came out to explain.

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,080
He even caused Ye Ran
to lose her previous job.

118
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,200
We thought about
exposing Yu Feng online.

119
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,680
But he bought many online trolls

120
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
and claimed that
we had edited the pictures to frame him.

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,560
Ye Ran was deeply affected.

122
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,600
She didn't leave the house
for almost half a year.

123
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,200
Later, she developed a phobia
about handsome guys.

124
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,440
Two years have passed.

125
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,120
We have consulted many psychologists,

126
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,720
but none of it has been effective.

127
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,080
So you need to be prepared.

128
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,280
If Ye Ran
can't overcome her inner fears,

129
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
what will you do?

130
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
As long as she is willing,

131
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,560
I will always stand by her side,

132
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,160
even if I have to keep away from her.

133
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,920
You need to think carefully.

134
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,600
If you don't truly love her,

135
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,960
and can't provide her
with a sense of security for a lifetime,

136
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
I advise you
to distance yourself from her.

137
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,560
Ye Ran can't afford
to get hurt a second time.

138
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
It's not too late to regret it now.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I won't regret it.

140
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,520
But I will make that Yu Feng regret it.

141
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,160
What are you trying to do?

142
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,560
Ye Ran,

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,520
are you still angry?

144
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,440
I have been regretting it
for the past two years.

145
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,880
Only now did I realize

146
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,960
that you

147
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,040
are the best girl to me in this world.

148
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
Ye Ran,

149
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,960
let's reconcile.

150
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,480
You really make me feel disgusted.

151
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,720
Ye Ran,

152
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,400
you can't let go either, can you?

153
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
I know you love me very much.

154
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,920
I was the one making mistakes all along,

155
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,560
but you always forgave me.

156
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,720
This time, I really made a mistake,

157
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,640
but I am a changed person now.

158
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,640
I can make it up to you.

159
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
Let go!

160
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
You dare to hit me!

161
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,120
Mr. Yu, you're here.

162
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,000
What's going on?

163
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,920
Ye Ran,

164
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,000
I know you hate me
for what happened two years ago,

165
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,720
but I am willing to forgive you now.

166
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,080
Why won't you let go?

167
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,000
I know what he's talking about.

168
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Two years ago, there was a crazy fan,

169
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
who became famous
for harassing Rainy Night.

170
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,240
Could it be Ye Ran?

171
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,680
I'm sorry, Mr. Yu.

172
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,160
Our employee was being rude,

173
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,560
I'll make her apologize to you.

174
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,640
Ye Ran,

175
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,600
apologize.

176
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,760
But...

177
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,280
Ye Ran, I have to cooperate
with your company.

178
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,400
How about this? If you apologize to me,

179
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,360
I won't hold any grudges about this matter.

180
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,280
Yes, yes, yes.

181
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,600
Ye Ran,

182
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,520
apologize.

183
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,200
- Long ago? How long ago?
- Stop it! Stop it!

184
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,480
You knew him long ago?

185
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,600
Stop filming.

186
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
When did you get to know him?

187
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,000
Just say it.

188
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,920
It's not what you think.

189
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,160
Actually, we have...

190
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,760
Yu Feng,

191
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,720
get out of here right now.

192
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,520
Otherwise,
don't blame me for being impolite.

193
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,400
Who are you?

194
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,000
It's none of your business.

195
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,800
Remember this,

196
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
from now on,

197
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,800
our company
terminates all cooperation with you.

198
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,080
Sorry, Mr. Meng,

199
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,440
I don't know what happened.

200
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,840
We have secured this cooperation
with great difficulty.

201
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,840
Lisa,

202
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,080
don't worry about this matter.

203
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,600
Go and formulate a new plan.

204
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,760
Okay.

205
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,600
Boss.

206
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,480
Come on, let's go.

207
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,200
We are ready to release the truth

208
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,320
about Rainy Night's scandal.

209
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,160
Mr. Meng,

210
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,920
did I offend you?

211
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,640
Ye Ran is my girlfriend.

212
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,440
Anyone who upsets her

213
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,400
upsets me.

214
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,680
Mr. Meng, it's all a misunderstanding.

215
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,160
Ye Ran fooled you.

216
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,160
Please leave.

217
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,800
Say something nice for me.

218
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Just get out.
