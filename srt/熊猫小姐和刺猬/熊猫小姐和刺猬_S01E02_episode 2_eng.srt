1
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:57,478

2
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:14,435
Why don't you open your eyes?

3
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:17,986
This is hard on me.

4
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:26,149
 Episode 2

5
00:01:44,894 --> 00:01:46,738
 Eun Bi

6
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:52,576
Are you alright?

7
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:57,580
Ouch...be careful.

8
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,111
Be careful.

9
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:00,798
What's the matter?

10
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:03,970
Hey! Hey! Why are you like this?

11
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,469
Hey, did you get a sprain from the panda dance?
Is that what happened?

12
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:08,633
Wait a second.

13
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:10,524
I'll... One, two, three!

14
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:13,914
Hey, I understand...

15
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:17,829
Then. Just stay like that...

16
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,913
Really...

17
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,466
Please don't move, stay still.

18
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:26,811
If she stays still like that,
would you take care of the business then?

19
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:35,822
What do you do?

20
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,330
What?

21
00:02:37,752 --> 00:02:38,992
What?

22
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,743
What do you do?

23
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:57,733
I watched them to the end. 
Nothing happened.

24
00:02:57,733 --> 00:03:00,248
They moved away from each other right away.

25
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:01,853
Really...

26
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:05,843
Why is this red light so long today?

27
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:11,840
Oppa, it's good that you turned away.

28
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,395
If you show up after 15 years,
 and suddenly get so jealous,
don't you think it wrecks your style?

29
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:32,030
So, why did you fall into this situation?

30
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:35,683
What are you talking about?

31
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,996
"What are you talking about?"

32
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:44,298
You say that, and you look at me like i'm some prick.. Then that must mean you're her boyfriend!

33
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:46,473
Ahjusshi!

34
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:51,881
Stop talking about nonsense and just get me topical anesthetic patches.

35
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:56,187
I need money to buy them.

36
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:59,755
I'll pay you back later.
Please buy them for me.

37
00:03:59,755 --> 00:04:01,723
What do you mean by later?

38
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:03,738
I'll pay you!

39
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:08,207
I'll accept it if you insist...

40
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:11,631
I don't have the cash to buy the pain relief patches.

41
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:15,661
Then, why don't you use your credit card?

42
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:18,395
Ah, really!

43
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:21,718
You know my credit card won't work.

44
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,069
Geez...

45
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:28,224
Here.

46
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:32,709
Does this include my errand?

47
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,430
Ahjusshi!

48
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:37,251
Why are you doing this, really!

49
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:43,199
She's giving me a sign to go away!

50
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,257
Right, right?

51
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:51,054
Hey, hey, isn't this your cell phone?
Huh?

52
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:54,284
It's crying out of control on the floor!

53
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:04,815
Then, why don't you give it to her?
Huh?

54
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:06,999
Instead of wasting time joking around.

55
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:11,746
Hello? Hey, Panda?

56
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,343
Something happened to you, right?

57
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:16,470
You had a fight with the chef, right?!

58
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:18,232
I'll contact you later.

59
00:05:18,232 --> 00:05:20,237
Did you throw your cell phone?

60
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,053
It ended abruptly with the sound.

61
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:24,449
It's not like that!

62
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:33,229
Over there...

63
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:35,983
Sorry.

64
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,064
Hey, Panda!

65
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:42,844
H...Hello?

66
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:45,786
I fell off from a chair.

67
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:50,241
No. I didn't break anything, 
but I can't straighten out my back.

68
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:56,070
My back is not straightening out because I fell,
I was trying to get your phone call...

69
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,554
Are you trying to tell me that you injured your back because of me?

70
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:00,631
Yes.

71
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:06,349
Ah, you have never blamed me for anything.
Now, you're making me a scapegoat...

72
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:09,212
Really, what happened? 
What happened?

73
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:17,866
Hey, by the way, when I say "what happened", I think of Won Il.

74
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:20,839
Oh, what happened? What happened?

75
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,635
Team Leader?
Huh?

76
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:24,648
Please ask if she can do the interview.

77
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:27,097
Right, right. Then, you can't do the interview?

78
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:28,694
HEY!

79
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,402
 Hey! Why are you yelling all of a sudden?!

80
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:34,393
I'll definitely be there for the interview.

81
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,973
Don't ever leave me out.

82
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:40,515
Did you think I was joking when I told you
I only had 35 cents in my account?

83
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:45,822
If it doesn't work out, I'll starve to death.

84
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:50,590
I've exhausted all my savings.

85
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,974
I didn't even have money for 
topical anesthetic patches.

86
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,839
Yes.

87
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,850
Money for topical anethestic patches...

88
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,940
I was going to the second floor for it.

89
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:07,630
I'll kill him if he's doing something else with the money!

90
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:38,344
Are you playing with food?

91
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:47,654
Maculinea teleius.

92
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:51,059
Aspidomorpha transparipennis.

93
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:54,364
Rhyssa persuasoria.

94
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:59,569
Homotropus tarsatorius.

95
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:38,130
What are you doing, customer?

96
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:44,256
Ma'am?

97
00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:47,301
When did you come?

98
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,135
Just now.

99
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:51,875
Not you, that guy over there.

100
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:58,103
What is he doing over there?

101
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,531
Did you change the chef?

102
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:02,422
No, I didn't!

103
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:03,915
No?

104
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:08,092
Then, let's recruit him.
Huh?

105
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:14,584
If the smell is as good as this, then your shop will be the best
and I can seduce Hyun Bin body.

106
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:17,491
Shall we try it?

107
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,915
Yes!

108
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,429
The cake that was here
 didn't look too good...

109
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:43,307
No, it was really bad....

110
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:45,968
It didn't even look like a cake.

111
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,228
This,
gives hope...

112
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:55,542
And makes people passionate!

113
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:59,267
This is the cake we fell for!

114
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,192
Can you give me some more of that cake?

115
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:30,075
For me too!

116
00:10:36,457 --> 00:10:38,108
He's not there.

117
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:41,278
Did he leave?

118
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:43,314
Go out and find him.

119
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:47,772
I hurt my back a little.

120
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,745
Then I'll go and find him.

121
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:06,155
Did he leave?

122
00:11:11,982 --> 00:11:14,695
Hey, he's going to come back!

123
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,606
 A pastry chef is already wanted.

124
00:11:17,606 --> 00:11:19,365
A hedgehog?

125
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:21,438
Hey, I got him first.

126
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:25,033
If you even look at him, you're dead!!

127
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,355
Yes, customer.

128
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:29,954
Call me unni!

129
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:32,625
We don't even have much difference between us.

130
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,936
It was a killer cake for real!

131
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:39,051
Okay, unni!

132
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:41,261
Yeah.

133
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:44,027
 We will be back soon. We will be in the nearest chicken shop.

134
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,282
Hey, what is up with you today?
Buying us chicken and all?

135
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:49,648
Let's go. Lets go.
Huh?

136
00:11:51,953 --> 00:11:53,977
Hey!? Where are you going? I thought we were going to go eat chicken?

137
00:11:53,977 --> 00:11:55,480
We're going to eat beef today.

138
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,675
And it's Korean beef!

139
00:11:57,903 --> 00:11:58,635
Beef?!

140
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,987
Wow!

141
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:03,890
Hey, put a lot more.

142
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,074
That much is enough.

143
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:08,704
Hey, you just worry about yourself.

144
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:10,935
I'm busy, I'm busy... Hehe, I'm going to eat this.

145
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:12,810
Hey.

146
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,103
Eat it wrapped.

147
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:18,460
What do you want to say?
Why are you hesitant?
Huh?

148
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:25,657
Why are you eating this, Ahjusshi?

149
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:28,446
What is the problem if I want to eat it you punk?

150
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,641
Then, you pay for it too.

151
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:34,003
What do you mean "you pay"? 
I got invited with them, punk!

152
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,746
Please eat.

153
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:39,564
What do you mean by eat?! 
Seung Ji is the one buying this!

154
00:12:39,564 --> 00:12:42,115
You must have received some money from Panda, right?

155
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:44,877
Was she really an accomplice?

156
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:46,152
It's not that.

157
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:49,208
Hey, are you going to get married?

158
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,302
What the heck are you talking about?!

159
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:55,545
What would it be if you're not going to get married then? When you always make bad decisions?

160
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:59,061
Are you perhaps quitting?

161
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:14,493
 We take photos that make you look younger ^^

162
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:17,177
Wait a second.

163
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,584
This little punk.

164
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:28,737
I think that quitting is the reason.

165
00:13:28,737 --> 00:13:29,674
But, what is the reason for it?

166
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:34,067
Ahjusshi. If you've had enough, can't you go away?

167
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:36,737
What kind of owner gets in between customer's conversations

168
00:13:36,737 --> 00:13:38,835
and doesn't know how to leave?

169
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:40,679
Hey, Ahjusshi is the one that knows everything about our problems.

170
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,102
What is the matter if we tell him?

171
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:43,761
Yeah, just tell me everything comfortably.

172
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:46,441
Out of all the people here in this neighborhood, I am the scariest person here.

173
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:47,742
Hey, you know....

174
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:49,305
Ahjusshi.

175
00:13:50,337 --> 00:13:55,413
Really, what is the best thing to tell my grandpa?

176
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,145
Oh...Boss, you're here!!

177
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:06,011
Boss, because we have not eaten with each other in a long time, I called them here today.

178
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:27,955
Hey, where are you going that you took a picture?

179
00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:31,200
What did you do by yourself?

180
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:36,677
Why did the manager make this photo so big?

181
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:41,338
Just say it's a girl problem.

182
00:14:41,484 --> 00:14:46,583
That's what will hurt your grandpa the least.

183
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:51,123
Not today, but a day you and your grandpa have everything figured out.

184
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,857
"I'm a big boy now."

185
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:54,404
Let him feel that you are.

186
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:56,788
That way he won't worry when he doesn't have his eyes on you.

187
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,750
It's not.

188
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,883
If it is her boyfriend?!

189
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:05,129
I report the both of them.

190
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,448
If it is not her boyfriend..?

191
00:16:08,453 --> 00:16:12,012
I mean if it is not her boyfriend, why the heck was he there??!!!

192
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,993
Why is Panda so weird?!

193
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:16,716
Hyungnim~

194
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,831
Is it okay if I tell you what I think?

195
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:22,321
Yeah, tell me.

196
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,299
First of all.. 
Let's find her together.

197
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:35,546
That woman for our gentleman or,

198
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:37,471
I'll look into it and apologize.

199
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:38,854
Wow, really.

200
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:40,987
I really didn't know that too.

201
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,922
But I think Panda is strange somehow...

202
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,358
I think she is suffering.

203
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:49,796
Does that mean she is poor?

204
00:16:50,068 --> 00:16:51,549
No, that's not what I mean.

205
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,839
The man is poor.

206
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:57,965
What does that mean?

207
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,055
Tell me in English.

208
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:02,730
Um, I'm just -

209
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,407
You know my English skills, yet you ask...

210
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:06,570
Sorry, sorry.

211
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,460
Then break the words apart and tell me.

212
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:14,483
As I was saying, the way Panda looked when that guy caught her...

213
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:18,197
What I'm saying is her face expression was,"what is this?!"

214
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:21,882
What?
Face expression?

215
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:24,958
What I mean is, Panda's face was -

216
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,270
"Huh? What is this situation"

217
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,909
What I'm saying is, wasn't like that?

218
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,453
You!

219
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:40,844
How can you say something like that when Panda is a close friend!

220
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:46,540
That means you're understanding that the man is poor!

221
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:48,414
Fine.

222
00:17:48,414 --> 00:17:51,724
Fine, I understand because I never knew what it felt like to actually kiss someone!

223
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,377
Then, you haven't kissed anyone yet?!

224
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:02,915
How could I if I haven't dated anyone?

225
00:18:03,503 --> 00:18:06,330
Hey, our hyung was way too busy for that stuff.

226
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,351
Hyung, you can do it even if you don't love the person but drunk, or -

227
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:12,859
When you're feeling it in a club, then you're supposed to do it!

228
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,523
YOU REALLY?!

229
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:16,165
Are you like that?!

230
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:16,945
Me?!

231
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:19,878
When men drink, they get like that.

232
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:22,064
So?

233
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,511
Brother, you're not telling me that you have never had alcohol, right?

234
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:30,258
Hey, didn't I tell you?!

235
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:33,774
It's not something that a human actually needs. Does alcohol make you love someone?

236
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,059
Oh my goodness~

237
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,788
Oh my goodness!! OH MY GOODNESS!!

238
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:40,024
This is the first time I have met a guy like this.

239
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,225
Hey, but even if you drink alcohol.

240
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:46,390
How can you kiss someone that you don't love?

241
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,611
Do you think lips are made for that?!

242
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:51,121
And also, a club?

243
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:53,501
Can you even kiss at such a chaotic place like that?

244
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,449
Goodness, you need to say stuff that makes sense.

245
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,259
Blah, blah, blah.

246
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,994
You have a long way to go.

247
00:18:59,994 --> 00:19:01,676
It's okay.

248
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:03,879
Keep calm and carry on.

249
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:07,838
Right now isn't the time to calm down!

250
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:10,557
Mom's trying to put you in a blind date..

251
00:19:11,993 --> 00:19:13,040
What?

252
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,117
She is putting me where?

253
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:16,937
OH MY GOODNESS! Me, I don't know. Mom wants us to come down.

254
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:17,799
Come down.

255
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:29,172
Oh, hyung!

256
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:31,427
HYUNG! HYUNG!! HYUNG!!!

257
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:42,574
Hyung, hyung, hyung, hyung! What will I do?

258
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,592
Where is he going?

259
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:49,052
You set up a blind date and he caught on and ran.

260
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:51,224
He says he will run whenever you set up a blind date.

261
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:52,181
What?

262
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:54,600
He says he even has thoughts of running away to America!

263
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,582
Just who does he resemble to be like that?!

264
00:19:57,982 --> 00:19:58,647
Me.

265
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,185
You're the same.

266
00:20:04,608 --> 00:20:06,887
What does that have to do with me?!

267
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:09,109
So annoying really...

268
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:11,264
I think he's running because he found out that we're about to set a date for him.

269
00:20:11,264 --> 00:20:12,912
I mean...

270
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:15,727
What's wrong with us finding him a woman to date?

271
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:18,083
What's wrong with him?

272
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:21,388
It is not like he has a woman?

273
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,518
It's not like he does whatever.
My handsome son.

274
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,618
Look, look! Stop with the nonsense.

275
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:29,934
Why can't I call it like that?

276
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:31,575
Mom's REAL son.

277
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:33,997
Oops! Sorry.

278
00:20:34,594 --> 00:20:35,797
Did you just realize?

279
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,884
I'm sorry!

280
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:41,696
I forgot that you weren't his biological dad.

281
00:20:41,696 --> 00:20:43,895
I was thinking how great it would be if you were his biological father and -

282
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:45,255
Totally forgot!

283
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,473
That's not something to forget!

284
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:52,212
How can a person do such a thing?

285
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:54,882
Why are you looking like that, woman?!

286
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,889
A young man is riding a nice car.

287
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:11,650
Hey, if you have a lot of money, go to Cafe Panda

288
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,954
and spend some money there.

289
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,375
Hey, look here!

290
00:21:24,871 --> 00:21:26,405
He just ignores me?

291
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:46,154
Hey! I said, look here!

292
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,787
Is it so hard?

293
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:53,587
Look here!

294
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:00,534
Aish.

295
00:22:10,183 --> 00:22:12,212
What is he..

296
00:22:17,145 --> 00:22:18,966
Did he hear me?

297
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:31,422
Sit anywhere you'd like.

298
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:34,677
Hello.

299
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:37,691
We don't have customers, anyway.

300
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,653
And have no customers coming here.

301
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:41,915
You should at least be thankful he is here!

302
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:49,380
Why did you come?

303
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,545
Did you just ask me why I came to my niece's shop?

304
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:54,052
She's not here.

305
00:22:54,717 --> 00:22:57,449
Today is the last of her part time job.

306
00:22:57,449 --> 00:22:58,845
So she went to get money.

307
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:01,249
Because she hurt her back, she went to a sauna.

308
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,332
Why is her back hurt?!

309
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:05,438
She was doing a show on a chair and fell.

310
00:23:05,438 --> 00:23:07,559
Why would she be doing a show on a chair?!

311
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,921
Because there were not any customers.

312
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:12,007
She hung a Panda and did nonsense.

313
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:13,710
How dare you say that!

314
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:18,775
Goodness, there are a lot of things you still don't know.

315
00:23:19,582 --> 00:23:24,037
There was an accident in front of the shop today so,

316
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:26,445
her back was hurting so much.

317
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:29,465
She went home to rest.
I really don't know.

318
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:31,308
Did she get hurt that much?

319
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:34,416
I.... don't know.

320
00:23:35,807 --> 00:23:39,573
You should have called first before coming.

321
00:23:39,573 --> 00:23:41,820
Why did you suddenly come here?

322
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,268
It is not because I suddenly came.

323
00:23:44,268 --> 00:23:47,152
I can come whenever I want to come!!

324
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:51,441
Ah.. Where did he go?

325
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:54,533
The steaming room, I told you!

326
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,959
I don't really know!!

327
00:23:57,639 --> 00:23:59,966
What the heck is that punk?

328
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:02,503
Why did he come here?

329
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,362
Omo! Auntie!

330
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,536
I thought you were in an accident today?!

331
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:12,506
We just went out for a while.

332
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:14,421
I have to stay with her all day long.

333
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:20,421
 A squirrel in the mountains~ 
(Children's Song)

334
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:29,907
I told you a million times NOT to wash rice with so much strength.

335
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:33,229
Leave me alone!

336
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:34,845
Move away, I'll do it!

337
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,745
YOU!

338
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:40,034
With all the beating, now you want to beat me with a frying pan!

339
00:24:40,034 --> 00:24:41,583
When have I ever beat you?

340
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,977
You did all the time when I was young, whenever I didn't do what you wanted!

341
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:45,512
Is it just one or two days you have?

342
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:47,339
Are you saying that you can't live here then??!!

343
00:24:51,835 --> 00:24:53,707
Let's talk!

344
00:24:53,707 --> 00:24:55,002
Man to man!

345
00:25:01,338 --> 00:25:05,043
Why are you pouring yourself a drink when I'm right here?!

346
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:06,844
Here.

347
00:25:11,954 --> 00:25:13,316
Drink.

348
00:25:18,303 --> 00:25:19,811
Here.

349
00:25:21,177 --> 00:25:23,221
My hand is going to fall off, hurry.

350
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:29,279
You feel great, don't you grandpa?

351
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,998
Whenever you drink soju you have to feel great, don't you agree?!

352
00:25:36,386 --> 00:25:38,027
I said I will pour it for you!

353
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:41,007
Why would I accept alcohol from you?!

354
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:59,308
Is the other place paying you more?

355
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:05,721
That you're acting like this with me, is it like that?

356
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:12,037
Why are you like this? There wasn't anything that you would hide from me!

357
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:15,650
This won't do!

358
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,878
Hey! Why would you drink that?!

359
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:21,236
Then what should I do with you, grandpa?!

360
00:26:21,236 --> 00:26:26,186
I mean why would I drink this?! Obviously because I can't say anything!

361
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:31,282
Hey, is it a girl?

362
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:34,183
Did you get her pregnant?

363
00:26:34,183 --> 00:26:35,457
What?

364
00:26:35,457 --> 00:26:41,817
Why are you all surprised? When I was your age my daughter was in Kindergarten.

365
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:47,022
Then, when is that daughter coming?

366
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:52,307
Did she already come out?

367
00:26:52,307 --> 00:26:53,603
Yeah...

368
00:26:53,603 --> 00:26:57,932
Then, why didn't you tell me?! Then you should bring her, what are you doing?

369
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,674
Why?

370
00:27:01,674 --> 00:27:04,427
Does she not want to live with you?

371
00:27:04,427 --> 00:27:06,496
Because our home is too small?

372
00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:09,585
Then, all you have to do is move, I have money. Then what is the problem?

373
00:27:09,585 --> 00:27:11,005
There's nothing like that.

374
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:13,284
Why?

375
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:20,693
It's a precious house to my daughter, so I can't move.

376
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:26,075
Then, she has come back to the precious house.
Why doesn't she come?

377
00:27:26,075 --> 00:27:31,659
After her grandma died, she didn't want to come and see me at all.

378
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:36,134
She would only come if I told her I had a death disease.

379
00:27:36,134 --> 00:27:38,379
Then tell her you have a death disease.

380
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:39,854
What did you say you punk?

381
00:27:39,854 --> 00:27:46,516
If that person will come to me I'll say that I have it. Grandpa that girl is no longer...

382
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:51,859
You were in a bad situation that's why I didn't tell you about her.

383
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:56,366
I mean, what kind of job does she do?

384
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:58,153
What I mean is.

385
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:02,247
Coincidentally..
She has a cake shop.

386
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:05,132
What? A bread shop?!

387
00:28:05,132 --> 00:28:07,358
It's hot.

388
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:08,396
Ah, hot!

389
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,211
Hold it in.

390
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,791
It won't do just by selling this.

391
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:21,571
Hey Da Na, bring that over here.

392
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:24,671
This?
 -Yeah, give me this.

393
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:27,356
What is this?

394
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:30,775
Aunt you know, this guy showed up at our cake shop..

395
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:38,777
I don't know how to tell you, but when I saw that girl for the first time I just FELL for her!!

396
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:45,601
And he was making a cake and OH MY GOODNESS, it was amazing!

397
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:48,121
At that time the girl...

398
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:53,467
was about to fall. So I just went, and just like this I caught her without letting her fall...

399
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,255
Oh that turned out good!

400
00:28:57,255 --> 00:29:00,013
Just be careful.

401
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,811
I didn't get her pregnant!

402
00:29:06,155 --> 00:29:08,731
People are going to think you are pregnant or something.

403
00:29:09,868 --> 00:29:15,121
It hurts so much, what am I supposed to do? I feel like I can see stars.

404
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:20,031
Can you even go to your interview like this? Tell Eun-Bi that you will go once you get better.

405
00:29:20,031 --> 00:29:24,246
If you interfere with other people's business, are you going to take fault?!

406
00:29:24,246 --> 00:29:27,609
Why do you speak with an accent?
Did Chef Gil Dong Goo influence you?

407
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:31,657
Chef Gil Dong Goo is fired. 
It'll be Patissier Ko Seung Ji.

408
00:29:31,657 --> 00:29:35,901
I'll be at Saint Honore.
Take care of the cafe business.
The end.

409
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,285
Who said they can do what ever they want?

410
00:29:37,285 --> 00:29:38,100
What?!

411
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,793
Who's going to hire you at Saint Honore?

412
00:29:54,933 --> 00:30:01,085
Hey, doesn't your dad look so good? Looking at him like that, it looks like he is the boss.

413
00:30:01,085 --> 00:30:03,004
Not he looks like, but he is.

414
00:30:03,004 --> 00:30:08,633
Of course, of course he is the boss... leader... master. Oh...so attractive.

415
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:13,510
Not that, but probably a boss of manipulation.

416
00:30:17,493 --> 00:30:25,587
Hey! When are you going to stop looking down on your father?! PLEASE DON'T DO THAT!

417
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,693
Stop what you're doing!

418
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,091
Do you think you would buy something like this?!

419
00:30:48,091 --> 00:30:49,257
I'm sorry.

420
00:30:49,257 --> 00:30:54,181
If you're sorry then get out and don't think about wasting my time.

421
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:12,954
Where the heck did you learn this?

422
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:16,861
Where did you learn to trick people's taste buds?

423
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:17,788
I'm sorry.

424
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:19,381
If you're sorry also, then you get out too!

425
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:34,439
I'm tired of the saying, 
'the cake that looks good tastes good.'

426
00:31:35,464 --> 00:31:40,425
From now on, you can work here in Franchise Cake Company.

427
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:43,972
Thank you, President! Thank you.

428
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:04,963
Hey, when was Won Il looking at us?

429
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:06,844
He was there right when you went in.

430
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:10,793
Then you should have at least told me!

431
00:32:10,793 --> 00:32:13,193
I'm...sorry.

432
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:17,222
Aigoo.

433
00:32:18,141 --> 00:32:25,943
Oh my goodness, you and your alcohol. And because of you I can't live.

434
00:32:31,935 --> 00:32:38,214
Grandpa I can't continue my dream becuase of you, why are you not letting me rest!

435
00:32:38,214 --> 00:32:40,312
Grandpa!

436
00:32:40,312 --> 00:32:53,249
I will help you!
I can change everthing for you, but, by that way how much does that cost?

437
00:32:54,086 --> 00:33:02,270
Anyway, the allowance you have given me for 5 years, I have saved a load!

438
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:08,062
I will give it all to you grandpa!

439
00:33:08,062 --> 00:33:11,006
Why would I use your money, punk?

440
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:16,119
Why?! Because you love me and I love you grandpa!

441
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,970
Hey, drink some of this. Drink, drink.

442
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,146
Hey, a little bit more.

443
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:28,837
You, YOU!

444
00:33:28,837 --> 00:33:31,480
Stop it! He keeps on trying to bite me!

445
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,748
Hey, hey, get out! Get out!

446
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:36,054
Hey, what are you trying to do with me?

447
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:52,616
Ah..Ah..*cough* Ah.. *cough*

448
00:33:53,246 --> 00:33:56,123
Are you wide awake now?

449
00:33:56,123 --> 00:33:59,846
I can't even talk normally. My throat is hurting so much.

450
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:04,704
What throat hurt? Do you know how much you drank yesterday?

451
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:10,244
Grandpa, I'll be going out for a bit.

452
00:34:10,244 --> 00:34:12,431
Again? Where?

453
00:34:12,431 --> 00:34:16,496
I mean.. to meet a girl.

454
00:34:18,506 --> 00:34:22,794
I will take this cake, that's okay, right?

455
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:31,380
This cake.. 
Didn't you say cake needs happiness?

456
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:15,422

457
00:35:17,372 --> 00:35:20,223
Careful, careful.

458
00:35:20,223 --> 00:35:21,881
Be careful.

459
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:30,538
Aunt, I think we are early.

460
00:35:30,538 --> 00:35:34,678
It is better than being late! You think you will be alright? Want me to piggy back you?

461
00:35:34,678 --> 00:35:37,633
I'm okay. 
I'm fine.

462
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:38,954
Owww...

463
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:42,051
How would you come here with this back?

464
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:46,231
If I didn't come here I can't make the interview.

465
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:51,545
Da Yang. Are you okay? 
 If you were this hurt, why did you come?

466
00:35:52,669 --> 00:35:55,392
Because I need to do the interview of course.

467
00:35:55,392 --> 00:35:59,464
Goodness, you're so dumb. 
Let's go.
 I will take care of her.

468
00:35:59,464 --> 00:36:01,300
Yes, please do.

469
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,697
Be careful in the front.

470
00:36:05,473 --> 00:36:07,424
Why is he here?

471
00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:10,515
Auntie, do you know the President?

472
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:14,717
He is the President?! That young guy? 
That is the son.

473
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:19,733
But how does he know Da Yang (Panda)? 
And how does he know that you're her Aunt?

474
00:36:20,998 --> 00:36:24,260
Da Yang and that guy must have some type of fate or destiny.

475
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:32,579
Right here, right here.

476
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,090
Be careful.

477
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:47,226
Miss Kang Eun Bi, could you get me some medicine for her back?

478
00:36:47,226 --> 00:36:48,479
Yes.

479
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:50,454
Would you like to eat some cake?

480
00:36:50,454 --> 00:36:51,971
Yes.

481
00:36:51,971 --> 00:36:53,024
Cake...

482
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:57,018
Eun Bi, could you bring some cold water, too?

483
00:37:10,384 --> 00:37:12,375
How do you know Kang Eun Bi?

484
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:15,655
We are high school friends.

485
00:37:15,655 --> 00:37:21,557
Something's weird. The President is not talking formally and Panda is.

486
00:37:21,557 --> 00:37:26,637
Something doesn't seem right, it feels as if there is electricity between them.

487
00:37:28,031 --> 00:37:30,633
Is this all you can say now?!

488
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:34,403
Why don't you go and do your WORK!!

489
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,510
Oh wait a sec.

490
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:50,566
What, what? Should I remove it? Is it uncomfortable?

491
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:52,494
Are you okay?

492
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:55,089
But...

493
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:57,091
Yeah. Talk to me.

494
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:01,349
But, why are you not talking formally to me?

495
00:38:03,203 --> 00:38:04,550
That.. is...

496
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:12,717
Is it perhaps because I got qualified? Even so, it's a little weird.

497
00:38:12,717 --> 00:38:17,367
But, do you not know me?

498
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:21,896
Of course I know... 
Beaun Bean Guh

499
00:38:21,896 --> 00:38:25,638
That.. That..
That's not me!

500
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:30,916
There is a rumor saying you're a rice cake frog...

501
00:38:35,223 --> 00:38:39,154
Hey, do you not know me?

502
00:38:39,154 --> 00:38:42,526
I'm Won Il. Choi Won Il.

503
00:38:42,526 --> 00:38:47,378
We were always playing together when we were younger!

504
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:54,057
Pangy? Would you remember me if I say Pangy?

505
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:56,164
Pangy?

506
00:38:56,164 --> 00:38:58,279
The guy who only drew cakes?

507
00:38:58,279 --> 00:39:00,938
Yeah that's right! You're the one that gave me that nickname!

508
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:06,257
Hey, if you said that earlier I would have known you.
How long has it been since we saw each other?!

509
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:08,787
14 years and 5 months.

510
00:39:09,574 --> 00:39:12,917
You...
How come you weren't around for a long time?

511
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:23,094
No, it's not like that, I have been in America for a long time, and 
studied a lot there...And while I was there I figured out that I haven't seen my parents for 14 years and 5 months.

512
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,428
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, how is it that we meet like this?

513
00:39:26,428 --> 00:39:28,738
I'm glad that you're thrilled.

514
00:39:28,738 --> 00:39:32,357
I'm more glad to see you, Pangy!

515
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,646
I look the same as long ago, huh?

516
00:39:37,646 --> 00:39:40,167
Same what?
You look totally different!

517
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:44,497
No it's not like that. 
By the way, you have changed too.

518
00:39:44,497 --> 00:39:49,097
Your eyes got so round and your nose...

519
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:51,755
Your lips, too..

520
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,959
Hey, why are you suddenly like this?

521
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:05,708
Try putting your head down and holding your breath.

522
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:17,210
Oh, it stopped.

523
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:23,704
You're the same. 
 You're the same as long ago.

524
00:40:26,864 --> 00:40:30,016
Oh... It's hot..

525
00:40:30,016 --> 00:40:32,135
Oh, I'm the only one that's hot.

526
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:36,396
Ohhh!

527
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:40,010
I forgot I have to meet the President for the interview.

528
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,774
If I made you feel weird, I am sorry.

529
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,077
Why are you being like this?

530
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:54,483
I'll leave now. You have other people to see, 
 and Auntie is waiting for me.

531
00:40:56,468 --> 00:40:58,337
That's a shame.

532
00:40:58,337 --> 00:41:03,465
If it's a shame, then hire me. Then I will always play with you.

533
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:06,246
And do work.

534
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:30,229
This is a cake that Grandpa made.

535
00:41:33,648 --> 00:41:36,484
You don't hate it, right?

536
00:41:36,484 --> 00:41:38,256
The cake?

537
00:41:38,256 --> 00:41:40,920
Actually this cake...

538
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,659
brings you happiness and success in your life.

539
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:50,178
My grandpa's cake is like that...

540
00:41:50,178 --> 00:41:52,643
Isn't it great?

541
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:56,172
It won't ever make you lonely.

542
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:06,447
That is why I am saying this, but...

543
00:42:06,447 --> 00:42:09,808
Couldn't you save my grandpa?

544
00:42:10,426 --> 00:42:13,256
Not in the same house.

545
00:42:13,256 --> 00:42:16,204
I'm going to a different cake house.

546
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:20,168
Leaving my grandpa...

547
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:23,877
I can't just leave him like that.

548
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:28,534
Someone else could come instead of me.

549
00:42:31,274 --> 00:42:33,849
Honestly..

550
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:41,912
After meeting his daughter.. He keeps dreaming..

551
00:42:46,472 --> 00:42:50,494
He doesn't even know what he's doing at home.

552
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:54,117
That's why you should come..

553
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:02,164
If I'm by his side then you will just be uncomfortable.

554
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:10,985
She would only come if I told her I had a death disease.

555
00:43:10,985 --> 00:43:15,503
He told me not to say this.

556
00:43:16,977 --> 00:43:22,770
Grandpa...
...has a disease.

557
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:35,204
He told me not to say this...

558
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:44,683
You can never say that I came here looking for you! Okay?!

559
00:43:44,683 --> 00:43:47,814
You understand, right?

560
00:43:52,759 --> 00:44:03,858
But if you want to give me place here... 
I don't really have anything I'm special at, but if they give me any job I will work hard.

561
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:09,812
So what I am saying is,
 don't try to give me a placement where you think I will be special at, just something comfortable.

562
00:44:09,812 --> 00:44:11,625
Okay, I got it.

563
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:19,100
When I have a big shop and make special cakes, you must come okay?

564
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,083
I understand that really well, Miss Panda. 
So you should try your best.

565
00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:26,369
Oh no! Does it hurt?

566
00:44:26,993 --> 00:44:28,106
No.

567
00:44:28,106 --> 00:44:35,506
I got better! When I move my back like this it doesn't hurt at all! 
You fixed it Pangy!

568
00:44:36,077 --> 00:44:42,051
I'm so glad you're here, you saved my life! 
How can I repay you?

569
00:44:42,051 --> 00:44:43,666
What do you mean repay?

570
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:44,844
Thank you!

571
00:44:44,844 --> 00:44:46,590
Oh, it's okay.

572
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:52,675
Auntie! Don't eat that, but eat this.

573
00:44:53,893 --> 00:44:56,842
It's the amazing Saint Honore's amazing cake.

574
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,492
Seems like you qualified.

575
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:02,281
Whatever it is.

576
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:05,954
Auntie meet him, this is Pangy! 
He's my childhood friend.

577
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:08,208
Hello, I'm Choi Won Il.

578
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:10,800
Yes, I'm glad to meet you.

579
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,658
We saw each other yesterday, right?

580
00:45:13,658 --> 00:45:15,871
How did you guys see each other yesterday?

581
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:18,635
-Oh, that.. is..
 -We met on street while we were driving.

582
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:20,060
Oh yeah!

583
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,479
Well things like that can happen.

584
00:45:22,479 --> 00:45:24,253
Aunt, you must be destined for him.

585
00:45:24,253 --> 00:45:27,111
Well, destined is a little.. 
 Is this your little sister?

586
00:45:27,111 --> 00:45:33,091
Yeah, Pan Da Na. She worked here to steal a cake.

587
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:41,540
I wouldn't say steal, it's just a job that I have to come to!

588
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,873
It's like that, President.

589
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:48,583
Are you just going to let her steal?
If I were you I would have fired her right away!

590
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:50,635
I don't think that is going to be the case.

591
00:45:50,635 --> 00:45:52,045
Aunt, how do you know that?

592
00:45:52,045 --> 00:45:55,018
Aunt knows him more than you do!

593
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:59,131
Let's meet frequently. I have a feeling we will.

594
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,998
Yes.

595
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:07,543
I learned how to bake a cake when I was in jail.

596
00:46:07,543 --> 00:46:09,448
My grandpa would come.

597
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:14,080
Before that I had a hard time. 
I didn't know what to do, I was lost.

598
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,666
My grandpa found me,

599
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:18,713
and took care of me for 5 years.

600
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,076
I was wondering why he was so kind to me.

601
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:27,937
'It's because if I'm kind to you, my daughter might at least get some luck.'

602
00:46:29,796 --> 00:46:31,978
I really didn't understand that.

603
00:46:32,469 --> 00:46:34,341
I always disliked grandpa.

604
00:46:35,995 --> 00:46:38,123
He still went with it.

605
00:46:41,317 --> 00:46:43,732
I always looked sad...

606
00:46:44,544 --> 00:46:48,031
and I never asked why he was having a hard time.

607
00:46:49,046 --> 00:46:51,286
Thats how much he waited for his daughter.

608
00:46:55,048 --> 00:46:56,985
Anyway...

609
00:46:56,985 --> 00:46:59,228
I must repay my grandpa.

610
00:46:59,785 --> 00:47:03,438
If I want to do so, you must help me.

611
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:10,795
It was a little bit too much...

612
00:48:11,479 --> 00:48:13,150
But still you did well.

613
00:48:13,942 --> 00:48:17,436
If I didn't, I mean, things wouldn't work out so what am I supposed to do?

614
00:48:18,934 --> 00:48:20,053
What is it?

615
00:48:23,176 --> 00:48:24,837
Hello?

616
00:48:24,837 --> 00:48:26,129
Yes.

617
00:48:27,584 --> 00:48:29,092
Ahjumma?!

618
00:48:31,134 --> 00:48:32,745
Really?!

619
00:48:32,745 --> 00:48:34,148
Thank you!

620
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:36,551
Ahjumma!

621
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:38,520
If you're going to come, then hurry and come!

622
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,198
Yes.

623
00:48:40,198 --> 00:48:42,270
I'll wait for you.
 Yes!

624
00:48:44,161 --> 00:48:45,561
YES!

625
00:48:47,173 --> 00:48:49,446
YES!

626
00:48:49,446 --> 00:48:51,308
I knew she would come alright.

627
00:48:52,004 --> 00:48:55,512
But, this isn't the time where I should just be standing here.

628
00:48:55,512 --> 00:48:58,249
I should go where I belong to.

629
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:00,376
If I don't go she won't accept me.

630
00:49:08,464 --> 00:49:11,078
Hey! Our telepathy connected! I was thinking about calling you.

631
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:13,468
I was waiting for your call.

632
00:49:13,468 --> 00:49:17,578
I'm looking at a killer cake right now.

633
00:49:18,383 --> 00:49:20,801
I think we can make a great cake!

634
00:49:21,469 --> 00:49:23,021
Me alone, okay?

635
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:24,387
Is this really a contract?

636
00:49:24,387 --> 00:49:27,294
It's not like I don't want to do it.

637
00:49:27,294 --> 00:49:29,793
Instead of that,

638
00:49:29,793 --> 00:49:32,407
we have to make the greatest cake ever!

639
00:49:32,407 --> 00:49:34,464
I'll do it by myself you don't have to do it.

640
00:49:35,112 --> 00:49:37,235
I'm not the type to eat any cake!

641
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:39,429
Then, at least tell me how to do it.

642
00:49:39,429 --> 00:49:41,926
How to make a great cake.

643
00:49:43,093 --> 00:49:44,525
Please... explain...

644
00:49:44,525 --> 00:49:46,443
Now we are talking!

645
00:49:46,443 --> 00:49:48,438
Then I'll tell you.

646
00:49:48,438 --> 00:49:50,089
 Just stay there.

647
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:52,312
I will go with the speed of the wind, okay! Wind.

648
00:49:52,312 --> 00:49:54,609
One, two, three. Go!

649
00:49:57,337 --> 00:49:59,898
How do you come with the speed of wind?

650
00:50:01,135 --> 00:50:02,585
Is it a lie?

651
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:06,019
One, two, three. Go?

652
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,665
Is he some punk that likes to play, Go! Stop!

653
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:14,891
If we saw fist.. then.. 
 a fighter?

654
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:18,238
It can't be...

655
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:21,296
He makes such amazing cakes.

656
00:50:21,933 --> 00:50:24,555
Surely, that couldn't be true.

657
00:50:32,504 --> 00:50:33,880
Hey!

658
00:50:37,812 --> 00:50:38,753
HEY!

659
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:41,793
Goodness sakes...
OH MY GOODNESS!

660
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,094
Hey?! You're a gecko, huh?!

661
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:50,529
I mean.. how can you...

662
00:50:50,529 --> 00:50:52,945
Are you not here to catch me?

663
00:50:52,945 --> 00:50:54,243
Isn't that right, bastard?

664
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,644
What?

665
00:50:55,644 --> 00:50:57,013
Bastard?

666
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:58,402
Yeah, bastard.

667
00:51:00,606 --> 00:51:01,723
Hey, why! 
Hey! Why are you being like this?!

668
00:51:01,723 --> 00:51:03,760
Hey, again! Why!

669
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,263
Stop!! STOP RIGHT THERE!!

670
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:16,509
Should... We just eat what's remaining?

671
00:51:17,889 --> 00:51:20,631
This, isn't something you can just buy.

672
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:24,656
Won II gave it to me because it was the sample from the bakery.

673
00:51:25,889 --> 00:51:28,891
Samples are even top secret to the workers.

674
00:51:30,628 --> 00:51:33,350
You only need a contract for that.

675
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:35,681
Contract for what?

676
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:39,304
Does that make any sense to make a contract for a cake?

677
00:51:39,749 --> 00:51:43,760
Making a cake is not that hard to do, you...

678
00:51:45,426 --> 00:51:47,043
Why are yelling like that?

679
00:51:47,043 --> 00:51:48,531
Ahjusshi, do you know?!

680
00:51:51,382 --> 00:51:55,975
There are so many things in the world I should know, but why do I need to know that?

681
00:51:58,650 --> 00:51:59,669
Ok.

682
00:52:03,796 --> 00:52:05,547
How'd they make this?

683
00:52:05,765 --> 00:52:07,342
I will explain to you.

684
00:52:08,106 --> 00:52:09,298
Forget it!

685
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:10,833
I don't need anything from you.

686
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:12,356
You just go stay there!!

687
00:52:12,904 --> 00:52:14,332
This girl. Really.

688
00:52:14,588 --> 00:52:17,750
You should at least show kindness to your patissier!

689
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,041
If you know so much,

690
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:21,831
then you start making cake tomorrow!

691
00:52:22,512 --> 00:52:25,104
Why me?! That is your job!

692
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,683
That's why. Give it to me.

693
00:52:28,524 --> 00:52:29,890
I said no!

694
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:39,967
What?

695
00:53:08,556 --> 00:53:09,386
Hey!

696
00:53:09,757 --> 00:53:11,058
Hey! Hey!

697
00:53:12,097 --> 00:53:13,554
What do you think about Amaga?

698
00:53:13,554 --> 00:53:15,139
Her back doesn't seem too good.

699
00:53:15,471 --> 00:53:17,937
But, don't you think Patissier is better than Amaga?

700
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,768
That girl doesn't know anything...

701
00:53:21,963 --> 00:53:23,890
Then should I take her to watch a movie?

702
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,100
Then Panda would really like that.

703
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:29,384
Watching a movie with a girl...

704
00:53:29,384 --> 00:53:31,353
she will definitely fall for you right away.

705
00:53:31,598 --> 00:53:32,686
Little sister.

706
00:53:32,987 --> 00:53:35,443
You really know something about relationships.

707
00:53:36,251 --> 00:53:37,714
If you're thankful then give me some money.

708
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,054
You have it by yourself.

709
00:53:46,725 --> 00:53:48,777
I said I can sleep in the living room!

710
00:53:49,043 --> 00:53:50,406
Father, why are you being like this?

711
00:53:50,406 --> 00:53:51,711
Just sleep comfortably in the room.

712
00:53:51,711 --> 00:53:54,068
You haven't been home in a long time, and why do you want to sleep in the living room?

713
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:56,588
I can sleep in the living room father.

714
00:53:56,588 --> 00:53:58,981
I said you can't!

715
00:53:58,981 --> 00:54:00,766
No, you just sleep in the room father.

716
00:54:00,766 --> 00:54:02,959
No you just sleep here and I will go to the living room.

717
00:54:02,959 --> 00:54:04,503
No father! I can just sleep in the living room.

718
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:14,803
Grandpa.

719
00:54:14,803 --> 00:54:20,123
It turned out that I'm really sorry, but..

720
00:54:21,788 --> 00:54:23,662
The cake house.

721
00:54:24,379 --> 00:54:27,211
Yeah, yeah, the one that my girlfriend works in.

722
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,384
There is an organization tomorrow.

723
00:54:32,187 --> 00:54:35,484
There is no one here, so I am going to sleep here,

724
00:54:35,484 --> 00:54:37,514
and start working in the morning.

725
00:54:39,786 --> 00:54:42,399
So today, don't wait for me and sleep comfortably.

726
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,303
I'm sorry grandpa.

727
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:50,128
I'll call you tomorrow.

728
00:54:51,848 --> 00:54:53,325
Alright.

729
00:54:53,325 --> 00:54:54,863
Goodnight grandpa.

730
00:54:54,863 --> 00:54:56,468
Okay.

731
00:55:10,919 --> 00:55:12,470
What's up at this hour?

732
00:55:15,106 --> 00:55:17,328
Me sleeping here today is going to be a secret.

733
00:55:19,371 --> 00:55:20,815
Don't tell anyone.

734
00:55:21,688 --> 00:55:23,003
You got it?

735
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:40,255
You sleep on the floor today.

736
00:55:42,917 --> 00:55:44,703
I'm cold today so,

737
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:47,767
I need to just sleep alone.

738
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:54,102
Where are you? How far are you?

739
00:55:55,476 --> 00:55:57,374
I'm already here.

740
00:55:58,194 --> 00:55:59,191
Yeah.

741
00:55:59,825 --> 00:56:01,261
Come a little faster.

742
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:02,884
Ok, I understand.

743
00:56:05,717 --> 00:56:07,654
What the heck happened?

744
00:56:11,366 --> 00:56:13,544
I'm the person that asked for the flowers earlier.

745
00:56:13,544 --> 00:56:15,798
Didn't you say delivery would come right away?

746
00:56:16,809 --> 00:56:17,758
Yes.

747
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,236
Then please come a little faster.

748
00:56:21,498 --> 00:56:22,969
Thank you, I am counting on you.

749
00:56:23,274 --> 00:56:24,240
Okay.

750
00:57:18,086 --> 00:57:21,793

751
00:57:21,793 --> 00:57:23,112
 Let's go.

752
00:57:23,112 --> 00:57:26,406
 You know that I won't ever do that.

753
00:57:26,406 --> 00:57:27,679
 You're being a little bit too much.

754
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:31,792
 I just want us to... work hard from now on...

755
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:35,551
 That's why, you have to count on me from now on.

756
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:37,552
 One. 
One...

757
00:57:37,552 --> 00:57:39,360
 Two.
Two...

758
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,278
 Three.
Three...

759
00:57:41,278 --> 00:57:42,613
 Go!

760
00:57:42,613 --> 00:57:44,337
 Go?
