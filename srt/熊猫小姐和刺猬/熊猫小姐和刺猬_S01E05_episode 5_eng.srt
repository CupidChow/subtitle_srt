1
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:49,090
 Episode 5.

2
00:00:56,575 --> 00:01:06,705

3
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:19,769
Why does Panda have the face of a surprised bunny?

4
00:01:21,518 --> 00:01:24,415
Oh, you have eyes for design. Here.

5
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:26,891
Have it.

6
00:01:27,423 --> 00:01:31,868
What's up with you?
Why are you acting like this?

7
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:36,958
I got cupcake orders for Choice Cream Cake...

8
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:40,678
I told you not to do it! Cake is not a fast food.

9
00:01:40,678 --> 00:01:43,894
And I'm not 24/7.

10
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:50,328
What's wrong? 
Are you admiring my body?
Huh?

11
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:57,789
She is such a child. Dummy.

12
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:01,680
Wow! It's pretty!

13
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:09,737
It's better than Saint Honore's, right? 
Seung Ji oppa's cake.

14
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:12,433
Anyway, what's his background like?

15
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,998
His grandpa's bakery.

16
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:17,070
He learned how to make this from such a place?

17
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,671
Dana. Let's talk a bit.

18
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:21,620
Talk here.

19
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,146
It's a private matter. I'm sorry.

20
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:28,348
What...private matter? Geez.

21
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:32,222
Oh, you scared me.

22
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:34,665
Are you spying on us?

23
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:36,970
Choi Won Il isn't here...

24
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,327
Be quiet.

25
00:02:41,313 --> 00:02:44,785
Ah...why are you doing this?

26
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:47,565
Pan Da Na, listen to me, don't get shocked.

27
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:51,519
Seung Ji has a tattoo on his back.

28
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,054
You're foxier than you look.

29
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:57,275
Huh?

30
00:02:57,275 --> 00:03:01,544
How far did you go?
How did you see him naked?

31
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:07,470
No, I didn't. I went into his room because I got an order for cupcakes and his back was showing with

32
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,624
a tattoo that looked like the edge of a knife.

33
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,326
What do you think his identity is?!

34
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:15,911
Fashionable?

35
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:20,923
Hey, having a tattoo on your back that looks like the edge of a knife is fashionable? Or is he a gangster?

36
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:24,533
I want to ask him if I can see it too.

37
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:27,662
Hey, don't talk about it!
You must not talk about it.

38
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:29,576
Why not?

39
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,617
He's not just an ordinary hedgehog...

40
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:35,773
There's something.

41
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:44,928
It resembles you, right?

42
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:47,602
It's pretty, fancy,

43
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:51,385
sweet, and refreshing.

44
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:53,887
How can you make such good flavors?

45
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:56,828
You inspired me, Eun Bi.

46
00:03:56,828 --> 00:04:00,209
You're a good judge of people.

47
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:04,946
Did Choi Won Il want you to find out
 what my cake tastes like?

48
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:07,707
No, that's not it.
He ordered to find out about you.

49
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,249
Find out?

50
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,050
Me?

51
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,979
How come?

52
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:15,969
I don't know. He told me to have Da Yang do it.

53
00:04:18,504 --> 00:04:23,560
So the president is investigating behind the vice president's back.

54
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,926
How can anybody know about this at Saint Honore?

55
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:29,873
Only in ingredient cost, more than $20,000 disappeared monthly,
in 10 years...

56
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:33,371
That's why the standard for ingredients has gone down.

57
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:35,829
Then, how come we have so many customers?

58
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:40,261
Since we use chemicals and food products to make old ingredients look fresh and new.

59
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:45,151
If people eat other cakes after having tasted ours,
 they'll think they are tastless.
That's the secret of Saint Honore.

60
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,152
Getting people addicted to the taste.

61
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,684
Experts must know that.

62
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:52,516
That's why we use lobbying, bribery, and such.

63
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:54,718
That's also why we use the magazine.

64
00:04:54,718 --> 00:04:58,391
They cover the luxuries of the world, 
and then our cake.

65
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:01,595
The operation is influenced by luxury.

66
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:06,817
Won Yi said our cake has no taste, and

67
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:09,182
Ko Seung Ji's has more flavor.

68
00:05:09,182 --> 00:05:11,352
HYUNG!!!!

69
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,835
You were here. I need your help.

70
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:17,441
To become a patissier, 
which book should I read first?

71
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,391
To become what?

72
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:20,259
A patissier.

73
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:25,576
You can start from the top shelves in the reference room. But why do you want to become a patissier?

74
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:29,861
Ah, you see, I'm a woman with a life. HAH!

75
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,352
Did you pay her to look at the books?

76
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:43,848
She wants to become a patissier like Ko Seung Ji.

77
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,506
She drives me crazy.

78
00:05:46,506 --> 00:05:50,052
 Please wait while it is being processed.

79
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:52,499
 Please take the cash.

80
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:54,682
It's me.

81
00:05:54,682 --> 00:05:57,311
You scared me!

82
00:05:57,311 --> 00:06:00,256
Why are you taking money out at this hour?
Did someone ask you for money urgently?

83
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:02,233
I just wanted to have some fun.

84
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:05,134
You want to buy something for Panda Da Yang, right?

85
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:10,021
If you have money for that kind of expense, 
give me some then.

86
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:15,060
So, because of Saint Honore's pride,
they will spend money rather than take.

87
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,198
Of course, Pan Da Yang is not 
the type to make you spend money.

88
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:23,185
You really don't know about girls.

89
00:06:23,185 --> 00:06:24,961
She asks me to pay for her all the time.

90
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:31,604
She'll pay you back later. Hey, does Pan Da Yang look like she'll rip you off? Probably the opposite is true.

91
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:33,977
Grandpa, noonim,

92
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:38,029
and hyung. 
Pan Da Yang has a lot of allies.

93
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:43,530
But, why are you not working, hyung?

94
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,687
No customer was looking for me at the entrance.

95
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:50,396
Of course, they have to fire me.

96
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:51,815
So you got fired?

97
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:53,071
Yeah.

98
00:06:53,071 --> 00:06:55,599
You have to have your temper under control.

99
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,507
That's unlike me, is it?

100
00:06:57,507 --> 00:07:03,657
You have to persevere.
Just bear anything for 3 months.

101
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,137
Do you want to learn about cake?

102
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:12,561
Even making ramen is difficult for me.
Do you think you can use me in the kitchen?

103
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,290
Hey, who's that?

104
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,767
Kind of a bling bling.....

105
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:25,238
She is...

106
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,751
Pan Da Yang's friend.
 Kang Eun Bi

107
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:31,436
Saint Honore's business strategy director...
What does she do?

108
00:07:31,436 --> 00:07:32,693
What was it?

109
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:37,232
Isn't it like being the president's right hand?

110
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:38,950
Really?

111
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,638
She probably makes good money.

112
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:43,967
Set me up with her.

113
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:46,418
As a night club waiter,

114
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:49,654
do you think it makes sense that your asking me to set you up at a cake shop?!

115
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:52,279
It's good for you too.

116
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,006
Saint Honore's president's...
And good for your cake.

117
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,185
Let me take a look at you.

118
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:02,325
It won't work today.

119
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:04,050
Talk to me again when you're ready.

120
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,148
I'm going.

121
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:07,503
Thank you, Seung Ji.

122
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:16,303
What is Seung Ji doing in there?

123
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:19,150
Those two are dating, right?

124
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,217
In your world, there are only two types of people; the ones who date, and the ones who don't.

125
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:28,270
Why are you like that every time I talk?

126
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,015
Are you going to get a job or not?

127
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:32,826
No, I don't want to.

128
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:38,059
It was only a few days ago when you came
 to Choi Won Il asking when you could start working.
So why don't you want to?

129
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:43,823
Choi Won Il is bad luck.
He looks down on our place.

130
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,581
Of course, it will seem like that to Choi Won Il.

131
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:52,678
Our mom and dad worked their
 whole lives to get this place.

132
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:55,864
So watch your mouth.

133
00:08:55,864 --> 00:09:00,866
Choi Won Il was born rich so he wouldn't understand what you mean.

134
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:05,757
I mean, he was trying to get rid of Seung Ji, and now he's trying to publish an article on him?

135
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:09,855
I'm doing well. You'll not be able to beat me.

136
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:12,785
Maybe Choi Won Il want to show that to Seung Ji oppa?

137
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:18,249
Or, you have to look good to me.
Your success depends on me.

138
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:24,999
Of course, I don't even have $800, and
 he bought a $8,000 massage chair for me.

139
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:31,245
You two will eat up Choi Won Il like that.

140
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:34,515
So honest!
Why don't you

141
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:37,363
keep up the good work?

142
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:42,881
Take this to Choi Won Il.

143
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:45,762
Don't open it.

144
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:49,722
Why would I open it? It has a sticker on it.

145
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,460
Keep it refrigerated?

146
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,864
No, keep it frozen.

147
00:09:52,864 --> 00:09:56,466
Why would you give a cake to Byun Bin Go?

148
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:57,828
Byun Bin Go? What's that?

149
00:09:57,828 --> 00:10:01,209
A sack full of poop, a potato pancake, and a turtle shell.

150
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,819
Byun Bin Go?

151
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:15,682
Ah! I want to eat Hedgehog hyung's cake...

152
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:21,655
When are you two going to make up? You guys have to make up so I can go eat his cakes and learn how to become a patissier...

153
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:24,739
You're going to learn from Ko Seung Ji and bake for Saint Honore?

154
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:27,110
I didn't think that far...

155
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,504
Then wouldn't Hedgehog hyung hate that?

156
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,782
I don't want to do anything that would upset him...

157
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:33,759
You're really...

158
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,943
That's mine, don't eat that.

159
00:10:37,943 --> 00:10:41,713
Why are you always here? Go to your own home!

160
00:10:41,713 --> 00:10:43,520
Hyung, is it okay or not okay for you to be that childish?

161
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,799
It's okay! It's okay so hurry up and leave!

162
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:48,444
Fine! I won't eat it! Happy?!

163
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:50,898
Seriously, that girl!

164
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:54,075
AISH!!!

165
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:03,358
 Did I know you for longer or did he know you for longer?

166
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:07,303
 You don't even know his past life! How can you just let him work for you like that?

167
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:10,558
 Do you not know how dangerous men are?

168
00:11:10,558 --> 00:11:12,834
 You didn't even recieve a resume from him, right?

169
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:15,783
 I bet you don't even know what he did before he started working for you, right?

170
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:19,804
 See? You're so careless!

171
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:33,948
Where are you going?

172
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:38,196
I'm going to see Seung Ji's tattoo more closely while he's asleep.

173
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:40,194
I want to come!

174
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:43,353
Oh yeah, my phone!

175
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:45,146
Why do you need your phone?

176
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:48,886
I'm gonna take a picture... I think he's gonna sleep naked...

177
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:49,892
What?

178
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:56,040
I'm gonna use that nude picture and threaten him that I'm gonna post it online if he doesn't listen to us.

179
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,100
She's so fearless.... Hey! Don't do that!

180
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,286
It's so stuffy!

181
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:22,162
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

182
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:26,317
Ko Seung Ji...

183
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:39,529
What are you doing?

184
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:44,824
I said what are you doing?

185
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:49,408
Unni wanted to look at your tattoo...

186
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:52,766
I wanted to take a nude picture to threaten you.

187
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:03,004
Show it to her, hurry.
She said she only saw the edge of a knife.

188
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:07,600
That's why you look scared.

189
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,230
And you ran screaming.

190
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:14,367
What kind of picture is it?

191
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:20,856
If you see it, you'll probably be so scared you'll faint.

192
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,247
After you fall asleep, we are going 
to take off your clothes to see it.

193
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:30,025
You guys are strange sisters, really!

194
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:33,283
What are you doing in a young man's bedroom?

195
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:38,508
What's that sound?

196
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:41,204
-Is it a robber?
-Huh?

197
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:43,875
Let's go.

198
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,001
Don't go!

199
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:46,201
Why?

200
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:50,334
It's dangerous here!

201
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:57,865
It's not the edge of a knife.

202
00:13:57,865 --> 00:13:59,346
What is it?

203
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:00,789
Ah..what is this?

204
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:03,109
It was just a porcupine!

205
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,894
I'm so scared, I'm going to faint.

206
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:20,057
Ah..seriously, I'm going to go crazy.

207
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:23,541
He put a lot of effort into the design.

208
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,210
Let's go to the police station and report it.

209
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,743
We need evidence that Gil Dong Goo did this.

210
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,535
Who else would do something this immature?

211
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:34,220
Would the police know that?

212
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,994
Even so, let's go to the police station.

213
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:39,508
Just get ready to go to the market.

214
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:49,768
Porcupine bread, and porcupine tires...

215
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:52,297
It's the porcupine attack.

216
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:55,863
You can joke about it because it's not you.

217
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:58,237
So let's go to the police station!

218
00:14:58,237 --> 00:15:00,304
Do you have somebody you like at the police station?

219
00:15:00,304 --> 00:15:02,803
Why do you keep singing 
"Police station, police station"?

220
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:05,669
Are the police crazy to come for things like this?

221
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:08,062
Then when are they dispatched?

222
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:10,322
If we get into fist fights, would they come then?

223
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:11,550
How would I know that?

224
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,835
Is it in my family register?

225
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:16,320
Where's Gil Dong Goo's house?

226
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,220
Am I Gil Dong Goo? How would I know that?

227
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,109
If I ever catch him...

228
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:22,854
Let's make him into a hedgehog.

229
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:27,215
A hedgehog like that.

230
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:30,041
Don't make me angry.

231
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:39,619
You're picky with things.

232
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:41,889
Do you have someone special?

233
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:43,788
There you go again.

234
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:47,740
Isn't it natural to want to know 
everything with our relationship?

235
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:50,160
Our relationship?

236
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,635
You said we're business partners.

237
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:55,553
I'm your partner on the same boat 
sharing the same fate.

238
00:15:55,553 --> 00:15:57,423
Two people in three relations.

239
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:01,155
One, Two! One, Two!

240
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:03,579
You're too young.

241
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:08,737
Mysterious...

242
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:10,549
What do you want to know?

243
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:12,979
This bright face

244
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:15,067
and your tattoo go well together?

245
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:18,280
You're worried that I might not
 see you as a woman?

246
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,711
Because you live alone, 
you might have stepped briefly 
into the dark world.

247
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:27,189
I just wanted to scare you.
Are you satisfied now?

248
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:32,047
Looking at the tattoo, it could be pretty scary.

249
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:37,878
That's why I shouldn't have gotten it from a cheap place.

250
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:41,746
What drawing did you ask for originally?

251
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:45,189
A flaming hedgehog.

252
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:50,402
Became the cutie burning with aegyo.

253
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,176
Omo omo (Oh my)

254
00:16:57,954 --> 00:16:59,434
Are you going to a wedding?

255
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:03,192
Seung Ji wants me to come.
He wants to show me a girl.

256
00:17:06,188 --> 00:17:08,314
Hello?
Yeah.

257
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:12,927
The suit suits you well. You look handsome.

258
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:15,097
Seung Ji said he'd get him a blind date.

259
00:17:15,097 --> 00:17:18,743
I'm going to meet Pan Da Yang's friend, a business director.

260
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:25,439
If you just want to play with 
someone's precious daughter, 
don't even start.

261
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,807
If I just wanted to play, 
would I be dressed in a suit
to get a blind date from Seung Ji?

262
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:32,865
They say don't even look at a 
tree that you can't climb.

263
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:36,477
Hey, they say there is no tree you 
can't conquer if you try 10 times.

264
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:38,751
The worst thing you can do is

265
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:42,198
hold a girl who doesn't want you hostage.

266
00:17:42,198 --> 00:17:44,296
Remember that.

267
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:49,010
Hey, what's that?

268
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,881
Did I do something wrong?

269
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:55,976
Did something happen while the 
President was getting flour?

270
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:58,972
He did that to me.

271
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,147
Dad.

272
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:15,838
Aigoo... Dad, dad. Don't make this anymore.

273
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:18,778
It doesn't sell at all! It's a big minus!

274
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:20,266
Wasn't there an error with the sales figures?

275
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:25,657
Ah... Yeah right. Would that expensive 
manager make that mistake?

276
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:34,177
-Have some coffee.
-Thank you.

277
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:43,064
They said to give it to you.

278
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:44,059
Da Yang?

279
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:47,687
No, Hedgehog.

280
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:50,238
Ko Seung Ji.

281
00:18:53,652 --> 00:18:58,465
It was kept frozen as I was told.

282
00:19:06,642 --> 00:19:10,864
Is it a cake bribe?

283
00:19:35,785 --> 00:19:39,105
Can't you do your work right?!

284
00:19:39,105 --> 00:19:43,084
You said you handled all the 
difficult sales at the hotel.

285
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:46,143
You said you always surpassed the daily goals.

286
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,629
If you get paid a lot, shouldn't you work that hard?

287
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:52,631
I'm trying hard to convince the customers, 
but their responses were...

288
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:55,957
Oh, so "it's not my fault, it's yours"?

289
00:19:55,957 --> 00:20:02,588
-That's not what I mean. 
-If not, explain using your marketing terms then.

290
00:20:02,588 --> 00:20:06,361
It's included in your salary.

291
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:08,047
Hurry!

292
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:10,729
I can't hear you! Louder!

293
00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:17,024
This cake is targeting it's sales for foreign students who are back home on their breaks and...

294
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:18,133
So?

295
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:22,556
I think the taste and the design 
don't follow today's trend.

296
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:25,494
So? The solution is?

297
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:34,061
We need to use more expensive ingredients,
 and give designing responsibilities to 
a patissier who understands young tastes.

298
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:37,203
Get out. Can't you hear me?

299
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:37,725
President...

300
00:20:37,725 --> 00:20:40,767
Who told you to call me president?

301
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,866
How dare you look straight back at me?

302
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:48,326
Move. This isn't somewhere you can interfere!

303
00:20:48,326 --> 00:20:50,237
Why don't you go to the conference room?

304
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:52,458
You. Didn't you hear me say get out??

305
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,570
Why don't you stop it now!

306
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,850
Did they teach you in America
 for the president to give
orders to the director?!

307
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,503
Dad. Stop. Stop it!

308
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:03,764
Stop it!

309
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,400
Stop it?

310
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,213
Should I show you what would happen to this place if I wasn't around?

311
00:21:09,213 --> 00:21:13,356
Who told you to quit? 
We can make ends meet without you.

312
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:17,227
Say that you're sorry to your father.
Beg for his forgiveness. Hurry!

313
00:21:17,227 --> 00:21:19,011
Can't you apologize?

314
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,910
How could you talk to your father so rudely?

315
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,523
Hurry, beg, beg. Beg!

316
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,712
A director meeting will be held soon.

317
00:21:28,712 --> 00:21:32,517
Both of you make sure you attend it.

318
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:34,784
Hey!

319
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:41,324
You, really! Why did you have to make 
him so mad and get us into this situation?!

320
00:21:41,324 --> 00:21:44,041
My gosh!

321
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:54,005
Why don't we go get some air?

322
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:55,263
How about the manager?

323
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:58,046
I sent her home today so she can get some rest.

324
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:01,227
How could mom be with that kind of man...?

325
00:22:05,977 --> 00:22:09,044
Panda Cafe..?

326
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:11,824
Oh! It's money!

327
00:22:12,784 --> 00:22:14,608
Give it here!

328
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:15,514
What is this?

329
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:19,316
Director Kang brought these samples.

330
00:22:19,316 --> 00:22:20,909
Is this an embezzlement?

331
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:22,554
What do you mean, an embezzlement?

332
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:25,146
Business Strategy is not in charge of the funds.

333
00:22:25,146 --> 00:22:27,336
It's nonsense.

334
00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:30,516
Director Kang, you went during a very bad time.

335
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,089
I'm very sensitive with money.

336
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:36,950
This isn't money. It's color copying (fake).

337
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,098
Then why was President Choi holding that?

338
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:44,933
He was probably on his way to a patissier.

339
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:47,185
Who's that patissier?

340
00:22:47,185 --> 00:22:50,307
What flavor is the money?

341
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:56,444
Manager said get a new patissier.

342
00:22:56,444 --> 00:23:00,420
Choi Won Il is on his way to meet a patissier...

343
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,203
What are you doing?

344
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:10,672
I have to return it.

345
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:14,346
If not, I'll be reported, and if the director 
says to look for it,

346
00:23:14,346 --> 00:23:16,166
then we'll just get tired.

347
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:18,857
I'll go out.

348
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:26,157
What are you doing!?

349
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:29,053
Just in case you get mad, you can't have high blood pressure!

350
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:29,810
Here. It's cool.

351
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,691
Get this out of my face!

352
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:33,557
Why are you getting mad at me!?

353
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:35,976
Was it me that picked the manager? No. It was you.

354
00:23:35,976 --> 00:23:38,621
Do you think this is because of the manager?

355
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:41,486
Then what!...Ohh...

356
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,545
Ah, is it because Won Il wants to have the meeting?

357
00:23:44,545 --> 00:23:47,416
Because you might be replaced by Won ll?

358
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:50,969
He is advertising for me to get get fired, that kid!

359
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:53,188
In front of all the employees!

360
00:23:53,188 --> 00:23:55,383
You, too really...

361
00:23:57,261 --> 00:24:01,548
Aigoo, honey, it's funny childish talk. 
Why are you being like that?

362
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:03,202
Contact Kwon Yoo Jin.

363
00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:05,052
Tell him to come to Korea.

364
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:05,913
Who?

365
00:24:05,913 --> 00:24:07,736
Won Il gets 45%.

366
00:24:07,736 --> 00:24:13,063
You get 25% and I get 20%. 
So together we get 45% like Won Il.

367
00:24:13,063 --> 00:24:14,173
So,

368
00:24:14,173 --> 00:24:18,726
she has to give us 10% she got from her father.

369
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:20,599
Why did Won Il's father share the stock

370
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:25,105
to a patissier and make it complicated?

371
00:24:25,105 --> 00:24:29,934
Does she have to come back for that?

372
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:31,607
What?

373
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:33,432
Do you want to be

374
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:35,409
on Won Il's side right now?

375
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:36,435
Ah...

376
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:38,244
Director!

377
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:39,872
I have something to tell you.

378
00:24:39,872 --> 00:24:41,187
What is it?

379
00:24:41,187 --> 00:24:43,649
It pertains to the president and the manager.

380
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,738
Go ahead. Say it.

381
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:47,828
That is...What you thought was right.

382
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:50,185
That's why he treated you...

383
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:52,871
How long has he been back from America?

384
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:55,712
He's good.

385
00:24:55,712 --> 00:24:58,492
How did I raise him?
 For him to be with that kind of girl.

386
00:24:58,492 --> 00:25:00,925
This kid, I want to immediately...

387
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:02,143
Aigoo. Aigoo, my legs...

388
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:04,834
My head, my head...aigoo...

389
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:18,782
Why are you dressed like that to put that on?

390
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:22,650
Ah, do you think I got dressed up to do this?

391
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,129
Alright.

392
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:26,420
You have a wild temper.

393
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,012
I like men who have a wild temper.

394
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:33,121
What are you doing?!
It's scary!

395
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:40,546
Oh, she's coming.

396
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:42,880
Who is?

397
00:26:15,286 --> 00:26:17,756
If you do it like this, the spikes come out.

398
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:21,515
I am good at elaborate works. Trust me.

399
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:28,388
What are you doing?

400
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:30,391
My hands won't work the way I want them to.

401
00:26:30,391 --> 00:26:32,635
So, what are you doing?

402
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:35,184
Hey, Seung Ji, hurry! Hurry!

403
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:37,844
Who is she?

404
00:26:37,844 --> 00:26:40,493
What are you doing at this hour?

405
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:43,155
Is there a quiet place where we can talk?

406
00:26:48,304 --> 00:26:49,499
You scared me!

407
00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:52,389
Tell me, you wench!

408
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:53,534
About what?

409
00:26:53,534 --> 00:26:57,150
Won Il and the manager are dating, right?

410
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,044
Who told you such a crazy thing?

411
00:26:59,044 --> 00:27:00,593
Jang Su Seok did!

412
00:27:00,593 --> 00:27:02,314
He's out of his mind.

413
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:07,736
Mom, if hyung and manager are dating, then you don't  ever have to give me even a cent for the rest of my life!

414
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:09,130
I see.

415
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,691
Then, they really are not dating?

416
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:14,803
That's what I said.
 You really don't know your son.

417
00:27:14,803 --> 00:27:16,028
Of course.

418
00:27:16,028 --> 00:27:17,973
My son is not ordinary.

419
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:21,135
Hey, hey. Hey!

420
00:27:21,135 --> 00:27:22,808
What brings you to read a book?

421
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,557
Yeah, I'm going to be a patissier.

422
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:28,505
What? Aigoo, my daughter is wonderful!

423
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:30,466
You finally grew up!

424
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:32,134
Do you want Mom to do anything for you?

425
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:34,003
Money?

426
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:35,724
Credit card?

427
00:27:35,724 --> 00:27:37,667
Car?

428
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:41,173
That sounds banal. Anything awesome?

429
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:48,256
Something awesome for our future Saint Honore's patissier,

430
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,296
how about shares?

431
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,648
Shares?
Yeah.

432
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:56,143
Give to me.

433
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:58,398
Alright. 10%.

434
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,232
What's this Mom?
Your daughter has made an official decision, 
but you're just fooling around.

435
00:28:03,232 --> 00:28:05,429
Give it to me officially! Officially!

436
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,075
Wait.

437
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:13,637
Instead of having a difficult situation 
between the two men...

438
00:28:15,878 --> 00:28:18,349
What?

439
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:20,070
Do you know more?

440
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,473
It's not the patissier the manager knows.

441
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:25,436
Won Il,

442
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:27,088
seems to have rejected them.

443
00:28:27,978 --> 00:28:33,610
Such a young kid knows how
 to play the game, money, and women.

444
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,662
He is shooting his own foot.

445
00:28:35,662 --> 00:28:38,568
So, you don't need to worry about the director meeting.

446
00:28:38,568 --> 00:28:40,689
I'm going to be out for a few days, so

447
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:42,459
just leave the manager as is,

448
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:45,408
find out who the patissier is.

449
00:28:45,408 --> 00:28:49,215
Yes, I understand.

450
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:51,210
What kind of person...

451
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,859
Would dare to take my place?

452
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:01,399
The massage chair fee?

453
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:04,471
Why is Seung Ji giving it to him?
It was given to Da Yang.

454
00:29:04,471 --> 00:29:07,416
If I need to spend money on anything,
Seung Ji will pay for me first.

455
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:09,197
I promised to give half later.

456
00:29:09,197 --> 00:29:10,657
Who said half?

457
00:29:10,657 --> 00:29:12,753
Wasn't it?

458
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:14,266
Are you two.... dating?

459
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:15,904
What do you mean, dating??

460
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,345
Your lips are matching.

461
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:19,869
Why are you like that?

462
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:23,129
Anyway, I can't bring him that money for now.

463
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:26,073
Even the direct delivery is off limits.

464
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,406
Choi Won Il is mad.

465
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:30,768
It's not that...

466
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:36,032
Something happened at the company.
So I need to protect Choi Won Il.

467
00:29:36,032 --> 00:29:37,730
What happened?

468
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,555
 Director vs. the president.

469
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:48,306
 The war between the father and the son.

470
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,777
War?

471
00:29:54,777 --> 00:29:58,321
Director is upset because the new product sales are ground zero.

472
00:29:58,321 --> 00:30:00,217
The manager stopped him,

473
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:02,173
Choi Won Il said,

474
00:30:02,173 --> 00:30:03,656
"Stop it!"

475
00:30:03,656 --> 00:30:06,095
"Please attend the director meeting!"

476
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,699
In front of all the employees.

477
00:30:09,302 --> 00:30:11,889
Why did he do that to his dad?

478
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:14,389
He's not his real father.

479
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:15,620
Oh right.

480
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,978
Won Il's dad passed away when he was in 1st grade.

481
00:30:19,978 --> 00:30:21,812
I didn't know he had a new father.

482
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:24,208
How long has it been since he had one?

483
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:27,166
Since Won Yi is 21,

484
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:28,707
it's already been 20 years.

485
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:30,693
But he still hates him?

486
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:32,607
He doesn't even call him Dad.

487
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:35,824
He doesn't properly address him when he calls him Director.

488
00:30:37,473 --> 00:30:40,178
There's a venomous side to him.

489
00:30:40,178 --> 00:30:41,629
But...

490
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:45,031
What did he mean when he told them to attend the director meeting?

491
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:48,778
Choi Won Il has the most stocks in Saint Honore.

492
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:53,571
That means, if Choi Won Il gets mad, he can fire the Director.

493
00:30:53,571 --> 00:30:57,147
He gave a warning today. 
If he needs to,

494
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,405
he'll fire him.

495
00:30:58,405 --> 00:31:00,653
No way... would he actually fire him?

496
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:02,885
It's not "no way"!!

497
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:04,955
The employees that have been there for a long time said

498
00:31:04,955 --> 00:31:09,067
the reason why Choi Won Il refused all the recruitments, 
and came back was to

499
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,339
to bury the director.

500
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,294
Why is he going that far?

501
00:31:15,294 --> 00:31:17,060
Does he have deep grudges?

502
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,304
Starting from 8, for 20 years,

503
00:31:20,304 --> 00:31:21,788
he's been determined to

504
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:23,936
take the long awaited revenge.

505
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:35,195
Oppa! I made all the hedgehogs!

506
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:48,027
Ki Tae left it unfinished, so I got it done. Isn't that great?

507
00:31:52,887 --> 00:31:54,617
Where are you going?

508
00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:02,416
Why's he like that?

509
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:03,975
You came?

510
00:32:03,975 --> 00:32:06,825
Why is hedgehog like that? 
He looks like he's out of himself.

511
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,011
I don't know.

512
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,089
That's why I'm going to follow him.

513
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,073
Oh, hurry and go then.

514
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:22,929
You can't consider it as mere money.

515
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:24,889
What is it if it's not just money?

516
00:32:24,889 --> 00:32:26,840
It's the heart, the heart.

517
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,069
Fondness, affection,

518
00:32:29,069 --> 00:32:30,518
love.

519
00:32:32,377 --> 00:32:33,857
Are you going to keep being like that?

520
00:32:33,857 --> 00:32:36,259
When would you ever get mature?

521
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:40,015
Do you think a man will spend money for a woman whom he doesn't even have crush on?

522
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:45,315
We're just business partners.

523
00:32:45,315 --> 00:32:47,683
He'll partner with someone he doesn't even like?

524
00:32:47,683 --> 00:32:50,435
He could have left a long time ago with his skills.

525
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,466
If others were to see his cake,

526
00:32:52,466 --> 00:32:57,945
they would pay a lot more than you did to partner with him.

527
00:32:57,945 --> 00:33:00,933
Then this place must be more comfortable than other places.

528
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:02,226
What's comfortable about it?

529
00:33:02,226 --> 00:33:03,697
This stuffy room?

530
00:33:03,697 --> 00:33:05,602
It's all wasteful.

531
00:33:05,602 --> 00:33:08,337
He's here because he likes you!!

532
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:11,664
Hedgehog is 2 years younger than us.

533
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:15,376
He's 2 years younger, not 2 years old!

534
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:18,798
Do you live in a country where a man 
would be taken away if he likes an older woman?

535
00:33:20,424 --> 00:33:23,358
He just feels sorry for me.

536
00:33:23,358 --> 00:33:26,956
He considers it as a charity work to help me with my bank account.

537
00:33:26,956 --> 00:33:30,913
He'll die of having pity on someone with a negative bank account balance, if he has pity on you.

538
00:33:30,913 --> 00:33:33,014
Of course, more for women in debt.

539
00:33:33,014 --> 00:33:35,274
Are you talking about me right now?

540
00:33:35,274 --> 00:33:36,843
No, Aunt.

541
00:33:36,843 --> 00:33:39,170
You talked about women in debt.

542
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,435
You are always upset with me...

543
00:33:42,474 --> 00:33:45,271
I'll leave. I came here when I was working.

544
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:46,306
Go well.

545
00:33:46,306 --> 00:33:48,110
Have a good time.

546
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,682
When can I have a good time 
when I'm in so much in debt?

547
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:58,483
What kind of smell is this?

548
00:34:00,553 --> 00:34:04,235
Hedgehog treats you all so well.

549
00:34:04,235 --> 00:34:06,600
But I don't think this is appropriate...

550
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:09,379
What?
Wallpaper?

551
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:12,338
But, I even put up the CCTV..

552
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:16,061
And I even changed the tire.
Wallpaper is a little bit too much...

553
00:34:16,061 --> 00:34:18,920
You gotta work to lose weight.

554
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:22,434
Let's do it together then.

555
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:23,944
Aigo, aigo..

556
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:28,831
Should I have made it in a cupcake shape?

557
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:31,528
It might get better attention...

558
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:35,294
Tell Seung Ji to do that. When it comes to drawing, Seung Ji...

559
00:34:35,294 --> 00:34:37,370
Oh, Seung Ji!

560
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:47,860

561
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:54,605
What's the matter?

562
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:57,122
Did you make mistakes on the blind date?

563
00:34:57,122 --> 00:35:00,058
What do you mean, blind date? We couldn't even start.

564
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:02,157
Because he was suddenly like that.

565
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:19,371
Why did you come here instead of working? Did you fight?

566
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:20,951
No. Fighting? Who's fighting?

567
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:25,165
You didn't get rejected like last time, right?!

568
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,446
You sure use that word "rejected" quite often..

569
00:35:28,446 --> 00:35:29,468
Did you get rejected?

570
00:35:29,468 --> 00:35:30,787
I didn't get rejected!

571
00:35:30,787 --> 00:35:33,603
Then why is your face like that?

572
00:35:33,603 --> 00:35:37,717
Because it's absurd. I must've gotten confused.

573
00:35:37,717 --> 00:35:40,014
I looked at the wrong guy.

574
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:42,656
He wasn't the enemy's son.

575
00:35:42,656 --> 00:35:44,775
Tell me in a way I can understand!!

576
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:48,397
Saint Honore's son!

577
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:49,758
Pan Da Yang's friend!

578
00:35:49,758 --> 00:35:52,334
The tall one?

579
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:53,635
How do you know?

580
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:56,867
I see him sometimes.

581
00:35:56,867 --> 00:36:03,351
He became the president so he can drive out the director. He held a grudge for 20 years.

582
00:36:03,351 --> 00:36:06,839
I was told he wasn't his real father..

583
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:11,689
He must be just as angry as I am.

584
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:15,723
It's not his real dad so he's trying to win the company...

585
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:21,888
I can't just take revenge like that...

586
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:27,266
That's why Panda is like that too.

587
00:36:27,607 --> 00:36:33,978
If you can't say it.. Should I go say it?

588
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:34,416
What?

589
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:38,755
If you need money, it's not a problem. I'll give it to you.

590
00:36:38,755 --> 00:36:41,475
And I'll go and talk to Panda.

591
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:44,559
That's not what I'm saying.

592
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,275
Then, what is it?!

593
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:49,890
What should I do?? Should I hold hands with him?

594
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:56,330
Or, if he fires the President, I'll miss my revenge opportunity. Do I block him?

595
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,850
Or put them together, and use him?

596
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:08,404
It's a good opportunity for you.

597
00:37:08,404 --> 00:37:13,566
You should just let go of it and start a new life.

598
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:20,105
Until when are you going to keep that face and destroy your life?

599
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:25,952
Just live a happy life and forget the rest.

600
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:29,553
That's the only way for you to be happy.

601
00:37:37,649 --> 00:37:43,376
If that man disappears, would Mom be unhappy?

602
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:47,217
And would Won II be pitiful if that man disappeared?

603
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:54,101
The stuff you want to do, is it something you should be doing?

604
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:58,601
What does that mean?

605
00:37:58,601 --> 00:38:02,138
Ahhh! I want to see Ko Seung Ji!

606
00:38:02,138 --> 00:38:04,886
Why does Ko Seung Ji suddenly come out?!

607
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:07,649
Keep calm and carry on.

608
00:38:07,649 --> 00:38:11,123
When I was about to tell you that, I just thought of him.

609
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:18,141
Hyung! I'm serious. I'm thinking whether or not I should fire him.

610
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:21,352
We shouldn't be like this and go to Ko Seung Ji.

611
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,326
What?!
Hey, don't you want to see him?

612
00:38:24,326 --> 00:38:25,943
I want to see him.

613
00:38:25,943 --> 00:38:31,173
The chair I bought for Da Yang he paid it back as a cupcake!

614
00:38:31,173 --> 00:38:31,654
Oh...

615
00:38:31,654 --> 00:38:34,445
Is he Da Yang's boyfriend or is Da Yang his girlfriend?

616
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,761
Why is he interfering?

617
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:39,562
I just wanted to send cake then.

618
00:38:39,562 --> 00:38:41,526
Hey, let's look at that.

619
00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:42,669
I don't have it.

620
00:38:42,669 --> 00:38:43,770
Did you eat it all?!

621
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,589
How can you eat that?

622
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:48,448
I got a text from Kang Eun Bi saying that she returned it.

623
00:38:48,448 --> 00:38:51,367
Ay... you should've at least taken a picture!

624
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:54,319
Hyung, I'm not in the mood to joke around.

625
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:58,948
The moment I mentioned Ko Seung Ji, your mood just went up.

626
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:03,288
Hey, why are you yelling here?

627
00:39:03,288 --> 00:39:05,904
Go against him and have a fight! You don't feel good right now anyway.

628
00:39:05,904 --> 00:39:08,402
Seriously?!

629
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:28,536
You came. Where did you go?

630
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:30,108
This is my room.

631
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:33,020
All of a sudden your mood just went down and you left...

632
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,691
Shouldn't you knock before going into someone else's room?

633
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:39,923
I put the massage chair money in the drawer.

634
00:39:39,923 --> 00:39:44,283
I told you to knock before entering a man's room.

635
00:39:44,283 --> 00:39:46,651
You have tattoos in other places too, right?

636
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,970
I told you to knock, so why are you talking about tattoos?

637
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,690
You're telling me to knock because you have more tattoos, right?

638
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,670
Let me see.

639
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,367
See what??

640
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:57,577
I don't have it!

641
00:39:57,577 --> 00:40:03,510
If you go out with no word and don't accept my call, I'm going to deduct 10% of your pay!

642
00:40:04,718 --> 00:40:07,180
You should give me my pay first and say that.

643
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:11,794
How can I give it to you, when I don't even have any money for myself?

644
00:40:11,794 --> 00:40:14,910
Hmph. You're getting senseless as you go on.

645
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:19,066
I told you when I have money I'll give it to you.

646
00:40:20,223 --> 00:40:24,238
Why did you change this room? What was wrong with it?

647
00:40:24,238 --> 00:40:29,268
Aunt said, "What kind of hedgehog room is this??"
And then, "step step step".

648
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:32,819
So we just changed everything.

649
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:35,447
She has skills.

650
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:40,645
Aunt was really unhappy with the room first.

651
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:44,473
The wall color is pretty, right? 
 I chose it.

652
00:40:53,924 --> 00:40:57,153
This is obviously Pan Da Yang's work.

653
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,855
This is really great!

654
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:10,410
 What's so pretty about him that you're giving him cake? To Byung Bin Guh?

655
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,687
 What's Byun Bin Guh?

656
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:14,301
 It's someone who's perverted!

657
00:41:38,578 --> 00:41:42,248
 Maculinea teleius

658
00:41:42,248 --> 00:41:45,721
 Aspidomorpha transparipennis

659
00:41:45,721 --> 00:41:48,807
 Rhyssa persuasoria

660
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:53,803
 Homotropus tarsatorius

661
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:08,360
This is really driving me nuts.

662
00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:12,523
Hey, Gil Dong Goo!

663
00:42:12,523 --> 00:42:14,657
Aish, you scared me.

664
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:22,100
What's wrong with you?
I won't stay still!

665
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,696
If you're not going to stay still, are you going to call the police?

666
00:42:24,696 --> 00:42:27,172
Why the police for a woman like you?

667
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:30,529
Do you think you can get what you want?!

668
00:42:30,529 --> 00:42:34,005
Hedgehog bread, Hedgehog tire! He's collecting evidence, so

669
00:42:34,005 --> 00:42:36,489
be careful!

670
00:42:37,568 --> 00:42:43,023
Don't lie. That thing wasn't there when I...

671
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:49,470
Oh look.

672
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,647
Ya, ya, ya!

673
00:42:51,647 --> 00:42:54,745
Ya, ya, ya! Gil Dong Goo!

674
00:42:56,772 --> 00:42:58,823
Unni!

675
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:00,450
Unni, are you exercising?

676
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,401
No. Today is a special day so I didn't go.

677
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:06,386
Gil Dong Goo came here and ran away again.

678
00:43:06,386 --> 00:43:08,349
Again?!

679
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:10,493
It's a good thing we installed the CCTV.

680
00:43:10,493 --> 00:43:14,178
Hey, hedgehog makes awesome cakes.

681
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:17,144
It's really great.

682
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:19,419
Oh!

683
00:43:19,419 --> 00:43:20,571
Oh!

684
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:30,487
Wah! They're awesome!

685
00:43:30,487 --> 00:43:32,534
Hedgehog and turtle.

686
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:35,205
Panda, does he like them?

687
00:43:35,205 --> 00:43:37,628
Oh! Looks like it is.

688
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,647
AHH!!

689
00:43:44,647 --> 00:43:46,824
What?!

690
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,010
Because you're cute.

691
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:51,445
What a strange girl.
Coming into a man's room like that.

692
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:53,188
It's morning!
Get up.

693
00:43:53,188 --> 00:43:55,750
Because of the glow-in-the-dark stickers, I couldn't sleep!

694
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:58,701
You're nice, Hedgehog.

695
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:03,036
You didn't sleep because you were making a cake for Won Il.

696
00:44:04,361 --> 00:44:06,116
It's really because of the wallpaper.

697
00:44:06,116 --> 00:44:09,093
Do you want to see it at night? It's literally a night club!

698
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:11,637
Oh yeah~ Free night club!

699
00:44:11,637 --> 00:44:13,876
I'll be the customer, and you be the waiter.

700
00:44:13,876 --> 00:44:15,790
Wait-

701
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:18,372
Tell Kang Eun Bi to come.

702
00:44:18,372 --> 00:44:20,235
Tell her to come to the night club?

703
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,367
Don't tell me..
You've fallen for Eun Bi?

704
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:31,744
So I'm right!
You like Eun Bi, right?

705
00:44:31,744 --> 00:44:35,305
Did you fall for her a first sight? How much do you like her??

706
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:38,593
Ah! No wonder you made
a special cake for Eun Bi!

707
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,302
Tell me! Hurry!

708
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:40,805
Stop it.

709
00:44:40,805 --> 00:44:42,349
Hurry!

710
00:44:48,247 --> 00:44:50,461
What are you doing?

711
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,610
Ah, the smell.

712
00:44:55,907 --> 00:45:00,506
How can you still use this smelly blanket?

713
00:45:00,506 --> 00:45:05,883
I can't buy a new blanket, why?

714
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:08,878
Are you sorry?

715
00:45:08,878 --> 00:45:10,974
You have an eye booger.

716
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,646
I think you have to go...

717
00:45:23,646 --> 00:45:26,261
Da Yang ssi!

718
00:45:26,261 --> 00:45:29,408
Oh, hello!

719
00:45:29,408 --> 00:45:31,176
Grandfather came to shop too?

720
00:45:31,176 --> 00:45:36,800
He wanted to buy Seung Ji a suit. 
So that he can work at his 
new working place with a new heart.

721
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,322
I came here to buy Seung Ji's pillow and blanket.

722
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:41,585
He has those at home, I could've brought them!

723
00:45:41,585 --> 00:45:46,798
No it's okay. Since he's working for me, I have to do this much at least.

724
00:45:46,798 --> 00:45:50,849
Hey, she's giving him a living expense!

725
00:45:57,284 --> 00:46:00,193
This is art!!

726
00:46:00,193 --> 00:46:03,525
Thanks to Ko Seung Ji we eat a lot of delicious cakes, right?

727
00:46:03,525 --> 00:46:06,480
How do you have such great skills??

728
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,239
What kind of cake do you like?

729
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:10,530
Why? You're going to make me one?

730
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:15,327
Well, you made me a wallpaper.
And I realized I didn't give you a proper hello.

731
00:46:15,327 --> 00:46:18,998
What nonsense. So then I'll have a big bow to you!

732
00:46:18,998 --> 00:46:25,790
You're so great to our Pan Da that even if I do it everyday I won't pay it back.

733
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:28,073
What is interest rate?

734
00:46:28,073 --> 00:46:32,454
It's how much money we use and there are a lot of kinds.

735
00:46:32,454 --> 00:46:35,742
Perhaps, what's your interest rate?

736
00:46:35,742 --> 00:46:39,096
48%

737
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:43,079
Why? Cause it's sad?

738
00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:50,304
Ja, the VIP has arrived.

739
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,867
I didn't even get hired. Why'd you buy me a suit when you don't have any money?

740
00:46:53,867 --> 00:46:56,580
I'm just telling you to work in a new suit with a new heart.

741
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,946
Does that make any sense? How could I make a cake in a suit?!

742
00:46:59,946 --> 00:47:04,556
That Choi  Won II or whatever is wearing a suit!

743
00:47:04,896 --> 00:47:07,983
What does Choi Il wearing a suit have anything to do with me?

744
00:47:07,983 --> 00:47:10,497
Saying not to get revenge on Saint Honore...You want me to?!

745
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:14,857
Who said anything about revenge? What I meant is getting dumped.

746
00:47:14,857 --> 00:47:17,458
I've already told you. Pan Da Yang is not my girlfriend!

747
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:20,249
She's not your girlfriend, but she buys you that?

748
00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:22,850
No, she flipped my blanket and couldn't breathe.

749
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:25,125
She's not your girlfriend, but why would she flip it?

750
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:26,437
We were fooling around and it got flipped.

751
00:47:26,437 --> 00:47:29,497
She's not your girlfriend, but why did you fool around and have the blanket flip??

752
00:47:29,497 --> 00:47:32,242
She has no idea! She just comes in out of nowhere.

753
00:47:32,242 --> 00:47:36,072
You! Why do you not know women well?

754
00:47:36,072 --> 00:47:39,114
That means you like her!

755
00:47:39,114 --> 00:47:41,786
I'm going to go crazy because of you Grandpa!

756
00:47:41,786 --> 00:47:44,609
What does that have to do with me?

757
00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:48,762
I'm worrying for nothing, you idiot.

758
00:47:48,762 --> 00:47:51,503
Stop it...

759
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:55,723
Come out already! They're waiting!

760
00:47:55,723 --> 00:47:57,210
Who's waiting?

761
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:59,057
Your girlfriend of course! Who else would?

762
00:47:59,057 --> 00:48:01,192
Grandpa!

763
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:04,793
Just come out already.

764
00:48:10,493 --> 00:48:12,921
He's out! He's out!

765
00:48:17,245 --> 00:48:19,288
You look cool!

766
00:48:19,288 --> 00:48:22,364
Put your hand down and stand up straight.

767
00:48:22,364 --> 00:48:27,980
How pretty!! Since you look like that, you look like a new husband!

768
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,158
What do you think Da Yang?

769
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,297
Does he look better than before?

770
00:48:33,297 --> 00:48:36,408
Than before?

771
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:39,656
He looks good! He looks good!

772
00:48:44,935 --> 00:48:49,897

773
00:48:55,681 --> 00:48:59,579
So loud, is this all you can come up with?

774
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:02,867
Why are you doing this job now?

775
00:49:02,867 --> 00:49:06,898
It's my problem now.

776
00:49:06,898 --> 00:49:12,050
Are you here to protect Saint Honore or ruin it?

777
00:49:12,785 --> 00:49:15,589
Why aren't you answering?

778
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:21,532
Do you really think I would ruin Saint Honore? The Saint Honore that Great Grandfather had built?

779
00:49:21,532 --> 00:49:26,330
Saint Honore being like this now is not because of Choi Won Il.

780
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:31,574
It's because of your husband.
Don't misunderstand please.

781
00:49:31,574 --> 00:49:37,240
Son. Because of you, father has been very upset. He's been gone for 3 days now.

782
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,296
Son, you should stop now. Hmm?

783
00:49:40,296 --> 00:49:43,941
Is it my problem if he doesn't come to work?

784
00:49:43,941 --> 00:49:47,793
Do you really want to see your mother cry?! 
What's wrong with you, son?

785
00:49:47,793 --> 00:49:50,066
It's better off to just stay at the office.

786
00:49:50,066 --> 00:49:52,543
Just stay.

787
00:49:52,543 --> 00:49:56,416
Ugh, who is it?!

788
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:58,320
What's so bad about answering it later...

789
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,455
She always calls at times like these.

790
00:50:01,455 --> 00:50:03,382
What!

791
00:50:03,382 --> 00:50:07,418
What do you want now?

792
00:50:07,418 --> 00:50:11,747
It's that all you can come up with now?

793
00:50:11,747 --> 00:50:14,721
It's not time for that, why cry...

794
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:18,641
I have no time to eat Hedgehog's cake!

795
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:22,678
This time it's not Father. It's Mother--

796
00:50:22,678 --> 00:50:25,720
That's right. It's a war!

797
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:37,278
Eun Bi and Won ll can't make it.

798
00:50:37,278 --> 00:50:38,791
There's a war.
With the President?

799
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:43,116
No. Today it's with his mother.

800
00:50:48,108 --> 00:50:50,978
That...that one. Ugh, whatever. Just pack it all.

801
00:50:50,978 --> 00:50:52,520
You're going to eat that all?!

802
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,979
President said to bring them.

803
00:50:54,979 --> 00:50:57,561
Why? Does the cake taste bad?

804
00:50:57,561 --> 00:51:01,734
Just go back to what you were doing.

805
00:51:02,588 --> 00:51:05,274
Carefully...

806
00:51:05,788 --> 00:51:10,286
President, it's me. I think it's best if you come back in now.

807
00:51:10,286 --> 00:51:16,494
No it's not just that, Choi Won Il doesn't know what to do with the cakes...

808
00:51:16,494 --> 00:51:20,453
Yes. Yes. Come back soon.

809
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:37,044
Are you checking if Eun Bi is coming?

810
00:51:37,044 --> 00:51:40,401
I already said no, it's getting annoying.

811
00:51:40,401 --> 00:51:43,187
Then... are you waiting for Won ll?

812
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:46,133
Why would I wait for him!?

813
00:51:46,133 --> 00:51:48,524
Because Hedgehog is nice.

814
00:51:48,524 --> 00:51:51,883
I'm not nice at all.

815
00:51:57,788 --> 00:52:03,117
Should I call Won ll and say that Hedgehog wants you to come?

816
00:52:04,025 --> 00:52:08,336
If you miss him, just tell him that you miss him, instead of using me as an excuse!

817
00:52:10,647 --> 00:52:16,090
Since when did I say I miss Won Il?? When Won Il is stuck in your heart!

818
00:52:29,366 --> 00:52:32,674
I told Won ll--

819
00:52:34,408 --> 00:52:39,421
Wow... that's killer!

820
00:52:40,529 --> 00:52:46,642
Keep looking at it. Whether it's killer or killing you mentally.

821
00:52:46,642 --> 00:52:49,562
It reminds me of my childhood.

822
00:52:49,562 --> 00:52:53,086
Let's endure although it's crazy.

823
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,627
Just in case it reminds you of your childhood.

824
00:52:57,296 --> 00:53:03,581
Are you frustrated because you can't remember your childhood?

825
00:53:05,918 --> 00:53:07,797
Nope.

826
00:53:07,797 --> 00:53:11,390
Then why are you sighing?

827
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:17,241
Because I don't know what will happen. It's frustrating.

828
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:19,183
What do you mean?

829
00:53:19,183 --> 00:53:23,576
The prickles are coming out.

830
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,764
Why?

831
00:53:26,764 --> 00:53:33,031
If Hedgehog's prickles come out, then won't you become nude?

832
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:43,895
Hedgehog made this for you. Hurry up and come eat it.

833
00:53:51,859 --> 00:53:54,311
What is it?

834
00:53:54,311 --> 00:53:56,147
Go buy these tomorrow.

835
00:53:56,147 --> 00:53:59,183
So cute!

836
00:53:59,183 --> 00:54:03,685
That turned out good. After I was finished reading, I was going to go meet Hedgehog.

837
00:54:03,685 --> 00:54:07,882
Wow... He's really good!

838
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:14,038
Would anyone eat these when they're so pretty?

839
00:54:14,038 --> 00:54:19,462
You are amazing. And this hedgehog macaroon slowly melts in my mouth!

840
00:54:19,462 --> 00:54:22,087
At this point, you'll eat everything by the time you have to go home.

841
00:54:22,087 --> 00:54:25,316
That's why I'm already eating so much.

842
00:54:25,316 --> 00:54:30,211
Accept me as your disciple, Hyungnim.

843
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:34,071
If you find out Saint Honore's secret taste, then accept her, Oppa.

844
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:37,824
Do you need our shop's secret taste?

845
00:54:37,824 --> 00:54:40,427
I don't need that, so just do your deliveries well.

846
00:54:40,427 --> 00:54:44,919
Yes! No wonder you're different from everyone else.

847
00:54:47,347 --> 00:54:49,665
Where are you?

848
00:54:49,665 --> 00:54:52,424
Are you coming back?

849
00:54:52,424 --> 00:54:58,509
Then I'll leave the cake here.

850
00:55:03,548 --> 00:55:08,354
There must be a good patissier book here somewhere...

851
00:55:33,986 --> 00:55:36,782
I told you not to scare me when I'm sleeping!

852
00:55:36,782 --> 00:55:41,453
You didn't pick up your phone because you were sleeping right? Where's Hedgehog's cake by the way?

853
00:55:41,453 --> 00:55:44,417
I left it on the table.

854
00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:46,539
It wasn't there.

855
00:55:46,539 --> 00:55:49,570
Did it grow legs and run away?

856
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:53,004
I'm going to sleep.

857
00:56:04,304 --> 00:56:07,254
Hello.

858
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:49,076
Macaroon...

859
00:56:49,076 --> 00:56:51,760
Welcome!

860
00:56:56,913 --> 00:57:00,452
Say hi to him. He's the president at the company when I want to work at.

861
00:57:00,452 --> 00:57:02,679
He's a famous writer.

862
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:04,881
Hello!

863
00:57:04,881 --> 00:57:07,036
I'm Ha In Ho.

864
00:57:07,036 --> 00:57:14,274
One macaroon is 500 won ($44.18). If you succeed, 100,000 won ($88.3595).

865
00:57:14,274 --> 00:57:17,800
Where'd you see me that you'd offer me this?

866
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,369
Your works are better than a market.

867
00:57:22,369 --> 00:57:23,745
And where was that?

868
00:57:23,745 --> 00:57:26,462
Saint Honore.

869
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,691
 Ta-dah!

870
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:45,150
 Why are both of your clothes...?

871
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:47,047
 Are you two going on a date?

872
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,964
 Is Da Yang and Hedgehog here?

873
00:57:48,964 --> 00:57:49,949
 They went on a date together.

874
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:51,944
 Where did they go?

875
00:57:51,944 --> 00:57:55,459
 Ko Seung Ji? That's really great then!

876
00:57:55,459 --> 00:58:02,365
 There's nowhere to go? You need to know the beginning of a dating relationship, 
do you really have no sense?!

877
00:58:02,365 --> 00:58:06,646
 Move your hand before it gets broken.
