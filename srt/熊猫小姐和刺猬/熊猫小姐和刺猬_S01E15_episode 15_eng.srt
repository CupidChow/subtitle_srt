 Homotropus tarsatorius

7
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:12,667
Who...

8
00:01:13,794 --> 00:01:16,247
are you?

9
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,085
Is Hedgehog...

10
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:24,166
Min Woo?

11
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:32,653
What's the matter?
Have you been crying?

12
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,679
Why do you look like that?

13
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,915
Are you nauseous?

14
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:49,140
Was it you...?

15
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,983
What is this about?
Are you joking with me?

16
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:59,358
Min Woo...is Hedgehog?

17
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:02,068
What?

18
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:06,413
Min Woo is Hedgehog? I'm asking.

19
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:10,872
Sit down for a moment.
I'll get you something refreshing to drink.

20
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:15,347
I'm saying Hedgehog is Min Woo!

21
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:20,601
Why are you being like this all of a sudden?
Did something happen?

22
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:26,397
If you want to call me Min Woo because you're 
tired of looking for him, that's fine with me.

23
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,689
Hedgehog.

24
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,216
You...

25
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:37,774
And what's the matter with you?

26
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:41,536
Da Yang, the photo...

27
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,911
I know.

28
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:47,939
What? How would you know?

29
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:50,543
I told you.

30
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:53,629
I believe in miracles.

31
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,092
You two have been rehearsing for this, right?

32
00:03:02,644 --> 00:03:05,581
Who is this person?

33
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:08,068
What's this?

34
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,870
We did an age progression photo of you.

35
00:03:14,784 --> 00:03:17,971
Do you understand what we're saying now?

36
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:25,578
Stop joking with me.
 I'm getting angry.

37
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:29,117
We are the ones who should get angry.
Why are you acting like a girl?

38
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:32,429
This is you. This is definitely you!
Can't you tell when you look at it?!

39
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:35,234
Would we joke about something like this?

40
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:38,665
You know how important Min Woo is to me and Da Yang.

41
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:41,900
You know how we lived because of him!
You heard all about it!

42
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,529
Is this all you can do?!

43
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,821
Right.

44
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:48,405
What?

45
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:50,094
Who are you?
Why are being like this, bastard?!

46
00:03:50,094 --> 00:03:52,729
He can't remember it.

47
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:56,473
What did you say?

48
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:58,783
He was beaten up so much that

49
00:03:58,783 --> 00:04:02,221
he has no memory before age 11.

50
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:09,324
His memory starts after he got out of the hospital with  a bandage on his head.

51
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,549
What are you to Choi Jae Gyum so far?

52
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:23,027
Why are you talking about Choi Jae Gyum?

53
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:25,725
-Choi Jae Gyum is...
-Oppa...

54
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:33,597
Because Choi Jae Gyum is your father.

55
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:40,219
This is too much.

56
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:44,487
You went overboard

57
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:47,264
with your joking.

58
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,554
 Maculinea teleius

59
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:58,975
 Aspidomorpha transparipennis

60
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:07,487
Hey, you have a good memory, huh?

61
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:10,641
You remembered it from me earlier.

62
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:15,276
 Rhyssa persuasoria

63
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:19,677
 Homotropus tarsatorius

64
00:05:21,282 --> 00:05:24,256
What are you two up to?

65
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:27,572
How would you know that?!

66
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:32,021
Because we taught you that.

67
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:37,769
It's the code only the three of us would know.

68
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:44,705
Hedgehog!

69
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:49,679
I'll go. He didn't want you to see him crying.

70
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,352
Hey, Min Woo.

71
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:11,229
Can your hyung... ?
It's been a long time...

72
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:16,094
It's been 20 years...
Can I give you a hug?

73
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:25,029
There is something you really have to know.

74
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:30,408
If I know about Choi Jae Gyum, then isn't it over?

75
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:36,304
It's more important than that.

76
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,711
What is it?

77
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:45,776
Min Woo...I mean Hedgehog.

78
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:50,333
Your mother...

79
00:07:51,824 --> 00:07:57,207
is Grandpa's daughter.

80
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,688
Grandpa is...

81
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:09,452
your maternal grandfather.

82
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:18,661
You're the one Grandpa had been searching for 20 years.

83
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:22,558
You're his grandson.

84
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:25,133
Our grandpa is...

85
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:31,535
my real grandfather?

86
00:08:31,535 --> 00:08:35,678
Right, he is.

87
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,503
By the way,

88
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,158
I have a favor to ask.

89
00:09:14,158 --> 00:09:16,585
What is it?

90
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,664
Our grandpa....

91
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:26,136
Don't tell him

92
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:30,747
that I'm his grandson, alright?

93
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,283
How come?

94
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,444
It's because if Grandpa finds out,

95
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:42,323
he knows very well how I had lived.

96
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:48,311
If he doesn't know about me,
 then he might imagine...

97
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:56,269
that I turned out great...

98
00:09:58,346 --> 00:10:01,377
He wouldn't worry, and...

99
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:07,243
he might imagine that I grew up well.
But if he finds out about me, then

100
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:12,325
he might get very upset.

101
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:17,597
He might get upset.

102
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:22,826
He might get so upset that

103
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:25,779
he could even cry.

104
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:33,986
Don't tell him about me, please.

105
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:40,664
Our poor Grandpa.

106
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:46,068
Please

107
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:50,545
don't tell him.

108
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:57,396
 By the way...I have a favor to ask you.

109
00:10:57,396 --> 00:11:00,784
 Don't tell Panda Yang noona that

110
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:08,749
 I...get beaten up by my dad everyday.

111
00:11:09,988 --> 00:11:12,568
 Please don't tell her that.

112
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,396
 How come?

113
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:18,024
 If Noona doesn't know about it,

114
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:22,554
 then she will just think that
 I'm living well with my dad.

115
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:28,696
 If she finds out that I get beaten up by my dad,

116
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:33,676
 she will really get upset.

117
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:38,622
 She might suffer in pain.

118
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:43,080
 So please don't tell her.

119
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,324
 I'm begging you.

120
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:49,925
 Please don't let her find out about it.

121
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,371
Why do you have to ask me for such
 favors since you were young?

122
00:12:15,893 --> 00:12:19,953
Why do you have to live like that?
What have you done wrong?!

123
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:25,488
Why do you...! 
All your life...!

124
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,062
We ate dinner. So what do you want me to eat again?

125
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:56,970
I made the taro soup that,

126
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,687
you like.

127
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:04,153
You...

128
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:05,747
What, father?

129
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:07,961
You.. your clothes..

130
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:10,992
Because it cool out,

131
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:12,934
aren't you cold?

132
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:14,920
How did you just button it?

133
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,567
Buttons?

134
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:23,126
Yes, button it again.

135
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:24,547
Why?

136
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:26,521
Did I line it up wrong?

137
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:29,231
Just do it again.

138
00:13:41,658 --> 00:13:43,959
Why do you button it that way?

139
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:45,982
Why father?

140
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:53,040
Why do you button the third one, then the first one?

141
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,323
Why are you like this father?

142
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:57,370
Why don't you just answer?

143
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,486
Min Woo said that buttoning was difficult, so...

144
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:05,488
he took all the buttons off the clothes.

145
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:08,646
He matches the bottom, then buttons the third one so you don't get it wrong.

146
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:11,421
That's how he taught me.

147
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,665
Since he was young he had that personality?

148
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:21,201
I don't know where he learned that from...I grew up with "if you make a mistake, that's the end."

149
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:26,107
Every day, he took out his clothes with buttons and buttoned them a lot.

150
00:14:28,823 --> 00:14:36,176
While he said that if you are neatly buttoned, that your mind is neatly organized?

151
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,505
Yes.

152
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,636
Oh my!

153
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:49,863
Father, how did you know that?

154
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:52,992
You never met Min Woo, but how did you know that?

155
00:14:56,764 --> 00:14:58,371
Father.

156
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:10,332
So what are we supposed to do now?

157
00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:15,222
Seung Ji won't disappear, will he?

158
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,255
Can't we tell his grandfather?

159
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,221
Let's just make sure.

160
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:27,496
Like a DNA test?

161
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:34,060
Grandpa!

162
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,825
I have arrived!

163
00:15:47,137 --> 00:15:48,606
Let's eat some meat.

164
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:51,388
You do you think she is that you're giving her meat?

165
00:15:51,388 --> 00:15:52,867
Pretense is pretense.

166
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:55,347
Do you think I'm an idiot?

167
00:15:55,347 --> 00:15:58,143
Nice to meet you Ms. Noona.

168
00:15:58,143 --> 00:16:01,529
Why are you calling grandfather's daughter "Noona"?

169
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,048
To someone who's so young,

170
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:04,470
do I call her "Ahjumma"?

171
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,807
Or "Mother"?

172
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:38,080
I'm sorry I couldn't recognize you.

173
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,874
I'm sorry.

174
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:47,560
I didn't go where you were born, I'm sorry for that too.

175
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,529
Because I hated your mother and father,

176
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:55,334
I never got to see the good things you did, so I'm sorry.

177
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,086
When you were suffering,

178
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,739
I couldn't be with you, so I'm sorry.

179
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:12,876
I'm sorry that I avoided having eye contact with you numerous times when you were serving in the jail.

180
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:18,360
Every time you called me "Grandpa",

181
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:23,397
I didn't even recognize my own grandson, I'm sorry.

182
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:31,216
When we lived together, and you were always saying "Grandpa, I love you",

183
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:38,517
I thought you were just trying to make me like you, I'm sorry.

184
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,114
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

185
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:54,116
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry Seung Ji.

186
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:45,780

187
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:21,116
 Hedgehog Noonim Trademark Macaroon

188
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:35,533
 Hedgehog,

189
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:38,483
 Don't be hungry and make sure you eat while you work.

190
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:42,059
 So you don't get indigestion, drink warm water.

191
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:46,632
Until you say you want to see me, I'll wait.

192
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:51,571
Don't worry about me,

193
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:58,309
so keep up the "1, 2, 3 Go! 1, 2, 3 Go!"

194
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:03,118
It would be great if these magic words were effective and result in something good.

195
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:35,063
Maculinea teleius.

196
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:38,042
Aspidomorpha...

197
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:40,251
...transparipennis

198
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:45,848
Rhyssa...

199
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:49,777
...persuasoria

200
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:54,874
Homotropus...

201
00:20:54,874 --> 00:20:59,299
...tarsatorius

202
00:21:07,014 --> 00:21:09,037
Grandpa,

203
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:12,807
give me some strength.

204
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:17,099
What Grandpa wanted,

205
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,354
you saw how I have my head on straight now and how I make cakes, right?

206
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:30,698
I don't have any other reason,

207
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,045
So we can win with cakes,

208
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,562
Ch..

209
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,043
Choi Jae Gyum

210
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:48,364
I wanted to throw him out.

211
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:53,308
So please,

212
00:21:54,028 --> 00:21:56,747
give me some strength.

213
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,872
Homotropus...

214
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:11,099
...tarsatorius

215
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:19,975
I'm sorry, I'm keeping you up.

216
00:22:19,975 --> 00:22:23,305
No it's ok.  I wanted to see you too.

217
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:28,505
Won Il sent the pictures.

218
00:22:28,505 --> 00:22:30,869
It's Seung Ji, right?

219
00:22:32,513 --> 00:22:34,146
Correct?

220
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,047
Yes.

221
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:42,355
How did..

222
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:43,950
you know?

223
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,960
�Father saw me buttoning my clothes,

224
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,210
saying that the way we button our clothes were the same.

225
00:22:55,362 --> 00:23:00,543
Hedgehog said not to tell grandfather.

226
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,410
Why?

227
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:08,643
Because grandfather knows how he suffered growing up,

228
00:23:08,643 --> 00:23:12,189
he thought his grandfather's heart would hurt.

229
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:24,261
Our Min Woo grew up well right?

230
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:40,779
I was worried he would grow up like his father.  That was my biggest worry. It's a huge relief.

231
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:46,485
Does grandfather know that Charmain Choi Jae Gyum is Minwoo's father?

232
00:23:46,485 --> 00:23:49,126
Because he didn't know that,

233
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:55,679
before he goes to work tomorrow, I came to talk to you.

234
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:03,501
Shouldn't I go meet Seung Ji as Min Woo right now?

235
00:24:05,814 --> 00:24:11,472
Hedgehog, doesn't want to see me right now, so...

236
00:24:11,472 --> 00:24:13,895
I didn't get to say goodbye and came home.

237
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:16,143
Why?

238
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:22,611
Maybe he's in a turmoil.
He's hiding like a hedgehog.

239
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:26,902
What I keep feeling insecure about is,

240
00:24:26,902 --> 00:24:29,851
because I romanticized this situation,

241
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:33,177
maybe he started disliking me or,

242
00:24:33,177 --> 00:24:35,852
he is losing interest in me.

243
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:41,823
I'm really sorry to you too.

244
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:46,456
Don't ever think like that.

245
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,924
I have nothing but grateful feelings toward you.

246
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:55,953
If Father knew, he would think the same way also.

247
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:59,761
If you think that way, I won't be able to lift my head in front of Min Woo.

248
00:24:59,761 --> 00:25:04,358
He shouldn't even hear "Mom".

249
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:10,877
So even though I want to run to see him,

250
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:14,738
I could only go to you.

251
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:15,975
Unni!  Unni!

252
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:17,853
There's big trouble!

253
00:25:17,853 --> 00:25:23,301
Uncle got beaten so he's been taken to the hospital.

254
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:24,700
What?

255
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,272
 KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON

256
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,147
Hyung! I'm just coming back from
 hanging out with Gyun Woo.

257
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:48,340
He packed this for you to eat.

258
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,603
Why are you putting this away?

259
00:25:50,603 --> 00:25:52,195
I'm not putting it away.

260
00:25:52,195 --> 00:25:55,983
I'm asking why did you bring that thing from over there?

261
00:25:55,983 --> 00:25:57,283
To give to Seung Ji.

262
00:25:57,283 --> 00:25:59,872
What?

263
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:02,734
Seung Ji wouldn't have asked for it,

264
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:05,539
Hedgehog is settling you down a lot, Hyung.

265
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:07,191
It's just

266
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,707
like you what you said.

267
00:26:08,707 --> 00:26:11,300
So he could keep calm and carry on as usual.

268
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,688
But still, something you treasured for twenty years...

269
00:26:15,688 --> 00:26:18,036
How does he feel?

270
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:22,007
He doesn't feel like working because he's dating?

271
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:23,075
Won Yi,

272
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:24,600
What?

273
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,920
You're all grown up now right?

274
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,548
Do you think I've grown more?
Maybe I should try modeling.

275
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,741
I mean, are you an adult now?

276
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:37,669
Ah Hyung, why would I be an adult?
I'm just a newborn.

277
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:42,299
If you don't give me my allowance,
I am a helpless and pitiful child.

278
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,105
It's because I have something important to tell you.

279
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:46,166
Getting coached about dating?

280
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:48,782
It's really important to Seung Ji.

281
00:26:48,782 --> 00:26:52,877
But you are the only one who can do this.

282
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:57,688
What is it?

283
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:15,849
If I tell you once,

284
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:18,406
and I won't mention it again,

285
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:21,783
can't I say a few things and let it go?

286
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:24,976
Otherwise, I think I'll suffocate.

287
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,402
Say it.

288
00:27:27,402 --> 00:27:33,045
I feel dirty and my confidence is dirty, I feel like I'm going crazy.

289
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:38,023
If it's possible, I would drain my dad's blood out of me.

290
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:42,370
And I want to filter out Mom's...

291
00:27:45,337 --> 00:27:47,367
What can we do?

292
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:49,761
You're not born from your father.

293
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:51,592
you were born as my little sister.

294
00:27:51,592 --> 00:27:54,189
So don't think like that anymore.

295
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:58,780
If it weren't for you, I couldn't have made it this far.

296
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:02,781
I know.

297
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,308
Because of me,

298
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,732
because I was born,

299
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:10,593
Hedgehog hyung will forever suffer like death itself.

300
00:28:10,593 --> 00:28:14,341
I feel so bad, I can't handle it.

301
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:18,438
Seung Ji doesn't think that way, you know that right?

302
00:28:20,628 --> 00:28:23,601
You can be good like an adult right?

303
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:43,371
Your father,

304
00:28:44,602 --> 00:28:47,766
is helping me too.

305
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,861
Your father, can I just...

306
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:58,823
call him my father too?

307
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,682
I also,

308
00:29:11,594 --> 00:29:13,798
like an adult,

309
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:15,857
for sake of Seung Ji,

310
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:18,911
I'll fulfill my obligations.

311
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,910
Welcome home Seung Ji!

312
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:09,236
How much was he hit?

313
00:30:09,236 --> 00:30:13,842
He went into surgery and is in the ICU so he must be in bad shape.

314
00:30:13,842 --> 00:30:19,015
Da Yang and Da Na felt so bad for their aunt, they've been crying and crying.  It's been crazy.

315
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:23,769
It was so bad that your Noonim, went with them.

316
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:26,689
She said that instead of the kids going, that it was better for an adult to go,

317
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:30,423
so I said I would go.  But she said,

318
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:33,806
that there might not be enough money for the surgery bill, so she went.

319
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:36,614
How much would the surgery and hospital bill be?

320
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:39,301
The cost for the ICU is going to be a lot.

321
00:30:39,301 --> 00:30:41,631
It's only a matter of time to blow your money away.

322
00:31:18,736 --> 00:31:20,657
 -It's ok.
 -Go in.

323
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:22,759
  Yes.

324
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:28,129
 Hurry and go inside.

325
00:31:28,129 --> 00:31:29,809
 Go, go.

326
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:32,505
 I know, hurry inside.

327
00:31:32,505 --> 00:31:35,014
 Just go.

328
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:44,438
 Grandpa,

329
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:48,044
 I will build you a place like Saint Honore.

330
00:31:48,044 --> 00:31:50,424
 Until then, don't get sick,

331
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:52,737
 and don't get old,

332
00:31:52,737 --> 00:31:55,809
 Just wait.

333
00:32:00,263 --> 00:32:03,288
Grandpa,

334
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:08,221
the money I saved for your sake, I'll use it now.

335
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:10,441
St. Hon..

336
00:32:12,455 --> 00:32:17,234
It will take a little more time to get ready.

337
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:20,852
Be healthier,

338
00:32:20,852 --> 00:32:23,651
be younger, as you wait.

339
00:32:27,225 --> 00:32:30,050
The grandson,

340
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:33,557
you were never able to see.

341
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,812
You should receive the result.

342
00:34:00,857 --> 00:34:01,843
 Grandpa,

343
00:34:01,843 --> 00:34:04,266
 This time, I'm taking vacation.

344
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:08,719
 I'm exhausted after producing a brand new product.  
I'll be back after I'm reenergized.

345
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,561
 Seung Ji, the punk

346
00:34:11,561 --> 00:34:12,917
You came out early.

347
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,984
Oh, you're here?

348
00:34:15,984 --> 00:34:18,897
Oh, this must be Seung Ji's new product.

349
00:34:18,897 --> 00:34:20,855
Yes.

350
00:34:22,188 --> 00:34:28,985
I have a feeling we'll be busy making this all day long.

351
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:41,269
You came?

352
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:42,778
Why are you here so early?

353
00:34:42,778 --> 00:34:44,922
To see Seung Ji.

354
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:48,792
He must have been up all night making this, so he must have gone home.

355
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:50,466
He must have had a hard time last night.

356
00:34:50,466 --> 00:34:54,552
Seriously.  There was so much work yesterday, I was beat.

357
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:57,472
He really is a hedgehog.

358
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:03,229
He said he's going to take a break.

359
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:07,911
He'll want to see you, Grandfather, so he'll be back soon.

360
00:35:19,506 --> 00:35:21,352
Hey,

361
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:25,456
Doesn't grandfather need to quit immediately then?

362
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,021
Seung Ji,

363
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:30,828
with that state, made those cakes.

364
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:37,537
What's the occasion?  You thought to come see your father.

365
00:35:37,537 --> 00:35:40,126
I don't know maybe it's because I need money?

366
00:35:40,126 --> 00:35:46,128
Understood, understood.  I'll take care of you.  Don't worry.

367
00:35:46,128 --> 00:35:47,991
Why are you avoiding your father's arms?

368
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:51,456
Who said I'm avoiding you?  Don't.  I'm saying I hurt my shoulder.

369
00:35:51,456 --> 00:35:52,787
Doing what?

370
00:35:52,787 --> 00:35:56,708
Exercising.  Dad, did you finish washing up or not yet?

371
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:59,369
I just showered, why?

372
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:01,254
I need to use the bathroom.

373
00:36:01,254 --> 00:36:02,223
Oh hurry and go!

374
00:36:02,223 --> 00:36:04,160
I'll be right back.

375
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,279
But...

376
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:13,099
Oh my stomach hurts.  I think I have diarrhea.

377
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,900
Aish, Mom is such a traitor.

378
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,800
Is it okay for Mom to stab her son in the back like this?

379
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:57,202
Oh, you should get some money and go eat some food with your dad, but you're going?

380
00:36:57,202 --> 00:37:00,559
I wish I could too, but something important came up.

381
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,941
Working part-time at someone else's cafe?

382
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:04,064
Yeah, that's it.

383
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:06,560
Do some part-time work for me.

384
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,517
What?

385
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:10,635
I heard there's a new gentleman pattisier?

386
00:37:10,635 --> 00:37:11,579
Yes.

387
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:16,624
Take a picture of his cakes and bring it.

388
00:37:16,686 --> 00:37:17,914
Why?

389
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:21,611
Because he's there in my place, and it's making me mad.

390
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:24,231
But you threw away your position, so why is it yours?

391
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:26,764
Is it because I wanted to throw it away?  
Won Il, he..

392
00:37:26,764 --> 00:37:29,584
Dad, I'm going.

393
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:32,414
I told you I'll pay your a lot for your part-time work.

394
00:37:32,414 --> 00:37:36,145
Dad, Dad!

395
00:37:36,145 --> 00:37:37,712
Why?

396
00:37:37,712 --> 00:37:39,615
Bye.

397
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:49,394
How much has Won Il influenced her that my own daughter behaves like that?

398
00:37:57,684 --> 00:38:00,365
It's really delicious.

399
00:38:05,294 --> 00:38:08,197
Thank you.  Come again!

400
00:38:08,197 --> 00:38:09,869
Which flavors did we sell?

401
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:14,484
Our Seung Ji is earning our food to eat.

402
00:38:18,761 --> 00:38:20,934
Hey, hey, hey.

403
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,983
That bottled cake, who made it?

404
00:38:23,983 --> 00:38:27,234
Pattissier Ko Seung Ji made it.

405
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:28,427
Do they really sell?

406
00:38:28,427 --> 00:38:33,548
They don't just sell, they are stronger than the turtle, bear macaroons.

407
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:35,097
How much stronger are they?

408
00:38:35,097 --> 00:38:37,547
We already got group orders.

409
00:38:37,547 --> 00:38:42,133
That's the third batch to come out, the others were all sold.

410
00:38:47,585 --> 00:38:50,594
Why do people like it so much?

411
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:54,722
The customers who eat in the shop usually don't bring home their left overs.

412
00:38:54,722 --> 00:38:58,432
But those, they're easier to carry than the boxed cakes.

413
00:38:58,432 --> 00:39:00,857
If there are any left over, you can eat it later.

414
00:39:00,857 --> 00:39:05,354
Many are saying that finally Saint Honore has made a cake for the customers.

415
00:39:05,354 --> 00:39:10,334
What do they mean finally?  Were we making cakes for ourselves? 
Cakes were always made for them.

416
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:11,919
Did you taste it?

417
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:13,894
We didn't try all the flavors, but...

418
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:16,366
we shared one of the bottles.

419
00:39:16,366 --> 00:39:20,063
It tasted unusual, and it was as 
good as one could imagine...

420
00:39:20,063 --> 00:39:21,630
Please try one.

421
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,610
It's not for me to eat.  Bring it to my office.

422
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,171
Yes.

423
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:35,179
Hyung, here's my work.

424
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:36,820
You did some hard work.

425
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,321
What kind of work?

426
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:40,582
This.

427
00:39:42,028 --> 00:39:45,802
Who.. for a DNA test?

428
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:47,941
For who?

429
00:39:47,941 --> 00:39:50,522
Father and Seung Ji.

430
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:52,208
Why?

431
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:54,345
What?

432
00:39:54,345 --> 00:39:56,931
I understand, but

433
00:39:56,931 --> 00:40:02,601
then you and Seung Ji are related?

434
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:06,880
You're related, he's related.

435
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,268
So you and Seung Ji are brothers?

436
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:15,121
Did you get some of Seung Ji's hair?

437
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,003
Not yet.

438
00:40:16,003 --> 00:40:19,725
I'll do it.  Let me do it.

439
00:40:19,725 --> 00:40:24,611
I want to talk to Seung Ji and give him some encouragement.

440
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:29,361
I'll take care of what we need for the DNA test.

441
00:40:31,322 --> 00:40:33,200
Pick-up!

442
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,718
Hello?  Hyung, it's me.  I have something I need to see you about.

443
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:40,715
It would be good if I could see you right now.

444
00:40:40,715 --> 00:40:43,019
At the hospital?

445
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:45,278
I'll go there right now.

446
00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:52,754
What do you think of the cake our Seung Ji made?

447
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:56,190
I can see that he's really your student, Teacher.

448
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,454
Are you giving me your best praise?

449
00:40:58,454 --> 00:41:00,377
That's what it seems like?

450
00:41:03,552 --> 00:41:07,167
Grandpa, Grandpa!

451
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,222
Grandpa, I'm going to go meet Seung Ji and will be back.

452
00:41:10,222 --> 00:41:12,236
Where is he right now?

453
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:16,142
He's on his way to the hospital because Da Yang and Da Na's uncle had a big surgery.

454
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:17,529
Oh, okay.  Hurry.

455
00:41:17,529 --> 00:41:18,631
Please carry on.

456
00:41:18,631 --> 00:41:20,974
I'll be back Grandpa.

457
00:41:22,645 --> 00:41:26,630
Who is she to call you "Grandpa, Grandpa", without fear of you, Teacher?

458
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:33,027
She's the daughter of this place.  But she follows Seung Ji and calls me that.

459
00:41:33,027 --> 00:41:37,876
Teacher, are you very close to the family from St. Honore?

460
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:40,053
I'm a stranger to Director Choi, but he's close to Seung Ji.

461
00:41:40,053 --> 00:41:44,795
I don't know the parent's of the Director.

462
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,385
Then it's good.

463
00:41:47,385 --> 00:41:49,626
What is?

464
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:52,477
Please help me, Teacher.

465
00:41:58,274 --> 00:42:00,510
 Gi Tae

466
00:42:02,192 --> 00:42:05,984
Is there a specific pastry you're looking for, Customer?

467
00:42:06,923 --> 00:42:11,478
I'll pick it out as I want, just answer your phone.

468
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:13,970
It's ok.

469
00:42:15,803 --> 00:42:19,666
It's just that I'm sensitive to the noise.

470
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:21,948
Just answer the phone.

471
00:42:21,948 --> 00:42:24,745
Yes.

472
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:25,951
Hello?

473
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:28,733
I'm working, so later.

474
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:30,227
What?

475
00:42:30,227 --> 00:42:36,356
Are you saying, Seung Ji is the President's grandson and the lost son noonim has been looking for?

476
00:42:36,356 --> 00:42:39,771
What could be more shocking than that?

477
00:42:39,771 --> 00:42:40,871
What?

478
00:42:40,871 --> 00:42:43,906
Seung Ji's father is Choi Jae Gyum?

479
00:42:43,906 --> 00:42:48,787
Where is Seung Ji?  Is he at St Honore?

480
00:42:52,397 --> 00:42:56,572
Seung Ji, you're suffering coming all the way over here.

481
00:42:56,572 --> 00:42:59,504
I drove over here, so...

482
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,901
You didn't sleep at all, did you?  Your eyes look tired.

483
00:43:04,901 --> 00:43:09,794
Because you brought me a lunch box, I had to stay up and make a new product.

484
00:43:09,794 --> 00:43:14,673
You did well.  Good work, our Seung Ji.

485
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:20,111
How is your uncle?

486
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:22,256
He's in the ICU.

487
00:43:22,256 --> 00:43:28,597
The surgery went well, but they have to keep an eye on him.

488
00:43:28,597 --> 00:43:33,298
You said you were worried about Aunt.  Why did you call me out instead of coming inside?

489
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:42,985
Are you uncomfortable if you see Ahjumma?

490
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:51,203
I can't bear to see grandpa who doesn't know his grandson.
It's even more difficult to face Noonim who knows who her son is.

491
00:43:55,094 --> 00:43:59,412
Let's go inside and talk.

492
00:44:09,553 --> 00:44:13,588
She knows.  Grandfather too.

493
00:44:15,443 --> 00:44:18,001
How did they find out?

494
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:20,553
Did she tell him?

495
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:28,325
She said when he watched her button up her clothes, grandfather figured it out.

496
00:44:29,736 --> 00:44:34,112
Then, why hasn't he called?

497
00:44:34,112 --> 00:44:40,412
To make you more comfortable, maybe he's avoiding you?

498
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:49,631
Grandfather is impressive and so is Ahjumma.

499
00:44:50,424 --> 00:44:53,617
How do you think they're feeling?

500
00:44:53,617 --> 00:44:57,549
It must be really difficult for them in reality.

501
00:44:57,549 --> 00:45:06,714
Ahjumma is comforting my aunt and grand father called to say not to worry about the hospital bill.

502
00:45:09,428 --> 00:45:12,209
Oh, right.

503
00:45:14,198 --> 00:45:19,093
Give this to your aunt, and pay the hospital bill.

504
00:45:20,031 --> 00:45:28,802
I paid the hospital bill from the Panda Cafe account, without getting your permission.

505
00:45:28,802 --> 00:45:31,796
You did well.

506
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:37,191
Aunt said not to burden you and yelled at me.

507
00:45:37,191 --> 00:45:39,207
If I accept this too then...

508
00:45:39,207 --> 00:45:42,679
If those people did that to your uncle, then they won't let it go.

509
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:49,628
It could be dangerous for your aunt too, so pay her debt back with this.

510
00:45:49,628 --> 00:45:51,321
Seung Ji.

511
00:45:51,321 --> 00:45:54,394
Are you going to listen to me?

512
00:45:54,394 --> 00:45:58,169
Are you going to let your aunt get hurt too?

513
00:45:59,534 --> 00:46:02,041
I understand.

514
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:16,628
I'm grateful and have nothing to say for myself.

515
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:28,212
Hyung! Da Yang!

516
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:37,326
What are you doing?

517
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:38,376
A big bow!

518
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:41,807
You're my hyung too.

519
00:46:42,971 --> 00:46:45,704
Why do you look like you're constipated?

520
00:46:45,704 --> 00:46:49,753
Do you hate that instead of your follower, I'm your little sister?

521
00:46:49,753 --> 00:46:51,563
No.

522
00:46:51,563 --> 00:46:56,346
Then does it bother you to have called my brother "Hyung" when you were young?

523
00:46:57,443 --> 00:46:59,117
Why did you come all the way here?

524
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:02,328
To see Hyung 2, and to carry out Hyung 1's errand.

525
00:47:02,328 --> 00:47:05,777
Hung 2-im, say "ahhhh."

526
00:47:05,777 --> 00:47:06,794
Why?

527
00:47:06,794 --> 00:47:09,530
Just be patient.

528
00:47:16,718 --> 00:47:18,309
All done.

529
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:20,709
We can't just let it go.

530
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:25,224
Then, I'll be leaving to drop this off.  The result will be available tomorrow.

531
00:47:25,224 --> 00:47:27,682
You're working hard, our Won Yi.

532
00:47:27,682 --> 00:47:29,991
I feel bad if this counts as hard work,

533
00:47:29,991 --> 00:47:35,661
but I'm really happy that I have another brother that turned out to be Seung Ji.

534
00:47:35,661 --> 00:47:37,140
You like it too?

535
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:42,744
The people you were waiting for were Grandfather, Ahjumma, Won Il and Noonim.

536
00:47:42,744 --> 00:47:45,301
Aren't you happy?

537
00:47:47,461 --> 00:47:49,992
I'm going.

538
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,696
Good job!

539
00:47:59,373 --> 00:48:02,248
Whose son?

540
00:48:02,248 --> 00:48:05,811
Cafe Panda's Ko Seung Ji is your son, and

541
00:48:05,811 --> 00:48:10,039
The Mozarto's owner is his grandfather.

542
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:13,468
But then, is that true?

543
00:48:15,864 --> 00:48:22,506
Your wife doesn't seem to know your relationship to the owner of Mozarto.

544
00:48:24,287 --> 00:48:28,696
Doesn't Choi Won Il know?

545
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:35,995
It's your wife.

546
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:42,110
Yes,

547
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,627
Honey.

548
00:48:43,627 --> 00:48:49,297
It's serious right now.

549
00:48:49,297 --> 00:48:53,849
It's not an emergency, but it looks like St. Honore's going to go soaring.

550
00:48:53,849 --> 00:49:01,848
What do you mean why? That legal agreement we made with Ko Seung Ji, we may end up losing.

551
00:49:01,848 --> 00:49:04,109
What do you mean let's wait and see?  What's there to wait and see?

552
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:09,378
If our sales go up by 5,000,000 won, Ko Seung Ji will win.

553
00:49:09,378 --> 00:49:11,638
Do you think I want to use him?

554
00:49:11,638 --> 00:49:14,608
It's because of Won Il's temperament.

555
00:49:14,608 --> 00:49:17,800
Who's the one who cheated that's mad at me?

556
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:23,713
It's an emergency!
It's an emergency!

557
00:49:23,713 --> 00:49:25,246
The vice president is reporting

558
00:49:25,246 --> 00:49:27,394
about the contract that she wrote with Ko Seung Ji...

559
00:49:27,394 --> 00:49:30,133
to the director.

560
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,401
They are planning something.

561
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:36,003
Alright. Why don't you go back to the office?

562
00:49:36,003 --> 00:49:38,144
If you get caught like that...

563
00:49:38,144 --> 00:49:40,446
Ok.

564
00:49:43,959 --> 00:49:46,519
It's not something that you've never imagined.

565
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:50,549
Let's go talk to my dad about the contract issues.

566
00:49:52,017 --> 00:49:56,431
I'm glad that you're here.

567
00:50:02,317 --> 00:50:05,080
That hurts.

568
00:50:06,802 --> 00:50:07,977
Hey, Jong Gab.

569
00:50:07,977 --> 00:50:09,278
Why are you doing this?

570
00:50:09,278 --> 00:50:13,166
How much could you do for me?

571
00:50:13,166 --> 00:50:15,260
What are you talking about?

572
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,738
If you do what I tell you to do,

573
00:50:17,738 --> 00:50:21,601
I can guarantee your livelihood for the rest of your life.

574
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,905
Yes?

575
00:50:23,905 --> 00:50:25,894
Da Yang?

576
00:50:25,894 --> 00:50:27,887
How did you come out?

577
00:50:27,887 --> 00:50:30,584
I wanted to see Hedgehog.

578
00:50:30,584 --> 00:50:32,704
I should have gone to see you.

579
00:50:32,704 --> 00:50:34,619
It's ok.

580
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:36,396
Is it alright for her uncle to be alone?

581
00:50:36,396 --> 00:50:41,586
Da Na is there. I'll just talk to you for a moment.

582
00:50:41,586 --> 00:50:44,143
Let me hug you once.

583
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:49,278
I'm so happy to see you again.

584
00:50:49,278 --> 00:50:52,541
Thank you for coming back safely.

585
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:54,736
My brother-in-law,

586
00:50:54,736 --> 00:50:57,361
I'll apologize instead of him.

587
00:50:57,361 --> 00:50:59,485
I'm sorry.

588
00:50:59,485 --> 00:51:03,722
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you when you were young.

589
00:51:03,722 --> 00:51:06,718
It's a miracle that you turned out so well.

590
00:51:06,718 --> 00:51:08,729
Our Da Yang...

591
00:51:08,729 --> 00:51:12,687
I'm grateful she had prayed for you all this time.

592
00:51:15,133 --> 00:51:21,175
While I was driving the taxi around, I was hoping for someone who might look like you to get in,

593
00:51:21,175 --> 00:51:27,797
so I can ask "did you grow up in our neighborhood?"  I was wishing and waiting for that day to come.

594
00:51:30,126 --> 00:51:32,840
Because I have a memorable face,

595
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,387
and even though you might not recognize others,

596
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:40,061
I wondered "Wil he be able to recognize me?"

597
00:51:40,061 --> 00:51:42,140
Anyways...

598
00:51:43,843 --> 00:51:46,173
Anyways,

599
00:51:46,173 --> 00:51:49,073
It's fine, now that I got to meet you.

600
00:51:51,677 --> 00:51:57,062
My affection towards you is like this, imagine how grandfather and mother's would be?

601
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,813
All alone,

602
00:52:00,813 --> 00:52:03,425
without your family, you turned out so well.

603
00:52:03,425 --> 00:52:05,113
Accepting this situation

604
00:52:05,113 --> 00:52:07,286
will be difficult.

605
00:52:07,286 --> 00:52:10,494
It will be scary and confusing for you.

606
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,589
I know you will have all kinds of thoughts.

607
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:16,958
Then just forget everything and...

608
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:19,072
just close your eyes,

609
00:52:19,072 --> 00:52:21,892
Start calling her mother.

610
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:27,886
Then it'll be like you were family since long ago.

611
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:39,408
Auntie ajumma is here.

612
00:52:49,479 --> 00:52:53,438
Hedgehog told me to give this to you, to pay back the debt.

613
00:52:53,438 --> 00:52:56,622
Repay the debt?

614
00:53:11,423 --> 00:53:16,156
It seems that Min Woo came back to save me.

615
00:53:28,267 --> 00:53:30,375
Seung Ji Ssi.

616
00:53:31,907 --> 00:53:34,233
Let's just...

617
00:53:34,233 --> 00:53:37,116
get along well.

618
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:42,986
Since we're not forcing anything.

619
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:48,537
Like water that flows, let time pass naturally,

620
00:53:48,537 --> 00:53:50,675
With time, we'll become comfortable with each other.

621
00:53:50,675 --> 00:53:52,641
When we get to know each other better,

622
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:55,027
we'll talk then.

623
00:53:58,704 --> 00:54:00,740
Still...

624
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,920
that will do?

625
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,914
Of course it will. It's all up to us.

626
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:08,219
How will it not work?

627
00:54:11,229 --> 00:54:13,200
What about Grandpa?

628
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,896
He was your grandpa until now and he will be forever.

629
00:54:17,896 --> 00:54:20,361
That's for sure.

630
00:54:23,285 --> 00:54:28,767
I believe my father thinks the same as me.

631
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:30,340
So...

632
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,576
let it all go.

633
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:44,911
But about President Choi Jae Gyum....

634
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,159
I know. I wasn't going to tell him.

635
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:53,438
About him,

636
00:54:53,438 --> 00:54:57,379
Do you know how sorry I'm...?

637
00:55:00,724 --> 00:55:04,747
We'll talk about that later.

638
00:55:08,704 --> 00:55:11,352
Thank you.

639
00:55:11,352 --> 00:55:14,372
And..

640
00:55:14,372 --> 00:55:17,423
Sorry.

641
00:55:17,423 --> 00:55:21,843
I am also thankful,

642
00:55:21,843 --> 00:55:25,279
and sorry.

643
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:45,151
Because the vice-president is surely involved,

644
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:49,026
In a court of law, whether a perjury
 is committed or not,

645
00:55:49,026 --> 00:55:52,598
whatever the method, they will light a fire.

646
00:55:56,976 --> 00:55:58,463
Director,

647
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,311
Welcome.

648
00:56:00,311 --> 00:56:01,843
I'm sorry.

649
00:56:01,843 --> 00:56:04,663
It's okay, have a seat.

650
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:11,702
This is Ms. In Ah Kyung.

651
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:15,803
Thank you for your courage.

652
00:56:22,285 --> 00:56:24,903
It's Jang Su Suk.

653
00:56:24,903 --> 00:56:27,874
The guy that works as a patissier under President Choi? 
Yea.

654
00:56:27,874 --> 00:56:29,652
Answer it.

655
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,055
Yes, hello.

656
00:56:33,055 --> 00:56:35,146
Yes, Mr. Jang.

657
00:56:35,146 --> 00:56:39,581
You want me tell you Director's cell number?

658
00:56:39,581 --> 00:56:41,482
Would you like to talk to him now?

659
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:44,821
Just a moment.

660
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:50,521
Yes, it's me.

661
00:56:50,521 --> 00:56:52,238
Yes.

662
00:56:52,238 --> 00:56:54,007
What did you say?

663
00:56:54,007 --> 00:56:57,649
He asked to get rid of Go Seung Ji?

664
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:28,489
Where did you go so late?

665
00:57:30,088 --> 00:57:32,514
Nothing,

666
00:57:32,514 --> 00:57:35,175
I just walked around here.

667
00:57:35,175 --> 00:57:38,130
Did you wait for me?

668
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:40,880
I'm glad you came.

669
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,816
I'd come home anyway.
Why would you wait for me?

670
00:57:44,816 --> 00:57:47,410
I was worried,

671
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:50,611
and I missed you.

672
00:57:57,824 --> 00:58:00,359
Come here.

673
00:58:08,233 --> 00:58:10,832
Why are you stopping?

674
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:14,995
It's me, grandpa.

675
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:17,529
I'm grandpa.

676
00:58:18,972 --> 00:58:20,285
Grandpa.

677
00:58:20,285 --> 00:58:22,966
Are you coming?

678
00:58:24,036 --> 00:58:25,784
Grandpa.

679
00:58:25,784 --> 00:58:27,499
That's right.

680
00:58:29,956 --> 00:58:32,359
Grandpa.

681
00:58:43,347 --> 00:58:45,805
You suffered a lot.

682
00:58:47,121 --> 00:58:50,158
You suffered a lot.

683
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,679
 Tell me what you heard right now!

684
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:45,030
 He told Jang Su Suk to

685
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:47,920
 get rid of Grandpa and Mr.Seung Ji.

686
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,550
 I've finally met the people I've been waiting for these past 20 years.

687
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:54,392
 Now he wants to separate them from me eternally?
He's not human.

688
00:59:54,392 --> 00:59:56,126
 If he's not a human,

689
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:58,338
 he shouldn't be treated as one.

690
00:59:58,338 --> 01:00:02,826
 I brought the flowers Choi Won Il sent.

691
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:11,783
 You...
Choi Jae Gyum...
