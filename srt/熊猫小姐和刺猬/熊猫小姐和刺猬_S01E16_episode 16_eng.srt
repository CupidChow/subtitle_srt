1
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:48,826
Send Jin Do and Gi Tae to the house so they can keep watch.

2
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:52,057
And you should find some patissiers, and go search through everything.

3
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,272
Get all the employees down here!

4
00:00:58,272 --> 00:00:58,971
It's urgent!

5
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:06,825
Search the kitchen to see if Choi Jae Gyum is around.

6
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:08,650
Yes.

7
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:20,794
Everyone is here. We went to see Uncle in the hospital,

8
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:23,463
and we also have a new macaron group order.

9
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:28,697
What?!

10
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:33,491
Okay, I understand.

11
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:35,554
I'll do as you say.

12
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:40,042
Okay, call me later.

13
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:46,036
What's wrong?  Did something happen?

14
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:51,566
Choi Jae Gyum ordered Jang Su Jok to

15
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:53,965
get rid of Grandpa and Hedgehog.

16
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:55,967
What?  He's crazy!

17
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:58,346
He calls himself human?

18
00:01:58,346 --> 00:01:59,794
Why was he born?

19
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:03,504
Someone like him shouldn't be in his world.

20
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:06,832
He said Ajumma might in danger too, so we should protect her.

21
00:02:06,832 --> 00:02:09,374
We shouldn't let her go places alone.

22
00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:12,415
It's so sad for him.

23
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:14,482
He finds his father

24
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:17,398
but he turns out to be this awful kind of person.

25
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:32,900
Ajumma isn't here.

26
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,492
Oh yes, she must be at Cafe Panda.

27
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:39,469
Should I lay out your blankets for you?

28
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,649
He's acting strange tonight.

29
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:44,125
He's providing us special services which is unusual.

30
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,570
Why are you being so overly nice to us?

31
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,938
Because it's so nice to see you reunited after 20 years.

32
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:51,813
What I'd actually like to do is to bring you two some drinks,

33
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:54,686
I think it might be better for you to spend quality time with Seung Ji.

34
00:02:54,686 --> 00:02:56,740
We'll save the party for next time.

35
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,764
Sure, we'll all get together and have a great feast.

36
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:03,212
I'll invite everyone, so just set a date.

37
00:03:03,212 --> 00:03:05,347
I wish Panda and Won Il were here.

38
00:03:05,347 --> 00:03:07,529
We can celebrate all together next time.
You have nothing to worry about.

39
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:09,172
Of course.

40
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:12,003
The way I feel, we're going to have a feast everyday now.

41
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:15,690
Do you want to eat all of your birthday meals that you've missed?

42
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,815
That's okay, Grandpa made sure to prepare them for me every year.

43
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:21,572
How old is he anyway?  He's a whole lot younger, isn't he?

44
00:03:21,572 --> 00:03:23,786
He is just boldly pretending to be older, isn't he?

45
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,524
No, his age is right.

46
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:28,644
His birthday isn't June 6th,

47
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:30,935
it's April 15th.

48
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:34,108
Hey, but how didn't you forget your age, despite it all?

49
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:37,235
When I left the hospital, they told me I was 11, so I figured I was.

50
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:40,302
What do you mean, not forget?

51
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:43,768
Grandpa, if you keep pitying me, I'm not going to be your grandson.

52
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:46,942
Little punk, do you think it's somethingyou can decide whether you will or won't?

53
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:50,802
Look at this.  It doesn't matter if I was found after being lost for 20 years.  He treats me the same.

54
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:56,401
What?  I speak the truth.

55
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,615
He's hitting me again.  Again.

56
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:08,398
He's not here. He already ran away.

57
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:11,817
Would he stick around for us to catch him when we are all out to search?

58
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:14,446
When we catch them, I'm going to kill them.  I am.

59
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:15,625
Don't say things you don't mean.

60
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,958
I mean it.

61
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,922
He told him to get rid of Hedgehog's Grandpa.

62
00:04:18,922 --> 00:04:20,996
I'm supposed to just leave him alone?

63
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:24,029
We have an attorney, detective, witnesses and compiled evidence. What's there for you to do?

64
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:26,486
Hyung, even if he is charged of embezzlement,

65
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:28,143
there is a statute of limitation.

66
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,957
The penalty can only cover last few years.

67
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:33,664
I feel like I'm going to go crazy. What am I supposed to do?!

68
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:35,772
I feel like my blood is boiling

69
00:04:35,772 --> 00:04:38,483
how am I supposed to stand it?!

70
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:42,416
Excuse me, President.  May I say just one thing?

71
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,785
Yes.

72
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:46,429
We've all spent some time in prison...

73
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:48,206
moreover solitary cells. We were infamous.

74
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:51,144
We are willing to stake our life, if it's for our Master.

75
00:04:51,144 --> 00:04:52,845
So, please leave it to us.

76
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:54,645
Until Choi Jae Gyum is taken away in handcuffs,

77
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:57,996
we will protect Saint Honore.

78
00:04:57,996 --> 00:04:58,883
Thank you.

79
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:01,283
No, you have trusted us and made a use of us,

80
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:02,630
and has helped Master Park and Seung Ji,

81
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,545
So it is our duty to show

82
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:07,930
our appreciation.

83
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,436
So please do not worry, and go back inside.

84
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:14,755
After this is over,

85
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:17,314
you will all be officially hired.

86
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:19,567
It is not because of what I heard from you tonight,

87
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:23,160
but it is a response to your ability.

88
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,699
So I ask for your continued good work.

89
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:29,576
Also, I'm sorry to have shown you my shortcomings and unbecoming of President.

90
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:33,770
I hope for your kind understanding.

91
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:59,243
President! Congratulations!

92
00:05:59,243 --> 00:06:00,482
Hey, Seung Ji, Congratulations!

93
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:03,732
Oh, thanks!  It is hard to run the store all alone, isn't it?

94
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:05,957
Well, Gil Dong Goo Ahjusshi does a good job helping me out.

95
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:08,625
Ah, Ajusshi was asking when we were going to have the party?

96
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,055
We were just talking about that.

97
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:14,693
Oh, right. What's Seung Ji's real name?

98
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:19,460
Jang Min Woo.

99
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:23,453
So do we have to change Ko Seung Ji to Jang Min Woo then?

100
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:26,431
Wait, isn't he supposed to become Park Seung Ji?

101
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:31,952
Grandpa, tell the truth.  Who do I seem to be?

102
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:35,498
Jang Min Woo?  Park Seung Ji?  Ko Seung Ji?

103
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:36,743
Ko Seung Ji.

104
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:40,134
That's why we should just leave it as it's been.  It's bothersome, so let's not change anything.

105
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,546
Let's talk about it later, punk.

106
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:46,662
What?  Speak up.

107
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:50,144
He's your maternal grandfather now but nothing has changed.

108
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:52,033
You've reunited after 20 years.

109
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:54,681
We saw each other yesterday, the day before, and everyday for five years.

110
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,506
Should I pretend to have met him for the first time in 20 years?

111
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:58,890
And what's so important about a maternal grandfather - grandson relationship?

112
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,624
Grandpa and Hedgehog's is the best. 
  Right?  Aren't I right?

113
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,717
Why is your expression so grave?

114
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,636
Were you thinking of your lost grandson the whole time you were living with me?

115
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,820
Hey, are you jealous of yourself right now?

116
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,971
Is this punk for real?

117
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:16,043
Grandpa has been my ranking number 0, but that means I wasn't for him.

118
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:17,808
Is it okay for a person to be so unfair?

119
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:21,182
Be quiet! Just bring your mom.

120
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:25,114
Why are you being grumpy?

121
00:07:25,114 --> 00:07:27,126
Oh, really!

122
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:29,590
You guys just wanted a laugh.

123
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:41,212
You said you would tell us everything.  Are you drinking your water having second thoughts?

124
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:43,767
I've already told them everything.

125
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:47,515
So, you should as well.

126
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:52,482
Did you work all those years at Saint Honore because you were planning to go to jail for Chairman Choi?

127
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:57,343
I didn't actually do anything, so I probably won't go to prison, right?

128
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,949
Exchange of trade secrets, embezzlement, misappropriation, fraud,

129
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:04,681
on top of that, murder incitement and the record of murder.

130
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:08,889
You've been helping that person for ten years. I can surely see how you'd get away and be fine.

131
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,408
Let's make this easy.

132
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,760
Pick one out of two choices.

133
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,918
Do you want to be considered a witness or accomplice in this case?

134
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,122
Gosh, I called President because I wasn't an accomplice.

135
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:23,116
If you knew it was wrong and still assisted him, that is an accomplice.

136
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:25,162
If you don't decide now,

137
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:30,271
no matter how much you say you sided with President Choi Won Il, we cannot help you later.

138
00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:33,086
The Chairman kept threatening that he'd kill me if I said anything.

139
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:36,801
I really felt as if I would die.

140
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:39,527
We will keep you safe.

141
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:49,542
Why has that person been out there keeping watch like a bodyguard?

142
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:52,665
Ahoy, Pentjak Silat!

143
00:08:58,273 --> 00:09:00,299
What is Pentjak Silat?

144
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:03,134
It's Malaysian martial arts. He's a master of it,

145
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:05,146
So, Won Il was learning that from him to beat me.

146
00:09:05,146 --> 00:09:06,368
What a silly thing to do.

147
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:08,194
But, why is Pentjak Silat here?

148
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:10,464
Is he here to fight someone?

149
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:21,631
As they say, meat is for those who are accustomed to eating it, so calling mother should also be the same.

150
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:26,647
It was hard to say "Grandpa, I love you." the first time,but once he started, now he says it all the time.

151
00:09:26,647 --> 00:09:30,171
I'm sure you will also hear "Mom, I love you."more than enough from now.

152
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:35,590
So, don't worry about a thing and for the first time in 20 years sleep the sweetest sleep of your life tonight.

153
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,431
You've endured much during that time.

154
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:42,446
I was blessed to have you in my life for 10 of those years.

155
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:43,577
Pardon?

156
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:49,305
I know very well Seung Ji wouldn't have survived prison life without you.

157
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:52,509
You were by his side for those 10 years

158
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:57,029
playing the role of his Hyung.  I thank you so much, Gi Tae.

159
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,621
I thank you, too.

160
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:05,713
I am so happy I could die because poor Seung Ji's family turned out to be you and not some strangers.

161
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:06,827
Tell me honestly.

162
00:10:06,827 --> 00:10:08,670
Why did you follow me here?

163
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,619
Gi Tae asked me to come with him.

164
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:15,233
Grandpa, Gi Tae and me came together, but you came in your own car.  Is that coming together?

165
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:20,374
Then you should ask Gi Tae.  Why are you asking me?

166
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:23,500
How can I ask when Grandpa was there?

167
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,619
It's because of Choi Jae Gyum, right?

168
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:32,801
I bought a baseball bat and left it in the car.

169
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:34,427
Be aware of that.

170
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:36,174
Why a baseball bat?

171
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:40,374
Tell me exactly what you've heard, right now!

172
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:43,608
Jang Su Suk got scared and called President,

173
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:46,163
and President told Vice-Chief to send me

174
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:48,982
to take you and grandfather home and to keep watch.

175
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,633
Why?

176
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:55,993
He told Jang Su Suk to,

177
00:10:55,993 --> 00:10:59,016
get rid of

178
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:01,329
you and Grandpa.

179
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:07,291
Where are you going?

180
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,134
- Let go.
- Tell me where you are going?

181
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:10,264
Do you really not know?

182
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:12,519
Seung Ji, please, just this once, hold back your temper.

183
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:15,343
The President finally found you after twenty years.

184
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:18,175
You want him to go thorugh a horrible situation when he isn't even done celebrating?

185
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:20,961
If you cause a scene for him to find out that Choi Jae Gyum is your dad,

186
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:22,807
the President will faint.

187
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,155
You mean Chairman Choi asked to get rid of

188
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:28,006
his son and father-in-law?

189
00:11:28,006 --> 00:11:30,700
How can you call that a person?

190
00:11:32,677 --> 00:11:36,415
Oh no.  Why would there be anything wrong between me and Won Il?

191
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:40,407
Our Won Il is just trying to do things as he learned them in America but

192
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:43,791
it's just not working out when it comes to making Korean cakes.

193
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,714
So I am trying to show my objection,

194
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:51,867
and I need the 10% share of yours,

195
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:54,818
so at least send me a letter of entrust.

196
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:56,505
Please.

197
00:11:56,505 --> 00:11:57,989
This girl...

198
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:01,394
doesn't say she will give her shares.

199
00:12:01,394 --> 00:12:03,572
Is she going to send the letter of entrust?

200
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:04,482
I don't know.

201
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:07,999
She keeps saying that she will, but I can't really trust her.

202
00:12:08,368 --> 00:12:13,520
The quickest way is for you to get on a plane to go see her and get her to personally stamp it yourself.

203
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,826
No, I can't.

204
00:12:14,826 --> 00:12:16,793
In a state of such great sales,

205
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:19,863
if I leave the office too, we will completely be left out.

206
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,217
Honey, look at this.

207
00:12:21,382 --> 00:12:23,151
Here.  This.

208
00:12:26,654 --> 00:12:29,017
Isn't this manipulated by Won Il?

209
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:32,431
How could Won Il have made it up when I received it first hand?

210
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:35,141
Anyway, what you've earned in one month

211
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:38,477
the two of them were able to bring in, in 10 days.

212
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:41,441
If they only make 5000,000 tomorrow, that's it. The end.

213
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,763
Why did you write a contract?  A contract?

214
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:47,001
I know.

215
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,851
What are Go Seung Ji and Grandpa to each other that

216
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:55,436
he looked like he could eat me that day when I criticized Grandpa.

217
00:12:55,436 --> 00:12:57,844
They have different last names, so maybe his daughter's son?

218
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:01,560
Ah, what business do you have in other people's family trees?

219
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:07,530
I'm curious as to why such a great man worked in such a crummy little bakery.

220
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:13,448
Is there anyway to bribe someone in their family to side with us by using a bit of money?

221
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:16,010
Don't spend your time doing such senseless things!

222
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:46,880

223
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,926
Then Chairman Choi asked to get rid of his son and his father-in-law?

224
00:13:57,926 --> 00:14:00,158
Is that a person?

225
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,153
If he is trying to separate forever

226
00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:08,570
those who met after 20 years,

227
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:11,090
he isn't a person, right?

228
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:14,918
If he is not a person,

229
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:17,970
then he shouldn't be treated as one.

230
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:21,736
I'm back.

231
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,329
Oh, you're here?

232
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:30,526
What about Seung Ji...Min Woo?

233
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:32,619
He is laying your blankets down for you.

234
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:35,082
Ah yes, let's call him Seung Ji, ok?

235
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:36,575
Yes.

236
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:46,374
I pulled out some clothes I need for Autumn.

237
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:51,236
I took a look at this, and I was really smart and calculating when I was young.

238
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:52,102
Why is that?

239
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:54,173
My cake drawings are excellent,

240
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:57,672
I drew Won Il so he isn't very good looking and I drew hearts for Panda.

241
00:14:58,716 --> 00:15:00,157
Listen to me for a sec.

242
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:00,727
Grandpa did you see this?

243
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:03,954
We can look at that later!  Let's have a meeting.  A meeting.

244
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:07,690
A meeting for the party food?

245
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,899
Hey!

246
00:15:09,297 --> 00:15:14,386
You.  Are you going to keep using formal speech with him?

247
00:15:15,354 --> 00:15:17,893
Just comfortably say this bastard, that bastard with me, huh?

248
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:18,929
Ok.

249
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:21,924
Are you going to keep call her Noona?

250
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:24,331
That would be like a dysfuntional family.

251
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:26,210
Call her mama.

252
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,594
What nonsense are you talking about?

253
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:32,333
Oh!  "Mama" as in Mama's Boy!

254
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:37,198
That kind of Mama, or another, later you can just change one syllable and get it right.

255
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:39,195
Grandpa as usual knows me too much!

256
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:40,020
Mama.

257
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,884
Okay.

258
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:42,019
Deal.

259
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,806
Then mama is also okay with mama?

260
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:47,422
You need to say, yes. Yes.

261
00:15:47,422 --> 00:15:48,476
Yes.

262
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:50,720
One more thing to discuss.

263
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,859
What else?

264
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:53,657
What?  You don't want me to call you Grandpa?

265
00:15:53,657 --> 00:15:56,190
We have a good news.

266
00:15:57,096 --> 00:15:58,579
What?

267
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:04,369
My father and the detective said

268
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:09,168
to deliver these documents to you and have you get documents ready by tomorrow.

269
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,257
then everything will be ready.

270
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:15,224
If we file a report of embezzlement and misappropriation, then wouldn't he just be arrested?

271
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,070
Why is it so complicated?

272
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,273
It's not easy to obtain real proof.

273
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:22,707
It's not a civil case between individuals, but a criminal case.

274
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:27,315
Can we get him for the offense he comitted  in the past or charge him for what he did today.

275
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:32,291
My father and I asked the detective about everything in detail but,

276
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:37,493
Either he is lucky or we are unlucky, that the horrible things Choi Jae Gyum commited,

277
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:39,815
are all statute-barred.

278
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:43,997
He was hiding here quietly for the last twenty years,

279
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:47,257
and he has been rich enough not to commit any troubles.

280
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,182
That's it.

281
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:54,030
And accusatorial procedure is required for what he did to In Ah Kyung.

282
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,991
Arrest is impossible without it.

283
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:58,394
What about the murder incitation he gave to Jang Su Suk?

284
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:03,343
He can get away for now by saying it was a mere anger,

285
00:17:03,343 --> 00:17:05,373
and a trial required.

286
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:11,817
The reason criminals stay fine as they were, was all because of the complicated procedures.

287
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:17,216
Are Hedgehog and Grandpa alright?

288
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:20,132
We sent them home early,

289
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:22,423
but we don't know what to do from tommorow...

290
00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:23,849
We can't explain this situation either.

291
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:30,941
Until Choi Jae Gyum is caught, shouldn't those two kept home?

292
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,948
I'll go after work.

293
00:17:40,214 --> 00:17:42,163
I think it's right to sleep with Grandpa tonight.

294
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:45,540
From now on, shouldn't you live with Grandpa?

295
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,085
That' how you'll all become a family.

296
00:17:47,085 --> 00:17:50,672
Oh I didn't think of that...

297
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:52,329
The reason Hedgehog moved in here was

298
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:53,635
because you wanted to let Grandfather and Ahjumma

299
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:56,686
live together as a family.

300
00:17:56,686 --> 00:17:59,182
Now you are a part of the family, and you're saying you will live separately?

301
00:17:59,182 --> 00:18:01,359
Then what about you?

302
00:18:02,004 --> 00:18:03,342
It's kinda weird living seperatley.

303
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:06,350
Usually boyfriends and girlfriends don't move in with each other.

304
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,678
When sleeping under the same roof, it's husband and wife.

305
00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:11,260
We already have lived together.

306
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,223
Then, are we a married couple?

307
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:15,763
We were a family, as well.

308
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:20,436
Anyway I'm folding Hedgehog's clothes

309
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:22,919
It doesn't seem like you will have the time to pack it yourself

310
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,692
Complicated issues are not just one or two things.

311
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:27,183
Then, let's have a meeting tomorrow.

312
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:28,809
A meeting for what?

313
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:31,254
I thought you said you weren't very good with meetings.

314
00:18:31,254 --> 00:18:33,002
This time we have to do it.

315
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:34,176
Sleep well and I'll see you tomorrow.

316
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,964
Okay.

317
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:41,100
Since its the first time you guys are sleeping together as a family, sleep well and have nice dreams

318
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,886
Okay

319
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:43,566
Sleep well, okay?

320
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:51,860
Wow, telepathy went through!

321
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,646
Actually, I was waiting for you.

322
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:56,202
Right now,

323
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:59,390
an awesome cake is in front of my eyes.

324
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,991
Please, try it and let's have a plan meeting.

325
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:05,124
I don't do well with meetings.

326
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:07,692
I've never done one and don't want to either.

327
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:10,264
Then, forget about the plan meeting,

328
00:19:10,264 --> 00:19:12,867
and let's have a conversation about the awesome cake.

329
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:15,539
I don't do well with conversations either.

330
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,805
I'm a person who uses fist before words.

331
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:20,160
Then, just come over and try it,

332
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,934
and explain to us,

333
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:24,925
just how we can make this kind of cake.

334
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:27,031
Now, we are talking.

335
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:28,459
I'd be happy to do that.

336
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,693
Don't move and wait for me.

337
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:32,908
I'll be right there, like the wind.

338
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:35,568
1, 2, 3, GO!

339
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:38,773
I thought that was the beginning for us,

340
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:41,750
but actually, we started twenty years go.

341
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:43,726
We did.

342
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,564
How can he fly inside the wind?

343
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:50,051
Is he a lier?

344
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:53,780
1, 2, 3, go...

345
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:58,627
He is not a Go-Stop loving player, would he be?

346
00:19:58,627 --> 00:20:02,544
Instead of words, he uses his fists..a trouble maker fighter?

347
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:05,561
He won't be.....

348
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:09,256
He makes such a beautiful cake...

349
00:20:09,256 --> 00:20:11,694
He couldn't be so dangerous, could he?

350
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:23,310
That's when I thought I first started to like Hedgehog...

351
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:28,832
Instead, it was twenty years ago.

352
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:32,103
Also today,

353
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:35,459
are you planning to say "I love you" all night and keep me up?

354
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,225
I need to think about something.

355
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:41,442
What kind of thinking are you doing holding my belly?

356
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:45,052
I can think better when I have my arms around your belly.

357
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,708
Pan Da Yang told me to live with you from here on.

358
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,412
Since, family usually live together.

359
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:52,295
Do the come-here, go-there.

360
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:53,880
What's that?

361
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,321
Live here, live over there, do what you want to do.

362
00:20:58,321 --> 00:21:01,271
You don't want to get dumped by living only here.

363
00:21:02,423 --> 00:21:04,540
She can't dump me now.

364
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,540
We have 20 years of shining history.

365
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,786
Even after 20 years, men and women can find reason to leave each other.

366
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:14,525
Be good to her instead of fooling around and getting dumped.

367
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:15,860
I got it.

368
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,645
But, what are we going to do about what we talked about earlier?

369
00:21:21,056 --> 00:21:24,394
I'll do what you want.  You choose.

370
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:29,057
Then, I'll consult with Pan Da Yang and Won Il

371
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:30,060
and decide.

372
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,397
Okay, do that.

373
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:37,986
Grandpa, let us take one picture together.

374
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:43,678
Those promoting id pictures with before and after?

375
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,498
Not that kind of picture.

376
00:21:45,498 --> 00:21:47,642
We are gathered here like this so, we are a family.

377
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:49,719
That kind of family portrait.

378
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:51,361
It's "I love you."

379
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:52,508
I love you.

380
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:12,090
Good morning.

381
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:17,189
What are doing out here?  Get inside.

382
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:20,364
Get inside, quickly.

383
00:22:20,746 --> 00:22:23,301
Because Choi Jae Gyum might kill me this morning?

384
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:26,153
Hey, do I look like an easy prey?

385
00:22:26,153 --> 00:22:27,948
He must be a few levels above you.

386
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:29,610
Don't underestimate him and just be careful.

387
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,065
How about grandfather?

388
00:22:31,065 --> 00:22:33,691
He's got several layers of pattisiers surrounding to protect him,

389
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:35,951
so he is almost difficult to find.

390
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:38,889
Just be patient for little longer.

391
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:41,529
Choi Jae Gyum, is definitely done for.

392
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:47,329
Perhaps, you

393
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:50,758
think grandpa and I would really work at Saint-Honore?

394
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:52,780
If not, why did you write a contract?

395
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,039
That's my special skill. Didn't you know I wrote Da Yang a contract too?

396
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,912
Of course, I don't know. How would I know that?

397
00:23:00,771 --> 00:23:01,971
Then

398
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:03,807
you're against it?

399
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:07,969
Do I have the right to agree or disagree?

400
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,090
Of course, you do.

401
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:10,991
Why?

402
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:13,194
Maculinea teleius
Aspidomorpha transparipennis,

403
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:18,136
Rhyssa persuasoria
Homotropus tarsatorius

404
00:23:18,136 --> 00:23:22,407
You taught me all that and because of that I was able to come all this way.

405
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:32,548
Anyways, what is this?

406
00:23:32,548 --> 00:23:36,352
It's smiliar to the Maculinea teleius spell.

407
00:23:36,352 --> 00:23:39,006
But why is this English so short?

408
00:23:39,006 --> 00:23:43,558
This English isn't short but your English is, you bastard.

409
00:23:44,212 --> 00:23:47,365
So what does this mean?

410
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:51,564
Keep calm and keep on with what you have been doing.

411
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:55,420
So you want me to go out and work?

412
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,192
My dad's

413
00:23:57,192 --> 00:24:01,463
last song to me was "Maculinea teleius"

414
00:24:01,463 --> 00:24:05,186
and the last thing he handed to me was this.

415
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:08,783
That's why this looks so old.

416
00:24:10,141 --> 00:24:11,709
Have it.

417
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:13,463
Why?

418
00:24:13,463 --> 00:24:18,060
Because it was something I looked at during the past 20 years whenever I thought of you, you should keep it.

419
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,683
Disgusting.

420
00:24:19,683 --> 00:24:23,141
This guy had me in his heart for 20 years?

421
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:28,166
Since it was something I was planning on giving to you once I met you, you should keep it.

422
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,033
No, it's alright. It was a keepsake from your father.

423
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:32,835
You hold on to it. I tell you whenever I want to see it.

424
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:34,955
HYUNG!!HYUNG!!

425
00:24:34,955 --> 00:24:37,175
HYUNG!!!

426
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,574
HYUNG!

427
00:24:39,574 --> 00:24:41,422
Why are you running around so early in the morning?

428
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:44,399
The examination results came out. You are

429
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,733
father and son.

430
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:49,484
Can I keep this?

431
00:24:49,484 --> 00:24:53,235
Keep it. I have one more. I'll show Hyung that later.

432
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:01,975
 Gene Analysis Appraisal Statement

433
00:25:06,975 --> 00:25:08,576
 Name: Choi Jae Gyum; Ko Seung Ji. 
Relationship: father; son.

434
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:11,415
 No. 1~11: all shared.

435
00:25:11,415 --> 00:25:14,686
 Probability of Paternity: 99.9%.

436
00:25:41,793 --> 00:25:45,551
I guess that was what Hedgehog wanted to talk about.

437
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:46,984
What do you think about it?

438
00:25:46,984 --> 00:25:51,434
Of course I'm for the idea. After all Cafe Panda and our house was kept

439
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:53,962
to find Min Woo and we found him.

440
00:25:53,962 --> 00:25:58,731
And with that Min Woo, we have the chance to build an even greater cake shop than Saint-Honore.

441
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,432
Why would we refuse such a good offer?

442
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:04,552
We have to forget the past and move on to the new age.

443
00:26:07,688 --> 00:26:12,588
I don't think I can decide easily.

444
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:16,751
Cafe Panda disappearing is...

445
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:21,972
I too think Mozarto closing is a bit...

446
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:25,068
What does grandpa want to do?

447
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:27,851
He said he would follow the majority vote.

448
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:31,707
He said everything in life has both merits and demerits.

449
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:34,890
Who proposed it?

450
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:39,872
The one who ordered the croque en bouche.
 The representative from the magazine.

451
00:26:39,872 --> 00:26:42,675
That person must have a lot of money.

452
00:26:42,675 --> 00:26:46,680
Much bigger than Saint Honore, opening in both Korea and France at the same time.

453
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:53,146
The pattisier school and the hotel dad used to go to, belongs to that woman's in-laws.

454
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:58,253
Like Grandpa, shouldn't Hedgehog play in big waters now?(be famous)

455
00:26:58,253 --> 00:27:03,821
If we accept the proposal, your aunt 
and Mi Ra unni can work with us also.

456
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:08,273
Let's do it. We should start a new journey. It's a chance that came after 20 years.

457
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:12,008
We aren't even investing our own money in it and we all get to work together.

458
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:16,113
We can all take the share. It's a present from grandfather to all of us.

459
00:27:16,113 --> 00:27:19,220
Why wouldn't we accept?

460
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:25,426
I do think Hedgehog fits better in that kitchen rather than the kitchen here.

461
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:30,442
I think grandpa fits better in that kitchen than in the kitchen at Mozarto as well.

462
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:35,054
For both of them, the kitchen there suits better than the kitchen at Saint-Honore.

463
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:38,194
Let's all do our high fives and go tell aunt.

464
00:27:38,194 --> 00:27:40,734
Hurry. Hurry.

465
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:54,664
Are they playing or dating?

466
00:27:54,664 --> 00:27:56,846
Should I shoot some arrows of love?

467
00:27:56,846 --> 00:27:58,326
This cupid, Gil Dong Goo?

468
00:27:58,326 --> 00:28:00,538
We can go there together now!

469
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:02,113
Bye.

470
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:14,121
Come in.

471
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:16,948
What is it?

472
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:18,257
What do you mean?

473
00:28:18,257 --> 00:28:21,315
What's the person that says "What do you mean"?

474
00:28:21,315 --> 00:28:23,348
I'm Hwang Bong Gu. What's what?

475
00:28:23,348 --> 00:28:24,651
"What's What"

476
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:30,646
is said with an expression that means that person is Da Na's man.

477
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:34,682
What is your intention of delving into

478
00:28:34,682 --> 00:28:37,456
your identity at this moment?

479
00:28:37,456 --> 00:28:39,975
Da Na thinks the same way too, right?

480
00:28:39,975 --> 00:28:41,766
I'm not mistaken, right?

481
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,182
Your reaction is surely different from Hedgehog's.

482
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:51,986
I'm asking why Da Na was high fiving you.

483
00:28:51,986 --> 00:28:54,627
That was because Boss got an offer.

484
00:28:54,627 --> 00:28:58,428
To manage a joint bakery of Korea and France.

485
00:28:58,428 --> 00:29:00,631
Then why is Da Na so happy about that?

486
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:03,282
We will close Cafe Panda,

487
00:29:03,282 --> 00:29:05,761
and all work there together.

488
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:07,560
My goodness, is that true?

489
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,185
That means there will be a way for me to become a real patissier?

490
00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:15,966
If I knew this was going to happen, I should have learned french earlier.

491
00:29:15,966 --> 00:29:17,601
Bonjour! Bonjour!

492
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:18,866
Ahjusshi.

493
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:24,858
If you have time to learn french, why don't you get the baking certificate?

494
00:30:19,577 --> 00:30:21,915
Escort Grandfather and leave work early today.

495
00:30:21,915 --> 00:30:24,269
Grandpa, Gi Tae, and Won Yi already left early.

496
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:26,263
I've got some work to do, so I can't leave.

497
00:30:26,263 --> 00:30:27,600
What kind of work?

498
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:31,761
I realized that I've never baked Grandpa a cake before.

499
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:34,445
What? Does that make sense?

500
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:36,315
Aigo, miserable....

501
00:30:36,315 --> 00:30:38,923
That, he waited and lived with a punk like you.

502
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:40,724
I know.

503
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:45,281
I'm going to use some of your ingredients for something personal.

504
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:48,512
Use as much as you want and it's okay to use it all.

505
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:52,346
So make one for your mom too.

506
00:30:52,346 --> 00:30:53,972
But that's still...

507
00:30:53,972 --> 00:30:56,399
Listen to Hyung.

508
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,943
Then, not seperately.

509
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:02,746
I'll just make it bigger.

510
00:31:02,746 --> 00:31:04,599
Acknowledging me as Hyung?

511
00:31:06,818 --> 00:31:09,851
We don't have the sales report yet,

512
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:13,571
but I have been checking the shop all day today,

513
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:17,227
they displayed at lease 5 new ones for each cake.

514
00:31:17,227 --> 00:31:20,057
They get sold as soon as they come out.

515
00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:22,590
We don't even need to see the sales report.

516
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,968
It's the end. It's going to be hell from tomorrow.

517
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:29,293
There's still time until today ends

518
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:32,314
so let's just wait and see.

519
00:31:38,694 --> 00:31:41,014
Yeah, it's me.

520
00:31:41,014 --> 00:31:43,050
Are you not near yet?

521
00:31:44,016 --> 00:31:47,319
Don't come to the underground parking lot,

522
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,991
come to the overground one instead.

523
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,113
Yeah. Okay.

524
00:31:55,426 --> 00:31:56,856
Where are you going, President?

525
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:59,153
I am going to go round up the contract deal with my mother.

526
00:31:59,153 --> 00:32:03,285
Before that, you have something more important to round up, so please come with me.

527
00:32:03,285 --> 00:32:04,947
Hurry.

528
00:32:07,774 --> 00:32:09,592
Why are you digging over here?

529
00:32:09,592 --> 00:32:13,535
This is the area, where it's the fullest with the energy of the earth,

530
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:16,296
and I'm told this is the best of the best "secret methods".

531
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:18,577
"Secret method"? 
What is that?

532
00:32:18,577 --> 00:32:22,019
Methods which have been passed down from long ago.

533
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:24,161
Are you kidding me?

534
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:29,001
Does this look like a joke? Can't you see my arm shaking from digging?  And, my legs....

535
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:32,493
Can't you see they are about to fall asleep?

536
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:38,694
You are only causing more work.

537
00:32:38,694 --> 00:32:43,906
Bend forward at your waist, grab your ankles and, turn three times around.

538
00:32:43,906 --> 00:32:46,681
That's the method to stop hiccups.

539
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,551
Hurry hurry.

540
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:49,624
Aren't you going to do it quickly?

541
00:32:49,624 --> 00:32:53,854
Believe in the "secret methods".
Please believe.  Quickly.

542
00:32:56,035 --> 00:32:57,628
One.

543
00:32:57,628 --> 00:32:58,839
Two.

544
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,542
Two!

545
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:03,859
Three.

546
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:05,396
One more time,

547
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:07,466
one more time.

548
00:33:07,466 --> 00:33:10,329
So dizzy.

549
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:13,463
Ah. It really stopped.

550
00:33:13,463 --> 00:33:18,600
This is the power of the "secret method".
Now do you believe?

551
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,188
But, what kind of "secret method" are you going to use that you need to dig a hole for?

552
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:27,457
Sit over here, just like me. 
Come over here, sit down.

553
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:30,572
Hurry.

554
00:33:33,523 --> 00:33:35,285
Tada!

555
00:33:35,285 --> 00:33:36,869
What are those?

556
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:42,307
What do you think they are? They are evil beings that need to be buried in the ground.

557
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,800
Are you making a grave of Choi Jae Gyum?

558
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:58,444
That's not it.  If we do this, he will realize he came from dirt and that he'll end up in dirt,

559
00:33:58,444 --> 00:34:01,587
and he'll stop his evil doings.

560
00:34:02,845 --> 00:34:07,735
I guess even though you say you hate him, you don't like to put him in a grave.

561
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:13,456
Because your heart is so soft that I have to use the "secret method".

562
00:34:13,456 --> 00:34:16,377
Choi Jae Gyum is trying to get rid of Hedgehog and Grandpa.

563
00:34:16,377 --> 00:34:19,950
If you're upset over digging a little hole with a spoon,

564
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:24,075
how will you win over Choi Jae Gyum?

565
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:29,509
We're finished, right?

566
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:32,908
Of course, we are done.  Were you planning to plant grass here?

567
00:34:32,908 --> 00:34:34,394
Hurry and get up.

568
00:34:34,394 --> 00:34:36,142
Wait a second.

569
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:39,613
My legs hurt.

570
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:03,877
Ah.

571
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,643
Did I understand it incorrectly?

572
00:35:07,643 --> 00:35:10,011
Was it not a secret method to repel the exile of evil,

573
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:13,181
but a secret method for dating?

574
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:23,553
Ah...hey, it's you...

575
00:35:23,553 --> 00:35:25,898
-You came?
-Yes.

576
00:35:49,934 --> 00:35:53,628
Money buys everything for you, Jang Byung Chun.

577
00:35:53,628 --> 00:35:56,166
You can't even earn a penny.

578
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,106
My car is at the next subway station. 
Why don't you go there?

579
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:14,037
Grandpa, why are you giving me this?

580
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:18,589
For waiting and finding our Min Woo,

581
00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:19,878
I'm grateful.

582
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,871
You know it's not something I deserve a gift for.

583
00:36:22,871 --> 00:36:26,822
To me it's something I must give a gift for.

584
00:36:26,822 --> 00:36:29,786
Don't say anything and accept it.

585
00:36:29,786 --> 00:36:35,843
That's right. Noona hurry up and open it. 
Grandpa went around the department 
store over an hour looking for it.

586
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:40,861
He went around for exactly 
one hour and thirty five minutes.

587
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:45,243
I'm sorry and thank you.

588
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,662
It's so pretty. How did you choose so well?

589
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:01,109
Let me try it on.

590
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:04,333
It's a relief that you like it.

591
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:06,218
I'll help you.

592
00:37:06,218 --> 00:37:10,133
How much is it? Is it a diamond or cubic zirconia?

593
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:11,633
Ahjusshi!

594
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:17,249
President, is it just a present?
Or, is it for a marriage?

595
00:37:17,249 --> 00:37:20,042
Ahjusshi!

596
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:22,102
But...

597
00:37:22,102 --> 00:37:25,280
Isn't it a little awkward for me to be around also?

598
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,579
Since Won Yi has a good relationship with the director,

599
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,122
would it be good to get her to charm him?

600
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:33,881
It would be beneficial to get Director Choi if Won Yi is around.

601
00:37:33,881 --> 00:37:34,688
Right?

602
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:40,498
They say men get scared the most of the department stores after they get discharged from the Army.
 Grandpa went to sleep already, 
said he was tired.

603
00:37:40,498 --> 00:37:43,123
Won Yi, stay here.

604
00:37:43,123 --> 00:37:45,057
Why?

605
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:48,405
I want to have a drink! Hey, let's drink beer.
 It's been a long time.

606
00:37:48,405 --> 00:37:51,889
Go get some beer and chicken.

607
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:52,673
How much chicken?

608
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:53,879
Just one.

609
00:37:53,879 --> 00:37:57,089
Are you eating Hyung?

610
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:12,706

611
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,394
They are carnations for the past 20 years.

612
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:19,047
Do they look like carnations?

613
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:22,397
More than you might think.

614
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,907
What's that small basket for?

615
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:28,270
It's for Panda Yang.

616
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:32,497
Why do you give a carnation to Panda Yang?

617
00:38:32,497 --> 00:38:36,343
In place of my grandpa and my parents,

618
00:38:36,343 --> 00:38:39,366
she took care of me.

619
00:38:55,997 --> 00:38:59,315
 His child is there, but not Grandpa?

620
00:38:59,315 --> 00:39:02,257
 Why? If you gave me a chore, then you have to tell me.

621
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:05,734
I will tell you later. Hang up for now.

622
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:20,587
Who is it?

623
00:39:20,587 --> 00:39:21,513
Who is it?

624
00:39:21,513 --> 00:39:23,326
Is this Park Byung Moo's residence?

625
00:39:23,326 --> 00:39:26,239
Yes, it is.

626
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:30,695
I brought flowers sent by Choi Won Il.

627
00:39:30,695 --> 00:39:31,903
Pardon?

628
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:35,383
Why flowers at night?

629
00:39:35,383 --> 00:39:38,185
Excuse me for coming this late.

630
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:42,144
No one was here during the day.

631
00:39:42,144 --> 00:39:46,156
-Excuse me.
-You can put them there.

632
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:50,647
It's better to put them properly...

633
00:39:59,435 --> 00:40:04,951
You're working as a director at Saint Honore, right?

634
00:40:04,951 --> 00:40:07,334
Isn't that right?

635
00:40:07,334 --> 00:40:09,514
You...

636
00:40:09,514 --> 00:40:11,448
You...

637
00:40:11,448 --> 00:40:14,770
Are you Choi Jae Gyum...?!
Is that you?!

638
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,198
Yes.

639
00:40:17,198 --> 00:40:19,262
It's been a long time, father-in-law!

640
00:40:20,762 --> 00:40:22,991
It's hot, hot.

641
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:28,417
It's delicious.

642
00:40:29,812 --> 00:40:32,033
Ah, you guys are really wrecking the mood.

643
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:34,946
Pay some attention to me! You proposed chicken and beer.

644
00:40:35,062 --> 00:40:39,680
Why are you looking around so much?
Are you waiting for someone?

645
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,394
My dad?

646
00:40:42,394 --> 00:40:44,371
What are you talking about?

647
00:40:44,371 --> 00:40:48,685
It looked like my dad's car passed by earlier.

648
00:40:48,685 --> 00:40:51,014
It really is my dad's car!

649
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:52,644
Hey!

650
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:55,045
Why are they being like that?

651
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:25,254
Since Mom is a woman, she might
 get mad if I only give it to Da Yang.

652
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:28,369
I should have just made Grandpa's seperately.

653
00:41:33,497 --> 00:41:35,237
Hedgehog, you came?

654
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:44,872
Why did you come out?
I'd be in shortly.

655
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:47,753
I wanted to see you quicker.

656
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,809
Huh?

657
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:55,260
I've never seen that before.

658
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,908
Grandpa gave it to me.

659
00:41:57,908 --> 00:41:59,945
Grandpa really!

660
00:41:59,945 --> 00:42:04,394
I knew it when he went out early in the morning. 
What happens to these then?

661
00:42:04,394 --> 00:42:05,411
What are they?

662
00:42:05,411 --> 00:42:07,908
They are cakes.

663
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:20,806
It's a carnation cake.

664
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:22,631
Take this to Grandpa.

665
00:42:22,631 --> 00:42:24,408
No. Please just open it.

666
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:26,378
Hurry.

667
00:42:32,335 --> 00:42:34,337
What, Hyung?

668
00:42:36,225 --> 00:42:37,928
WHAT?

669
00:42:43,368 --> 00:42:45,447
I got it.

670
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,276
Mom, stay over at Grandpa's.

671
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:00,299
Oh, Choi Won Yi, why aren't 
you coming home yet?

672
00:43:03,354 --> 00:43:05,118
What did you say?

673
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:24,195
Grandpa just left via 911.
There were a lot of policemen here.

674
00:43:24,195 --> 00:43:26,070
What to do?

675
00:43:27,195 --> 00:43:29,316
Grandpa...

676
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:31,525
don't die.

677
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,422
You can't die!

678
00:43:34,422 --> 00:43:37,434
Not until I say you can!

679
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,678
You cannot die!

680
00:43:40,678 --> 00:43:42,783
Grandpa!

681
00:43:42,783 --> 00:43:44,998
I'm on my way.

682
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:47,598
Tell Choi Jae Gyum to come.

683
00:43:47,598 --> 00:43:51,141
It's not something I can just talk about with you, Mom!

684
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:53,438
Why don't you call Choi Jae Gyum to come over immediately?

685
00:43:53,438 --> 00:43:58,198
I don't reallly need to call him to come. 
He'll be here soon anyway since he 
has something to talk to me about.

686
00:43:58,198 --> 00:44:00,805
Anyway, what's the matter with you all of a sudden?

687
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:04,048
You want to get us together, so you can draw up a contract to take over the business.

688
00:44:04,048 --> 00:44:07,661
Don't tell Choi Jae Gyum about finding 
Min Woo. Just tell him to come immediately.

689
00:44:07,661 --> 00:44:09,029
What?!

690
00:44:09,029 --> 00:44:12,235
Min Woo...was found?! 
Where?!

691
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:13,723
Saint Honore.

692
00:44:13,723 --> 00:44:16,483
What are you talking about?
How could he be there?

693
00:44:16,483 --> 00:44:22,995
So let's get Choi Jae Gyum to come over, 
and let's all hear what he has to say right now!

694
00:44:24,344 --> 00:44:28,170
Hello!
Hello!

695
00:44:28,718 --> 00:44:33,841
What is he talking about?
We had him here as an employee then?

696
00:44:35,963 --> 00:44:38,238
Ah, where are you?

697
00:44:38,238 --> 00:44:41,488
We have to talk about the entrust, so come over right now.

698
00:44:41,488 --> 00:44:44,319
Hurry.

699
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:50,300
Could it be...Ko Seung Ji?!

700
00:44:50,300 --> 00:45:30,261

701
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:04,057
Choi Jae Gyum.

702
00:46:04,057 --> 00:46:06,406
It's been 5 years.

703
00:46:06,406 --> 00:46:10,744
And it's been 20 years for Jang Byung Chun.

704
00:46:10,744 --> 00:46:13,472
As a son to a father,

705
00:46:13,472 --> 00:46:16,754
is this all you can say to greet me after 20 years?

706
00:46:16,754 --> 00:46:18,925
I...

707
00:46:18,925 --> 00:46:20,864
don't even know what a father is.

708
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:26,968
Because of that, you put your spoon in my dish.

709
00:46:26,968 --> 00:46:33,510
And you said you couldn't put your spoon in 
St Honore's dish because it's someone else's. 
You cried and cried about that.

710
00:46:34,597 --> 00:46:36,348
Why?

711
00:46:36,348 --> 00:46:39,006
You don't remember?

712
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:41,988
That's not possible.

713
00:46:41,988 --> 00:46:51,595
You left St Honore at the age of 6.
 You came back at the age of 11.
 You are Jang Min Woo with an abnormally 
good memory who could come back like that.

714
00:46:51,595 --> 00:46:54,762
You...

715
00:46:54,762 --> 00:46:57,993
Are you really Min Woo?

716
00:46:58,652 --> 00:47:00,325
You're not even Min Woo.

717
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:02,199
You have disguised as Min Woo.

718
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:03,754
And you dared to get to me like that?

719
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,375
I...!

720
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:08,669
dont know Min Woo.

721
00:47:08,669 --> 00:47:12,768
I don't know my father either.
I only know my grandpa. But,

722
00:47:12,768 --> 00:47:15,929
Jang Byung Chun made my grandpa 
cry bloody tears for 20 years!

723
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:19,220
And my grandpa got badly hurt by Choi Jae Gyum!

724
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:24,458
Because I only know my grandpa, 
I have to see an end to you today.

725
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:29,366
You want to see the end of me?
Aren't you a softy inside?

726
00:47:29,366 --> 00:47:33,021
You couldn't even kill a butterfly or an insect.

727
00:47:33,021 --> 00:47:36,064
And you want to kill me?

728
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:40,277
With those weak fingers that have only made cake?!

729
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:41,987
You don't seem to remember this.

730
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:45,423
The one who clinged to you 5 years ago,

731
00:47:45,423 --> 00:47:48,002
was no one other than me. 
A patissier out of a prison.

732
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,777
You told them I could kill someone at
 anytime because of my background!

733
00:47:53,777 --> 00:47:56,627
You told them to keep me away from you!

734
00:47:57,235 --> 00:48:00,676
Don't you remember 
asking the police to do that?

735
00:48:00,676 --> 00:48:05,152
Would I have done it if I had known it was you?
Why didn't you tell me it was you?

736
00:48:05,152 --> 00:48:07,945
I didn't even know myself who I was.

737
00:48:07,945 --> 00:48:13,497
I promised myself to meet the person 
I saw on TV in the prison!
And that I must have the
 courage to go to his place!

738
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:18,562
I advertised myself to a crazy bastard.

739
00:48:20,552 --> 00:48:24,901
It's all because we're blood related.

740
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:30,125
So, Min Woo, why don't you calm down?
 Listen carefully to what I have to say.

741
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:35,395
After losing you again, do you know how much I searched for you?

742
00:49:18,507 --> 00:49:21,463
 Mom!

743
00:49:21,463 --> 00:49:24,353
 MOM!

744
00:49:26,498 --> 00:49:28,856
 Mom!

745
00:49:34,498 --> 00:49:38,425
Min Woo!
Wake up! Min Woo!

746
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:43,549
Min Woo, you punk!

747
00:49:44,852 --> 00:49:49,604
Min Woo!

748
00:49:50,882 --> 00:49:54,370
Wake up! Min Woo!

749
00:49:54,370 --> 00:50:00,394
Min Woo...!

750
00:50:00,925 --> 00:50:04,851
Wake up...

751
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:21,821
You're here Aunty?

752
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:23,054
Where is Da Yang?

753
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:26,963
She left first with Ahjumma.

754
00:50:26,963 --> 00:50:28,918
Let's get going then.

755
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:51,149
Why is it so hard to get started?

756
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:55,264
Right. What kind of preparation
 is it that it takes so long?

757
00:50:55,264 --> 00:50:57,368
Where did Da Na and Won Il go?

758
00:50:57,368 --> 00:51:02,132
The ordered supplies came in late. They
 went to get them now with the assistant.

759
00:51:05,954 --> 00:51:07,851
Hey, who's that?

760
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:11,329
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

761
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:14,433
Hello...

762
00:51:14,433 --> 00:51:17,750
-Oh, you came.
-Yes, Director.

763
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,500
Please introduce yourselves.

764
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,540
From now on, she will be working 
with the two presidents. She is Manager Nam.

765
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,670
I'm looking forward to working with you.

766
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:30,396
You are the manager for the operations?

767
00:51:30,396 --> 00:51:33,850
You'll be working with the two men?

768
00:51:38,992 --> 00:51:40,737
Move away!

769
00:51:40,737 --> 00:51:43,632
You move away.
There are a lot of mirrors outside.

770
00:51:46,207 --> 00:51:48,726
What are you doing? Everyone is waiting come out!

771
00:51:48,726 --> 00:51:49,745
Yes.

772
00:51:49,745 --> 00:51:51,323
Ah, can you tell them to wait a little?

773
00:51:51,323 --> 00:51:54,167
What's the problem with the 
company presidents in their office?

774
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:56,656
Won Il, why are you taking so long today?

775
00:51:56,656 --> 00:51:59,539
Why do you take so long all of a sudden?
 To wear a suit the way you always do.

776
00:52:00,406 --> 00:52:08,849
It's because we want to impress the new manager.
We've been looking in the mirror the whole time.

777
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:13,417
Aigoo..you'll function as good presidents that way.

778
00:52:13,417 --> 00:52:16,642
If we can't do it, then you'll take care of it.

779
00:52:23,571 --> 00:52:27,138
I'll will take care of everything.
 This is the first time meeting you.
I'm Nam Chi Yeon.

780
00:52:27,138 --> 00:52:32,140
-Hello. I'm Choi Won Il.
-I'm Ko Seung Ji.

781
00:52:33,645 --> 00:52:34,925
What you can start doing for me

782
00:52:34,925 --> 00:52:36,725
is to give me inspiring orders.

783
00:52:36,725 --> 00:52:41,476
One, two, three, go.

784
00:52:49,094 --> 00:52:54,284
 He got dumped for sure this time...

785
00:53:00,673 --> 00:53:01,220
What should I do?

786
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,923
What should I do?
We didn't do anything wrong.

787
00:53:03,923 --> 00:53:08,296
Why did you get so dirty?

788
00:53:08,296 --> 00:53:13,776
-That's right.
-Hey, you're the star. 
You should have gotten 
cleaned up, you punk!

789
00:53:13,776 --> 00:53:18,694
Hey, this is a star too.
Put it where it can be seen well.

790
00:53:18,694 --> 00:53:22,643
Where should I put it?
On the top of Panda's head?

791
00:53:22,643 --> 00:53:25,608
No...

792
00:53:25,608 --> 00:53:27,375
Right here.

793
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:31,346
Of course, Hedgehog is in Panda's hands.

794
00:53:32,857 --> 00:53:36,143
Could I put this here...?

795
00:53:36,143 --> 00:53:40,423
Move it over this way, please...
Ok. It's perfect!. It's done.

796
00:53:43,676 --> 00:53:45,399
 Coming Soon

797
00:53:45,399 --> 00:53:47,713
 Cafe Panda Hedgehog

798
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:51,005
This is really nice.

799
00:53:51,005 --> 00:53:54,556
Wow, it looks great!

800
00:53:54,556 --> 00:53:56,432
Alright!

801
00:54:44,796 --> 00:54:45,843
Ah, what!

802
00:54:45,843 --> 00:54:48,910
Stop being stubborn, and come this way.

803
00:54:51,513 --> 00:54:56,668
You fell head over heels for Manager Nam.
 What happend now?

804
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,468
Why did you drag me to such a secluded place?

805
00:54:59,468 --> 00:55:01,778
I have something to give you.

806
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:02,976
What?

807
00:55:02,976 --> 00:55:04,269
A cake.

808
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,989
Are you joking with me right now?

809
00:55:06,989 --> 00:55:10,625
I'm being serious.

810
00:55:11,637 --> 00:55:14,254
Here.

811
00:55:14,254 --> 00:55:16,477
What is this...?

812
00:55:16,477 --> 00:55:22,001
The shop's name is Panda Hedgehog now. 
You can't run away even if you wanted to. That's why.

813
00:55:36,272 --> 00:55:38,033
What's this...?

814
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:41,398
What could it be?
It's a ring a boyfriend gives to a girlfriend.

815
00:55:41,398 --> 00:55:43,473
Ah...

816
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:46,405
I thought it was a couple's ring.

817
00:55:46,405 --> 00:55:50,910
You really look down on it. Who says
 this is worse than a couple's ring?

818
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:52,538
I'm saying it! 
I am!

819
00:55:52,538 --> 00:55:56,216
You buy the right kind next time.
Get two that are the same.

820
00:55:56,216 --> 00:56:01,790
Just let it go, huh?
Why does a man need a ring?
 Especially a patissier.

821
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:07,744
I hear there was a patissier who lost his fortune 
because he resisted the coupledom...

822
00:56:07,744 --> 00:56:12,731
Alright. Alright. Don't get the kind 
with a round stone. Got it?

823
00:56:12,731 --> 00:56:15,502
Then, it's a wedding ring.

824
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:17,696
One, two, three, go.

825
00:56:17,696 --> 00:56:21,552
Why get married...?
I'm still very young.

826
00:56:30,924 --> 00:56:33,914
 Contract...

827
00:56:33,914 --> 00:56:37,134
Why doesn't this cell phone ever get broken?

828
00:56:37,134 --> 00:56:37,890
Give it to me!

829
00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:45,678
Ah!

830
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:50,003
One, two, three, go!

831
00:56:50,003 --> 00:56:52,580
Come here.

832
00:57:26,924 --> 00:57:29,944
Oh, it looks better up there.

833
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:40,508
What happened?
Why is it here?

834
00:57:40,508 --> 00:57:44,010
-Oh...
-It looks good there.

835
00:58:12,631 --> 00:58:17,782
 Thanks everyone for watching Panda and Hedgehog.
