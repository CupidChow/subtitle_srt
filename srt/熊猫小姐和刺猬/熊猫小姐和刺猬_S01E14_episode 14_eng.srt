1
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:49,605
 Episode 14.

2
00:00:57,061 --> 00:01:00,156
Hedgehog, don't worry about anything here at home.

3
00:01:00,156 --> 00:01:04,404
I'll iron your shirts every day and deliver them right to you so

4
00:01:04,404 --> 00:01:10,384
instead of wearing wrinkled shirts, wear crisp and polished shirts, with style and charisma.

5
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:13,230
Also, don't pay any attention to whatever Won Il's mother has to say,

6
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,255
Stay pricky, like a hedgehog. Alright?

7
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:22,671
In return, grandpa will be encouraged.  Right, Hedgehog?

8
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:25,796
Ah, I have to prepare the undergarments too.

9
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:31,563
I think he washed them in the bathroom and then

10
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:35,968
snuck them to dry here in this room.

11
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:41,515
Wait, those secret undies I took...

12
00:01:42,474 --> 00:01:46,688
Hedgehog, I usually don't look in other people's private things,

13
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:48,855
I don't even look in Dan Na's drawers.

14
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:52,486
There is no explanation for a human to do that.

15
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:54,730
But...

16
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,647
I was so curious....

17
00:01:57,647 --> 00:02:00,344
And because I just want to check once.

18
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:05,455
Just once, just once, okay?

19
00:02:05,455 --> 00:02:08,145
Sorry.

20
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,004
What's this?

21
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,445
How can a man wear something like this?

22
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,397
I can't live...

23
00:02:29,756 --> 00:02:32,406
Perhaps, for wearing this,

24
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:35,155
didn't grandpa get angry?

25
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,057
Grandpa didn't buy this for you, right?

26
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,446
But...

27
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:48,753
But...

28
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:53,676
how will grandpa make croque en bouche?

29
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:58,755
Even for the top 1% of the pastry chefs,

30
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:01,164
croque en bouche is difficult to make.

31
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:34,809
Hey. Shouldn't we save this moment?

32
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:36,950
Should I go get it?

33
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:48,483
Our grandpa doesn't like his picture taken.

34
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:50,741
You have eyes on the back of your head?

35
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:52,087
I have eyes on my back.

36
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:53,798
Your back?

37
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,851
Yes.

38
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:59,247
On his back,

39
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:03,835
he has a tiny hedgehog tattoo. Looks just like him.

40
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:05,400
He must be cute.

41
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,461
He is cute. Like a prickly little hedgehog.

42
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:13,173
What are you guys doing?  In one shot, you're making a fool of me.

43
00:04:13,173 --> 00:04:17,544
Let's take one picture together. Make sure your friend on the back is in it.

44
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:19,793
That's enough.

45
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,341
He often enjoys getting his ID photograph taken.

46
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:24,257
ID photograph?

47
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:28,071
Promotional photos that say 'you can change from this to this.'

48
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:29,523
Grandpa!

49
00:04:29,523 --> 00:04:31,637
Stop talking nonsense and just get back to work.

50
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:33,294
I'm working, you rascal.

51
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:36,110
I'm saying to stay focused. Why are you taking so long?

52
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,508
This is how it is made.  What do you want me to do about it?

53
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:40,929
If you know how to make it quickly then, you try it, you rascal.

54
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:43,939
Making a simple croque en bouche and you're acting all superior.

55
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:47,803
But making a croque en bouche is not that simple.

56
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:51,976
That's why I've firmly took a hold of our grandpa.

57
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:54,104
I love you!

58
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:59,448
Aish really, I can't saying a thing in front of grandpa. He imitates everything.

59
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,116
What are these pictures of?

60
00:05:08,116 --> 00:05:11,534
It's what I told you I will investigate.

61
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:17,103
The private detective sent them as proof that he has finished his investigation.

62
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:19,315
Private detective, whatever...

63
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:25,383
It's the detetective who found her ex-boyfriend who stole her credit card.

64
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:30,115
But, regarding his fee for this work

65
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:32,569
it would be nice if President would please take care of it.

66
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:33,987
That's fine so, please continue.

67
00:05:33,987 --> 00:05:37,496
It was said that Choi Jae Gyum disappeared.

68
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:38,732
What does that mean?

69
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:42,003
It has been over 20 years since he has been missing and

70
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:46,128
Mother is the only remaining family, but she passed away.

71
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:50,218
But the problem is that he was mentally disabled.

72
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:51,311
Was this confirmed?

73
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:56,572
Yes. He wasn't formally registered for disability because his mother objected but...

74
00:05:56,572 --> 00:06:00,081
Not to mention cake, he couldn't even make ramen..

75
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:01,939
the neighbors confirmed it.

76
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:04,173
How about a death certificate or other records?

77
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:08,914
There were none. That's why Chairman is still using his identity.

78
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:13,099
The weak and poor man got lost and became homeless,

79
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:16,091
And Chairman must have approached him...

80
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:17,504
Is that possible?

81
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:20,235
There are a lot of newspaper articles like that.

82
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:22,584
People who purchase life insurances with identity of homeless men,

83
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:27,728
and forge an accident to take their lives and the money.

84
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:29,842
Take a life?

85
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:33,675
There are those cases, and some are just to change their identity.

86
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:37,392
The rumor that there is a black market that deals with

87
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:40,491
Identity forgery and record alteration, is it true?

88
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:45,595
Perhaps, he was in the business?

89
00:06:45,595 --> 00:06:49,131
Then, when did he learn how to make a cake?

90
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:53,594
Honestly, very few cakes are made by him.

91
00:06:53,594 --> 00:06:57,276
He only did the finishing touches of the cakes his underlings made.

92
00:06:57,276 --> 00:07:02,894
Even the Cosmetic Macarons of sheep, bear, and poop were made by Lee Na Kyung.

93
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:05,151
Really?

94
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:08,312
With such great skills, why did she have to be Chairman's lover?

95
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:13,815
I heard, Lee Na Kyung's family was in debt so the Chairman loaned her money and she was the collateral.

96
00:07:13,815 --> 00:07:17,319
Can a person really be used as collateral?

97
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,201
Well, I guess so. He could even steal the name of a poor man.

98
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:23,322
Then what about Shin Sae Mi?

99
00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:25,186
I heard he was having an affair with her,

100
00:07:25,186 --> 00:07:28,818
and brought her to the kitchen even though she had no baking certificate.

101
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:30,354
Really?

102
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:32,388
How could he? How could he?

103
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:35,259
What does that all mean?

104
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:42,916
I took a picture as evidence to show you but,

105
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:47,384
before I could, Vice-Chairman intercepted my phone.

106
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,016
What?

107
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:53,727
Why did I have to use slang in this situation?

108
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:59,739
She happened to look into my phone and their marriage got into a crisis.

109
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:03,224
In anger she took the position of being on your side over his.

110
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:08,884
Backed into a corner, Chairman decided to pretend to leave from a fight with you.

111
00:08:08,884 --> 00:08:10,955
With no real intention, of course.

112
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:16,750
When a married couple fight, you know it doesn't easily split them, right?

113
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,108
When you weren't here, they fought and they acted like nothing happened a few days later.

114
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:24,344
They repeated that cycle a few times.

115
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:27,863
But this time, Chairman's mistress was an employee and

116
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:33,416
also the fact that there were two of them made things worse.

117
00:08:53,455 --> 00:08:56,348
The only way for me to live is

118
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:59,417
with Hwang Jung Rye.

119
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:04,759
Our lawyer is on Chairman Choi's line, right?

120
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,879
Yes.

121
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,707
So, Vice-Chairman went to meet my father...

122
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:12,242
Her father is a lawyer.

123
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:15,544
My father would not meet Vice-Chairman, and says

124
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:17,396
"Bring the President"

125
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:21,014
and I said, "why?"

126
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:25,519
"Chairman Choi Jae Gyum is not Choi Jae Gyum."

127
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,291
Please make an appointment with your father.

128
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,579
You can meet him tomorrow.

129
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:34,846
Why did my mother decide to see your father?

130
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:39,123
Chairman seems to have taken the legal documents.

131
00:09:39,123 --> 00:09:42,859
He asked Won Yi to get him some clothes and items from home

132
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:47,022
Won Yi probably didn't know she was taking him legal documents among them.

133
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:49,722
But I have all the company's legal documents.

134
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,307
Those are original documents and the main seal.

135
00:09:53,307 --> 00:09:57,389
There are many copies and other seals.

136
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:04,271
There are many horrible things you can do only with copied documents and seals.

137
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:08,828
Ah, it's refreshing.

138
00:10:08,828 --> 00:10:12,342
Harder, please. Over here.

139
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,296
Oh, you scared me! Move!

140
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:21,202
Honey...

141
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:23,184
Get out before I call someone!

142
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:26,982
For the last time, just once.

143
00:10:26,982 --> 00:10:30,731
You poor thing, all stressed out because of me.

144
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,359
That's enough.

145
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:34,412
Are you hurting me then giving me medicine?

146
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:37,263
I'm going to call someone. Leave now.

147
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,901
Please be happy.

148
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:57,261
What's matter with that man.  I tell him to leave, and he is actually leaving?

149
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:59,053
I am getting hot.

150
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:02,684
Man, it's as if she hid the camera so well because it's pricy.

151
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:05,718
Where are you?

152
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:12,050
Wow, your dad must have gotten a lot of tattoos.

153
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,847
He said it was a burn he got while he was working.

154
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:18,420
What burn? This is a tattoo that was removed.

155
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:20,242
It's not a burn?

156
00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:22,279
It's not.

157
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,511
How do you know the difference between a burn and a removed tattoo?

158
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:28,467
In this field, I'm a professional, professional.

159
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:32,099
By just looking at the color, I know how much it cost and where they got it.

160
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:34,144
Really?

161
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:36,997
How much was this?

162
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:41,009
Well, looks like, including pigment, you spent about 50 dollars.

163
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:45,246
Wow, you're not joking.  You're right.  Then, how about this one?

164
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:51,203
Well, that one.  Without pigment, about 8 dollars?

165
00:11:51,203 --> 00:11:53,206
Wow, you are a professional.

166
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:54,500
Then, this one?

167
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,431
That's enough!

168
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:57,928
Why are you getting mad?

169
00:11:57,928 --> 00:11:59,270
I'm a man.

170
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,717
Hyung, you think no one knows you are a man?

171
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:02,928
I'm a man and you're a woman.

172
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:05,239
And, in this room, it's just the two of us.

173
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:06,925
What are you talking about, suddenly?

174
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,252
Yah, I'm..

175
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:11,414
You are lucky that I am professional only with tattoos.

176
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,985
What?

177
00:12:12,985 --> 00:12:14,569
You are pretty.

178
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:19,185
So, don't do that from now on.

179
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:24,813
Because I'm pretty, I shouldn't do it anymore?

180
00:12:24,813 --> 00:12:28,123
What is he talking about... Wow.

181
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:33,727
Does she have any sense or not?

182
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:56,284
Ah, that jerk.  He calls himself President but he leaves without even saying goodbye.

183
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:59,557
Bastard, stop your small talk and wash this now.

184
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:03,527
Grandpa, the people around here don't know me as "bastard"

185
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:06,910
So could you please call me Patssier Go Seung Ji when we are here?

186
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,324
Then don't call me Grandpa, you bastard.

187
00:13:09,324 --> 00:13:11,429
I call you Grandpa because you are a grandpa.

188
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:13,018
Then should I call you Hyung?

189
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:15,002
Silly Grandpa.

190
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:15,939
Where are you going, bastard?

191
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:17,861
To pee.

192
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:21,963
Bastard, you're just curious to see where Won Il went, aren't you, bastard?

193
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:28,717
Good, you two should get along like brothers.

194
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:36,274
-Yes.
 -Yes?

195
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,856
Why?

196
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:42,715
You must be really busy that you can only answer yes and why.

197
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:44,812
You didn't say goodbye even to Grandpa.

198
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:48,707
Oh, I didn't think of it.

199
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:50,764
Is there something going on with you?

200
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,776
You didn't look so good.

201
00:13:52,776 --> 00:13:54,727
I'm going over to Da Yang's for a little bit.

202
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:57,359
You rushed out to go over to Pan Da Yang's house?

203
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:59,062
 Why are you going over there?

204
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:01,864
 Dude, I'm not even there, 
why are you going over there?

205
00:14:01,864 --> 00:14:05,068
Is this some sort of maneuver you're trying to pull  to steal her while I'm not there?

206
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:08,026
I have something to ask about Choi Jae Gyum.

207
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:10,932
What would Pan Da Yang know about Choi Jae Gyum?

208
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:13,407
Choi Jae Gyum isn't his real name.

209
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:19,317
I'm wondering if there's anything left from Min Woo whom Da Yang's looking for.

210
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,353
What does he have to do with Choi Jae Gyum?

211
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:24,644
Choi Jae Gyum is his father.

212
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:26,886
What?

213
00:14:26,886 --> 00:14:29,118
He used Da Yang and me

214
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,586
to find his way into Saint Honore.

215
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:36,658
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

216
00:14:37,973 --> 00:14:40,156
Alright.

217
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:41,836
Drive safely.

218
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:44,305
Okay, thanks.

219
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:46,287
Ok.

220
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:55,723
Why can't Choi Jae Gyum leave us alone?

221
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:58,685
Alright.

222
00:14:58,685 --> 00:15:00,729
I understand.

223
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:03,709
We don't have customers now, so please don't worry. Alright.

224
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:09,320
That was Da Na.

225
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,918
She said she made her delivery and she was going to take a little walk with Beombo.

226
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:17,771
Are Grandpa and Hedgehog doing well at Saint Honore?

227
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:18,901
Yes.

228
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:22,509
Of course with their skill, Saint Honore is nothing to worry about.

229
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:27,648
I knew Grandpa wasn't ordinary from his posture and the spark in his eyes.

230
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:31,022
but still I didn't know he was this impressive.

231
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:32,960
Among all the people I've seen in my life,

232
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,568
I think he is the most successful.

233
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,594
But why was he running the little Mozart-ho?  A great man like him?

234
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:45,310
I was born in the house we are living in now,

235
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,568
Until I was 5, my father ran Mozart-ho as his bakery.

236
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:52,045
Saying my father was like the Mozart of bakers

237
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:56,147
my mother named the bakery so.

238
00:15:56,147 --> 00:16:01,070
But I couldn't pronounce it and kept calling it "Mozart-ho"

239
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,871
so my father changed the name to Mozart-ho, for me.

240
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:06,906
Such a deep love for his daughter.

241
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:10,619
When I was young, my feet rarely touched the ground because

242
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:14,289
he constantly carried me in his arms, on his back and up on his shoulders.

243
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:16,268
That's how he raised me.

244
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:20,577
They said it was as if he believed he was the only one with a daughter in the world.

245
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:23,717
You had him wrapped around your little finger.

246
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:29,383
Because he misses his little daughter, he's started up Mozart-ho again.

247
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:33,871
I think he wanted to turn back time while he was waiting for me.

248
00:16:33,871 --> 00:16:36,333
Did you study abroad for a long time?

249
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,489
Or did you get married to someone who lived in another country?

250
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,727
For 20 years...

251
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:45,570
I was in prison.

252
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:53,243
Why do you need stuffs related to Min Woo?

253
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:57,499
What I couldn't tell you because I was embarrassed,

254
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:59,624
and

255
00:16:59,624 --> 00:17:02,711
what I didn't want to say because I detested it.

256
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:04,484
I want to tell you now.

257
00:17:07,228 --> 00:17:08,682
Do you have it?

258
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:11,377
Anything that belonged to Min Woo.

259
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:02,636
The clothes that Min Woo wanted to have.

260
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:05,200
I was holding on to it to give it to him.

261
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,077
But I couldn't meet him anymore.

262
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:18,285
He said he was coming back soon,

263
00:18:18,285 --> 00:18:21,747
and told me to hold on to this.

264
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:35,033
It's a moustache!

265
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:39,788
Stop it.

266
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:43,229
Stop it.

267
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:53,642
This is all I have,

268
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:56,484
that was related to Min Woo.

269
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:18,599

270
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:24,928
He was Jang MIn Woo?

271
00:19:28,287 --> 00:19:31,783
I thought he would be Choi Min Woo all this time.

272
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:34,635
Why Choi Min Woo?

273
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:39,617
Because it's Choi Jae Gyum.

274
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:42,813
What does Choi Jae Gyum have to do with Min Woo...

275
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:50,068
The thing you didn't tell me...

276
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:54,360
Min Woo's dad

277
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,417
is Choi Jae Gyum.

278
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:06,938
I thought we should drink beer today.

279
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:11,595
Then, the patissier that your mother brought into your home is...

280
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:15,082
Did you ask Choi Jae Gyum?

281
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:17,915
Did he say he really didn't know where Min Woo is?

282
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:22,532
Choi Jae Gyum lives

283
00:20:22,532 --> 00:20:26,430
as if a child named Min Woo never lived.

284
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:32,191
How can he do that?

285
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:36,534
When strangers like us are like this, and he's the dad.

286
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,701
According to my mom,

287
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:40,944
it's not me who lost him, but

288
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:42,959
Choi Jae Gyum might have disowned him.

289
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:46,608
Because it would bother him living with my mom.

290
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:52,618
Then if Min Woo's last name is Jang

291
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,790
why is Chairman Choi's last name Choi?

292
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,292
Isn't Min Woo his real son?

293
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:59,771
Did he use his mom's surname?

294
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:03,672
He changed his face and name

295
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:06,476
and erased the snake tattoo on his arm.

296
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,220
Let's look for him as Jang Min Woo even now.

297
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,918
My dad did as much as he could

298
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:21,271
before he passed away.

299
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:24,180
Although there weren't any results.

300
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,556
Why didn't you look for him personally?

301
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,515
He wanted to take charge as an apology to me,

302
00:21:33,515 --> 00:21:39,429
and he was an assistant lawyer and had a close relationship with the police.

303
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:43,701
I thought it would be best to leave it to my dad.

304
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:45,544
To the police,

305
00:21:45,544 --> 00:21:51,395
I was just a kid who lived in the same neighborhood.

306
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:55,614
That's why I became a reporter specializing in cakes.

307
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,566
-To look for Min Woo?
-Yes.

308
00:22:03,685 --> 00:22:07,386
Drive safey, hyung nim. 
  My cooking skills weren't good enough

309
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:10,048
 for me to become a patissier.

310
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:13,508
But I was sure Min Woo would have become a patissier.

311
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:18,423
Probably a really talented patissier.

312
00:22:18,423 --> 00:22:23,693
I thought it would be the fastest way to hear the news.

313
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,671
So the reason you wanted to keep your job in the magazine

314
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:39,484
was to find Min Woo?

315
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:45,667
Before my parents passed away,

316
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:49,041
finding Min Woo was a priority,

317
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:52,154
but after taking over Cafe Panda

318
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:56,877
I haven't done much about finding Min Woo.

319
00:22:56,877 --> 00:23:00,784
At the time it looked like we might lose it over debt, so I was busy making sure that didn't happen,

320
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:04,738
and these days, I'm having so much fun with you and Hedgehog,

321
00:23:04,738 --> 00:23:08,783
and we're busy selling cakes, too.

322
00:23:08,783 --> 00:23:11,099
I think I lived forgetting about Min Woo.

323
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,924
Did you send Won Il because you thought

324
00:23:14,924 --> 00:23:17,945
I had lost the affection for you?

325
00:23:17,945 --> 00:23:20,930
I'm sorry.  I'll do better.

326
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,858
If we search for him with the name Jang Min Woo

327
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:28,157
it would give us his mother's name. We might at least find his mother.

328
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,976
His records didn't indicate his mother.  He was listed only with his father.

329
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:35,775
His father's name was Jang Byung Chun.
After Min Woo disappeared,

330
00:23:35,775 --> 00:23:37,967
there was a death report with his name.

331
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:42,013
So he didn't die, but became Choi Jae Gyum.

332
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:43,690
Don't you have any pictures?

333
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,905
Let's use his old picture with a program to see what he would look like as an adult today.

334
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:51,903
I'll ask my friend in America to help us.  He used the method to find his parents, too.

335
00:23:51,903 --> 00:23:53,799
I don't have any photos.

336
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,505
It wasn't a happy enough time to take pictures.

337
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:59,514
In our house, Min Woo was

338
00:23:59,514 --> 00:24:02,355
a little guest who wasn't invited.

339
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:06,355
And it's not like we had cell phones with cameras on them back then.

340
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:10,654
20 years ago we...

341
00:24:10,654 --> 00:24:14,897
were so young and helpless.

342
00:24:14,897 --> 00:24:17,103
Right?

343
00:24:21,276 --> 00:24:24,471
Lost the house that I lived in for twenty years,

344
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:28,668
and sold the taxi I drove for three years.

345
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:32,272
The only thing I have left is a monthly rental unit.

346
00:24:33,323 --> 00:24:37,376
In your eyes, they all must be luxurious inconveniences.

347
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:41,083
But I can't appreciate that, "I'm living well enough in comparison",

348
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,777
then I would feel guilty and sorry...

349
00:24:43,877 --> 00:24:48,868
But I can't complain that, "why everyone's life is so hard", then I would become disheartened.

350
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,457
Are you planning to start another line of work?

351
00:24:54,417 --> 00:25:02,943
I was planning to start working at a restaurant next week, until then I wanted to do a part-time job.

352
00:25:02,943 --> 00:25:05,906
I had a bad headache, so I went to see the doctor,

353
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:09,845
and they said that I must rest for a few days or it would be dangerous.

354
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:16,048
I came over since I have some time and thought I would make some food for my nieces.

355
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,490
Then, you shouldn't be drinking alcohol.

356
00:25:19,825 --> 00:25:23,545
I just pretended to take some sips.  It's still full.

357
00:25:23,545 --> 00:25:26,593
Maybe I just don't know how to say things.

358
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:35,718
Or, maybe words are made in a way that can't fully express people's hearts.

359
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:40,387
I want to encourage you, but I'm not finding it easy.

360
00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:44,690
When you asked to have beer, I already understood everything.

361
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:48,657
If you understood it that way, I'm thankful.

362
00:25:48,657 --> 00:25:53,122
Whenever you want to have a beer from now on, give me a call.

363
00:25:53,122 --> 00:25:55,753
We can complain together as friends.

364
00:25:55,753 --> 00:25:57,348
Yes, that sounds nice.

365
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:01,475
Finally, I now have a friend... 
No, a sister.

366
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:11,361
It seems, after twenty years, besides your father, no one else waited for you.

367
00:26:12,952 --> 00:26:17,589
My mom died of an illness from waiting for me.

368
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:22,200
My son was with his father but went missing.

369
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:25,367
Why didn't you have your father take care of him?

370
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:28,533
They parted ways and lost touch.

371
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:33,529
The assistant baker, whom my father kicked out condemning his personality,

372
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:37,719
pretended to be interested in me to get back at my father.

373
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:42,011
Not knowing that, I believed it was my first love.

374
00:26:42,765 --> 00:26:47,800
My father told me to end the relationship immediately and go abroad,

375
00:26:48,396 --> 00:26:52,522
but I wanted to give birth to my child.

376
00:26:52,522 --> 00:26:56,214
I can imagine how upset he must have been for a daughter he loved so much.

377
00:26:56,623 --> 00:26:58,999
About how old is your son now?

378
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,898
26 years old.

379
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:06,813
I went to prison when he was 6 years old.

380
00:27:07,437 --> 00:27:09,209
Now, friend...

381
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:13,711
No, since we are now sisters, let me ask you...

382
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:15,872
You seem like you must've been
a pure person all your life.

383
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:18,997
What kind of crime can someone like you have committed to be sentenced for 20 years?

384
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,551
Lenders who my husband owed money to came to us,

385
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:25,858
and said if I don't pay back the money right away, they would violate me,

386
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:30,082
and take my son and kill him.

387
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:33,194
So I threw a container full of gasoline on them that was lying next to us.

388
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:35,527
Did people die?

389
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:38,323
I just remember throwing the gasoline.

390
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:44,629
When I became conscious, there was fire and thick smoke.

391
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,771
Why were you unconscious?

392
00:27:48,441 --> 00:27:52,493
I think I was hit in the head by someone.

393
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:56,937
But the investigators said I was running away from the fire,

394
00:27:56,937 --> 00:27:59,536
and hit my head on a corner of the refridgerator.

395
00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:03,061
That means there is a different perpetrator for this crime.

396
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:05,390
A detective came not too long ago. . .

397
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,569
and told us that it was my husband,

398
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:10,037
And I was falsely charged for it.

399
00:28:10,037 --> 00:28:13,499
What in the world!
What a despicable. . .

400
00:28:15,934 --> 00:28:20,249
Seeing that scary tattoo on his arm,

401
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:23,936
I should have know what kind of person he was.

402
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:33,660
As I was listening, I kept thinking about it....

403
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,265
What neighborhood did you live in?

404
00:28:44,964 --> 00:28:47,070
I want to do as much as I can.

405
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:52,008
For the last twenty years, you've been searching
for Min Woo, but I haven't done anything.

406
00:28:54,197 --> 00:28:58,195
I believe in miracles.

407
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,873
Miracles?

408
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:05,400
One day...

409
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:12,734
  ♫ Maculinea teleius ♫

410
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:19,646
  ♫ Aspidomorpha transparipennis ♫

411
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:26,341
  ♫ Rhyssa persuasoria ♫

412
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:33,219
  ♫ Homotropus tarsatorius ♫

413
00:29:39,806 --> 00:29:42,817
He's going to come find us singing this song.

414
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:47,223
Home to us.

415
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:54,573
The Scarce Large Blue Butterfly
  Maculinea Teleius

416
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,641
Is our Won Il going to grow up to be an Entomologist?

417
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:04,355
You only like pictures of butterflies and bugs.

418
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,781
Mom says since you're ill,
and we can't go anywhere,

419
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:12,382
I should at least follow my teacher to collect insects.

420
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:16,937
So I took the natural science class at school,

421
00:30:16,937 --> 00:30:21,666
and now I have to memorize all the names of
these butterflies and bugs for homework.

422
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:25,927
It's so difficult that I'm considring
whether I should just give up or not.

423
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:27,866
Try making it into a song to memorize.

424
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:30,709
For dad, the cake names were so hard to remember,

425
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:31,846
I made them into songs to help me.

426
00:30:31,846 --> 00:30:33,095
How?

427
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:34,471
Bring it and

428
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:35,685
come over here.

429

(Homotropus tarsatorius)

437
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:30,185
That was the last time my father held me in his arms.

438
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:33,143
The song was the last will he left for me.

439
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:37,519
You taught me that song,

440
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,541
and I taught it to Min Woo.

441
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:46,616
Only the three of us knew that song.

442
00:31:46,616 --> 00:31:50,220
So if someone were to sing that song,

443
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,855
that someone would have to be Min Woo.

444
00:31:55,682 --> 00:31:56,707
Da Yang!

445
00:31:57,143 --> 00:31:58,099
Da Yang!

446
00:31:58,099 --> 00:31:59,970
Aunt, I'm in here.

447
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:04,257
Da Yang.

448
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:06,784
This is Min Woo's mother.

449
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,489
What are you saying, Aunt?

450
00:32:11,489 --> 00:32:14,586
This is Min Woo's mother, whom you've been searching for so long!

451
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:17,964
And Grandpa is Min Woo's maternal grandfather.

452
00:32:21,202 --> 00:32:23,475
Is that really true?

453
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:29,911
Are you saying Ahjumma is Min Woo's mother?

454
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:34,234
The person who was taken away
in the police car back then?

455
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:38,680
Yes, that's me. That was me.

456
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:42,560
Ahjummah, it's you?

457
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:45,052
It's really you?

458
00:32:47,402 --> 00:32:53,548
Thank you for not forgetting Min Woo,
and for searching for him.

459
00:33:21,203 --> 00:33:22,642
First, drink this right up.

460
00:33:28,492 --> 00:33:32,646
What's wrong? What makes you so distressed?

461
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:38,228
The man who married my mother...

462
00:33:38,228 --> 00:33:40,794
Saint Honore's chairman...

463
00:33:40,794 --> 00:33:42,767
Why are you metioning the Chairman?

464
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:47,275
Is Min Woo's father.

465
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:50,122
What did you say?

466
00:33:51,712 --> 00:33:56,058
He is Ahjummah's husband,
and Grandfather's son in law.

467
00:33:57,477 --> 00:34:02,407
So, right now grandfather is working for the company of the guy who left his daughter for another woman?

468
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,886
For the son of the other woman?

469
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:07,990
What should I do?

470
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,510
Should I get Choi Jae Gyum to kneel and ask for forgiveness before Grandfather?

471
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,554
What if Grandfather collapses from the shock?

472
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:18,223
Don't tell Grandfather, but consult with Ahjumma, first.

473
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:22,257
What if she makes an impulsive desicion?

474
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:25,763
She won't. At least for Grandfather's sake, she won't.

475
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,606
And, her heart seems to be at peace too.

476
00:34:31,055 --> 00:34:36,912
It seems that she went to prison for 20 years
instead of Choi Jae Gyum.

477
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:49,128
Ahjumma, by chance,
do you have any pictures of Min Woo?

478
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,211
Yes.

479
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:55,723
Please give them to me. Won Il said we can get current appearance using pictures from childhood.

480
00:34:55,723 --> 00:34:59,333
Won Il's friend found his parents through that.

481
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,872
In my bag.

482
00:35:00,872 --> 00:35:03,049
It's in my bag in the first floor.

483
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:05,052
I'll go and bring it.

484
00:35:12,003 --> 00:35:17,096
That's right, Min Woo looked like this.
So cute. . .

485
00:35:17,096 --> 00:35:20,586
Can I have a copy too?

486
00:35:30,372 --> 00:35:32,496
Min Woo...

487
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:34,640
It's been a long time.

488
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:43,758
Ahjumma.

489
00:35:47,373 --> 00:35:51,361
What is Min Woo's father's name?

490
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:53,784
Jang Byung Cheon.

491
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,519
That was his name when he lived with us.

492
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:01,135
I don't know what he has changed his name to.

493
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,829
It's Choi Jae Gyum.

494
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,682
Saint Honore's Chairman.

495
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:15,300

496
00:36:15,988 --> 00:36:19,255
The color is good, and the size is perfect too!

497
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:20,406
Do you like it, Boss?

498
00:36:20,406 --> 00:36:22,682
I like it.

499
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:24,698
But, why spend the money?

500
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:27,004
You have to go to work everyday.

501
00:36:27,004 --> 00:36:29,933
Since you weren't here, I realized how big your role was.

502
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:31,250
I just suddenly wanted to buy it for you.

503
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,666
But are you Seung Ji?

504
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,830
Why are you buttoning up like Seung Ji?

505
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:40,099
You should button up like this so that your heart would also be organized, that's what Boss taught him.

506
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:42,537
Boss didn't teach him that.

507
00:36:42,537 --> 00:36:48,105
Children are taught to button up like that, so they'll feel more secure. This is what they remember.

508
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,431
That's what they said in the prison too, right?

509
00:36:50,431 --> 00:36:52,515
Yes.

510
00:36:52,515 --> 00:36:58,469
Instead of that, he should have memorized the names of his mother and father.

511
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:00,077
That's what I say.

512
00:37:00,077 --> 00:37:04,942
I thought Seung Ji learned eveything from you. So I followed him all this time.

513
00:37:04,942 --> 00:37:07,926
Because of that habit of his, 
he was beaten up a lot in the prison.

514
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:11,380
They were saying, "What is the use of looking neat in a prison uniform?".

515
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:18,096
Maculinea teleius
  (Go-un-jeong-baki Pu-reun-bujeom-nabi)

516
00:37:18,096 --> 00:37:21,501
Aspidomorpha transparipennis
  (Mo-sigeum-jara-nam Saeng-i-ip-beol-le)

517
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:25,129
Rhyssa persuasoria
  (Song-got-beolle-sali Nam-jak-maepsi-beol)

518
00:37:25,129 --> 00:37:28,975
Homotropus tarsatorius 
  (Eoli-deunge-sali Mung-tuk-maepsi-beol)

519
00:37:40,445 --> 00:37:44,243
I am here working all night,
and where is Pan Da Yang and Byun Bin Geo?

520
00:37:44,243 --> 00:37:46,227
They don't call even once?

521
00:37:46,923 --> 00:37:50,212
I suddenly feel like I'm being treated like
cold rice, and I'm really getting angry!

522
00:37:50,669 --> 00:37:55,560
If you guys keep making me feel like ousted out,
I'm not going to make cakes...

523
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:21,061
 I will contact the detective tomorrow.

524
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:26,515
 Until we find a way, please don't tell my father.

525
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:30,147
 We will find Min Woo.

526
00:38:30,147 --> 00:38:34,871
 Please let him finish the croque en bouche.

527
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:53,257
 You've been working hard, my daughter.

528
00:38:53,257 --> 00:38:56,645
 I didn't call, just in case I would be disturbing you.

529
00:38:56,645 --> 00:38:59,523
 I will go to sleep first.

530
00:38:59,523 --> 00:39:05,013
 Don't worry even if I don't see you
tomorrow morning to leave at dawn.

531
00:39:11,008 --> 00:39:19,022

532
00:39:30,382 --> 00:39:32,213
 Father,

533
00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:36,848
 Your son-in-law, Jang got married to Won Yi's mother.

534
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:41,312
 Won Yi is his daughter.

535
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,231
 She's the daughter that he had,
after abandoning our Min Woo.

536
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:51,543
 Our Min Woo, we'll definately find him, father.

537
00:39:52,143 --> 00:39:58,092
 I feel so much more pain for him now. 
Father, we must find him...

538
00:40:07,502 --> 00:40:11,109
It's been only 2 days since I left.

539
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,551
Why am I so glad to see you, Cafe Panda?

540
00:40:14,431 --> 00:40:19,317
But, you just sleep without sending a text or even a call?

541
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:20,849
Pan Da Yang.

542
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:23,575
I won't let it go easily.

543
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:45,194
Look at that, you're sleeping in my blanket
with the picture of your first love?

544
00:40:46,156 --> 00:40:48,012
What's with this woman?

545
00:40:59,669 --> 00:41:02,180
I can't bear to see you two sleep together. . .

546
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:04,999
So.

547
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,778
She looks more like a panda when she's asleep.

548
00:41:24,802 --> 00:41:26,754
What have you been up to?

549
00:41:28,628 --> 00:41:30,534
Did you miss me?

550
00:41:33,473 --> 00:41:36,284
Because of that child, Min Woo. . .

551
00:41:36,284 --> 00:41:38,270
You must have cried and slept.

552
00:41:39,557 --> 00:41:41,960
I hope you find him.

553
00:41:42,422 --> 00:41:44,881
So that my Da Yang would be happy.

554
00:41:45,282 --> 00:41:47,583
I need to go after an hour.

555
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:51,769
Let's talk in our dreams.

556
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:55,181
Sleep well, Panda.

557
00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:25,000
You look more like a hedghog while you're asleep.

558
00:42:25,648 --> 00:42:27,932
You must have been so tired.

559
00:42:29,993 --> 00:42:32,783
Did you not miss me?

560
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:41,180
I found Min Woo's mother and grandfather today.

561
00:42:42,751 --> 00:42:45,219
I couldn't tell you. . .

562
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:49,217
So I didn't call or text.

563
00:42:49,787 --> 00:42:55,407
Now I understand why Grandfather
didn't tell you about finding his grandson.

564
00:42:57,165 --> 00:43:01,807
He didn't want you to feel lonely.

565
00:43:02,203 --> 00:43:08,947
If there is no one looking for you,
it would be too heartbreaking.

566
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:21,523
You're up.

567
00:43:22,342 --> 00:43:23,547
Yes.

568
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:25,778
When did you get here?

569
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,353
4 a.m.

570
00:43:29,353 --> 00:43:30,982
What time is it now?

571
00:43:30,982 --> 00:43:32,732
7 a.m.

572
00:43:32,732 --> 00:43:35,611
What? 7 a.m.?

573
00:43:35,611 --> 00:43:37,711
I'm in a big trouble!

574
00:43:37,711 --> 00:43:39,358
What?

575
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,622
Work starts at 6 but if I go now it would be
already past 8... Then I'm late.

576
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:45,669
It's embarrassing.

577
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:50,638
What kind of patissier wakes up
later than the time cakes should be out?

578
00:43:50,638 --> 00:43:52,074
Bag, bag, where's my bag?

579
00:43:53,555 --> 00:43:55,420
I packed your stuffs.

580
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:58,537
Thanks! I'm going.

581
00:43:58,537 --> 00:44:01,367
You're going to just leave?

582
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:03,872
Of course, then should I play?

583
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,138
Ah, I got it, I got it.

584
00:44:08,138 --> 00:44:10,525
Okay, stay well, Oppa's leaving.

585
00:44:11,924 --> 00:44:14,351
What do you mean "Oppa"?

586
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:17,935
Don't drive fast because you're in a rush.

587
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:19,117
Okay, I'm leaving.

588
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:23,311
I packed your favorite red undies to cheer you up.

589
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:25,444
You'll be late, hurry.

590
00:44:25,444 --> 00:44:26,200
Okay, bye.

591
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,150
Bye!

592
00:44:34,123 --> 00:44:36,166
Make sure you eat.

593
00:44:36,532 --> 00:44:38,987
Goodbye, bye!

594
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:43,996
Bye!

595
00:44:44,324 --> 00:44:47,956
Hey!
You both look like a newlywed couple.

596
00:44:47,956 --> 00:44:53,969
"Honey, return safely!
I'll cook delicious food and be waiting for you!"

597
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:56,226
I need to try that next time.

598
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,013
Don't make me jealous.

599
00:44:58,013 --> 00:45:02,227
I'm going to eat everything you make for Hedgehog.

600
00:45:02,227 --> 00:45:05,998
Should I bring a lunch box to Hedgehog?

601
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:09,007
Why?
So I can't touch his food?

602
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:12,423
Or do they not feed them in Saint Honore?

603
00:45:12,423 --> 00:45:18,389
The thought came to my mind that Hedgehog hasn't tried eating a packed lunch from home.

604
00:45:18,389 --> 00:45:22,171
That's right. Pack it with the utmost devotion.

605
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:26,372
So that he would feel like he's receiving
all the love that he deserved throughout his life.

606
00:45:42,529 --> 00:45:46,998
The 8th anniversary celebration cake for the Solar Evergy Development. No wonder it's Hedgehog!

607
00:45:46,998 --> 00:45:48,909
It's done very well. Right, Grandfather?

608
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:50,032
Yes.

609
00:45:50,032 --> 00:45:53,046
What about you, Grandpa?
Did you finish the croque en bouche?

610
00:45:55,494 --> 00:45:59,287
I'm sorry, she sort of lacks manners.

611
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:01,764
That's what makes her cute.

612
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,398
It's definitely 8th anniversary in anyone's eyes, right?

613
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:14,314
Are you going to pretend you don't know your mother?

614
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:21,497
If you make a mistake with the croque en bouche, and harm Saint Honore...

615
00:46:22,499 --> 00:46:25,177
Whats that? 
Is that a resignation letter?

616
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:29,442
It's Grandfather's resume.
Please review it carefully.

617
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,303
Emergency! Emergency!

618
00:46:36,303 --> 00:46:38,411
The representative is here!

619
00:46:38,411 --> 00:46:40,306
Already?

620
00:46:42,899 --> 00:46:45,164
You've arrived.

621
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:49,887
Is it ready? The Croque en Bouche?

622
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,469
Hey, Seung Ji!

623
00:47:04,939 --> 00:47:06,607
Come on, hurry up!

624
00:47:06,607 --> 00:47:07,467
Why?

625
00:47:07,467 --> 00:47:10,486
They're judging the Croque en Bouche right now.

626
00:47:10,486 --> 00:47:12,505
Lets go, lets go!

627
00:47:28,286 --> 00:47:41,555

628
00:47:46,106 --> 00:47:49,275
Could you go get the patissier who made this?

629
00:47:49,275 --> 00:47:51,874
That would be me.

630
00:47:57,764 --> 00:48:00,204
It's been a long time, Mr. Park!

631
00:48:00,204 --> 00:48:01,742
Can you recognize me?

632
00:48:01,742 --> 00:48:04,979
Of course. I knew it was you
 when I saw the crouque en bouche.

633
00:48:04,979 --> 00:48:06,973
I'm so happy to see you!

634
00:48:06,973 --> 00:48:10,236
I'm very happy to see you too.

635
00:48:12,321 --> 00:48:15,510
It's great, President!

636
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:21,911
That's my best pupil,
who is so much better than I am.

637
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:23,658
Who could be better than you?

638
00:48:23,658 --> 00:48:27,991
There is one. He's the one.

639
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:39,880
  Park Byeong Moo
Work Experience and Qualifications, Etc.

640
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:44,259
 Le Cordon Blue Summa cum laude 
 Hotel ___  France, Chief Patissier...
Japan...researcher...
US...professor...

641
00:48:50,763 --> 00:48:55,680
When our grandpa made a grand entry,
 that proud woman exclaimed, 
"Oh, it's you, Mr Park!".

642
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,091
Alright!

643
00:48:58,091 --> 00:48:59,461
Did they know each other?

644
00:48:59,461 --> 00:49:07,218
Our grandpa made the cakes when she was proposed, when she got engaged, and when she got married.

645
00:49:07,218 --> 00:49:10,712
Our grandpa was the head patissier at her mother-in-law's hotel.

646
00:49:10,712 --> 00:49:15,223
Alright! Alright! Cheers for Grandpa!

647
00:49:15,223 --> 00:49:17,101
Oppa, why aren't you saying a word?

648
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:19,057
What's the matter, Beom Bo?

649
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,586
Say it, if you have something to say. 
Don't hold it back.

650
00:49:21,586 --> 00:49:24,610
President, I love you!

651
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,386
Hey, me too. Me too.

652
00:49:26,386 --> 00:49:29,992
Grandpa, I love you!

653
00:49:29,992 --> 00:49:34,728
Then we can find out about Jang Byun Chun at anytime.

654
00:49:34,728 --> 00:49:40,079
It's possible, either through my mom or my sister.

655
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,363
It would be better if we don't get Won Yi involved.

656
00:49:44,363 --> 00:49:45,923
Thank you.

657
00:49:45,923 --> 00:49:49,261
You don't have to be thankful or feel sorry.

658
00:49:49,261 --> 00:49:52,580
Please don't think like that.

659
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:57,968
If it's a case that is over 20 years old, 
wouldn't it be closed?

660
00:49:57,968 --> 00:50:03,464
So I'm still investigating. And, I've been 
questioning the people who were around.

661
00:50:03,464 --> 00:50:07,068
Won Il, do you have a lawyer you can trust?

662
00:50:07,068 --> 00:50:10,924
Yes, I was going to meet him later. He's Kang Eun Bi's father.

663
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:15,526
Then, why don't you also discuss about his embezzlement case?

664
00:50:15,526 --> 00:50:18,255
How do you know I was going to talk about that?

665
00:50:18,255 --> 00:50:21,067
He's capable of doing more than that.

666
00:50:21,067 --> 00:50:23,880
How much would it be?

667
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,631
I think it would be over 2000 monthly for 20 years.

668
00:50:28,631 --> 00:50:30,137
Alright then.

669
00:50:30,137 --> 00:50:32,686
What would happen with that amount of money?

670
00:50:32,686 --> 00:50:35,558
He can't escape it.

671
00:50:35,558 --> 00:50:41,763
How about if I meet Jang Byung Chun, 
I mean Choi Jae Gyum?

672
00:50:41,763 --> 00:50:45,518
I don't know exactly what you're thinking of, 
but I have a good idea.

673
00:50:45,518 --> 00:50:50,142
I will definitely arrange for you to meet Jang Byung Chun.

674
00:50:50,142 --> 00:50:56,262
So, don't do anything ahead on your own. If we lose him by doing so...

675
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,429
Yes.

676
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,642
I understand.

677
00:51:10,093 --> 00:51:13,819
What happened with your friend who
 was going to work on Min Woo's photos?

678
00:51:13,819 --> 00:51:17,969
I gave the photos to him yesterday.
 I asked him to work on them as soon as he can.

679
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:19,716
Did he say it'll take a long time?

680
00:51:19,716 --> 00:51:23,646
He found his parents through the program,
 and he ended up working in the field.

681
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:30,295
He will do it quickly. 
He would understand the best 
what it feels like to look for 
one's parents or children.

682
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,594
Alright...

683
00:51:32,594 --> 00:51:34,204
What's the matter?

684
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:40,090
We can't find Min Woo right away just because
 we know what he looks like now.

685
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:45,064
I'm just worried that Ahjumma will be too hopeful.

686
00:51:45,064 --> 00:51:49,253
Ahjumma will be alright.

687
00:51:49,844 --> 00:51:52,663
The reason why I asked not to tell Grandpa

688
00:51:52,663 --> 00:51:54,372
is not just because I want him to work.

689
00:51:54,372 --> 00:52:00,139
You didn't want him to know, so he won't be disappointed?
Yeah.

690
00:52:01,171 --> 00:52:03,869
Alright, you're right.

691
00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:07,597
If I get the photo, I'll contact you right away.

692
00:52:07,597 --> 00:52:12,300
I can't wait to see how Min Woo matured.

693
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,461
Me too.

694
00:52:15,574 --> 00:52:19,708
Stop doing that, get ready to meet Won Il!

695
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:22,886
Why would I get ready to meet him?
 I'm not the one who likes him.

696
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:29,782
Even though you don't 
have to like Won Il, 
you should still look 
presentable as a lawyer.

697
00:52:29,782 --> 00:52:33,480
Being like this is the 
most comfortable for me, 
in this type of setting.

698
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,058
So, you should meet him at work. 
Why are you meeting him in a cafe?

699
00:52:38,058 --> 00:52:41,146
It's not like Won Il is giving me a case to work on.

700
00:52:41,146 --> 00:52:44,975
I'm meeting him for you because I have no choice.
 So, why should I meet him at work?

701
00:52:44,975 --> 00:52:47,449
I don't know. I don't know.

702
00:52:47,449 --> 00:52:51,030
Anyway, I really don't like this, Dad.

703
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,780
If you behave this way, it won't be in your favor, Eun Bi Ssi.

704
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,697
What did I do?!

705
00:52:54,697 --> 00:53:01,014
Should I tell about how you're at home, and what condition you room is in?

706
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:04,379
Dad, father, dear father.

707
00:53:04,379 --> 00:53:09,244
You know how much I love and respect you, right?

708
00:53:09,244 --> 00:53:11,396
I don't think I really know.

709
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:15,727
I'll do everything you tell me to do from now on.
 But please don't tell Won Il...

710
00:53:15,727 --> 00:53:16,528
He came.

711
00:53:16,528 --> 00:53:21,527
Please don't joke. 
The horrendous mess that I am at home,

712
00:53:21,527 --> 00:53:24,036
please don't ever tell Won Il about it. Please?

713
00:53:24,036 --> 00:53:26,377
Please have a seat.

714
00:53:29,951 --> 00:53:34,091
You probably thought it was 
strange to meet in a cafe, where it's 
hard have documents around, right?

715
00:53:34,091 --> 00:53:35,393
No.

716
00:53:35,393 --> 00:53:39,845
Actually, there's someone who 
Choi Jae Gyum knows at the office.

717
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:43,566
I wasn't sure about that person.

718
00:53:43,566 --> 00:53:46,144
Thank you for your concern.

719
00:53:46,144 --> 00:53:48,620
You don't need to be thankful.

720
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,681
How well are you prepared for it emotionally?

721
00:53:51,681 --> 00:53:53,346
In what aspect?

722
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:59,067
Even though you're 
Saint Honore's President, 
you are a son and a brother.

723
00:53:59,067 --> 00:54:03,464
I wonder how well prepared you're for the
 trauma that your family will experience.

724
00:54:03,464 --> 00:54:06,344
I think I need to know.

725
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:12,330
I just would like you to proceed with it accurately, thoroughly, and without any emotions attached.

726
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:16,770
It can lead to a criminal penalty.
Do you have that in mind?

727
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,109
Yes.

728
00:54:18,109 --> 00:54:23,435
Alright. I understand. 
Please leave this in my hands. 
And, President Choi Won Il 
should just concentrate on your work.

729
00:54:23,435 --> 00:54:28,191
You can't have a story 
saying that Saint Honore 
cannot operate without Choi Jae Gyum.

730
00:54:28,191 --> 00:54:33,430
If you get distracted, your employees could catch on really quickly.

731
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:37,160
I understand. I'll remember that.

732
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,911
Then, let's proceed with it fully.

733
00:54:39,911 --> 00:54:41,164
Yes.

734
00:54:41,837 --> 00:54:43,218
What did you just say?

735
00:54:43,218 --> 00:54:46,958
Croque en bouche was a success.

736
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:49,215
Who made it?

737
00:54:49,215 --> 00:54:52,908
An old patissier.

738
00:54:52,908 --> 00:54:54,682
What did he look like?

739
00:54:54,682 --> 00:55:00,441
He...was handsome.

740
00:55:03,975 --> 00:55:08,411
You made the celebration cake.
 Why do you need to stay up all night? 
Let's go home, Hedgehog.

741
00:55:08,411 --> 00:55:10,934
No, I have to create a new product.
Why don't you get going?

742
00:55:10,934 --> 00:55:13,739
Grandpa, go home early, and have a good rest.

743
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:16,349
Oh! What brings you to talk 
to me using honorific words?

744
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:18,946
It's a special treat for you.

745
00:55:18,946 --> 00:55:22,604
You really did a big thing for me, 
you punk! Take it easy.

746
00:55:22,604 --> 00:55:25,487
Grandpa, I love you!

747
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:29,245
I love you too.

748
00:55:55,148 --> 00:55:57,718
Who's that?

749
00:56:00,528 --> 00:56:01,537
Have you been waiting for me?

750
00:56:01,537 --> 00:56:05,875
Why would I be waiting for you?
I said goodbye to my grandpa.

751
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:07,407
But,

752
00:56:07,407 --> 00:56:08,905
what are you up to this late at night?

753
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:10,229
You've been out all day.

754
00:56:10,229 --> 00:56:13,471
Since I stayed out all day,
I came to finish up my work. Why?

755
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:16,932
Oh, I see. Then,

756
00:56:16,932 --> 00:56:19,533
using your notebook (computer),

757
00:56:19,533 --> 00:56:20,964
work hard.

758
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:22,566
Work hard.

759
00:56:22,566 --> 00:56:24,664
What?

760
00:56:34,783 --> 00:56:37,328
Choi Won Il will have a hard time.

761
00:56:37,328 --> 00:56:40,900
Ah! Hedgehog, you really!

762
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,744
Aish!

763
00:56:43,744 --> 00:56:45,327
What, Da Yang?

764
00:56:45,327 --> 00:56:46,754
I'm in the office.

765
00:56:46,754 --> 00:56:50,465
Hedgehog put the picture files on my computer!

766
00:56:50,465 --> 00:56:53,888
I've been busy erasing all these.
 I haven't had a chance to open my e-mail yet.

767
00:56:53,888 --> 00:56:58,145
I can't open it...
 Maybe it's infected with a virus...

768
00:56:58,145 --> 00:57:00,473
Huh? You came here?

769
00:57:00,473 --> 00:57:06,920
I want to see Min Woo's 
photo with you. 
I also wanted to feed 
Hedgehog a meal tonight.

770
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,491
Ok. I'll be right up after I see Hedgehog.

771
00:57:10,491 --> 00:57:15,169
Alright. Erase them, and open your e-mail.

772
00:57:17,905 --> 00:57:22,521
Hedgehog, you didn't know it's an important day for us.

773
00:57:29,873 --> 00:57:36,509
Ah, Hedgehog, that punk! What on earth did 
he do that even the picture I got is his face?

774
00:57:44,454 --> 00:57:47,987
 Maculinea teleius

775
00:57:47,987 --> 00:57:51,207
 Aspidomorpha transparipennis

776
00:57:51,207 --> 00:57:54,826
 Rhyssa persuasoria

777
00:57:54,826 --> 00:57:56,808
 Homotropus

778
00:57:56,808 --> 00:58:00,041
 tarsatorius

779
00:58:00,956 --> 00:58:03,478
You...

780
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:07,649
Who are you...?

781
00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:12,049
Hedgehog is

782
00:58:12,049 --> 00:58:15,206
Min Woo?

783
00:58:30,066 --> 00:58:31,698
 Why are you buttoning like that?

784
00:58:31,698 --> 00:58:34,507
 Min Woo said it's hard to button up.

785
00:58:34,507 --> 00:58:39,403
  He starts with the third button to make it come out right. He even taught me.

786
00:58:39,403 --> 00:58:41,355

788
00:58:43,097 --> 00:58:46,663

789
00:58:46,663 --> 00:58:49,350
 I was worried,

790
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:51,712
 and I missed you.
What could I do?

791
00:58:51,712 --> 00:58:53,313
 What did you say?
