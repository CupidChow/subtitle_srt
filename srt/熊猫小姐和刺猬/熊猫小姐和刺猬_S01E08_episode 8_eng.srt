1
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:50,539

2
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:00,805
Your ugly face became uglier.

3
00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:03,553
Is it Choi Jae Gyum again?

4
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:05,436
The macaron for the makeup product advertisement....

5
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:06,955
They copied mine again?

6
00:01:06,955 --> 00:01:12,999
We suddenly got the advertisement work. We never even received a macaron project.

7
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:16,121
Yeah, I became a very important person to Choi Jae Gyum.

8
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:19,412
How can you joke right now?

9
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:22,994
Hedgehog, is it possible for you to make 22 servings by 4 PM?

10
00:01:22,994 --> 00:01:23,828
What?

11
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:30,615
A customer asked if you can get a cake or macarons ready as presents for his guests who couldn't attend.

12
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:33,022
How pretty could she be!

13
00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:34,476
He'll hear!

14
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:37,269
Yes. I heard it.

15
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,427
My girl friend is pretty.

16
00:01:39,427 --> 00:01:41,570
Is it possible by 4 pm?

17
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,543
Do you think it won't be possible?

18
00:01:43,543 --> 00:01:47,734
I must have thought it would be possible because I ordered.

19
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:51,458
What are you doing, Assistant?

20
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,584
Follow me.

21
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:53,234
 Episode 8

22
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:55,420
Ja...

23
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,212
Heh, we'll prepare it perfectly so don't worry and leave, customer.

24
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:09,135
What are you doing, Assistant?
Why aren't you following him?
 Did you forget about the round? One, two, three, go.

25
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:18,892
I'm going to buy some flowers for the table setting so don't fight and prepare it well!

26
00:02:18,892 --> 00:02:28,139
If the business keeps on doing this well, then we might pay off my debt and my aunt's. 
Maybe we can give a loan to the bank?

27
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,485
Wash your hands and put an apron on.

28
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:40,682
It's not the time to bake right now.
Then,

29
00:02:41,084 --> 00:02:45,070
should we even lose the order because of Choi Jae Gyum?

30
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,426
Right now, with me, let's go...

31
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:48,859
Go there, then what.

32
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:51,806
Oh, You're here again?

33
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:52,873
I left my cell phone.

34
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,698
Oh, yes.

35
00:02:56,118 --> 00:03:00,130
Would you go to the president of the cosmetic company, and tell them that 
Choi Jae Gyum copied Ko Seung Ji's macarons?

36
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,564
And, tell them to use Ko Seung Ji's macarons, not Saint Honore's, would you?

37
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:04,979
If not,

38
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,284
would you go to Choi Jae Gyum, and ask him to tell the truth?
Because you think they'd do whatever you tell them to do?

39
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:11,497
We have to do something. Should we just stay still?

40
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:15,700
In a fair competition, Choi Jae Gyum cannot win over Ko Seung Ji.

41
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,611
What did you just say?

42
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:21,301
The representative from the advertising company said that as he left.

43
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:25,483
I knew it would turn out this way at that time.

44
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:29,910
If it's not a fair competition, then you'll keep on losing and you will keep getting beat up.

45
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,714
What is a fair competition?

46
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:33,374
Is there such a thing?

47
00:03:33,374 --> 00:03:39,241
Even if this repeats, you would still stand it for the day to get a fair competition? Is that what you want?

48
00:03:42,213 --> 00:03:44,885
Yes.

49
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:51,869
Even if I want to beat up Choi Jae Gyum and set fire on Saint Honore, I'll still grit my teeth and bear it.

50
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:56,395
Why are you holding it in? I'm mad too but you're probably more mad.

51
00:03:56,395 --> 00:04:01,191
You used to turn everything upside down when you were wronged!
Why are you willing to go this far to bear it all?!

52
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:04,699
Why are you letting them just take from you?! 
Why?!

53
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,410
Compared to you,

54
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:13,151
I don't have much.

55
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:15,354
I had lost so much.

56
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:18,727
I know what would happen if I don't bear it.

57
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:26,148
I can jokingly fight with you, but if I fight with others,

58
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:30,890
I have to be ready to give up everything.

59
00:04:33,203 --> 00:04:36,380
So just go get some almond powder, now.

60
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,758
Tell Da Yang to cancel the order. Tell him to have the event somewhere else.

61
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:43,676
Your mood got ruined and what cake can you make?

62
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:47,361
Right now and in the future...

63
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:50,582
The most important thing to me....

64
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,157
Is the customer who ordered trusting me.

65
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:58,765
A patissier who can't please a customer, is not a patissier.

66
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,304
A patissier who prioritize his mood over customer,

67
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:05,925
even if he is in a fair competition, do you think he'd be able to please the judges?

68
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:09,586
So just go get the almond powder.

69
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:22,402
If you're not going to work, leave. It's bothersome.

70
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:46,039
Maculinea teleius.
Aspidomorpha...

71
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:33,957
Because you work at Saint Honore, I'm holding it in.

72
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:37,693
Because I know you are trying to help me. But I...

73
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:42,529
I still haven't found a way to protect you.

74
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:05,783
I came to meet Representative Ha In Ho.

75
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:08,903
The Representative is in an important meeting right now.

76
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:11,131
Where could I wait?

77
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,281
I would have to know who you are...

78
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:16,768
Saint Honore's President, Choi Won Il.

79
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:25,925
Hello.

80
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:26,858
I'm Ha In Ho.

81
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:30,171
I'm Choi Won Il. You were in a meeting so..

82
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:33,654
We were in a meeting about Saint Honore.

83
00:07:56,793 --> 00:08:02,854
Choi Jae Gyum gave me a box of the macarons from where you are sitting.

84
00:08:03,452 --> 00:08:09,793
Panda, hedgehog, turtle like... they were macarons of animals.

85
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:15,968
Did you give the makeup macaron opportunity to Ko Seung Ji only or to us also?

86
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:18,911
I originally asked Choi Jae Gyum to do it.

87
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:23,078
But, it was so bad that I asked
 patissier Ko Seung Ji.

88
00:08:23,078 --> 00:08:26,879
Then why were Saint Honore's macarons selected?

89
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:32,344
Not as President of Saint Honore, but you're here as a friend of Ko Seung Ji.

90
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,928
Are you here for Ko Seung Ji?

91
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:37,520
Yes. You're right.

92
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,623
What happened? What do we have to do?

93
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,482
Maculinea teleius.
Aspidomorpha transparipennis.

94
00:08:58,482 --> 00:09:02,165
Rhyssa persuasoria.

95
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:07,499
Homotropus tarsatorius.

96
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,921
 Director Choi Jae Gyum got a connection with the cosmetic company.

97
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:32,261
 To send the pictures of Ko Seung Ji's macarons before the final meeting,

98
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:35,341
 he used me.

99
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:40,658
The problem was that the cosmetic company
 has people similar to Choi Jae Gyum.

100
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:46,768
I cannot abandon my advertisement work to be on the side with Ko Seung Ji.

101
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:51,146
Moreover, considering Ko Seung Ji's current circumstances,

102
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:57,417
he cannot win over Choi Jae Gyum's connection and power.

103
00:09:57,417 --> 00:10:03,088
 Even if President Choi Won Il helped, it would still be breaking a stone with an egg.

104
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:06,713
 So why don't we just let it go for now,

105
00:10:06,713 --> 00:10:11,179
 and wait for an opportunity to help Ko Seung Ji.

106
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:44,804
Maculinea teleius.

107
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:50,853
Aspidomorpha transparipennis.

108
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:56,084
Rhyssa persuasoria.

109
00:10:56,084 --> 00:11:01,021
Homotropus tarsatorius.

110
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:20,924
You came?

111
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:22,386
Yes.

112
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:28,168
What is she doing?

113
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,660
Hedgehog is showing off magical macaron making techniques.

114
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,549
He said not to bother him because he needs to concentrate.

115
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:34,784
So they are spying on him.

116
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:36,522
And not working.

117
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:38,896
I'll help you so don't worry.

118
00:11:40,974 --> 00:11:44,366
A man's good looking face is important, after all.

119
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:48,337
The shining face of a genius who is indulged in his work.

120
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:52,108
Should I go inside and just bite it?

121
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:55,305
Bite where? 
 Nose? 
 Cheek?

122
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:56,428
Lips?

123
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,678
Lips?

124
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,039
Hyung!

125
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:04,232
Where are you going?

126
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:06,666
Where do you think? To assist Hedgehog.

127
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,588
The touching round one is still ongoing.

128
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:14,319
Pleasing to see that way,

129
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,330
and pleasing to see that way as well,

130
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:18,524
What should I do?

131
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,332
A credit card with no limit on one hand, and a bank account with a full balance on the other,

132
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:25,398
the touch of holding them together?

133
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:29,367
I've never had that experience before,

134
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,112
It's hard to imagine that.

135
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:33,415
Ah, don't worry.

136
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:40,434
It's seems to me that those two servants will soon let you know strongly what that's like.

137
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:42,152
Really?

138
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,636
I think in my previous life,

139
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:49,240
I must have saved a country twice.

140
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,944
Seeing these,

141
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:04,945
makes me want to quit the presidency at St. Honore and be a president here.

142
00:13:04,945 --> 00:13:07,108
Seeing you,

143
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:09,552
I want to stop being a patissier here,

144
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:12,220
and become a patissier at Saint Honore.

145
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,639
Really?

146
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:16,566
Can't you understand a joke?

147
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:18,883
Your head is used to look tall.

148
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:21,083
Really? Do you want to try?

149
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,624
What?!

150
00:13:22,624 --> 00:13:23,598
Yeah.

151
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:25,995
Are you all ready?

152
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:27,480
The girlfriend of the customer is coming shortly.

153
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,088
They come when they come.

154
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:30,941
It's not even 4 pm yet.
What's the matter?

155
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,044
They came!

156
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,227
They came! They came!

157
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:34,430
They came! They came!

158
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,785
They came! They came!

159
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:38,948
Ah,

160
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:42,376
You can run upstairs as fast as you want.

161
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:44,784
But your eyes are already leveled for me.

162
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:48,211
Wouldn't it be just a disappointment?

163
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,464
This is not what I imagined...

164
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:23,214
You listen carefully!

165
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:25,333
Don't forget that you're in the first round.

166
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,605
Don't get into a fight.

167
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:29,262
Do your best to get ready for the event.

168
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:38,176
Are you listening to me...?

169
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:45,748
You are still in the first round to determine who will date me.

170
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:46,891
Move away!

171
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:51,417
Won Il, this is your opportunity. Don't forget that you're in the first round.

172
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:53,593
Why don't you go in and get the beverages ready, hurry.

173
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,118
You... do it.

174
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,821
You two...

175
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:00,300
You're dead!

176
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,873
Oh...

177
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:05,300
Aish...

178
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:09,790
You stay here, don't move!

179
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,775
The customers came. How can we just stay here?

180
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:14,308
This isn't even my room. Why would I stay here?

181
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:18,065
To both of you, because of a large crowd of customers,

182
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:20,296
even though I have a bomb ready,

183
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:22,412
you should understand that I'm trying my best not to explode it.

184
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:23,642
Understood?!

185
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:25,640
I asked if you understood!

186
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,818
Unni! Unni!

187
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:28,994
The customers are looking for you.

188
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,130
-Me?
-Me?

189
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:33,563
Hey, why would customers look for you?

190
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:35,006
Is this Saint Honore?

191
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,802
Ah, both of you.

192
00:15:43,792 --> 00:16:08,832

193
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:14,671
This is Ko Seung Ji patissier's present to you.

194
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:15,888
Ah.

195
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:19,021
And this one is for you.

196
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,324
I get one too?

197
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:27,640
Wow.

198
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:30,006
It's pretty!

199
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:35,574
What could mine be?

200
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:39,552
I guess I like it.

201
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,459
Everyone is on their way.

202
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:49,868
Let's introduce ourselves.

203
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:55,151
This is the person you've been curious about. My girlfriend, Sinatori Mina.

204
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:57,574
Ah! Japan!

205
00:16:57,574 --> 00:16:58,894
Nice to meet you!

206
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:04,179
 I'm Choi Won Il. It's nice to meet you.

207
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:07,757
 Thank you for visiting our cafe.

208
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:11,214
I heard you're not from this cafe.

209
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:15,623
 I am not employed at Cafe Panda...

210
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:17,273
But,

211
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:18,236
are you Korean?

212
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:20,246
No, I am Japanese.

213
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:22,338
She is a very famous actress in Japan.

214
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:24,840
Ah! That's right!

215
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,360
Sinatori.

216
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,396
Crazy! I knew you were familiar!

217
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:32,148
Do you know me?

218
00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:33,669
I saw the movie you were in.

219
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:35,071
You are an amazing actress.

220
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:36,662
Thank you.

221
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:40,268
But, how can you speak Korean so well?

222
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,447
I learned, diligently.

223
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:45,137
I wanted to be able to speak with this man.

224
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,342
Do you still feel it was too much for you to make the cake and the macarons?

225
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,111
What do you mean?

226
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,436
I never said that, right?

227
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:55,147
I never complained, did I?

228
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,027
If the cake and the macarons are not to your liking,

229
00:17:58,027 --> 00:18:00,575
I will have them go back into the kitchen and make them again.

230
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,115
You don't like it, do you?

231
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,454
It's not that I didn't like it...

232
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:07,737
I feel like I received such a wonderful present,

233
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:10,718
that I think I owe a present back.

234
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:13,652
Please give me an autograph.

235
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:15,741
Oh, sure.

236
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:33,089
Ahh. She was really pretty.

237
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:36,432
That's the first time I've seen such a beautiful woman.

238
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:38,135
How pretty is she?

239
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:39,819
Lets see...

240
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:45,996
It's like her eyes are made of the stars in the sky. Her eye...

241
00:18:48,716 --> 00:18:53,729
A luxurious mousse cake has a beautiful cherry

242
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:55,496
on the top.

243
00:18:55,496 --> 00:18:56,835
Then what about Panda?

244
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,720
Why are you suddenly asking about Panda?

245
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,011
Yeah?

246
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:05,491
What is it?

247
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:06,577
What are you doing here?

248
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:07,716
Won Yi said,

249
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:09,258
said that you two are in a danger.

250
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:10,293
She asked us to come see you.

251
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:12,277
What danger are we in?

252
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,709
You got kicked out by Pan Da Yang.

253
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,557
After she kicked out both of you,

254
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,291
Pan Da Yang said that

255
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,604
whether it's round one, or whatever,

256
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:21,659
you're both out.

257
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:22,690
That's what I heard.

258
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:25,964
You don't care if she said that or not, do you?

259
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:28,003
Before we really get kicked out, let's hurry back to

260
00:19:28,003 --> 00:19:29,444
See mina one more time?

261
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:32,054
Yes. One, two, three. Go.

262
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,766
Let's go too!

263
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:38,540
Don't get left behind.

264
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,862
Run faster.

265
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:42,707
Wait a sec.

266
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,527
What?

267
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:46,816
Car.

268
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:48,036
What about a car?

269
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:57,259
It was here.

270
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:00,479
Hot-wire it.

271
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:01,417
What?

272
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,073
You're a pro.

273
00:20:03,073 --> 00:20:03,904
Hot-wire it, hurry.

274
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:05,563
I've been clean for a long time.

275
00:20:05,563 --> 00:20:08,105
You skill worth of three stars don't go anywhere.

276
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,310
Do you not have the key?

277
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,239
Gil Dong Goo took it.

278
00:20:11,748 --> 00:20:13,166
You have another one, don't you?

279
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,743
Panda had it in her wallet and he took that too.

280
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,516
Haaa... that jerk. Why couldn't he leave one behind?

281
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:21,902
Call the insurance company.

282
00:20:21,902 --> 00:20:23,244
You do it.

283
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:24,383
I have to hurry and

284
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:25,646
see Mina's  face.

285
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:27,310
You want to see by yourself, you bastard?

286
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,739
I have eyes too.

287
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:30,672
I want to see pretty women, too.

288
00:20:30,672 --> 00:20:33,374
So why don't you hot-wire it fast?
Huh?

289
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:38,417
It'll be dangerous if we get caught.

290
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,708
Hey. This car is mine.

291
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,083
Why would it be dangerous?

292
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,472
We have no instruments.

293
00:20:44,472 --> 00:20:46,173
If we take the car, we get to see Mina.

294
00:20:46,173 --> 00:20:48,416
But if we run, we won't be able to. What are you going to do?

295
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,062
How pretty is she that,

296
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:51,784
you two who were crazy about Panda,

297
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,053
put Panda aside,

298
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,567
and make a fuss about Mina?

299
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:57,518
Give me a minute.

300
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:01,147
Let's go see Mina, let's go see Mina.

301
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:04,119
What are you upset about now?

302
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:06,481
Choi Jae Gyum made another trouble?

303
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:09,513
He's probably worried that Panda will scold him.

304
00:21:10,274 --> 00:21:13,028
Think about that later. Now, we go to see Mina.

305
00:21:13,028 --> 00:21:14,695
One, two, three. Go!

306
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:15,787
Okay!

307
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:17,471
I am driving as fast as I can.

308
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:23,581
Mina, mina, mina, mina, mina, mina, mina, mina...

309
00:21:37,284 --> 00:21:38,689
Where did the car go?

310
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:40,397
This is where I left it.

311
00:21:40,397 --> 00:21:43,210
Where did the car go? Did it just roll away?

312
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,891
Where did the car go?!

313
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:49,036
Aish! Im going crazy!

314
00:21:50,228 --> 00:21:54,627
Aish! Hedgehog is going to kill me.

315
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:57,684
Aish! I should have  returned it sooner.

316
00:21:58,131 --> 00:21:59,908
Aigoo!

317
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:06,100
Who stole the car? I'm really going to go crazy...

318
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,341
Will you keep them over the night?

319
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:20,699
If you have something to say, then hurry up and dismiss them!

320
00:22:20,699 --> 00:22:22,080
That's right, Noonim.

321
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,707
They are probably tired today from being excited over Mina.

322
00:22:24,707 --> 00:22:28,544
-Ah really!!
-Don't you dare look up!

323
00:22:28,544 --> 00:22:30,683
We found the car, isn't this too much?

324
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,437
Car is a car, and I am me.

325
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:36,273
You guys were the ones who kept saying you loved me to death

326
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:37,896
and asking to be picked?

327
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:39,568
It's not me!

328
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:42,398
Why are we also being scolded?

329
00:22:42,398 --> 00:22:44,879
We even helped find the car.

330
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:51,448
You know I'm really thankful.

331
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:53,399
Please go ahead first.

332
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:55,589
Goodbye.

333
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:04,055
You still don't get it? Go back in position!

334
00:23:04,055 --> 00:23:06,085
We have been in position since long ago. What do you mean?

335
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,954
I mean you two got back in your previous position.

336
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:12,711
Hedgehog is a business partner, and Won Il is Bbang Il, Byun Bing Geo.

337
00:23:12,711 --> 00:23:17,975
You two are unattractive bastards who won't be treated like a man to me. Okay?

338
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,888
I say this because we are back in position. The touching round one, you got it.

339
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:37,835
Why?

340
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:42,766
You didn't tell on me about how I brought the car to Panda.

341
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:48,454
That little shot wouldn't have me just back in position, but permanently erased.

342
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:53,403
You... What is your real identity?

343
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:57,614
The worst man you can think of.

344
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:02,027
Same here.

345
00:24:02,027 --> 00:24:04,963
You are also the worst man?

346
00:24:04,963 --> 00:24:09,876
If you told Da Yang that St. Honore copies your macarons and takes your advertisement work,

347
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:15,800
I would also not stop at back in position but at a permanent erase.

348
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:22,129
I guess two stinky men stuck to Panda.

349
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:26,174
So you want to get back in position together?

350
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:30,862
Maybe if Mina would give up her boyfriend and come to me,

351
00:24:30,862 --> 00:24:32,997
that's probably not possible.

352
00:24:32,997 --> 00:24:36,551
The first round is still ongoing.

353
00:24:36,551 --> 00:24:40,593
I can't remain flat when Panda has it in for me.

354
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:45,818
That's right. I won't live as a piece of Byun or Bbang.

355
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:49,072
I mean, I can't.

356
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:52,274
Then do round 1 again, OK?

357
00:24:52,274 --> 00:24:55,691
Don't want to? Give up?

358
00:24:57,064 --> 00:25:02,199
But seriously, what is your real identity?

359
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:07,144
Are you guys dating?

360
00:25:07,144 --> 00:25:10,204
Your share the same taste of woman, and hang out together all night.

361
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:14,944
If you like each other so much that you guys are still face to face, why don't you two just go out together?

362
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:20,994
It's gonna be tough from tomorrow.

363
00:25:20,994 --> 00:25:23,800
Should I stop coming from tomorrow?

364
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:28,327
What? Do you think you will be lonely without me?

365
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:29,621
Yes.

366
00:25:29,621 --> 00:25:31,213
I don't think I can live without you.

367
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:32,538
Let's go out together.

368
00:25:32,538 --> 00:25:34,247
-What are you doing?
-Let's date.

369
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:36,394
I was too nice to you. I'm leaving!

370
00:25:36,394 --> 00:25:38,913
Let's date! Uh?!

371
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:43,185
See you tomorrow, Assistant.

372
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:09,178
Ah, that's good. Stop taking pictures.

373
00:26:09,178 --> 00:26:11,513
Pictures are not only for me to take.

374
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:13,650
With who?
With me?

375
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,906
Should I schedule a photo shoot right after President comes back from the vacation?

376
00:26:16,906 --> 00:26:21,631
Why call someone having fun while I am working my ass off?

377
00:26:21,631 --> 00:26:24,635
How come you guys are so thoughtless?

378
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:27,931
If it's neither me nor Won Il, then with whom?

379
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:30,598
Thank you, Chairman!

380
00:26:30,598 --> 00:26:32,959
Why would you be in it?

381
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,024
I'm sorry, Chairman.

382
00:26:35,024 --> 00:26:38,755
Whose macaron is this macaron?

383
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:42,361
It's a macaron for a cosmetics advertisement, isn't it?

384
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:48,687
Then, who should be on the cover of the magazine with me?

385
00:26:48,687 --> 00:26:50,781
The cosmetic company's president?

386
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:54,204
Do you think the public would recognize the cosmetic company's president?

387
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:56,750
Stop playing twenty questions.

388
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,233
With whom do you want to take the pictures?

389
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:01,381
Won Yi?

390
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:04,753
What do you mean, Won Yi?

391
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:08,034
What is the flower of advertisement?

392
00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:10,338
Wouldn't it be a model?

393
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:16,215
A makeup model would fit perfectly with this flowery macaron.

394
00:27:16,215 --> 00:27:19,701
The macaron would shine. I would also shine!

395
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:22,997
Wouldn't that flatter Saint Honore as well?

396
00:27:22,997 --> 00:27:24,280
That's right!

397
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:30,326
Then if that model falls for Won Il, I'll get a beautiful daughter-in-law!

398
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:32,723
Unbelievable.

399
00:27:32,723 --> 00:27:36,244
She would fall for him alright.

400
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:45,521
You saw that, right? That other girl got jealous too, right?

401
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:48,591
It's not just In Ha Gyum. Shin Se Min was even worse.

402
00:27:48,591 --> 00:27:51,580
Then there is In Ha Gyum, Shin Se Min and even Vice-Chairman.

403
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,702
Chairman has three women in this company?

404
00:27:53,702 --> 00:27:55,721
Doesn't he have even more than that?

405
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:56,633
You too?!

406
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:02,023
Are you crazy? I'd rather tell President or Vice-Chairman and quit.

407
00:28:02,023 --> 00:28:04,372
Why do In Ha Gyum and Shin Se Min stand it?

408
00:28:04,372 --> 00:28:06,036
They are patisserie beginners.

409
00:28:06,036 --> 00:28:10,447
The beginners who can have their future ruined just by the breath of Chairman.

410
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:13,391
Do you think my Won Il would know this truth?

411
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,838
I doubt it. He's a beginner.

412
00:28:16,838 --> 00:28:21,336
Then this is a chance to send my Won Il to the throne.

413
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:22,754
This isn't the time for me to be like this.

414
00:28:22,754 --> 00:28:28,996
I will go have a talk with his cousin, so you go find out about In Ha Gyum and Shin Se Min. Okay?

415
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:34,097
President sitting on the throne,

416
00:28:34,097 --> 00:28:39,004
doesn't mean you will sit on the queen's.

417
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:47,476
It's too obvious that you are buying time not to go to the kitchen.

418
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,151
You're being noisy.

419
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:54,304
We should have a talk. Urgently.

420
00:28:54,304 --> 00:28:55,831
Please tell me.

421
00:28:55,831 --> 00:28:57,791
Urgently, I said.

422
00:28:57,791 --> 00:29:00,306
Not in public, but behind anyone else.

423
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:03,126
Then, you should talk in President's office.

424
00:29:03,126 --> 00:29:06,249
He's not here, so you should go.

425
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,851
Let's go.

426
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,737
Are you making that face because you don't believe me?

427
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:22,895
No, that's not it.

428
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:26,513
If that's not it, then for my Won Il...

429
00:29:26,513 --> 00:29:31,847
for President to sit on the throne, I am making nonsense?

430
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:32,676
That's not it.

431
00:29:32,676 --> 00:29:34,353
If that's not it, then what is it?

432
00:29:34,353 --> 00:29:39,749
You keep on interrupting me so that I can't explain!

433
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:46,211
Gyun Woo sshi, I thought you had a prickly moustache, but it seems you have a prickly temper as well.

434
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:49,694
It's not something I haven't been aware of.

435
00:29:49,694 --> 00:29:51,641
Won Il also is aware of it to some extent.

436
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:55,384
Then it was a public secret that only I didn't know?

437
00:29:55,384 --> 00:29:57,679
It's not that much.

438
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,197
Of course, I didn't know it even included our kitchen staff.

439
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:04,057
This is impossible. It is unbelievable and unacceptable.

440
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:05,877
That's right.

441
00:30:05,877 --> 00:30:10,537
Whether it is a company or an organization, a boss reaching an evil hand to powerless young women,

442
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:14,441
should be revealed to the public and be punished from the divine.

443
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:16,829
You're right. You're right but,

444
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:23,251
the problem is, the person who deserves divine punishment and should never come near,

445
00:30:23,251 --> 00:30:29,081
is the father of Won Yi, 
whom Won Il favors the most.

446
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:35,698
 However, isn't keeping St. Honore which is left behind by his own father,

447
00:30:35,698 --> 00:30:40,242
 more important than trying to help a sister who only shares the half blood?

448
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:43,106
 It is right that she is only a half sister.

449
00:30:43,106 --> 00:30:49,788
 Won Yi decided at such an early age to call him hyung for him.

450
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:51,893
 What is such a big deal about it?

451
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:56,852
 She called out to be a man 
because Oppa, her favorite person is a man.

452
00:30:56,852 --> 00:30:58,696
 No. That's not it.

453
00:30:58,696 --> 00:31:02,519
- It's okay, I can do it! 
- You will sweat a lot, I will do it.

454
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,888
 Won Il was a lost child.

455
00:31:07,888 --> 00:31:13,024
 It was a child that Chairman Choi brought for a moment because his ex-wife had some situation.

456
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:20,033
 Like the current Won Yi, 
he was very attached to Won Il, 
and those two held on to each other. 
But one day that kid suddenly disappeared.

457
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:22,826
Grandpa! What are you doing now?

458
00:31:22,826 --> 00:31:26,744
- It's too hot, so let's eat some ice cream! 
- Oh, okay.

459
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:38,947
- Tada!  Won Yi's signature Bibimbob! 
 - Won Il thought that was his fault,

460
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:43,515
 and from that moment on, 
whenever he ate cakes which were that kid's favorite,

461
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:49,456
 he couldn't stop retching.  
So, now, he can't eat cakes after all.

462
00:31:49,456 --> 00:31:52,540
 As he avoided cakes, 
he even avoided Won Yi.

463
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,382
 That was probably because the young Won Il thought 
caring Won Yi was

464
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:59,526
 a kind of betrayal to that lost child.

465
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:01,696
Master! Hyungnim! I will help you guys!

466
00:32:01,696 --> 00:32:05,753
 Won Yi found out  
why Won Il kept the distance with her,

467
00:32:05,753 --> 00:32:08,809
 so she started to call him Hyung, 
instead of Oppa.

468
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:13,449
 Looking at her changing 
from a really feminine girl to a really boyish girl,

469
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:19,010
 Won Il finally opened his mind to Won Yi. 
Although they are half sister and half brother,

470
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:22,596
 those two became a brother and sister 
who care for each other so much.

471
00:32:22,596 --> 00:32:27,760
That's why it's not easy to cut off 
Chairman Choi Jae Gyum.

472
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,798
Just like Won Yi likes Won Il the most in the world,

473
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:35,269
Won Il also cares for Won Yi the most in the world.

474
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:42,147
Losing that child is something that the 
Chairman must suffer,
 not something that Won Il should take the blame for.

475
00:32:42,147 --> 00:32:44,704
That's why it's Chairman Choi,

476
00:32:44,704 --> 00:32:47,606
and that's why it's Won Il.

477
00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:56,721
I didn't know that, 
so asked I him why he's not eating cakes, 
and if he had been sick from cake before. 
I was so thoughtless....

478
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:02,837
Why didn't you tell me that before?

479
00:33:02,837 --> 00:33:07,540
I'm not in the position to tell you this, 
and I shouldn't tell this either,

480
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,826
but the reason I told you this story without getting a permission from Won Il is...

481
00:33:09,826 --> 00:33:11,131
I know.

482
00:33:11,131 --> 00:33:15,017
It means I need to understand Won Il better 
and to treat him better.

483
00:33:15,017 --> 00:33:19,261
No. That's not it.

484
00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:25,776
When Won Il was having a hard time here, 
I was studying in France, 
so I couldn't help him.  
I'm still sorry for that, so...

485
00:33:25,776 --> 00:33:28,409
I'm telling you this 
to act as his old brother even if it's a bit late.

486
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:32,150
Won Il,  thanks to Pan Da Yang, 
can endure in this country Korea,

487
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:36,520
no, in this Saint Honore.  
That's what I think.

488
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:39,290
So...

489
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,043
Don't butt in, don't interfere?

490
00:33:43,043 --> 00:33:49,545
Because a kid who grew up in pain 
could finally become happy and get out of the guilt?

491
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:57,790
Your heart to give me warnings and advices 
considering your cousin,

492
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:01,019
and my situation which is far behind Da Yang 
in many points,

493
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:07,679
and that President is not interested in me at all.  
I'm asking you a question, considering all of these.

494
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,199
If the relationship between him 
and Da Yang doesn't work well, then, 
will you help me get the President?

495
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,620
A woman who can understand President 
and his situation

496
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,448
better than me...

497
00:34:20,448 --> 00:34:23,268
Do you think you can find her?

498
00:34:23,268 --> 00:34:26,125
Shall I give you more explanation 
so that you can answer more easily?

499
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:30,017
Do you think Da Yang likes the president

500
00:34:30,017 --> 00:34:33,957
or do you think she likes Ko Seung Ji?

501
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:38,372
Oh, I'm hungry. Food, food!

502
00:34:38,372 --> 00:34:41,976
-Welcome. 
 -Why is he eating in here?

503
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:45,441
Why not eat here and eat at the cafe?

504
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:50,434
He can eat with his loving Siratoni Mina 
or Choi Won Il.  Why is he eating with me?

505
00:34:50,434 --> 00:34:53,989
It's so petty to be hard on a person about food. 
Oppa, sit down.

506
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:56,158
Ok.

507
00:34:58,258 --> 00:35:00,095
No, I will eat later.

508
00:35:00,095 --> 00:35:03,792
Just eat. 
 Unni, stop it.

509
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:09,716
Stop what? I can still see his dazzled face 
looking at Siratoni Mina clearly!

510
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:22,021
I can't forgive him.

511
00:35:22,794 --> 00:35:27,460
If others see you, they would think you were betrayed by a husband whom you had supported for decades.

512
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:32,236
I wouldn't be this angry if it had been only a week since he confessed.

513
00:35:32,236 --> 00:35:34,728
He said he loved me to death and

514
00:35:34,728 --> 00:35:38,954
after just one day, he gazed at other girl? 
Is it a mayfly (its Korean name is "one-day-life")?

515
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:42,509
I mean it's okay for you to be mad 
when you're dating him even for a day.

516
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:44,588
Why are you jealous when you're not even his lover?

517
00:35:44,588 --> 00:35:48,551
Unni, you're not in a relationship 
with either Hedgehog Oppa or Won Il Oppa.

518
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:54,592
Don't kid yourself. 
A girl who is nagging even before starting a date? 
If it were me, 
I wouldn't have started that relationship.

519
00:35:54,592 --> 00:35:57,653
I'm saying I would have ran away, 
very quickly!

520
00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:06,702
Grandpa!
Grandpa. Is he not here?

521
00:36:09,672 --> 00:36:15,222
Where did he go in this early in the morning?
It's not even time for the shop to be open... 
I wanted to get his advice about dating...

522
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:18,346
Oh, I'm hungry. I better go eat.

523
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:21,452
I am hungry.

524
00:36:28,573 --> 00:36:29,823
 Pan Da Yang

525
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:32,247
Oh, Gil Dong Goo!

526
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:33,352
Hello?

527
00:36:33,352 --> 00:36:42,014
It's me. Right now..  it.. it wasn't intentional... 
It's for real that it wasn't intentional, huh?

528
00:36:42,014 --> 00:36:46,495
The car was stolen.

529
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,380
How will you deal with me?

530
00:36:49,380 --> 00:37:01,866
That's why I'm saying this, 
but I found a way to compensate 
by contributing a lot to your love life! 
Of course, this must involve me, though.

531
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:03,251
You want me to believe that?

532
00:37:03,251 --> 00:37:10,750
I can feel you, grinding your teeth and holding your anger against me, so I'm even more sorry.

533
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:18,363
I know the credit level of Gil Dong Goo is dropped on the ground now, but I also have some conscience.

534
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:22,411
So, can you trust me for one time, please?

535
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:23,964
Then how will you help me?

536
00:37:23,964 --> 00:37:32,277
A relationship between a man and a woman 
 follows the rule, 'out of sight, out of mind'.

537
00:37:32,277 --> 00:37:32,794
So?

538
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:38,762
So you must ascend from the underground world to the overground world.

539
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:40,618
Ascension sounds random in this situation.

540
00:37:40,618 --> 00:37:48,145
Moving your place to the second floor across from
 Da Yang's room will decide success or failure of dating.

541
00:37:48,145 --> 00:37:50,537
What difference does it make whether I am in the basement or the second floor?

542
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:54,743
 It is not just different.  
A relationship between a man and a woman

543
00:37:54,743 --> 00:38:00,547
Feeds on facing each other
after the sunset and the moonrise.

544
00:38:00,547 --> 00:38:04,516
 If you want to create an evoking atmosphere
 in a late hour,

545
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:08,809
Then your room should be 
right in front of Da Yang's room.

546
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:12,246
Therefore you can have more chances to face each other even while going to the bathroom.

547
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:15,701
Staring at the ceiling from the basement,

548
00:38:19,908 --> 00:38:23,658
Hello? Hello? Did you hang up?

549
00:38:23,658 --> 00:38:23,867
 By the way,

550
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:28,330
 why does it matter to you if I move to the second floor?

551
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:31,368
That is a very good question.

552
00:38:31,368 --> 00:38:33,370
It does matter.

553
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:39,114
 You need me to come back to Cafe Panda, so you can yield your room and move to the second floor!

554
00:38:39,114 --> 00:38:41,742
 With a perfect reason!

555
00:38:41,742 --> 00:38:43,953
Am I wrong? Huh?

556
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:46,851
To be honest, who else but I,

557
00:38:46,851 --> 00:38:50,894
 will create a commotion asking to have a room. 
Isn't that right?

558
00:38:52,413 --> 00:39:01,905
Hello... I don't have money to charge this phone and it's dying. So why don't you hurry and ...

559
00:39:02,898 --> 00:39:04,378
Oh really...

560
00:39:04,378 --> 00:39:07,120
Hello?
Hello?

561
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:12,342
Seriously, why would you stop in the middle of help?

562
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:17,986
Face her with an evoking atmosphere at a late hour.

563
00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:21,994
Gil Dong Gu could be better than Grandpa.

564
00:39:24,758 --> 00:39:27,400
Do you know who they are?

565
00:39:33,586 --> 00:39:35,414
I don't know.

566
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,824
I don't know this person, either.

567
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:45,167
Then what about this person?

568
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:53,897
Answer me please, is it a person you know or not?

569
00:39:53,897 --> 00:39:57,555
You know he is dead. Why do you have to show us a picture of a dead person?

570
00:39:57,555 --> 00:39:59,975
You know both of them?

571
00:39:59,975 --> 00:40:03,731
I know only this person!
Only this person!

572
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:06,830
Do you also know only this person?

573
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,701
Yes.

574
00:40:07,701 --> 00:40:09,809
Who is he?

575
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:13,514
Hello, Detective. Isn't it too much?

576
00:40:13,514 --> 00:40:18,401
She has paid for her fault. Why do you treat her like a criminal?

577
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:22,534
She was serving her sentence that she found out the death of her husband after a long while.

578
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:25,147
How can you do this?

579
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:30,707
Sir, you should decide whether to be angry or not after hearing what I have to say.

580
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:34,124
It has no regard with us. Why should I hear it?

581
00:40:34,124 --> 00:40:38,371
Park Mi Yang has served 20 years. To be precise, 10 years for the death from injury,

582
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:42,847
and 10 years were added for an attempt to breakout to find her young son.

583
00:40:42,847 --> 00:40:47,415
That long suffering might not have been her obligation.

584
00:40:47,415 --> 00:40:49,931
What are you talking about?

585
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:55,536
So, Miss Park Mi Hyang, please answer. Do you know this person or not?

586
00:40:56,647 --> 00:41:02,049
I have never seen him before, but he is not unfamiliar.

587
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:06,516
These two men are Jang Byung Cheol.

588
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:08,580
What?

589
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:14,477
What do you mean, they are the same person? They have different faces. How can they be the same person?

590
00:41:14,477 --> 00:41:18,472
According to the testimony of a victim, Min Kyung Soo, who appeared after twenty years,

591
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:21,913
Jang Byung Cheol has been changing his face through plastic surgeries and changing identities,

592
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:26,465
and has committed kidnapping, assault, and even murder.

593
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:29,745
Min Kyung Soo was once on the same side as Jang Byung Cheol,

594
00:41:29,745 --> 00:41:35,481
after surviving a fatal injury from head to toe, which was caused by Jang Byung Cheol's attempted murder,

595
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:39,109
he was accommodated in a mental hospital and finally recovered to his normal state,

596
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:42,458
and came to the police asking to find Jang Byung Cheol.

597
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,044
Jang Byung Cheol has used his identity to commit a fraud,

598
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,368
and took all his properties,

599
00:41:47,368 --> 00:41:51,512
and that has distressed his parents to death.

600
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:58,005
Only the known identities he used are five.

601
00:42:00,155 --> 00:42:05,669
This is a mere assumption, but Jang Byung Cheol must not be dead, yet.

602
00:42:08,273 --> 00:42:12,130
So I ask for your cooperation.

603
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:17,606
I have definitely got to catch Jang Byung Cheol.

604
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:45,271
Gift number one for Won Il, secured.

605
00:42:48,056 --> 00:42:50,211
What took you so long?

606
00:42:50,211 --> 00:42:52,023
Why? Did you miss me?

607
00:42:52,023 --> 00:42:53,610
Why would I miss you?

608
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:56,103
Then why do you whine as soon as you see me?

609
00:42:56,103 --> 00:42:58,937
There is a customer...

610
00:43:11,831 --> 00:43:15,183
Say hi to her. She is a pretty girl customer which you really like.

611
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:16,972
This is a customer?

612
00:43:16,972 --> 00:43:20,365
My name is Yea Won. Do you mind having me as a customer?

613
00:43:22,661 --> 00:43:26,515
I don't not like it. It's my first time having a little kid as a customer and it surprises me.

614
00:43:26,515 --> 00:43:30,417
I am not a little kid. I am a junior.

615
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,631
She has an unique order.

616
00:43:36,044 --> 00:43:37,978
What is it?
Junior menu?

617
00:43:37,978 --> 00:43:41,378
Do you think a junior only has junior menu?

618
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:46,707
That disloyal looking oppa is the one who makes cakes, so explain it to him.

619
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,915
What is disloyal?

620
00:43:48,915 --> 00:43:53,117
Liking one girl and immediately turning around to another girl.

621
00:43:53,117 --> 00:43:55,530
How awful. You as well?

622
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,797
Who else is like that?

623
00:43:56,797 --> 00:44:02,643
It is Bo Ram. Because of him, I brought all the money I collected all my life.

624
00:44:05,418 --> 00:44:07,656
I think she came because of the troubles with a love affair.

625
00:44:08,978 --> 00:44:10,737
Will you be disloyal in making cake as well?

626
00:44:10,737 --> 00:44:12,469
I am not disloyal with making cakes.

627
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:15,471
You don't become disloyal with making cakes?

628
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:19,008
What do you want? What kind of cake should I make for you?

629
00:44:19,008 --> 00:44:21,728
A cake that tastes like Jajangmyun (black bean noodles).

630
00:44:21,728 --> 00:44:22,438
What?

631
00:44:22,438 --> 00:44:26,251
I asked you to make a cake that tastes like Jajangmyun.

632
00:44:26,251 --> 00:44:31,224
Oppa isn't a person who makes Jajangmyun. I am a person who makes cakes.

633
00:44:31,224 --> 00:44:36,078
That's why I am asking you. If I needed Jajangmyun, I would've have gone to a Chinese restaurant.

634
00:44:36,078 --> 00:44:37,973
Why would I ask here?

635
00:44:37,973 --> 00:44:39,669
That is true, but...

636
00:44:39,669 --> 00:44:43,936
If you wanted to eat a Jajangmyun flavored cake, then you can eat Jajangmyun and then eat a cake.

637
00:44:43,936 --> 00:44:45,929
Why would you eat a Jajangmyun flavored cake?

638
00:44:45,929 --> 00:44:47,894
Bo Ram said he liked me,

639
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,659
and immediately turned around to Sae Rom.

640
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:54,328
Sae Rom said she will give him a fried pork flavored cake for his birthday.

641
00:44:54,328 --> 00:44:56,404
Are you telling me to just sit still?

642
00:44:56,404 --> 00:44:59,066
Ah, you are also in a love triangle.

643
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:00,959
Are you also in a love triangle, ahjusshi?

644
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:04,123
I'm not ahjusshi, I'm an oppa too!

645
00:45:04,123 --> 00:45:09,460
Forget that. Make me a Jajangmyun flavored cake for Bo Ram's birthday next week. Got it?

646
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,501
Got it!

647
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:11,845
Got what?

648
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:16,188
You should get it. Do you want Yea Won lose Bo Ram to Sae Rom?

649
00:45:16,188 --> 00:45:17,629
Ohh really...

650
00:45:17,629 --> 00:45:20,948
When you make the cake, please clean your hands very carefully.

651
00:45:20,948 --> 00:45:25,834
Okay. I will be watching him. Let's go. I'll take you.

652
00:45:27,415 --> 00:45:30,381
Are you and that oppa and that ahjusshi in a love triangle?

653
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:31,823
I said I'm not an Ahjusshi!

654
00:45:31,823 --> 00:45:35,015
Why are you yelling? You look like a lollipop.

655
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:35,860
What?

656
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:43,403
Right! Bo Ram likes to eat lollipops after eating Jajangmyun, so include lollipop flavor, too. You must!

657
00:45:46,155 --> 00:45:47,117
Wow!!

658
00:45:47,117 --> 00:45:50,197
Why did you talk back to her and make the job more difficult?

659
00:45:50,197 --> 00:45:52,771
What was that? Are most kids these days are like her?

660
00:45:52,771 --> 00:45:57,157
How would I know kids these day? I don't even know them from old days. Move out!

661
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,775
Why does he not know kids from old days? Wasn't he one once?

662
00:46:01,775 --> 00:46:05,228
That Ahjusshi for real... How do I appear like...

663
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,828
Yae Won, take care!

664
00:46:07,828 --> 00:46:09,875
-Bye!
-Bye!

665
00:46:10,158 --> 00:46:11,976
Da Yang!

666
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:14,766
How is Hedghog doing? Is he alright?

667
00:46:14,766 --> 00:46:17,554
Did Hedgehog talk badly about me?

668
00:46:17,554 --> 00:46:21,040
What are you talking about?
 Why would he talk badly about you?

669
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,958
I didn't treat him nicely.

670
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:28,357
He probably is not in good mood because of what happened with the advertisement work.
Why did you treat him badly?

671
00:46:28,357 --> 00:46:31,117
What do you mean the advertisement work
 didn't work out?

672
00:46:31,117 --> 00:46:32,949
Weren't they suppose to
 use Hedgehog's work?

673
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:36,529
Hedgehog probably didn't tell you because he didn't want you to get upset.

674
00:46:36,529 --> 00:46:42,722
Representative Ha called. 
He said he was sorry that it didn't work out.
 He even apologized to me.

675
00:46:42,722 --> 00:46:45,812
Why won't he use his work? 
He did such a good job!

676
00:46:45,812 --> 00:46:49,689
They decided to use those of a patissier that the cosmetic company is close to.

677
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:54,537
Looks like representative Ha 
couldn't win in the end
 because he just works and gets paid by them.

678
00:46:54,537 --> 00:46:56,953
Hey, Hedgehog is coming out!

679
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,521
You came?

680
00:46:58,521 --> 00:47:00,504
How are you?

681
00:47:02,131 --> 00:47:05,305
"You're going to look at girls instead of working?"

682
00:47:05,305 --> 00:47:07,450
That's what you're thinking of when you're looking at me, right?

683
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,550
No. Where are you guys going?

684
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,772
To a Chinese restaurant.

685
00:47:13,243 --> 00:47:15,653
We'll return after eating Jajangmyun.

686
00:47:15,653 --> 00:47:19,036
Alright. Return safely!

687
00:47:23,914 --> 00:47:27,277
Hey! Don't leave them together like that!

688
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:31,822
If they become friends, 
it'll be hard for you to choose one.

689
00:47:31,822 --> 00:47:34,402
They became friends already.

690
00:47:37,998 --> 00:47:39,140
What?

691
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,898
You don't have an appetite because you're worried about making a cake?

692
00:47:41,898 --> 00:47:45,933
Why does that Bo Ram like Jajangmyun?

693
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:50,235
Don't normal kids like chocolate, candies, ice cream, right?

694
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:53,363
Whether the kid is normal or abnormal, he's in a better situation than us.

695
00:47:53,363 --> 00:47:54,390
Why is he in a better situation?

696
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:59,124
We're eating Jajangmyun to look good in front of her, hoping to get a date with her.

697
00:47:59,124 --> 00:48:05,511
When two women are in competition for Bo Ram, spending their lifetime savings.

698
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:07,069
He is better off.

699
00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:09,541
Of course, at his young age.

700
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:12,008
Should we get coaching from that kid?

701
00:48:12,008 --> 00:48:13,588
Hey...I said that first.

702
00:48:13,588 --> 00:48:15,767
No, I said it first!

703
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,873
Hey, I'm the one who said first that Bo Ram is better off than us!

704
00:48:18,873 --> 00:48:20,137
I wouldn't have known it if you didn't tell me?

705
00:48:20,137 --> 00:48:22,631
Huh? Really!

706
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:25,405
You'd better take me when you go to meet Bo Ram.

707
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:28,102
Are you crazy? He's my rival.

708
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:31,191
You, reallly...

709
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:33,872
You always do this in important situations.

710
00:48:33,872 --> 00:48:35,876
All of a sudden, Jajangmyun is tasty.

711
00:48:35,876 --> 00:48:40,245
If you don't drop it, I will tell her to change it to Pal Bo Chae(a dish with luxurious ingredients) flavored cake.

712
00:48:40,245 --> 00:48:42,340
Pal Bo Chae, of course.

713
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,382
How would the kids know what Pal Bo Chae tastes like, to order the flavor?

714
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:47,032
I can buy Bo Ram a dish of Pal Bo Chae.

715
00:48:47,032 --> 00:48:49,685
And say, "isn't it better than Jajangmyun?
then tell Yae Won."

716
00:48:49,685 --> 00:48:52,372
Alright, let's go together! 
Are you satisfied now?!

717
00:48:52,372 --> 00:48:54,757
You can't even win and you always try to crawl up.

718
00:48:54,757 --> 00:48:56,707
Aish!

719
00:48:56,707 --> 00:48:59,975
What? What? What?

720
00:48:59,975 --> 00:49:03,335
You would know if you get pierced by this.

721
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:25,471

722
00:49:35,761 --> 00:49:42,461
You don't have to eat it again. I was just wondering if this could help you to come up with ideas.

723
00:49:43,093 --> 00:49:46,032
Does it bother you...? Should I take it away then?

724
00:49:46,032 --> 00:49:49,030
Why are you so friendly all of a sudden?

725
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:53,308
You were yelling, 'back in position!'

726
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:57,379
Why didn't you tell me?

727
00:49:57,379 --> 00:49:58,826
What?

728
00:49:58,826 --> 00:50:04,760
That the macaron cosmetic advertisement went to another patissier.

729
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,279
Who told you that?

730
00:50:07,279 --> 00:50:11,541
Representative Ha called Mi Ra unni to apologize.

731
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,580
Aish...

732
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:18,070
I forgot to thank her.

733
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:23,039
I did it already. You didn't tell me because I'd get upset?

734
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,822
Getting rejected is just nothing to brag about.

735
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:35,880
I don't know who that patissier is,
but he got the job because he is friends 
with the cosmetic company.

736
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,909
So, the fact that your macarons
are the best never changes.

737
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:47,581
Siratoni Mina who stole your heart
was also impressed by your macarons.

738
00:50:47,581 --> 00:50:52,032
Of course, if I was even acknowldeged by Mina...

739
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:53,875
It must be great.

740
00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:59,054
My compliment that you are the best didn't make an impression on you.

741
00:50:59,054 --> 00:51:04,531
And Siratoni Mina's compliment out of politeness makes you feel like winning a gold medal?

742
00:51:04,531 --> 00:51:08,531
Hedgehog, don't live like that!

743
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:14,518
What a big mood swing for a panda!

744
00:51:14,518 --> 00:51:19,549
Calm at this. Calm as that. Isn't that panda?

745
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:23,068
It's so annoying!
Why does she have to date like that?

746
00:51:25,237 --> 00:51:28,202
Ahh!

747
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:32,584
That's it!

748
00:51:37,502 --> 00:51:43,683
Ommo! What's all this?!

749
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:48,925
Our Panda must be happy because she has a man who cares about her this much.

750
00:51:48,925 --> 00:51:51,700
That's because he did something wrong.

751
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,986
Do you think all the men will do this because they did something wrong?

752
00:51:54,986 --> 00:52:00,047
Most men, when they do something wrong, they'll do the opposite.

753
00:52:00,047 --> 00:52:05,589
They will just give you a hard time. Think of this as a gift.

754
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:06,304
Really?

755
00:52:06,304 --> 00:52:09,800
Really! You naive Panda!

756
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,889
Anyways, he's talented.

757
00:52:13,889 --> 00:52:18,367
Not only is he talented, but it looks like he applies himself as well.

758
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:19,272
What's this?

759
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:26,663
I was going to write the answers, but I thought it would be better if you did.

760
00:52:27,484 --> 00:52:30,771
Scored zero?!

761
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:35,366
So what if the score is zero?
 This scored one hundred.

762
00:52:35,366 --> 00:52:37,566
Auntie!
 My goodness.

763
00:52:37,566 --> 00:52:39,345
Ah, what?

764
00:52:39,345 --> 00:52:40,745
How can you eat me?

765
00:52:40,745 --> 00:52:44,573
What do mean? You just have to tell him to make more!

766
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:50,923
The taste

767
00:52:50,923 --> 00:52:53,437
scores 120.

768
00:52:55,303 --> 00:52:58,732
Should I try and see if it tastes better than that of Siratoni Mina?

769
00:52:58,732 --> 00:53:02,377
What is Siratoni Mina?

770
00:53:03,233 --> 00:53:04,785
Hello.

771
00:53:04,785 --> 00:53:06,911
How come she always shows up when I'm here?

772
00:53:06,911 --> 00:53:11,964
Of course, I didn't want this to happen, but it happened this way.

773
00:53:11,964 --> 00:53:15,058
Don't you have work? Why are you here in the morning?

774
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:20,259
I have to something to report to the boss.
What can I do when he's around here all the time.

775
00:53:20,259 --> 00:53:22,788
Choi Won Il is here?

776
00:53:22,788 --> 00:53:25,380
Yeah. He is here as Hedgehog's assistant.

777
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,068
How come?

778
00:53:26,068 --> 00:53:28,670
What?

779
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:35,229
Why did Won Il become Hedgehog's assistant?

780
00:53:35,229 --> 00:53:38,808
Is he being punished for the macarons?

781
00:53:38,808 --> 00:53:41,761
Why would Won Il be punished for the macarons?

782
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:52,984
Huh? Oh...um the m-macarons that Hedgehog made before... As an appreciation? My words came out wrong.

783
00:53:52,984 --> 00:53:56,110
Ah, it's not that.

784
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:58,214
Then, what's the reason?

785
00:53:58,214 --> 00:54:02,277
Ah, Won Il and Hedgehog are competiting in their first round.

786
00:54:02,277 --> 00:54:04,062
Why are they competing?

787
00:54:04,062 --> 00:54:05,817
Huh?

788
00:54:05,817 --> 00:54:07,133
Perhaps,

789
00:54:07,133 --> 00:54:10,589
Are they in a competition for you?

790
00:54:10,589 --> 00:54:15,602
Would that be possible? They became friends and they are just fooling around like kids.

791
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:20,551
Is that right? Then, I'm relieved.

792
00:54:36,452 --> 00:54:37,644
Yeah?

793
00:54:37,644 --> 00:54:41,122
You should have called if you couldn't make it. 
You were rude as an assistant.

794
00:54:41,122 --> 00:54:44,658
I have something to do today. I'm sorry, I'll be there tomorrow.

795
00:54:44,658 --> 00:54:46,791
The Jajangmyun cake is due the day after tomorrow.

796
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:49,479
So be ready to stay up the night. Alright?

797
00:54:49,479 --> 00:54:51,501
Alright. Take it easy.

798
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:53,867
Okay.

799
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:58,963
 August 14th, the 6th prisoner patisserie competition being held.

800
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:02,606
 The first prize winner of the event 1 of 2007: Ko Seung Ji.

801
00:55:15,306 --> 00:55:17,020
What shoud I do?

802
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,450
You don't want to fight Kang Eun Bi, so you want to date me?

803
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,309
No thanks.

804
00:55:21,309 --> 00:55:24,188
Are you still fallen for Siratoni Mina?

805
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:28,547
Do you think then I would make the macarons all night long?

806
00:55:28,985 --> 00:55:33,199
That's that, but what should I do?

807
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:35,133
When I didn't have a man, things weren't complicated.

808
00:55:35,133 --> 00:55:38,725
But now I'm asked if this is a friendship or love...

809
00:55:38,725 --> 00:55:41,995
My torment began...

810
00:55:41,995 --> 00:55:44,869
Ah! Why did this story begin all of a sudden,

811
00:55:44,869 --> 00:55:48,364
and I became the female star of this romance?

812
00:55:48,364 --> 00:55:53,396
So you just have to like me. Why are you involved with Choi Won Il, and suffer like that?

813
00:55:53,396 --> 00:56:00,899
That's right! Why didn't you show me you like me?! 
Why did you wait until Won Il to like me, 
and give me such a headache?

814
00:56:02,636 --> 00:56:04,949
Let's kiss while there is nobody around.

815
00:56:04,949 --> 00:56:06,555
Huh?

816
00:56:06,555 --> 00:56:08,283
Let's do it.

817
00:56:08,283 --> 00:56:11,380
Hedgehog, it's a foul play. 
This is your first warning. 
If I have to give you a third warning...

818
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,506
Out.

819
00:56:13,506 --> 00:56:17,989
I have to give Won Il a chance to go on a date...

820
00:56:19,757 --> 00:56:24,208
Then, let's just kiss three times, and then go see Won Il.

821
00:56:25,922 --> 00:56:30,183
It's alright. I'm not an easy woman.

822
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,428
I'm not an easy man either.

823
00:56:56,762 --> 00:56:58,034
 Did you sleep here?

824
00:56:58,034 --> 00:56:58,548
 Yeah

825
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:01,383
 What happened?

826
00:57:01,383 --> 00:57:04,235
 He doesn't even know the three characters of his name.

827
00:57:04,235 --> 00:57:09,565
 He is too greedy. Just because Panda is nice to him, he doesn't know what to do.

828
00:57:09,565 --> 00:57:13,625
 Let me think through why I'm like this.

829
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:17,631
 Do I already like Hedgehog...?

830
00:57:17,631 --> 00:57:20,444
 Do I have any right to like you,

831
00:57:20,444 --> 00:57:23,533
 I need time to think.
