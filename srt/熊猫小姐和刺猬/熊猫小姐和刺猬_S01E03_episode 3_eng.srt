1
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,426

2
00:00:52,926 --> 00:00:56,085
 Episode 3

3
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:07,376
You there! Excuse me!

4
00:01:07,376 --> 00:01:09,867
What?

5
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:10,986
What?

6
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:16,475
If you have something to say, say it or else get out of here!

7
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:18,563
No.

8
00:01:18,563 --> 00:01:23,364
Who are you to sleep in someone's store?

9
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:25,699
Is it yours?

10
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:27,543
Huh?

11
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:33,272
Are you a stalker ?

12
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:34,696
What?!

13
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:37,559
The day Pan Da Yang fell off the chair you were here too.

14
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:40,511
You secretly saw and left.

15
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:41,528
I saw it all.

16
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:46,060
That. That wasn't secretly. I just saw and left.

17
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,276
Then, "I came. Are you okay? Who is this bastard?"

18
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,506
Why didn't you ask that?

19
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:57,303
That was the first time in 15 years that I've seen her. How can I say that?

20
00:01:57,303 --> 00:02:00,482
You haven't seen her for 15 years...

21
00:02:00,482 --> 00:02:03,100
Like in movies? Or...

22
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,831
Like when a dog pees?

23
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:10,515
You, what are you?

24
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:12,238
Why aren't you answering me?

25
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:14,916
If you know, you'd get surprised.

26
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,725
What could it be?

27
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:22,831
The  worst  situation that you can think of.

28
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:25,425
Bartender?

29
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:27,543
You're really interesting!

30
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:28,061
You!

31
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:31,274
What is wrong with you?

32
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:34,955
I've thought about it all night.

33
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:41,630
But you have no manners towards a person, and no respect towards a professional at  all !

34
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,162
What did I do?

35
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:53,527
You think I wouldn't know about this?

36
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:57,033
How much do you think you did for me to find another patissier?

37
00:02:57,033 --> 00:03:01,267
How can you leave me, Gil Dong Goo and try finding a new patissier?

38
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:08,497
Because all the cakes you make don't sell and paying you leaves me no money for myself!!

39
00:03:08,497 --> 00:03:13,129
Am I shaking?

40
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,236
No.

41
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,695
I'm shaking!

42
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:18,138
Is it because you are going to get fired?

43
00:03:18,138 --> 00:03:21,200
It's not that, I'm shaking in anger!

44
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,003
You are lucky to have met me.

45
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,523
I am naturally kind!

46
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:33,323
And when I see people who are worse than me, I'm the type to help them out, so I didn't say anything until now!

47
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:35,726
But if you were encountered with someone else-

48
00:03:35,726 --> 00:03:37,774
Then do as everyone else does!

49
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:40,181
Why do I have to be like everyone else?

50
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:44,276
Do you know how much pride I have?

51
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:47,112
What you want from me?

52
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:51,617
Deflamation of character and for damaging my personality!

53
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:55,066
Give me all of my missing pay as my severance pay!

54
00:03:55,066 --> 00:04:00,104
Since you've been in this store, you've only sold 8 cakes.

55
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:04,250
And for half of them, we gave our money back.

56
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,760
But I had to pay your salary which is higher than my journalist salary.

57
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,101
I had to work part-time and got fired.

58
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:17,477
Without Mom and Dad, what you want me to do?

59
00:04:17,477 --> 00:04:21,950
It wasn't just a favor or a something...

60
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,258
I really...

61
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:37,536
What is this sound?

62
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:40,208
Is it a bear?

63
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,023
Bear?

64
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:45,323
You don't have to cry for something like that...

65
00:04:45,323 --> 00:04:47,688
If you keep crying like this ...the people..

66
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,758
What is this? What happened?

67
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:53,721
No, no! Nothing! I didn't make her cry!

68
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:56,519
We were just remembering some things that happened...

69
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,405
About remembering some things,

70
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:01,378
I kept my mouth shut about you.

71
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:04,203
Because I knew that your paperwork was fake!

72
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,617
The one thing that I hate the most is lying!

73
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:11,482
How dare you lie to my nieces!!

74
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:18,479
S.O.S

75
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,781
Panda is being violent! A group of pandas are...!

76
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:28,526
That son of a --!

77
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:30,995
Oh! It's the hedgehog!

78
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:33,714
Oh! The president!

79
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:39,582
The president...brought his car.

80
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:43,260
Saint Honore...

81
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,078
President?!

82
00:05:56,995 --> 00:06:00,218
Let's do it! The competition.

83
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:02,762
Excuse me.

84
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,382
Did you come here to get the job?

85
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:08,001
That is...

86
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,747
Do you really think the head of Saint Honore would come to get a job here?

87
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:16,807
The manager probably just came to help.

88
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:18,889
Wait!

89
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:27,554
I have something to say.

90
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:34,584
As you can see, our store can't have a competition to pick a patissier,

91
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:38,948
and the salary also differs depending on the monthly earnings.

92
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:42,925
I'm already thankful that you came but a competition...

93
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:45,632
Let's do it!

94
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,405
The competition.

95
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,839
He's not just a patissier. I know you have skills but you can't beat Saint Honore.

96
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,688
You really disregard me.

97
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:03,548
I think you misunderstood. Saint Honore is the best of the best.

98
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,649
Who said I'm worse than them?

99
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:11,893
That I'm worse than the Head of Saint Honore?

100
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:16,148
I think it's best if you just work at the store.

101
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:20,195
If you lose then you'll be embarassed and leave.

102
00:07:20,195 --> 00:07:24,403
Why are you doing this? You're in for work, and there is no one else!

103
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:29,813
Then let's do it like this: If I win, you provide me with all my needs without any resume.

104
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:33,665
Giving me 50% of all profit.

105
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:40,714
But, if he wins, I, Ko Seung Ji will work free without any money for half a month.

106
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:46,158
Both of those are good for me though...

107
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,864
That's why all you have to do is say encouraging lines

108
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:52,612
Encouraging lines?

109
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:58,135
One, two, three. Go.

110
00:07:58,135 --> 00:08:04,089
One, two, three. Go?

111
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,188
Hyung, we have to win no matter what.

112
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:31,529
Win. Win no matter what!

113
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:36,387
You said I had to make a cake, but what's this about a competition?

114
00:08:36,387 --> 00:08:38,055
But how is this a  competition ?

115
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:40,861
That way that guy won't stay here anymore.

116
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:44,893
He's not trying to stay here, he's looking for a job.

117
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:48,381
I don't have an interest in taking away other people's things.

118
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:50,465
Regardless if it was a job, or other people's woman.

119
00:08:50,465 --> 00:08:52,941
What do you mean other people's woman?

120
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:54,629
Then, is she your woman?

121
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:57,403
Seriously!

122
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:08,227
Da Yang to me is someone who will never be forgotten.

123
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:13,146
Dad! Dad!

124
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:15,032
Dad!

125
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:19,205
Father died all of a sudden.

126
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:26,366
It was one of the worst times, and my mother was even head over heels for someone else..

127
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,789
During those times, I smiled and laughed only because of  Da Yang.

128
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:33,150
I wasn't lonely because of Da Yang.

129
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:39,634
And I lived through every day, relying on Da Yang.

130
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:43,762
When I was lonely and sad the most,

131
00:09:43,762 --> 00:09:48,432
Da Yang was always there for me by my side.

132
00:09:48,432 --> 00:09:52,820
But if I do that to precious Da Yang now, then...

133
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:05,363

134
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:14,418
Maculinea teleius.

135
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:18,916
Aspidomorpha transparipennis.

136
00:10:22,428 --> 00:10:27,839
Rhyssa persuasoria.

137
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,771
Homotropus tarsatorius.

138
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:07,087
1 hour or 2 hours, there are 2 types of cakes to be made.

139
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:11,988
To avoid any problems, sketch the design first.

140
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:15,975
For the base, we use the cafe's utensils,

141
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:22,112
and we split the President's utensils in half.

142
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:25,021
Judges are the ones related to Cafe Panda.

143
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:28,762
The loser doesn't say anything about the results.

144
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:31,563
That's it.

145
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:41,165
Hedgehog VS Jo Gyun Woo

146
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:35,264
Hey, Beum Bo! Beum Bo!

147
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:40,142
Hey, Seung Ji is going to compete.

148
00:12:40,142 --> 00:12:43,140
What's this about competing?

149
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,993
You have nothing to talk about but only Seung Ji?

150
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:48,185
I won't accept that.

151
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,973
It's not like that.

152
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:53,086
Saint Honore is a big hit right now!

153
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:03,440
What's Saint Honore?

154
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,592
That's the best and most expensive cake shop in our town.

155
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:13,845
 When Seung Ji was in jail,

156
00:13:13,845 --> 00:13:16,917
 he learned the recipes of making cake from the TV.

157
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:19,618
 I thought I would learn too,

158
00:13:19,618 --> 00:13:22,497
 but I couldn't since I wasn't like him.

159
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:26,355
 So after he got out of jail, he looked for Saint Honore.

160
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:31,497
 It doesn't matter where it is. Just somewhere to make cakes.

161
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:34,116
 I can just do the dishes without accepting money.

162
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:38,013
 Why don't you understand that the manager doesn't accept someone like you?!

163
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:40,920
 The manager didn't take him in since he was in jail.

164
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:48,005
 He waited day and night to see the manager.

165
00:13:54,324 --> 00:13:56,111
 Manager, please try my cake.

166
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:57,883
 What's this?
I made it, please just try it.

167
00:13:57,883 --> 00:13:59,740
 Aish, this person...

168
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,231
 This person...

169
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:07,084
 The manger didn't even look at it.

170
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:13,856
 They threw him into a small place and made fun of him as much as they wanted.

171
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:17,905
 Seung Ji was really out of it that time.

172
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:23,571
 He didn't know what to do so he just told them that he will just kill the manager.

173
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:30,448
 After giving the manager a final call, the moment he was about to spill oil,

174
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:34,265
 Boss found Seung Ji and tried to stop him.

175
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:39,066
 How could he?
Let's go home. 
Let's go home.

176
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:47,102
 He gave up that time...

177
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:50,500
 Seung Ji told them that he'll take revenge no matter what.

178
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,155
As you can see now,

179
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:56,365
Seung Ji's revenge has started.

180
00:14:56,365 --> 00:15:00,199
But does Seung Ji have the skills as Saint Honore?

181
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,021
Oh you don't know how great he is!

182
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:08,298
As he start s singing his song, our business starts too!

183
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:11,959
I know that Saint Honore is the best and expensive place for cakes but,

184
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:17,947
if you don't have a lot of money, you can't go to a place like that to buy cakes.

185
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:24,121
Saint whatever it is, our cake place is so much better!

186
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:27,158
Just look at him how he make a cake.

187
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:32,565
When you're just looking at it, you would want to eat it right away.

188
00:15:49,750 --> 00:16:03,113

189
00:16:14,684 --> 00:16:19,572
All you 4 just need to pick the tastiest cake.

190
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:15,292
It's a panda!

191
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:19,068
It's you, Auntie!

192
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:24,361
Why am I angry?!

193
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:28,713
 What's yours?

194
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:22,161
Why is he being like that?

195
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:26,055
Well, he was like that since he came to work...

196
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:27,760
Did he meet Pan Da Yang?

197
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,370
Meet Panda?

198
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,754
No. Pan Da Yang.

199
00:18:31,754 --> 00:18:37,499
Well, it's not like I want them to meet, Mother.

200
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:39,871
Mother?

201
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,926
No. I meant Ma'am

202
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:48,398
Anyway, you have to show me everything about that girl, okay?

203
00:18:48,398 --> 00:18:50,792
Yes, Ma'am.

204
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:56,542
He was never like this, what's wrong with this Panda stuff!!

205
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:58,905
That's true.

206
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:05,064
Ta-dah!

207
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:09,972
It's pretty, isn't it?

208
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,319
One, two, three~!

209
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:42,742
Let's work well together, Manager Pan Da Yang.

210
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:47,302
Yes, Patissier Ko Seung Ji.

211
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:52,447
What's up with all that formalities just call each other by names!

212
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,424
Should we change the cafe name to "Panda KoJi?"

213
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:01,759
First, there is something else that needs to be changed.

214
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,944
Eun Bi unni.

215
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,226
Where's Da Yang?

216
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:14,990
Da Yang?

217
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,093
Follow me.

218
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,859
Eun Bi, you came.

219
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:28,984
You must be happy with all this new stuff around you.

220
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:31,228
We found a new patissier.

221
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:32,893
Someone similiar to Gil Dong Goo?

222
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:36,276
No, he's way much better than him.

223
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,375
Who's that?

224
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,910
He's our new patissier!!

225
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:46,717
You. When you were in elementary school, did you date Won ll?

226
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:54,156
If we dated, you think you wouldn't know?

227
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:56,510
If you guys didn't date, what kind of relationship did you have?

228
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,542
What kind of charms do you have?

229
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:01,440
Hey. That's really harsh.

230
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,225
How am I harsh. It's your sister that's harsh.

231
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:07,569
I called dibs on Won ll. What is she doing?

232
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:09,758
My sister didn't do anything.

233
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:12,129
He just came. Unexpectedly.

234
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:14,142
Because you made him.

235
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:17,811
If you didn't make him, why would he come to a place like this?!

236
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:21,819
Won ll was always kind, even as a kid.

237
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,887
Won ll-ie?

238
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:26,911
If someone heard that, they'd think you guys are BFF!

239
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,666
My BFF is you! I'll give you a refreshing drink.

240
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,886
Oh, really it's so annoying.

241
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:36,213
How can someone change like, that it's really disgusting.

242
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:40,336
I'm really getting crazy because of a girl like her!!

243
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:43,111
Unni. That's harsh.

244
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:47,253
If you keep getting jealous of my sister, I'll just making you...

245
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:48,640
What are you going to do about it?

246
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,820
I'm going to seduce him.

247
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,160
You?

248
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,132
Hey, that's a lot to our Unni.

249
00:21:57,132 --> 00:21:59,286
How can your pretty face be like that?

250
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:03,835
We just came to know each other since we we're in the same school.

251
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:07,825
But, it looks like you got in.

252
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,466
Really?!

253
00:22:09,466 --> 00:22:11,226
Eun Bi! Thanks so much!

254
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:13,433
If I didn't have you, what would I do now?

255
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,210
Thanks a lot!

256
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,703
If you're thankful, then don't step on my gold!

257
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:22,634
If you do, then I won't let it be with the BFF!

258
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,865
I understand our great manger.

259
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:26,295
You promised right?

260
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:28,000
Please take care of me well.

261
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:40,916

262
00:22:59,873 --> 00:23:01,735
What is it? Tell me.

263
00:23:01,735 --> 00:23:03,431
This isn't like you.

264
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:05,734
Hyung, how did it taste?

265
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:07,588
Oh yeah, I didn't taste it.

266
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:11,423
Then, it must have been the design, right?
 It wasn't the taste?

267
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:17,866
If I was the president of Saint Honore, I would give up all the others just to bring Ko Seung Ji.

268
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:21,630
Are you saying he is better 
than President Choi Jae-Gyum?

269
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:08,551
Grandpa~!

270
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:11,680
I have come!

271
00:24:21,444 --> 00:24:23,613
Is that for a special guest?

272
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:25,895
Who do you think that special guest is?!

273
00:24:25,895 --> 00:24:29,929
You should at least pretend seeing me for the first time someone may think that I'm really stupid grandpa!

274
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:32,622
First time seeing you, Noonim! 
 (Noonim is the guys way of address a woman formally)

275
00:24:32,622 --> 00:24:36,083
Why are you calling your grandpa's daughter Noonim?

276
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:39,085
Then, do I call someone this young, Ahjumma?

277
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:42,027
Or, should I call her Mother?

278
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:44,169
Don't you think so, Noonim?

279
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:46,065
Call me whatever is comfortable for you.

280
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:48,249
Because Noonim came....

281
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:51,877
this place is really bright now.

282
00:24:51,877 --> 00:24:55,852
Noonim we should eat now, right?

283
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:00,925
That little...

284
00:25:03,547 --> 00:25:04,696
You sit down, too.

285
00:25:04,696 --> 00:25:07,698
Oh, in a minute. Let me just cook some more.

286
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:09,177
I'll eat well.

287
00:25:09,177 --> 00:25:11,800
Yes.

288
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:19,987
Ah, grandpa. You heard that I won against a 
pastry chef from Saint Honore, right?

289
00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:21,714
No, I didn't hear.

290
00:25:21,714 --> 00:25:24,050
Yeah right! I know you heard from Beom Bo hyung!

291
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,809
This is all thanks to you grandpa, who taught me well!

292
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:29,132
What's he talking about?

293
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:32,846
The next time I'll become the greatest baker,

294
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:38,335
then become the Boss, I'll just throw Saint Honore to the ground!

295
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:41,469
You, are you thinking of doing a dangerous thing?

296
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:43,671
Eh. No, no! Don't worry. Don't worry.

297
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:45,623
You be careful.

298
00:25:45,623 --> 00:25:50,386
Living in a house with two girls...
Watch your actions!

299
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:53,712
How do you know, grandpa?

300
00:25:54,866 --> 00:25:58,110
My grandpa sure knows a lot!

301
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:02,859
Oh, did you miss me so much that you watched secretly?

302
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:13,037
Alright.

303
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:14,337
Yes.

304
00:26:19,498 --> 00:26:20,566
Hurry and go back.

305
00:26:20,566 --> 00:26:22,188
Go, go.

306
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:24,892
I understand. Hurry and go back.

307
00:26:24,892 --> 00:26:27,481
Ah, go.

308
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,969
Grandpa.

309
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:40,301
I'll make sure I become the best baker.

310
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:45,133
Until then, don't be hurt and don't cry.

311
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:48,052
Please wait for me.

312
00:27:12,502 --> 00:27:14,939
What are you doing with all that stuff?

313
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:19,136
We don't need to make cakes with these stuff.

314
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:23,072
I just brought all of them!!

315
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:34,595
They are expired?
They tricked me?!

316
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:37,825
I don't know about that but first, let's go.

317
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,990
Where are we going to go?

318
00:27:42,332 --> 00:27:44,133
Ah, where are we going?

319
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:48,969
Hurry up and come!

320
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,489
Over there.

321
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:56,823
This is the greatest and cheapest place!

322
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:01,141
Why aren't you coming?

323
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:06,105
I don't have any. Money, that is.

324
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:09,164
Then what should we do?

325
00:28:09,164 --> 00:28:12,317
First, we can use Seung Ji ssi's card.

326
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:20,247
And later on when your cakes are selling well 
 can't I pay you back then?

327
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,971
I don't have a card.

328
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:30,066
Why is it that all of our store's patissiers 
 don't have cards?

329
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:47,556
How much is this?!

330
00:28:52,493 --> 00:28:56,682
Let's go! If you have money, what's there to be afraid of?

331
00:28:58,882 --> 00:29:03,472
You must have done some dating, have you?

332
00:29:04,314 --> 00:29:10,935
I must be crazy. I was so happy to see money.

333
00:29:16,451 --> 00:29:22,210
Did you work in Saint Honore that you know this much?

334
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,819
Let's go to Saint Honore and do a cake investigation.

335
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:30,432
If we didn't come here today I would have been in that place now.

336
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:33,934
You can just know from tasting.

337
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:35,926
Do you hate Saint Honore?

338
00:29:35,926 --> 00:29:39,855
If you're going to make cake don't 
 think about Saint Honore!

339
00:29:39,855 --> 00:29:42,834
You should know that at least.

340
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:46,558
I've just never had that kind of dream before.

341
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:52,428
One, two, three. Go.

342
00:29:52,428 --> 00:29:57,342
Is that for real if you say that it gives you confident? 
 I don't think it's like that.

343
00:29:57,342 --> 00:30:02,391
I told you it's like that.
What's this girl thinking of?

344
00:30:03,883 --> 00:30:06,452
Anyway, did you study making cakes?

345
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:10,668
I didn't do something like that so, I don't know what you're talking about.

346
00:30:10,668 --> 00:30:13,955
When you were young did your 
 mother like making cakes?

347
00:30:13,955 --> 00:30:19,990
I'm an orphan, so don't even remember my 
 mother's face!

348
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,718
No, the police and this place is like this.

349
00:30:55,718 --> 00:30:58,874
So why would I come too?

350
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:03,700
For the past 20 years, I've waited for In Ha.

351
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,788
I'm sorry.

352
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:10,216
I was too narrow-minded.

353
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:15,692
But, I have a favor to ask you.

354
00:31:15,692 --> 00:31:23,016
I know, I will try my best without disappointing you.

355
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:27,086
Right, that's right.

356
00:31:28,696 --> 00:31:34,431
I've come to the supermarket multiples times, 
but this is the first time I've come here.

357
00:31:36,577 --> 00:31:41,108
What did I do wrong?

358
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:50,861
Just what's wrong...

359
00:31:59,491 --> 00:32:02,848
Are you really an orphan?

360
00:32:02,848 --> 00:32:05,459
Do you really think I would joke about 
being an orphan?

361
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:08,046
Do you have anyone?

362
00:32:08,046 --> 00:32:13,549
I have a grandpa but he's not my own.

363
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:16,160
How old were you when your parents died?

364
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,477
Whether they died or are still alive...

365
00:32:19,477 --> 00:32:23,265
I don't know. Their faces either. 
 Ah!

366
00:32:23,265 --> 00:32:25,187
Let me show you it. A scar.

367
00:32:25,187 --> 00:32:30,738
I got hit when I was young so I don't remember anything.

368
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:33,221
Since when has it been like that?

369
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:38,127
When I was 11 years old?

370
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:40,357
I think that's when I forgot...

371
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:44,638
about my past.

372
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:47,957
Who hit you? Those bad kids.

373
00:32:47,957 --> 00:32:50,995
Ah, I don't know.

374
00:32:50,995 --> 00:32:56,832
My head was bleeding so they took me
 to the hospital.

375
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,332
Let's stop here.

376
00:32:59,332 --> 00:33:04,005
Why do you want to know that 
much about an orphan?

377
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,354
When I was young my mom took me to my friend and told me that...

378
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:15,834
"What to do you're an orphan, now" but...

379
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:19,859
suddenly she threw me away like a garbage.

380
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:24,237
It was really hard.
I didn't know that orphan...

381
00:33:24,237 --> 00:33:27,087
would be living like this.

382
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:30,494
Unexpectedly, Seung Ji ssi is an orphan too.

383
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:36,788
I suddenly thought of myself too.

384
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:41,124
It's...

385
00:33:41,124 --> 00:33:43,626
not only panda.

386
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:47,994
Panda and Hedgehod are both orphans.

387
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:50,960
Really boring.

388
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,282
So are you going to cry now?

389
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:58,283
To girls weak men are not good.

390
00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:02,504
To girls talking like this is not good too!!

391
00:34:02,504 --> 00:34:04,704
Let's go.

392
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:15,937
Ah, Auntie.

393
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:19,329
 I heard you both went to the supermarket.

394
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:22,813
Why did you guys buy so much?

395
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,261
Seung Ji paid it.

396
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:27,379
I'm embarrassed.

397
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:30,707
My husband threw all our money away 
with his business.

398
00:34:30,707 --> 00:34:33,062
I can't live like a human being.

399
00:34:33,062 --> 00:34:34,081
It's alright.

400
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:36,977
I just have to get a promissory note 
from Miss Panda.

401
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:38,856
A promissory note?

402
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:43,509
She's suffering from that, it's off the limits.

403
00:34:43,509 --> 00:34:48,483
Aunt, please calm down.
Let's create a good mood.

404
00:34:49,994 --> 00:34:53,668
How did Seung Ji become a patissier?

405
00:34:55,377 --> 00:34:57,587
My grandpa is a patissier.

406
00:34:58,815 --> 00:35:03,595
So you made such good cakes with 
 home training?

407
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:11,977
 It's alright

408
00:35:20,008 --> 00:35:21,211
 Da Yang!

409
00:35:21,211 --> 00:35:22,365
What's the matter?

410
00:35:22,365 --> 00:35:24,065
 Is he your brother?

411
00:35:24,065 --> 00:35:28,447
 No. The bakery burned down a few days ago.

412
00:35:28,447 --> 00:35:32,224
 His mom and dad disappeared,
 so he spent a night at our house.

413
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,683
 Why did they disappear?

414
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:34,588
 I don't know.

415
00:35:34,588 --> 00:35:38,111
 I'm going to look into it, so watch him for me.

416
00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:40,328
 Alright.

417
00:35:48,483 --> 00:35:50,633
 Daddy!

418
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:54,476
 Daddy, mom disappeared.

419
00:35:54,476 --> 00:35:57,038
 Ah, she will be back soon.

420
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:12,169
 Hello?

421
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:12,718
 What?

422
00:36:12,718 --> 00:36:14,457
 You didn't go to your cram school, right?

423
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:17,823
 I'm going to die of an illness 
if you keeping on causing me problems.

424
00:36:17,823 --> 00:36:19,608
 Okay, I got it.

425
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:21,645
 Bye.

426
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:31,056
 Are you good looking taking after your mom? 
 Huh?

427
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:37,662
I was just wondering if you need anything.

428
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:42,797
I just came to see how you're doing.

429
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:49,637
Ah, with the boss of the company,

430
00:36:49,637 --> 00:36:52,929
I am spending my own money,
 but I need to get his permission.

431
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:57,313
Don't you think that's a little bit unfair?

432
00:36:57,313 --> 00:37:01,430
Is that really necessary?

433
00:37:09,221 --> 00:37:13,775
You'll lose. 
I'll go my own way.

434
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,491
It started with your grandpa,

435
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:23,430
and your father made Saint Honore.

436
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:28,749
I understand what they are trying to do, of course.

437
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:34,694
However, your father was in charge for 10 years.

438
00:37:34,694 --> 00:37:39,135
And, I had done it for 20 years.

439
00:37:39,135 --> 00:37:40,548
What it means is that...

440
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:44,628
What power would a boss have if he's a salaryman?

441
00:37:44,628 --> 00:37:54,338
I'm the boss.
Aren't you going a little overboard?

442
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,950
Keep that in mind.

443
00:38:00,035 --> 00:38:02,331
Do your work.

444
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:31,595
Do you like cupcakes?

445
00:38:31,595 --> 00:38:33,755
That question is too common. Next.

446
00:38:33,755 --> 00:38:37,881
The cake boss,

447
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:40,420
One vote.

448
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,964
Meet my grandpa.

449
00:38:41,964 --> 00:38:45,369
My grandpa is the real boss.
I can guarantee you that.

450
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:48,857
Okay then. First, we should interview
 him and then decide if we should hire him or not.

451
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:50,695
Why don't you schedule him in?

452
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:51,793
Okay.

453
00:38:51,793 --> 00:38:55,917
A cake that a girl loves
A cake that a boy loves.

454
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:59,087
A girl wants a cake that won't make her fat.

455
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:03,887
A boy wants a cake that, no matter how many times they eat it, won't make their muscles disappear?

456
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:08,921
Instead of a cake that is fattening, 
how about the one that tastes rich and sweet?

457
00:39:20,964 --> 00:39:35,415

458
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,886
Maculinea teleius

459
00:39:51,886 --> 00:39:54,779
Aspidomorpha transparipennis

460
00:39:54,779 --> 00:39:59,125
Rhyssa persuasoria

461
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:03,827
Homotropus tarsatorius

462
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:25,924
 Cake Cafe Panda
Today's cake is 
a cake that a girl loves
 a cake that a boy loves

463
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:32,915
Welcome to Cafe Panda.

464
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:35,419
What type of cake do you want?

465
00:41:38,712 --> 00:41:40,578
It's pretty.

466
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:43,688
It's not only pretty, but it's something 
a girl eats without getting fat.

467
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:48,093
And for boys, it won't ruin their abs.

468
00:41:48,093 --> 00:41:51,848
It's very rich and sweet.

469
00:41:51,848 --> 00:41:54,739
By chance, what Da Na and I were talking about...

470
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:56,745
Did you make an article for me to write?

471
00:41:56,745 --> 00:41:58,468
No.

472
00:41:58,468 --> 00:42:00,949
I made them to make money.

473
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:07,599
But who would know that at this cafe, cakes like these are made?

474
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,658
So...

475
00:42:25,615 --> 00:42:26,737
 A gift a boyfriend/girlfriend would want.

476
00:42:26,737 --> 00:42:27,787
 Whatever cake you want, we will listen to you.

477
00:42:27,787 --> 00:42:29,799
 A cake that won't make you fat, no matter how many times you eat.

478
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:32,170
 Today is the only special sale day! Costs 2 dollars.

479
00:42:49,587 --> 00:42:52,193
 Can I have one of those?
Me too!

480
00:42:52,193 --> 00:42:54,335
This one! This one!

481
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,180
Wait that...

482
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,120
It's 2,000 won ($2). Enjoy!

483
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,278
Thank you!

484
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:03,332
Please enjoy!

485
00:43:13,486 --> 00:43:15,997
 There's annoyingly a lot.

486
00:43:18,215 --> 00:43:20,882
What I said was right.

487
00:43:20,882 --> 00:43:23,034
I'll crush him.

488
00:43:24,598 --> 00:43:28,890
He took my place.

489
00:43:30,668 --> 00:43:32,815
Ok.

490
00:43:32,815 --> 00:43:36,311
278,000 Won.

491
00:43:37,104 --> 00:43:38,656
Why are you sighing?

492
00:43:38,656 --> 00:43:42,362
278,000 Won x 30.

493
00:43:42,362 --> 00:43:44,857
8,340,000 Won.

494
00:43:44,857 --> 00:43:47,483
Wow. You can calculate really fast.

495
00:43:47,483 --> 00:43:49,610
I'm kind of tuned into money.

496
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,820
We sold them for 2,000 Won each today, but

497
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,017
if we sell them for 4,000 Won each, then

498
00:43:55,017 --> 00:43:59,619
we'll make 16,680,000 Won monthly.

499
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:01,941
We'll become rich in no time.

500
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:04,592
We were able to sell outside today, but

501
00:44:04,592 --> 00:44:07,683
we won't be able to sell as much indoors.

502
00:44:07,683 --> 00:44:10,857
If we can sell 20, 4,000 Won each, 
then we'll make 80,000 Won.

503
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:15,671
If we sell coffee well, we can get 150,000 Won daily and 4,500,000 Won monthly.

504
00:44:15,671 --> 00:44:17,473
Did you take out the money for the ingredients?

505
00:44:17,473 --> 00:44:18,847
Right.

506
00:44:18,847 --> 00:44:22,467
Minus the cost of the ingredients and your salary.

507
00:44:22,467 --> 00:44:27,006
I also have pay for the interest. I have to keep on paying for the ingredients...

508
00:44:29,158 --> 00:44:33,182
This won't work just selling cupcakes.

509
00:44:34,018 --> 00:44:36,069
What is the operating cost?

510
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:37,753
8,000.

511
00:44:37,753 --> 00:44:42,222
I had to pay for my mom's hospital bills, 
so this place is owned by the bank.

512
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:51,042
I'll pay off your debts, you don't have to pay my salary, and I'll pay for the cost of the ingridients.

513
00:44:51,042 --> 00:44:53,251
I'll do all that for you.

514
00:44:55,177 --> 00:44:57,314
Let's draw up a contract.

515
00:44:57,314 --> 00:44:59,144
What kind of contract?

516
00:44:59,144 --> 00:45:02,915
Ko Seung Ji will provide the necessary
 funds to operate the cafe.

517
00:45:02,915 --> 00:45:07,395
In return, you'll follow my rules.

518
00:45:08,345 --> 00:45:10,026
Is that alright with you?

519
00:45:10,026 --> 00:45:13,113
You might lose your money.

520
00:45:13,113 --> 00:45:15,038
Is that alright with you?

521
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:17,444
If you have to follow my rules?

522
00:45:17,444 --> 00:45:18,777
It's fine for me.

523
00:45:18,777 --> 00:45:22,927
I don't have to spend any money now. 
I just have to pay back later after I make a lot of money.

524
00:45:22,927 --> 00:45:24,109
Then, why don't you write it up fast.

525
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:26,356
Okay!

526
00:45:32,218 --> 00:45:34,855
Ko Seung Ji will

527
00:45:36,182 --> 00:45:40,377
provide the necessary funds to operate the cafe.

528
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:14,468
Why are you like this?

529
00:46:14,468 --> 00:46:16,444
I couldn't find anything.

530
00:46:16,444 --> 00:46:19,294
-What?
-Ko Seung Ji's profile.

531
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:26,390
The employees were saying that 
you're in your office studying.

532
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:28,304
Aigoo. Is that all you have been doing?

533
00:46:28,304 --> 00:46:30,245
No, that's not all!

534
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:33,337
Even if we put everything together, 
we still can't win Ko Seung Ji.

535
00:46:33,337 --> 00:46:34,894
We have to know where he had worked,

536
00:46:34,894 --> 00:46:36,781
and from whom he had learned. We have to know something to win.

537
00:46:36,781 --> 00:46:38,504
So you're going to scout him?

538
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,703
Then, what should I do with Da Yang?

539
00:46:40,703 --> 00:46:43,208
Just try your best with making cakes.

540
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:45,220
Boss Choi was going to sell it anyway.

541
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,622
Whatever it's a just baker or a patisserie.

542
00:46:47,622 --> 00:46:49,797
Panda has it all made then.

543
00:46:49,797 --> 00:46:53,523
Aigoo. Would Da Yang accept it that
 readily considering her temper?

544
00:46:53,523 --> 00:46:59,799
So are you saying that you looked into
 Ko Seung Ji's background without intention to hire,
 but out of mere jealousy?

545
00:46:59,799 --> 00:47:03,831
Hyung, aren't you even curious about his identity?

546
00:47:03,831 --> 00:47:05,432
This is how I look at it.

547
00:47:05,432 --> 00:47:07,921
You're in a love triangle by yourself.

548
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:10,697
Panda is not interested in Ko Seung Ji.

549
00:47:10,697 --> 00:47:13,701
And, Ko Seung Ji is not interested in Panda either.

550
00:47:14,562 --> 00:47:16,718
Then, that's enough.

551
00:47:16,718 --> 00:47:19,264
Tell me how I can find out then.

552
00:47:19,264 --> 00:47:21,431
There must be something only patissiers know.

553
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:27,152
They say, you should get to know your enemy
 better than your friend.

554
00:47:27,152 --> 00:47:30,149
How can I make friends with him right now?

555
00:47:30,149 --> 00:47:33,231
Right, if you go there, you'll only get into a fight.

556
00:47:33,231 --> 00:47:36,547
Pick someone the other side won't be suspicious of.

557
00:47:36,547 --> 00:47:37,431
If you send him there...

558
00:47:37,431 --> 00:47:39,613
Hey, Bro! I know you!

559
00:47:39,613 --> 00:47:41,702
What are you doing here?

560
00:47:44,624 --> 00:47:46,902
She's not too civilized.

561
00:47:53,893 --> 00:47:55,524
Free part-time worker?

562
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:57,288
Unni!

563
00:47:57,288 --> 00:47:59,192
Look at this.

564
00:47:59,192 --> 00:48:00,644
It's pretty, isn't it?
Give it to me.

565
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:04,282
When I held it last time, we made good sales.

566
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:06,354
Isn't it really strange?

567
00:48:06,354 --> 00:48:10,274
Hello? Oh, wow!

568
00:48:10,274 --> 00:48:12,590
It's Choi Won Yi.

569
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,053
How do you know me...?

570
00:48:14,053 --> 00:48:16,695
I worked part-time at Saint Honore.

571
00:48:16,695 --> 00:48:19,035
Oh, I see. It's nice to see you.

572
00:48:20,279 --> 00:48:22,213
If you're Choi Won Yi,

573
00:48:22,213 --> 00:48:23,838
then you're Choi Won Il's sister?

574
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:25,694
Yes, hyungnim!

575
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,653
Hyungnim?

576
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,615
Yes, hyungnim.

577
00:48:27,615 --> 00:48:31,360
I came because Won Il hyung wanted me
 to help you with everything.

578
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:38,038
Even though I may look like this, 
I shined at Saint Honore.
I should contribute, right?

579
00:48:38,038 --> 00:48:41,527
Hey, hey, let's use her.

580
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:43,137
Free things are nice.

581
00:48:43,137 --> 00:48:44,420
But what to do...

582
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,350
I'm not just someone!

583
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:49,573
I've seen pictures of you a lot.

584
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:52,845
Just think of me as a sister you gained, 
so please use me as you wish.

585
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:56,069
Won Il hyung sent me here as a present for you.

586
00:48:57,381 --> 00:48:59,279
Ah, hyung, this must be heavy for you.

587
00:48:59,279 --> 00:49:00,773
I'll lift it. Oh...

588
00:49:00,773 --> 00:49:02,657
Ommo, Ommo.

589
00:49:02,657 --> 00:49:04,577
Hey, hey, is she a man?

590
00:49:04,577 --> 00:49:07,811
She called you noona. Noona.
Huh?

591
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:12,364
Ya, she's okay.

592
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:22,534
Buy cake~

593
00:49:22,534 --> 00:49:26,685
Please buy our cakes.
Couple? Are you a couple?

594
00:49:26,685 --> 00:49:29,669
Hello? This cake won't make you gain weight.

595
00:49:29,669 --> 00:49:33,296
Are you going to give this as a gift to your girlfriend?
Here you go.

596
00:49:33,296 --> 00:49:34,921
1000 won ($1) as a special.

597
00:49:34,921 --> 00:49:38,534
Please don't misunderstand by looking at me. 
This cake won't make you fat.

598
00:49:40,076 --> 00:49:41,262
Wow, so cute! Wow!

599
00:49:41,262 --> 00:49:42,652
Take a lot of pictures.

600
00:49:42,652 --> 00:49:44,402
Let's upload it on our homepage later.

601
00:49:44,402 --> 00:49:46,989
But that one, should we give that to our professor?

602
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:49,243
Hey, let's eat some, too.

603
00:49:49,243 --> 00:49:50,234
We sold that much?

604
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:51,759
That's what I'm saying!

605
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:53,322
There's something in your eyes.

606
00:49:53,322 --> 00:49:56,579
You keep blinking.

607
00:50:02,612 --> 00:50:04,580
Unni!

608
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:14,358
Gil Dong Goo! You jerk!

609
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,187
I'll get him!

610
00:50:19,187 --> 00:50:20,540
Do you know who it is?

611
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,369
No, I don't know.

612
00:50:21,369 --> 00:50:24,986
Unni! We came out on our blog!

613
00:50:24,986 --> 00:50:28,837
I came out, we all came out! 
Come here!

614
00:50:28,837 --> 00:50:31,727
It's Panda Cake!!
Aja Aja!!

615
00:50:44,092 --> 00:50:45,895
For you, Hyung,

616
00:50:45,895 --> 00:50:49,772
since my hard work was officially acknowledged,

617
00:50:49,772 --> 00:50:54,236
do you know how you can show your gratitude?

618
00:50:56,936 --> 00:51:00,824
Thank you. I prepared Panda's pictures too.

619
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,135
Buy this cake with that money.

620
00:51:02,135 --> 00:51:03,458
Huh?

621
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:05,375
I thought you were just giving it to me.

622
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:08,238
Da Yang had nothing to say to me?

623
00:51:08,238 --> 00:51:10,074
Ah, she said she'll come soon for

624
00:51:10,074 --> 00:51:11,933
When is soon?!

625
00:51:11,933 --> 00:51:15,193
Tomorrow, after she meets the boss of the bakery.

626
00:51:17,534 --> 00:51:21,160
Hey, hey, my arms hurt after working.

627
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,268
You think this is fat.

628
00:51:23,268 --> 00:51:24,560
It's muscle.

629
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,531
Let me see.

630
00:51:26,531 --> 00:51:29,079
What do you mean see.
I'll just...

631
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:31,606
By the way, who is Pan Da Yang?

632
00:51:31,606 --> 00:51:33,731
That's me.

633
00:51:33,731 --> 00:51:36,421
It's a present from Choi Won Il.

634
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,121
My back healed a while ago.

635
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:44,883
I think it's not bad at all.

636
00:51:44,883 --> 00:51:49,285
Oh, this will look nice in my room.

637
00:51:49,285 --> 00:51:51,180
How much is this?

638
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:54,792
Probably more than 800.

639
00:51:56,754 --> 00:51:59,244
He's gone crazy.

640
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:05,621
Here's where everyone working on making cakes and who specialized in pastries and sweets.

641
00:52:05,621 --> 00:52:09,595
After you learned the best way of making cakes and become a great baker...

642
00:52:09,595 --> 00:52:18,293
Our staff members will accept the graduates here and you can start working right away as patissiers...

643
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:32,114
How did Panda found Won II's phone number?

644
00:52:32,114 --> 00:52:33,983
Won Il contacted her?

645
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:36,524
Who did this?

646
00:52:36,524 --> 00:52:39,835
Just spend it, it doesn't matter how much.

647
00:52:41,016 --> 00:52:43,864
The present that costs 800 doesn't...

648
00:52:47,548 --> 00:52:51,227
I'm in a meeting right now.
 I'll contact you later. I'll come over.

649
00:52:51,227 --> 00:52:53,004
We'll talk over there.

650
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,693
Ok.

651
00:52:56,585 --> 00:52:58,037
Boss.

652
00:52:58,037 --> 00:52:58,878
Yes.

653
00:52:58,878 --> 00:53:00,555
They tried to change it!

654
00:53:00,555 --> 00:53:01,264
Pardon?

655
00:53:01,264 --> 00:53:04,414
They tried to change the main menu of Saint Honore.

656
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:07,818
I took your side.

657
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:09,276
Don't let them change it.

658
00:53:09,276 --> 00:53:11,843
Yes, I'll be loyal.

659
00:53:11,843 --> 00:53:15,273
He's crazy, how can he give me a present costing 800 won?

660
00:53:15,273 --> 00:53:19,302
No, is he my boyfriend? I am his girlfriend?

661
00:53:19,302 --> 00:53:23,449
Is he a big spender or does he not
 know what to do with all that money?

662
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:26,497
What was he really thinking?

663
00:53:26,497 --> 00:53:29,073
You're so preoccupied with Choi Won Il.

664
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:31,347
Are you capable of doing your job?

665
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,947
I'm sorry. Let's go, hurry.

666
00:54:06,322 --> 00:54:07,909
Thank you.

667
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:12,538
Why don't you sit down too?

668
00:54:12,538 --> 00:54:16,819
I won't even be interviewing, 
so please talk comfortably.

669
00:54:16,819 --> 00:54:20,904
It might be uncomfortable if it's just two of us here,
 that's why I'm saying it.

670
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:22,791
Yes.

671
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:30,843
Where did Seung Ji go?

672
00:54:30,843 --> 00:54:34,032
Father, she is a reporter, not an in-law.

673
00:54:34,032 --> 00:54:36,698
It's the same thing.

674
00:54:36,698 --> 00:54:40,895
I am just the owner of the cafe where Seung Ji works.

675
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,589
So it's the same thing.

676
00:54:53,645 --> 00:54:55,832
Please take care of Seung Ji.

677
00:54:57,239 --> 00:54:58,559
Yes.

678
00:54:59,959 --> 00:55:02,362
Can I start the interview?

679
00:55:02,362 --> 00:55:03,709
Go ahead please.

680
00:55:06,746 --> 00:55:09,469
When did you make your cake for the first time?

681
00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:11,291
He might say harsh things, but

682
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:13,673
his heart is good.

683
00:55:13,673 --> 00:55:17,198
So please think well of him.

684
00:55:26,213 --> 00:55:29,119
A little more expensive than $8,000.

685
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,153
Do you think we can find more expensice one?

686
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:33,689
Why does it have to cost a little more than $8,000?

687
00:55:33,689 --> 00:55:35,459
So it will be accepted.

688
00:55:35,459 --> 00:55:36,712
By whom?

689
00:55:36,712 --> 00:55:41,280
Who else can it be?

690
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,468
He will even buy a car.

691
00:55:42,468 --> 00:55:45,200
He really fell for her.

692
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,577
I'm even thinking of paying for
 that $8,000 message chair.

693
00:55:48,577 --> 00:55:51,232
Is there such a massage chair?

694
00:55:51,232 --> 00:55:53,767
Hey, did you get money from lotto?

695
00:55:55,596 --> 00:55:57,437
If I make the bakery successful,

696
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:00,351
It must be exactly that much.

697
00:56:00,351 --> 00:56:02,038
how much can I profit?

698
00:56:02,038 --> 00:56:04,936
Well..
Ah!

699
00:56:04,936 --> 00:56:06,946
There's a baker here...

700
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,442
They made a lot of money.

701
00:56:09,442 --> 00:56:12,491
Hey, you're planning something here.

702
00:56:12,491 --> 00:56:15,468
He has a plan to make a big profit. 
Looks like he started.
Huh?

703
00:56:15,468 --> 00:56:18,286
-What kind of plan?
-What's his background?

704
00:56:18,286 --> 00:56:20,370
Patissier.
Not that.

705
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,741
Businessman.

706
00:56:22,741 --> 00:56:24,549
But, what does it matter?

707
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:27,543
If you regard all the money that
 went into Cafe Panda as a loan,

708
00:56:27,543 --> 00:56:29,735
the interest will accumulate,

709
00:56:29,735 --> 00:56:32,891
if you finally want to sell it, 
then you can have the whole thing.

710
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:36,775
Then, she won't have money to pay back.
Seung Ji, it's a bad thing to do.

711
00:56:36,775 --> 00:56:39,668
You don't eat from other people's dish.

712
00:56:39,668 --> 00:56:42,435
It's not a dish being eaten by someone,
but it's a dish there to be eaten.

713
00:56:42,435 --> 00:56:45,856
Don't touch it if it won't benefit, 
but pierce it if it will benefit.

714
00:56:45,856 --> 00:56:49,292
That's Go Seung Ji.

715
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:13,190
Da Yang.

716
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,560
Why do you look like that?

717
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,991
Did something happen?

718
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:40,744
 Let's talk.

719
00:57:40,744 --> 00:57:43,962
 I really need to do something for Da Yang

720
00:57:43,962 --> 00:57:45,571
 What is it?

721
00:57:45,571 --> 00:57:47,519
 Patissier Ko Seung Ji.

722
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,851
 Ko Seung Ji?

723
00:57:51,851 --> 00:57:54,410
 What do you have to gain by doing this to me?

724
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:57,286
 I don't say anything wrong, so contact me after you consider it carefully.

725
00:57:57,286 --> 00:57:58,197
 Does it make any sense?

726
00:57:58,197 --> 00:57:59,770
 Alright, I'll give everything.

727
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:00,824
 I mean I'll give you more.

728
00:58:00,824 --> 00:58:04,766
 We're saving our cafe finally.
