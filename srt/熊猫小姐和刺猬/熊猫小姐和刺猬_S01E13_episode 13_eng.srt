1
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,835
 Saint Honoré,

2
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:57,765
 I have finally arrived.

3
00:00:58,307 --> 00:01:00,272
 Chairman, please taste my cake just once.

4
00:01:00,272 --> 00:01:03,030
 -What is this? 
-I made this. Please taste it. 
-Ahh! This person!

5
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,898
 -Chairman! 
-Stop it!

♫ Maculinea teleius ♫

♫ Aspidomorpha transparipennis ♫

00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:30,617
♫ tarsatorius ♫

11
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:56,385
The main and branch locations, all 8 put together

12
00:01:56,385 --> 00:02:00,540
bake, produce, and display daily,

13
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,216
one thousand slices of cakes of different varieties, 50 small sized cakes,

14
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:09,300
30 medium sized cakes, and 20 large sized cakes.

15
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,101
Also, 10% of production is taken by a thousand cookies in assorted varieties,

16
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:15,099
and we also make a thousand pieces of chocolat, that is, chocolate.

17
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,511
Special orders were made by the President, me, and Soosuk...

18
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:22,083
Three of us were in charge of making them. 
Around 15 a day.

19
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:27,525
And three people are in charge of creating one new product a month.

20
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:33,113
Mr. Chun was worried about next week's event.  Where is that taking place and what do they expect?

21
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:36,105
Tae Yang Energy Corporation is planning their 18th Anniversary event.

22
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:39,981
They've ordered one large cake and 2000 slices of cake.

23
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:43,097
As for the kind of cake it will be, that hasn't been decided yet.

24
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:47,918
Then, we should decide that first.

25
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:54,586
He probably isn't accustomed to this environment yet...

26
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:57,852
I feel bad asking him for such a huge favor.

27
00:02:57,852 --> 00:03:02,694
About that... Since you guys took down President Choi's posters, there's nothing to say.

28
00:03:02,694 --> 00:03:04,159
Do you sell everything you make?

29
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,279
Because there are many customers who buy gifts.

30
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:09,915
Wow... How much do you guys earn in a month?

31
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:11,861
Hear from Won Il yourself.

32
00:03:13,929 --> 00:03:15,758
Let's go.

33
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:21,509
We're going to make it big this time...

34
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,741
You have to help us. Okay?

35
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:27,417
Grandpa is cool!

36
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:48,405
I'm worried to death and he doesn't even call once.

37
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:51,564
I hate you, Hedgehog.

38
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:03,396
I think I'm right...

39
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:08,897
I really think I'm right.

40
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:26,389
How much does a building like this cost anyway?

41
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,707
You have to ask Won Il about that too.

42
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:31,717
Anything that has to do with money, he's in charge, huh?

43
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:35,775
Do you think President Choi is really not coming back?

44
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,760
I think that may depend on how you help us, Seung Ji.

45
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,644
I mean, you probably aren't giving up your position at Cafe Panda, right?

46
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:46,012
It wasn't quite my choice to come here.

47
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:49,359
Won Il asked Grandpa to come, and Grandpa ordered me to.

48
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,227
So I just followed him here.

49
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:56,291
So if he were to say, "Let's go home now," then you'd follow him home?

50
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,695
Well, when it comes to Grandpa, I have to do as he says.

51
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:03,052
He will be my master forever.

52
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:06,135
Panda must be sad.

53
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:08,616
Panda is my servant.

54
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:11,013
And Grandpa is your master?

55
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:13,313
Exactly.

56
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,477
Let's go.

57
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:21,296
Why aren't you going to greet someone who's come to help us?

58
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:26,119
We don't even know if he's going to be a help yet. After I see, I'll go and say something.

59
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:29,542
Are you saying you're going to test him?

60
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:34,513
Son, you know how hard it is to get a decent pastry chef, don't you?

61
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:37,147
But, 17 of them showed up at once.

62
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:39,604
Do you think they could have come on a moments notice if they were any good?

63
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:41,652
What if they make products we can't sell?

64
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:46,325
Then later should we say, "I'd like to cancel my thanks, please pay back our losses?"

65
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:49,025
You think Grandfather would have brought untalented people?

66
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:50,391
Is he your grandfather?

67
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,620
You haven't known him long enough to trust him.

68
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,812
Okay, I'll give you that Ko Seung Ji has talent,

69
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,640
but have you heard anything about that old man?

70
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,655
If he's so good, what was he doing running that crummy little shop?

71
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:04,117
Who says it's a crummy little shop?

72
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:07,542
Her.  She said that.

73
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:10,642
Um.  I didn't quite say it like that.

74
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:15,522
When she asked "What's his profile?" I said "He runs a little corner shop."

75
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:18,645
That's not at the level of something you can fit into a profile.

76
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:22,933
That's why at that age he's just running a crummy bake shop.

77
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,991
Are you done speaking?!

78
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:27,081
What are going to do if I am done speaking?

79
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:33,636
What are you going to do if those people are just here because they want to take advantage of us thinking they are going to take our money?

80
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:37,770
You don't know my Grandpa at all.

81
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,237
Who is this?

82
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:43,320
Grandfather, why are we in the bathroom?

83
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,944
Do you need to make sure you are close to a well running bathroom to be comfortable?

84
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:48,665
There's something our President always says...

85
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:52,759
You can tell the condition of a place by the state of their kitchen and bathrooms.

86
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:56,595
Oh, then our condition must be really awful.

87
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:58,720
Who are you?

88
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:02,771
Let's go out.  Let's go out and talk.

89
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:05,287
I have to at least say hello, don't I?

90
00:07:05,287 --> 00:07:08,360
Hello, my name is Ko Seung Ji.

91
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:12,302
Yes. I've heard a lot about you.

92
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:17,505
I read in the paper that you became known for our macarons.

93
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:20,889
You should know that you are lucky that it didn't leak onto the internet that

94
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,894
President Choi Ja Geum stole my macaron ideas and made them his own.

95
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:26,804
It is I, Yang Gom Dong Macarons.

96
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:29,720
The original creator of the Cosmetic Macaron design.

97
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,722
Wait.

98
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:34,045
Who said

99
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:36,197
we stole them?

100
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:37,683
Then

101
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:42,407
who said my grandpa's bakery is worse than Saint Honore?

102
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:45,563
And who said my grandpa is worse than Choi Jae Gyum?

103
00:07:45,563 --> 00:07:47,382
W-What do you mean by Choi Jae Gyum?

104
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:49,569
What kind of young man calls an adult by their name?

105
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,504
Let's go out.

106
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,578
My grandpa is

107
00:07:55,578 --> 00:08:00,025
an adult over an adult.

108
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:02,838
Not even a beggar.

109
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:04,772
Anyhow,

110
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:08,093
we'll see after seeing the cake.
Not the cake that Ko Seung Ji makes,

111
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:12,312
but the cake your grandpa, owner of the crummy bread shop, makes.

112
00:08:12,312 --> 00:08:16,507
If the cake my grandpa makes is better than the cake President Choi makes,

113
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:18,672
what are you going to do?

114
00:08:22,574 --> 00:08:24,459
President Choi out?

115
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,325
President Choi's spot...

116
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:29,460
Will you give it to my grandpa?

117
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,311
You guys aren't beggars, you're players.

118
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:36,753
You're tricking my Won II, right?
Together with Pan Da Yang.

119
00:08:36,753 --> 00:08:38,203
Mom!

120
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:40,277
Do you need to speak like that?

121
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:43,425
He's speaking nonsense right now.

122
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:45,727
Should we write a contract?

123
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,942
What kind of contract?

124
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:51,817
If me and my grandpa's cake beat Choi Jae Gyum's cake in sales and taste

125
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:56,926
within 11 days, then my grandpa will take over Saint Honore for a year.

126
00:08:56,926 --> 00:08:58,312
And,

127
00:08:58,312 --> 00:09:02,498
my grandpa will receive exactly what Choi Jae Gyum was paid. 
Why?

128
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:03,901
Because we're not beggars.

129
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:05,919
And

130
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,659
my grandpa's entire team will be accepted.

131
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:13,864
What happens when Ko Seung Ji and his grandpa loses?

132
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:15,775
Then I, Ko Seung Ji,

133
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:20,685
will work at Saint Honore without pay for a year.

134
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,382
Really?

135
00:09:22,382 --> 00:09:26,576
Well, both of those conditions are not bad for me.

136
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:29,633
Then let's write it. The contract.

137
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:31,441
Fine. Let's do it.

138
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:32,559
Kang Eun Bi.

139
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,063
-Yes?
-Qucikly bring the pen and the stamp.

140
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:43,088
There's no need to go that far.
I'm the one who asked for your help.

141
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:44,785
Don't get involved.

142
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:50,421
Although I know I need to hold back because she's your mother,
 I can't because my grandpa is that special to me, and

143
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:53,009
although I can stand being called a beggar...

144
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,135
Our Grandpa and Da Yang

145
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:58,463
being called a beggar...

146
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:01,269
I won't stand it.

147
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:13,059
Write accurately. This is going to be fair.

148
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:15,523
Son, who's side are you on?

149
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:17,848
On whatever side you think I'm on.

150
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:21,221
And you're on the side I think you're on.

151
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,387
What is that?

152
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:23,864
To use me

153
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:28,404
to fix Choi Jae Gyum's personality and bring him back.

154
00:10:34,162 --> 00:10:36,077
Why are you writing this?

155
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:40,933
It needs to be stamped to legally bind Saint Honoré so, it shouldn't matter who writes it.

156
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:45,041
Why? If you write it, are you going to say it never happened?

157
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,149
What?

158
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:49,908
Hurry up and contact him.

159
00:10:49,908 --> 00:10:51,812
What?

160
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:04,866
What President said is right.

161
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:07,794
We'll know from looking in the bathroom and here.

162
00:11:07,794 --> 00:11:13,353
What does it matter how many employees we have if the rooms are in such a state? 
We fail when it comes to keeping order.

163
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:16,361
If it was my house, would I use it like this?

164
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:20,006
Seung Ji is organized because he learned from you,

165
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:22,994
but our guys seems to take what they want and then leave things  around anywhere when they are done.

166
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:24,547
That's right.

167
00:11:24,547 --> 00:11:27,138
It's not just here. It's the same with other stores too.

168
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:31,071
I wish no patissiers were hired and I hope they won't do business.

169
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:34,528
But, they won't close so I'll get paid without working.

170
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,755
I hope it's like that. It better be like that.

171
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:42,201
That's why Won Il asked Seung Ji to help because they have no one they can use.

172
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:46,603
Because Seung Ji talked about him so much, I wondered what kind of man President Choi was.

173
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:48,684
After coming here, I'm even more curious.

174
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:54,412
Exactly what kind of person is he that he takes all his workers out 
with him so that his own store would be ruined?

175
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:57,172
Why wouldn't you be?

176
00:11:57,172 --> 00:11:59,046
But President...

177
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:02,545
Are you helping out here because Choi Won II is pitiful or because you are

178
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:09,332
teaching Seung Ji that it is better to help being a patissier here than to burn this place down?

179
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:11,602
It's killing two birds with one stone right?

180
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:13,797
Go and do your work.

181
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:16,248
I will go upstairs.

182
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:30,662
Did I do something wrong?

183
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:36,275
But, she's your mother.

184
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:38,317
Your mother doesn't know

185
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:40,264
whether it will work out or not.

186
00:12:40,264 --> 00:12:43,491
I'm not even sure.

187
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:45,104
Even so,

188
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:49,397
can my mother act like that to someone who's like her son's dongsaeng?

189
00:12:49,397 --> 00:12:54,442
Act like that to someone who's like her son's real grandfather?

190
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,078
Don't tell Grandpa anything.

191
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,271
That's what I should be saying.

192
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:03,723
Hyung, you were here too? Grandpa is waiting.

193
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:04,625
Where is he?

194
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,916
In the storage room.

195
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:09,795
He said to get the profiles of the patissiers. I'm going.

196
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,995
Why are you here? Please go upstairs.

197
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:55,840
I'm looking at the ingredients. If you see the storage room, you know the cakes as well.

198
00:13:56,394 --> 00:14:01,087
This is 10 won. The ones we use at Grandpa's and Panda's are 100 won.

199
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:03,382
Huh...?

200
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:03,921
According to our documents,

201
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:08,311
our expenses just for ingredients is over 20,000 dollars per month.

202
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:11,161
I believe the quality of our ingredients has remained unchanged for the last 20 years as well.

203
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:13,820
20 years is $4.8 million.

204
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,236
Wow. Giving customers cheap cakes...

205
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:19,076
And gobbling up all the money.

206
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,261
Manager Choi Il.

207
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,171
Yes?

208
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:27,556
Are you going to reaccept President Choi or are you going to do this on your own?

209
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,962
I want to block President Choi from coming back.

210
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:39,313
But, doing this alone, I feel like I'll be putting too much pressure on Gyun Woo hyung.

211
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,673
Honestly, I have no confidence.

212
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:47,717
To tell you more honestly... Getting investments

213
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:51,351
for the company is something I could do...

214
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:55,054
But making a cake and placing it in front of the customer...

215
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:57,855
I don't know even know where to start...

216
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,426
I'll be relying on Grandpa and Seung Ji.

217
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:07,134
I don't even know where I should be starting right now even.

218
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,598
Grandpa...

219
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:14,136
Please take over, Grandpa.

220
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:18,052
Don't be behind me. Be in front of me.

221
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:21,583
As you know, Grandpa, I can make cakes on my own.

222
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,851
But I've never been in charge of 20 patissiers before.

223
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:26,301
But, Grandpa, you've looked over not just 20, but...

224
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:34,510
I'm not just saying for Grandpa to go to the front. This is something I've decided back then.

225
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,887
The patissiers that poured flour on me

226
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:41,297
and hit me are here.

227
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:52,691
What did you say?

228
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:54,913
Why did you go through that kind of thing here?

229
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:58,444
Why would I hate President Choi for no reason?

230
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:02,355
What is he saying right now?

231
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:05,483
What happened here? Please tell me, Grandpa.

232
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:10,252
5 years ago, after being released from prison.

233
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:15,521
To a man who decided to have a clean start and found this place...

234
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:18,490
President Choi had the nerve to...

235
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,810
Excuse me?

236
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:22,880
It's not like we're going to set this place on fire...

237
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,084
We're saying we'll listen to you.

238
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:29,084
You said for the three of us to become happy.

239
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,937
So, President Choi...

240
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:36,043
let's replace him with you here.

241
00:16:36,043 --> 00:16:40,293
Then, wouldn't the happy memory

242
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:44,352
erase the unhappy one?

243
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:04,852
I thought you said Grandpa was in there...

244
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:07,490
Oh, please give this to grandpa.

245
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:10,825
You... Why is your face like that?

246
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:15,182
Because I'm nervous. Because I can work beneath you guys.

247
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:18,448
After looking at Ko Seung Ji I feel that way too.

248
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:20,959
Both Hedgehog and Grandpa are amazing.

249
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,561
I know. Ko Seung Ji probably learned from Grandpa.

250
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:26,948
Hurry up and give it to them. I'll...

251
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:28,714
go and change my outfit.

252
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,901
What clothes?

253
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:38,080
I...

254
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:42,327
Because everyone is waiting, I'm here to escort you there.

255
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,855
Won Yi told me to give you the patissiers' profiles.

256
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,951
Will it be okay if I do as I see fit?

257
00:17:50,951 --> 00:17:52,138
Yes.

258
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,664
Yes.

259
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:54,855
We will follow you.

260
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:58,469
Then, let's get started.

261
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:09,474
A knife that Grandpa has decided not to use since 20 years ago, we've brought it out again.

262
00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:11,380
For you...

263
00:18:11,976 --> 00:18:13,193
and for me.

264
00:18:13,972 --> 00:18:16,098
But why for 20 years?

265
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:18,330
I don't know.

266
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,089
What was he like 20 years ago?

267
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:23,067
He said he flew.

268
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:24,668
What?

269
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:27,228
Let's fly with Grandpa, also.

270
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:28,233
One.

271
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,113
Two.

272
00:18:29,113 --> 00:18:30,069
Three.

273
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,554
Go!

274
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:45,053
From now on, forget the past procedures.

275
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:50,950
We will make people in charge of what they are most confident in.

276
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:56,517
Petits gâteaux, entremets, demi-chef, chocolats.

277
00:18:56,517 --> 00:19:00,969
Please write down one of the four that you are confident in.

278
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:08,214
Team One. Petits Gâteaux. Châtaignes, Charlotte aux poires, Tropical, Blanc manger, Chocolat-Menthe.

279
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:14,992
Team Two, Petits Gâteaux, Mousse Melon, Mont Blanc, Piaf, Crème Brulée, Fleur du pomme.

280
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:22,341
Third Team, Entremets: Fromage Blanc, Pain Impératrice,  Alliance, Opéra, Mille feuille.

281
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:27,013
Fourth Team. Entremets:  Tarte noire, Chocolat à l'orange, Chocolat-menthe,

282
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:29,282
Printanier fruit de la passion.

283
00:19:29,282 --> 00:19:35,858
Team Five, Demi-feuilleté: Cake aux marrons, Dacquoise, Sablés, 
Financier aux amandes, Biscuit de thé.

284
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:41,741
Team Six, Demi-feuilleté:  Croquant, Eclair, Madeleine, Choux, Amarreto

285
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:47,180
Team Seven, Chocolat, Oranges et Marrons, Amandes Chocolat, Pralines, Miel,

286
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:52,875
vanille, truffe, menthe, pâte de fruit, muscade et Cointreau.

287
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,245
That's all.

288
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:13,456
Tomorrow, the reason I am asking you to take on

289
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:19,919
this serious and heavy responsibility,

290
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,210
is because I expect each day you spend here to

291
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:28,151
become valuable experiences that will lead to a bright future.

292
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:33,629
Become the best team to produce the best cakes.

293
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:37,973
When a cake is made with my name and with my pride on the line.

294
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:44,860
that is what determines if a cake is dead or alive.

295
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:47,600
 Panda's cakes are all alive but...

296
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,000
 why are all our cakes dead?

297
00:20:50,158 --> 00:20:57,163
I'm not sure if all of you relied on Saint Honoré to survive.

298
00:20:57,163 --> 00:21:05,040
From now on, because of all of you, Saint Honoré will survive. Is that correct?

299
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,082
Yes!

300
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,378
Team 8... Saint Honoré...

301
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:30,457
Saint Honoré. Please make Saint Honoré.

302
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:34,423
The Saint Honoré that you all will make.

303
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:40,723
A departure from President Choi's blood. It is a new face of Saint Honoré.

304
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:44,512
Use the your hidden passions and talents and...

305
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:51,441
let's make the best Saint Honoré!

306
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:04,850
Now, to your positions.

307
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:27,721

308
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:39,399
 Wait for me, Saint Honoré.

309
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:41,628
 I'll take care of you.

310
00:22:52,426 --> 00:22:53,791
Hyung, do you know?

311
00:22:54,276 --> 00:22:55,532
What?

312
00:22:56,051 --> 00:22:58,931
Grandpa and Hedgehog aren't blood related.

313
00:23:01,204 --> 00:23:04,507
Me, Hedgehog, Grandpa and you are all strangers.

314
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:07,263
So?

315
00:23:07,796 --> 00:23:14,632
Even though they are strangers, they are more like family than blood-related family.

316
00:23:17,156 --> 00:23:23,289
Think about your filial duty later, hyung. If you don't consider your filial duty, our cakes will die.

317
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:28,341
Are you going to abandon the poor cakes that look to you to save them?

318
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:29,444
No.

319
00:23:29,997 --> 00:23:32,956
Right? That's why you're the manager.

320
00:23:35,287 --> 00:23:38,948
Grandpa and Hedgehog are reviving our dead cakes...

321
00:23:38,948 --> 00:23:41,694
but is there something we can do for them?

322
00:23:41,694 --> 00:23:44,908
We can't replace his grandson that passed away, either...

323
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:49,660
But he may not have passed away.

324
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,034
What else?

325
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:53,245
They could have lost him.

326
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:56,053
That's true!

327
00:23:57,497 --> 00:23:59,603
Hyung, I looked on the internet recently...

328
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:02,923
There's something where you can match people's faces to an old childhood picture.

329
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:05,363
What if we try to find him like that?

330
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:07,983
You said there may be a possibility that he's still alive.

331
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:12,792
My collegue in the U.S. also found his parents like that.

332
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,196
Really?

333
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:16,394
Should I go directly to Grandpa and ask him?

334
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:18,169
Don't... He's working.

335
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:23,104
Instead, why don't we ask Grandpa's daughter?

336
00:24:23,104 --> 00:24:26,830
"What I wish is that he is lost and not dead..."

337
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,825
But, we find him for them.

338
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:33,699
Then, don't you think we'll feel like we paid them back a little?

339
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:08,451
Ask ahjumma to find out whether she lost her child or he passed away?

340
00:25:08,451 --> 00:25:12,444
Yeah. I checked with my friend in U.S.

341
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:18,390
The program which matches childhood faces with current faces is over 99% accurate.

342
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:23,810
We want to repay Grandpa a little for all he's done for us.

343
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,474
I'll find out.

344
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:32,221
Not now but later.

345
00:25:32,221 --> 00:25:39,011
It's not something you can bring up out of the blue. After work, I'll have to bring out beer or something.

346
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:43,998
Yeah. It doesn't have to be today. Think about it carefully and act accordingly.

347
00:25:43,998 --> 00:25:46,821
I understand.

348
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:48,840
But...

349
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,443
But what?

350
00:25:51,276 --> 00:25:57,304
If we had a picture of Minwoo, we could have done that too...

351
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:02,785
Da Yang, there's something I have to tell you...

352
00:26:02,785 --> 00:26:04,340
What?

353
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,835
About Minwoo.

354
00:26:06,835 --> 00:26:09,860
What about him...?

355
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,080
I'll tell you when we meet again. 
Over the phone is kind of...

356
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,033
Okay. I understand. I'll wait.

357
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:24,993
Unnie!

358
00:26:24,993 --> 00:26:26,868
Mi Ra unni wants you to come down right away!

359
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:27,620
Why?

360
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,684
She said there's a suspicious person. She says he's been watching us. Come quickly!

361
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:34,347
Okay.

362
00:26:43,207 --> 00:26:44,924
I think he's left.

363
00:26:44,924 --> 00:26:48,667
Of course he would have left since I stared at him like that.

364
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,581
What did he look like?

365
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:52,253
Around 50 years old?

366
00:26:52,253 --> 00:26:56,563
He's not suspicious looking but the atmosphere around him was suspicious.

367
00:26:56,563 --> 00:26:58,986
Could he be a detective?

368
00:26:58,986 --> 00:27:02,783
Hey, Syung Bin's dad is a detective,
 would he be spying like that?

369
00:27:02,783 --> 00:27:06,735
Anyway, point the CCTV at the entrance.

370
00:27:08,047 --> 00:27:09,387
I haven't even turned it on.

371
00:27:09,387 --> 00:27:16,100
Turn it on then! The CCTV can see if he comes here.

372
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,349
They say you chase away a thief, not catch one.
Got it?

373
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:20,847
You say it's a thief?

374
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,755
A thief or not,

375
00:27:22,755 --> 00:27:26,109
a person watching over a house... Do you think he's Santa Claus?

376
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,264
Is he a guy that she's dating?

377
00:27:32,354 --> 00:27:33,747
Eh?

378
00:27:35,475 --> 00:27:39,081
Anyways, listen to me. The feeling was bad.

379
00:27:39,081 --> 00:27:42,263
Okay. I'll listen to you, unnie.

380
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:43,518
I'm going!

381
00:27:43,518 --> 00:27:44,180
Go safely.

382
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,289
Ok.

383
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,602
Let's go in too.

384
00:27:55,291 --> 00:28:01,394
Park Mi Hyang... she used Hedgehog and is attacking me.

385
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,100
She found me?

386
00:28:09,406 --> 00:28:12,783
Did Won Il perhaps...

387
00:28:12,783 --> 00:28:19,774
This was for me and not a suspicious person is making me put this up.

388
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:22,629
What kind of person is it anyways?

389
00:28:27,454 --> 00:28:30,036
Should I just start recording it?

390
00:28:30,036 --> 00:28:33,731
If you can, you should. It's better to do this thoroughly.

391
00:28:35,325 --> 00:28:40,021
Perhaps, this won't be harmful to Seung Ji, right?

392
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:49,351
Grandpa said that when you get out of jail, 
people are suspicious of things
 that you have nothing to do with. 
That is the hardest thing.

393
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:54,019
I promised him that I won't be like that.

394
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:56,287
But is it because of Hedgehog?

395
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:59,161
That is the first thing that I think of.

396
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:03,117
Even until now, I've been thinking like that.

397
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:10,360
Hedgehog...
He probably lived all of his life feeling like this.

398
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,067
Yes, I was like that too.

399
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:20,308
I was there for 20 years.

400
00:29:22,397 --> 00:29:25,447
Seung Ji hasn't told you?

401
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:31,335
No, he hasn't. I didn't know at all...

402
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:36,544
I, too, knew people would look at me differently.

403
00:29:36,544 --> 00:29:42,028
Because I knew I would suffer elsewhere, Seung Ji came here.

404
00:29:42,028 --> 00:29:45,195
Seung Ji said Da Yang was his girlfriend and he had to help her.

405
00:29:45,195 --> 00:29:48,539
He lied to Grandpa and me.

406
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:54,226
So, when he first came, he asked me if he could work even without submitting his profile.

407
00:29:54,226 --> 00:30:00,227
Because anywhere else, they would ask for his profile no matter how amazing he is.

408
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:07,904
Before he came here, he probably got cold shoulders and rejection elsewhere.

409
00:30:08,827 --> 00:30:12,347
How pitiful, our Hedgehog.

410
00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:19,920
If Won Il's mother is like that, I'm afraid she might ask him for his profile.

411
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,558
Won Il will probably block her.

412
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,158
That may be the case but...

413
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:31,228
But all the patissiers my father brought with him have criminal records.

414
00:30:35,397 --> 00:30:57,190

415
00:31:05,754 --> 00:31:08,300
What is this?

416
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:20,576
Him, too?

417
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:26,949
You have get the new documents ready.

418
00:31:26,949 --> 00:31:31,534
I understand. I know this is not something I should be doing before the big event!

419
00:31:31,534 --> 00:31:35,986
It's just that I'm in a dire situation.
Yes.

420
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:41,428
I'll see you when you get the documents ready.
I'm sorry.

421
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:46,504
Son!

422
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,266
Son!

423
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:54,657
You go get all of their resumes! And, you
 investigate their backgrounds thoroughly!

424
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:56,272
What do you mean "them"?

425
00:31:56,272 --> 00:32:02,434
The people Ko Seung Ji brought were gang members, weren't they? 
They have tattoos on their hands, arms, everywhere!

426
00:32:03,943 --> 00:32:07,050
What is this? You knew and hid it from me?

427
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:12,571
They are not gang members...  They are patissiers that were praised in the best bakeries.

428
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:15,697
That's not what I mean.

429
00:32:15,697 --> 00:32:18,947
That Grandpa is in charge of them, right?

430
00:32:18,947 --> 00:32:23,952
The way you talk! Can't you be more discreet?

431
00:32:23,952 --> 00:32:27,800
You... Is this something you should say to your mother?

432
00:32:28,974 --> 00:32:33,815
Have you forgotten the disgusting snake tattoo on President Choi's arm?

433
00:32:33,815 --> 00:32:39,157
The tattoo that wouldn't come off even if we invested father's money to try to erase it? Have you forgotten?

434
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:44,733
President Choi can have a tattoo but no other patissier? How is that fair?

435
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:48,447
You really... Are you really going to come out like this?

436
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:56,408
Yes, I will! So, clean up this matter with President Choi and get the house back.

437
00:32:56,408 --> 00:33:03,689
If you don't, I feel like I will make him repay all the money he's embezzled for the last 20 years. 
Because of you, I'm holding back.

438
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:07,223
Embezzling? Who's embezzled?

439
00:33:07,223 --> 00:33:13,563
Should I really bring in the law? If you closed your eyes for him, you know that will be a problem too, right?

440
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:17,450
If you're like this, you'll chase out your mother one day.

441
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:26,646
The mother that is on President Choi's side while pretending to be on my side, the mother who can't throw away her future with President Choi, the mother who is on President's Choi's side and then back on my side!

442
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:34,580
The mother who cannot get ahold of herself. 
Before I am your son, I am Saint Honoré's manager.

443
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:45,211
Now, you're saying you'll chase me out as well?

444
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:50,020
Getting dumped by my own son, huh?

445
00:33:57,362 --> 00:34:25,558

446
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:41,433
I'm laughing because of you.

447
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:45,675
Thanks, Hedgehog.

448
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:52,031
I know. I said I know...that you can't live without me.

449
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:54,752
What is that?

450
00:34:54,752 --> 00:34:59,986
I made it as a new creation. But, for some reason, it's not that good.

451
00:34:59,986 --> 00:35:01,775
It looks good.

452
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:05,073
Eat it.

453
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:11,462
You. You can eat cakes I've made.

454
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:16,375
All of the employees are watching. Eat it.

455
00:35:26,645 --> 00:35:30,625
You eating this cake will revive Saint Honoré's cakes.

456
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,108
You can eat it, Choi Won Il.

457
00:35:32,108 --> 00:35:33,960
Eat it!

458
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,393
The feelings you had about me. When you hated me the most... with that feeling, take a bite out of it.

459
00:35:41,448 --> 00:35:44,734
You can eat it. Here! Eat it!

460
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,120
Cometelo!

461
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:51,584
You can eat it, Choi Won Il! 
Eat it!

462
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:58,125
The feelings you had about me. When you hated me the most... with that feeling, take a bite out of it.

463
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:03,558
You can eat it. Here! Eat it!

464
00:36:03,558 --> 00:36:05,382
Eat it!

465
00:36:08,753 --> 00:36:12,003
Alright. Look forward to it.

466
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:26,663
It'll be delicious.

467
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,482
He ate it? What shall we do?

468
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,398
What?

469
00:36:56,398 --> 00:36:59,427
Because I made a mistake, I gave it to you instead of trashing it.

470
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:01,506
Really, you!

471
00:37:01,506 --> 00:37:05,254
Hey, later, in your office, let's sleep.

472
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:06,590
What?

473
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,377
Without going home, you're sleeping here?

474
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:13,887
For some reason, ideas aren't popping up.

475
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:18,224
Your office is closest to here. I'll borrow your sofa.

476
00:37:18,224 --> 00:37:19,837
Hedgehog...

477
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,362
Huh?

478
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:22,998
I love you.

479
00:37:22,998 --> 00:37:24,755
Gotcha!

480
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:28,679
Hey,

481
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:32,370
So, gotcha!

482
00:37:36,676 --> 00:37:41,017
Hedgehog, when are you coming home?

483
00:37:41,017 --> 00:37:44,285
I'll come home after I make a new product.

484
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:48,156
Wouldn't it better for you to make it at home?

485
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:53,298
Perhaps so, but I'm a little worried to go home now.

486
00:37:53,298 --> 00:37:59,985
I don't know the people, so the progress is slow.

487
00:38:00,922 --> 00:38:02,617
Alright.

488
00:38:02,617 --> 00:38:05,510
You're working hard, our Hedgehog.

489
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:09,722
You're not mad at me for not giving you a call today, right?

490
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:13,281
I just thought you might be busy.

491
00:38:13,281 --> 00:38:17,977
But this is the first time we have ever talked
 this long on the phone.

492
00:38:17,977 --> 00:38:21,174
That's because this is the first time
 that we've ever been apart like this.

493
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,607
Don't you miss me...?

494
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:29,492
I've been looking at the picture on my cell phone all this time.

495
00:38:29,492 --> 00:38:31,428
You aren't looking at other girls?

496
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:34,185
Won Il is the only one in front of my face.

497
00:38:34,185 --> 00:38:35,671
I'm relieved.

498
00:38:35,671 --> 00:38:38,971
Go back to your work, hurry. Even though 
I want to hear your voice more,

499
00:38:38,971 --> 00:38:41,858
it feels like I'm just 
taking up your time.

500
00:38:41,858 --> 00:38:44,950
You're nice, our Pan Da Yang.

501
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:49,134
Take care of our house well. 
I'll be there shortly.

502
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:52,179
Hedgehog, fighting!
One, two, three, go!

503
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:55,950
I want to hear something else.
Ah!

504
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,091
I'll be sleeping in your room.

505
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:01,365
Not that.

506
00:39:01,365 --> 00:39:04,478
Hedgehog, I love you!

507
00:39:05,288 --> 00:39:08,821
Me too, I love you.

508
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:26,124
 Looking for a missing child

509
00:39:26,124 --> 00:39:28,872
Angel House orphanage was closed over 10 years ago.

510
00:39:28,872 --> 00:39:33,902
I went to the missing persons unit. 
They asked me if I was looking for this child.

511
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:39,667
Did they say who took this?

512
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:45,242
Since his grandfather and mother
 are looking for him,
 they asked what my 
relationship is to the child.

513
00:39:45,242 --> 00:39:45,977
So?

514
00:39:45,977 --> 00:39:47,636
So I told them that I'm his uncle.

515
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:51,125
Then they asked me if I'm
 the grandfather's son.

516
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:56,401
I thought he disappeared and died.

517
00:39:56,401 --> 00:39:59,745
It seems that he's been alive all this time.

518
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:02,545
Who are you talking about?

519
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:09,656
Someone who could be a threat to me.

520
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:28,039
Didn't that certificate expire already?

521
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:30,735
Why would it have an expiration date? 
It' not like baked goods.

522
00:40:30,735 --> 00:40:38,634
What do you make here the best that you could show off to others?

523
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:40,511
Everything is delicious.

524
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:43,627
This is the most delicious, I think.

525
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,051
Here.

526
00:41:06,893 --> 00:41:09,364
By the way, Ahjummuni...

527
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:11,588
What do you mean by 'Ahjummuni'?

528
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:13,442
Please take it back.

529
00:41:13,442 --> 00:41:16,247
It doesn't look like you're selling much.
Why don't you just keep it?

530
00:41:16,247 --> 00:41:18,273
Our business is doing very well.

531
00:41:18,273 --> 00:41:20,169
We don't need this kind of money.

532
00:41:20,169 --> 00:41:22,300
What do you mean by "this kind of money"?

533
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,861
We used the best materials to make this bread.

534
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:28,265
Why would you do that? 
It still doesn't taste good.

535
00:41:28,265 --> 00:41:34,463
The reason why you say this 
doesn't taste good is because 
you're used to the cheap ingredients, 
 or chemicals used in baking
 to stimulate one's appetite.

536
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:39,165
I don't think you have ever tasted baked goods made from domestic ingredients.

537
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,694
Why don't you try it?

538
00:41:41,694 --> 00:41:46,756
After you're done eating it, you'll know what really pleases your palate.

539
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:50,411
If this old certificate is still hanging , it means

540
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:53,328
that we're still around for good reasons.

541
00:41:53,328 --> 00:41:55,875
You look like you're old enough to know that.

542
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:58,317
Really...

543
00:42:11,326 --> 00:42:13,545
I should have done it.

544
00:42:13,545 --> 00:42:16,051
That's alright.

545
00:42:17,723 --> 00:42:20,661
Try the macarons Ajumma made.

546
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:23,788
We don't have any special cakes today.

547
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:25,702
I'll enjoy it.

548
00:42:25,702 --> 00:42:28,203
I enjoyed Seung Ji's cake so much,

549
00:42:28,203 --> 00:42:31,759
I came by to say hello.

550
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:33,910
I'm a little disappointed not to see him.

551
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,783
He and his grandpa went to Saint Honore to help out.

552
00:42:37,783 --> 00:42:41,174
Such a large bakery doesn't have enough people? 
How come?

553
00:42:41,174 --> 00:42:45,137
Ah...maybe he was recruited because he's so talented.

554
00:42:45,137 --> 00:42:46,359
For both reasons.

555
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:48,972
Ah, Sung Byun is doing well, right?

556
00:42:48,972 --> 00:42:52,946
His manners have improved a tiny bit, 
thanks to Seung Ji.

557
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:57,018
He talks about you a lot. He says 
that you're a very good looking woman.

558
00:42:57,018 --> 00:42:59,308
He thinks you're very pretty.

559
00:43:00,193 --> 00:43:02,505
He knows what to look for...

560
00:43:02,505 --> 00:43:04,119
Please enjoy.

561
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:06,453
-Thank you.
-Yes.

562
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,583
Did you make any progress with the investigation?

563
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:19,031
I wish I could get hold of something for sure 
about Jang Byung Chun to solve the case.

564
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:22,018
There aren't any real leads, so it's not that easy.

565
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:27,332
So, I was going to search the
 directory listing of the pastry chefs,
 who passed the qualification exam.

566
00:43:27,332 --> 00:43:30,779
I was going to emerge his face by 
comparing with the directory photos.

567
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:34,257
Would you by any chance know 
what year he passed the exam?

568
00:43:34,257 --> 00:43:38,473
He didn't have his certificate until 1992.

569
00:43:39,613 --> 00:43:43,017
Then we have to start looking after 1992?

570
00:43:43,017 --> 00:43:45,828
It doesn't mean that he continued to work at a bakery.

571
00:43:45,828 --> 00:43:50,592
That's right, but I don't have much of an option otherwise.

572
00:43:50,592 --> 00:43:53,620
Kang Eun Bi's mom didn't pay for the bread?

573
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,775
Wow, what in the world...! 
They say that the ones you
 know are more dangerous...

574
00:43:57,775 --> 00:44:01,880
Wait, maybe it wasn't her mom!

575
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,026
Eun Bi was in the front, and she was in the back!

576
00:44:06,026 --> 00:44:07,915
Could she be someone in a top position?

577
00:44:07,915 --> 00:44:11,767
Hey, who could be above Eun Bi?

578
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:16,474
She thinks she outranks everyone in the world.

579
00:44:16,474 --> 00:44:18,008
Saint Honore!

580
00:44:18,008 --> 00:44:19,539
The madam?

581
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:22,438
Why would she come here?

582
00:44:22,438 --> 00:44:24,689
To investigate Grandpa?

583
00:44:24,689 --> 00:44:26,138
Why?!

584
00:44:29,226 --> 00:44:33,973
Are you saying that Saint Honore's owner came to find out something?

585
00:44:33,973 --> 00:44:36,786
What do you mean by that?

586
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:45,853
But, why did she pick on Grandpa's certificate?

587
00:45:12,173 --> 00:45:14,477
This is Cafe Panda.

588
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:16,741
Would you go in there, too?

589
00:45:16,741 --> 00:45:24,241
Ah...this is not even a cafe.
Hey, things are obvious by just 
looking at the customers here.

590
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:29,823
Look to the left and right,
 and the big awkward sign.

591
00:45:29,823 --> 00:45:33,456
There wouldn't be any business
 in a location like this.

592
00:45:33,456 --> 00:45:38,295
Really, someone who lives in
 a place like this wanted Won Il?

593
00:45:40,778 --> 00:45:42,932
When did you come?

594
00:45:42,932 --> 00:45:44,734
Are you leaving?

595
00:45:44,734 --> 00:45:45,620
How do you do?

596
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,376
Who is she?
 She is not Pan Da Yang.

597
00:45:48,376 --> 00:45:52,103
She's Pan Da Yang's sister.

598
00:45:52,103 --> 00:45:55,636
It's not much to see here or there.
They don't look like beggars.

599
00:45:55,636 --> 00:45:56,571
Let's just go.

600
00:45:56,571 --> 00:45:58,299
Yes. Yes.

601
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,974
Instead of calling, it's better to see Won Il in person, right?

602
00:46:03,974 --> 00:46:05,296
Ask him to come here.

603
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:10,760
If you go there, you'll see Seung Ji. He'll be wondering if something happened.

604
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,348
Unni!

605
00:46:13,348 --> 00:46:15,945
Saint Honore's Vice President...!

606
00:46:15,945 --> 00:46:18,283
Ah, there is a customer here. 
I'm sorry.

607
00:46:18,283 --> 00:46:19,613
What about the vice president?

608
00:46:19,613 --> 00:46:21,633
Did she come by here?!

609
00:46:21,633 --> 00:46:23,341
Why here?

610
00:46:23,341 --> 00:46:28,361
She was out front with Eun Bi unni.
 They just left...

611
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:33,178
They left!

612
00:46:38,368 --> 00:46:41,682
Your father is going through things he shouldn't have to.

613
00:46:41,682 --> 00:46:46,034
It's bad enough that he quit working at the bakery.

614
00:46:46,034 --> 00:46:47,832
It's all because of me.

615
00:46:47,832 --> 00:46:52,818
He said he got the name from
 not taking care of his daughter. 
He threw it away, saying what's the
 use of having such a name.

616
00:46:52,818 --> 00:46:57,086
Why don't you get the name back for him?

617
00:46:57,086 --> 00:46:58,625
Please give his profile

618
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:04,647
to the vice president of Saint Honore. 
For Grandpa and Ko Seung Ji.

619
00:47:08,732 --> 00:47:13,513
Won Il, it's me. 
Can you come by today?

620
00:47:13,513 --> 00:47:16,878
Not that I want to hear 
what you have to say so urgently.

621
00:47:16,878 --> 00:47:18,739
It's because I have something to tell you.

622
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:22,203
I have a series of meetings today, 
so I don't think I can come right now.

623
00:47:22,203 --> 00:47:24,750
I'll come by after work.

624
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,748
Alright. I'll see you later.

625
00:47:28,564 --> 00:47:32,603
Is she mad at me?
 Why does she sound cold to me?

626
00:47:45,556 --> 00:47:48,029
President! It's an emergency! 
It's an emergency.

627
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,155
She is your emergency?

628
00:47:52,155 --> 00:47:55,551
She is the CEO of the magzine,  Luxurious Living .

629
00:47:55,551 --> 00:47:59,082
Her husband heads a French 
investment firm in Korea.

630
00:47:59,082 --> 00:48:05,302
Her father-in-law is an owner
 of a famous culinary school. 
Her mother-in-law is
 a famous hotelier.

631
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:06,835
And?

632
00:48:06,835 --> 00:48:09,075
They're known to be very picky eaters.

633
00:48:09,075 --> 00:48:13,460
The best we could do was the status quo.
Most of the time, we couldn't even do that.

634
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,428
We can't refuse to take the
 order because of that either.

635
00:48:16,428 --> 00:48:18,147
What did they order?

636
00:48:18,147 --> 00:48:20,274
The French wedding cake.

637
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:23,808
Her wedding anniversary is coming up.

638
00:48:23,808 --> 00:48:25,904
Not only does she order from us,

639
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:28,741
she orders from all the reputable bakeries.

640
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:32,774
She gives the ratings in her magzine the following month.

641
00:48:32,774 --> 00:48:36,022
We could never even get a one star rating.

642
00:48:39,582 --> 00:48:41,810
 It's really cool!

643
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:42,801
 What's this?

644
00:48:42,801 --> 00:48:44,761
 Is this for a celebration?

645
00:48:44,761 --> 00:48:47,120
 This is a traditional French wedding cake.

646
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,627
 It's Croque en bouche.

647
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:53,120
Ah, are you talking about Croque en bouche?

648
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,433
How would you know that?

649
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,289
If that's what it is, 
Hedgehog knows how to make it vey well. 
Don't worry.

650
00:48:58,289 --> 00:49:04,375
Could he really make it how it's originally made,
according to the French tradition?

651
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:09,185
I heard there are not that many, 
who can make it like that in our country.

652
00:49:09,185 --> 00:49:12,042
Hedgehog is one of those who can do it.

653
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:17,872
As you know, croque en bouche is a very hard thing to make...

654
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:21,176
And right now... We have a lot of delayed orders...

655
00:49:21,176 --> 00:49:24,536
If you call Saint Horone, the best of the best,

656
00:49:24,536 --> 00:49:28,019
you should at least be able to make croque en bouche correctly, right?

657
00:49:35,156 --> 00:49:39,094
Ko Seung Ji patissier makes croque en bouche well.

658
00:49:40,914 --> 00:49:42,417
How are you doing?

659
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:45,033
He is our president.

660
00:49:47,322 --> 00:49:51,885
I heard you made a request for a croque en bouche for a wedding anniversary.

661
00:49:51,885 --> 00:49:58,283
Last year, I tried it and I wanted to know if it improved after a year.

662
00:49:58,283 --> 00:50:01,982
Today, we will make sure to make a great croque en bouche.

663
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:09,629
Since we have visitors coming from France, you have to really.. 
 make them right.

664
00:50:09,629 --> 00:50:11,329
Yes, I understand.

665
00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:13,735
I will take responsibility and prepare them right away.

666
00:50:13,735 --> 00:50:15,822
Is that so?

667
00:50:15,822 --> 00:50:20,180
I guess I will trust you, but the result?

668
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,265
It will be perfect.

669
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,958
I can't make croque en bouche.

670
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:35,351
What do you mean you can't make them? You made them for me last time.

671
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:38,447
When we played the Jin shil game, we ate croque en bouche.

672
00:50:38,447 --> 00:50:39,189
That's right.

673
00:50:39,189 --> 00:50:41,657
That's not real croque en bouche.

674
00:50:41,657 --> 00:50:44,834
It's made based on croque en bouche.

675
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:46,043
What?

676
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,064
Then, why did you say it was croque en bouche?

677
00:50:48,064 --> 00:50:50,403
When did I?

678
00:50:50,403 --> 00:50:53,532
Byeom Bo said that...

679
00:50:53,532 --> 00:51:02,918
Ahh! What do I do? It was a really picky customer. I told her it would be an authentic French croque en bouche and that I was extremely confident! That was why I took the order!

680
00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:07,548
Then, go to Grandpa.

681
00:51:07,548 --> 00:51:09,721
Grandpa?

682
00:51:11,622 --> 00:51:13,680
Grandpa!

683
00:51:22,575 --> 00:51:25,931
You got an order for an authentic French croque en bouche?

684
00:51:25,931 --> 00:51:27,019
Yes.

685
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:28,950
She says her husband is French.

686
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,825
She also said French VIPs are coming.

687
00:51:30,825 --> 00:51:35,321
Not just French people but really well-to-do French people.

688
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:37,160
Okay. I'll make it for you.

689
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,749
Really? For real?

690
00:51:38,749 --> 00:51:40,757
Thank you! Thank you, Grandpa!

691
00:51:40,757 --> 00:51:43,074
Grandfather.

692
00:51:43,596 --> 00:51:48,888
Grandpa, one, two, three, GO!

693
00:51:48,888 --> 00:51:52,200
That surprised me! You guys!

694
00:52:01,137 --> 00:52:03,388
Here you go.

695
00:52:03,388 --> 00:52:08,490
Secretary, I asked you to take me to your father. Why are we here?

696
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:09,546
That's what I would like to know, also.

697
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:13,432
Saint Honore has a culinary school, too. 
But I don't know why he came here.

698
00:52:13,432 --> 00:52:15,123
Are you joking with me?

699
00:52:15,123 --> 00:52:18,097
What should I do when my father's here...?

700
00:52:18,097 --> 00:52:20,112
Is your father really a lawyer?

701
00:52:40,398 --> 00:52:43,899
You don't have to listen to lectures, 
now you can give them.

702
00:52:43,899 --> 00:52:49,352
I should have become a food coordinator in the first place. Instead, I became a lawyer.

703
00:52:49,352 --> 00:52:51,863
Dad, dad?

704
00:52:51,863 --> 00:52:54,581
I think it's your daughter...

705
00:52:54,581 --> 00:52:58,116
Eh. You should have pretended not to hear her.

706
00:52:59,915 --> 00:53:04,824
If I don't pick up the phone, you should know I don't want to work. Why did you come all the way here?

707
00:53:04,824 --> 00:53:08,061
What should I do when she said she'll fire me if she can't see you?

708
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:10,521
Get fired then!

709
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:15,020
If I get fired, will you make arrangements so I can see Choi Won everyday?

710
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,859
Why should I pay attention to your love life?

711
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:20,323
Am I your servant?

712
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:27,118
Enough. Please do her wish properly.

713
00:53:27,118 --> 00:53:29,074
I hate annoying cases the most.

714
00:53:29,074 --> 00:53:31,412
If possible, change your man now.

715
00:53:31,412 --> 00:53:33,102
What about Hedgehog?

716
00:53:33,102 --> 00:53:36,784
He's not my style. And I told you he's dating Da Yang.

717
00:53:36,784 --> 00:53:40,581
Won Il also said you're not his style.

718
00:53:40,581 --> 00:53:44,063
Dad, do you know Won Il?

719
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:50,258
Hurry up and go say, "Yes, the matter you've asked of me is progressing like this, this, this."

720
00:53:50,258 --> 00:53:55,119
Tell her something like this and score some points for me! Dad!

721
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:59,124
Start peeling onion peels.

722
00:53:59,124 --> 00:54:01,501
Open up a shop.

723
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:04,084
What do you mean by that?

724
00:54:04,084 --> 00:54:08,546
I have nothing to say to the chairwoman. If you want to bring someone, bring Won Il.

725
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:12,900
Has the director already started selling Saint Honoré?

726
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,311
Director Choi Jae Gyum is not what he claims to be.

727
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,960
I'm sorry...

728
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:31,473
Father said he was here but no matter how hard I look for him... He's not here.

729
00:54:31,473 --> 00:54:33,451
I wonder where he's gone...

730
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:38,316
Kang Eun Bi, are you guys making a show because you think I can't pay the lawyer fees?

731
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:41,061
No, no. Why would that happen?

732
00:54:41,061 --> 00:54:43,461
It's a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding.

733
00:54:43,461 --> 00:54:47,760
My father has stopped working, so...

734
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,394
It's true!

735
00:54:51,194 --> 00:54:52,896
Is that true?

736
00:54:55,296 --> 00:54:59,600
Then, quickly find another lawyer. I have to meet with one today.

737
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,945
Yes!

738
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,064
Hey, but you know...

739
00:55:05,064 --> 00:55:13,384
the Saint Honoré school without the director...  
Competing with somewhere like this, do you think it'll survive?

740
00:55:13,384 --> 00:55:16,719
Are you going to bring the director back?

741
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:18,633
Oh, wait a minute.

742
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:24,624
Yes, what?

743
00:55:24,624 --> 00:55:26,258
WHAT?

744
00:55:26,258 --> 00:55:29,434
Why did you take that woman's order?

745
00:55:29,434 --> 00:55:31,711
Who took it?

746
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:35,795
How does that Grandpa know how to make croque en bouche? Hang up!

747
00:55:40,329 --> 00:55:44,659
We're going to get a zero star rating again.

748
00:57:26,086 --> 00:57:32,109
Da Yang, going right now is a little inconvenient. Could I stop by after escorting Grandpa home?

749
00:57:32,109 --> 00:57:35,912
We received a really important order and Grandpa is making that right now...

750
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:40,483
No one has left and is watching over him. He's making croque en bouche.

751
00:57:41,149 --> 00:57:46,870
There's barely anyone who knows how to make authentic croque en bouche.

752
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:52,761
The croque en bouche that Hedgehog made is famous. Hedgehog style.

753
00:57:53,378 --> 00:57:56,774
But how is Grandpa making it?

754
00:57:56,774 --> 00:57:59,424
That's why leaving right now is inconvenient.

755
00:57:59,424 --> 00:58:02,035
I'll call you when I leave.

756
00:58:06,133 --> 00:58:11,704
Manager, there's something I should tell you.

757
00:58:11,704 --> 00:58:13,723
Tell me.

758
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:22,119
Is President Choi Jae Geum...not really 
 Choi Jae Geum?

759
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:27,671
I came.

760
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:30,255
I came.

761
00:58:30,255 --> 00:58:31,499
You came?

762
00:58:31,499 --> 00:58:33,720
What are you looking at...?

763
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:38,705
Who has such a great talent?

764
00:58:38,705 --> 00:58:40,929
My father.

765
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:15,723
  Preview

766
00:59:15,723 --> 00:59:19,645
This is all I have of Minwoo.

767
00:59:19,645 --> 00:59:21,723
'' Pan Da Yang Jang Min Ho''

768
00:59:21,723 --> 00:59:24,295
It was Jang Min Ho?

769
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:26,625
I thought it was Choi Min Ho all this time.

770
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:28,720
Why Choi Minwoo?

771
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,567
Minwoo's dad is President Choi.

772
00:59:31,567 --> 00:59:33,342
What neighborhood did you live in?

773
00:59:33,342 --> 00:59:36,473
Ah! Minwoo's mom.

774
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:38,837
What are you saying, aunt?

775
00:59:38,837 --> 00:59:42,643
This is Min Ho's mother, whom you've been searching for so long!

776
00:59:42,643 --> 00:59:45,181
Is that really true?
