1
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:51,388
You should have dodged it! DODGED IT!

2
00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:55,736
Wait a minute, do they say you'll get lucky or 
get into a fight if you get hit in the head?

3
00:00:55,736 --> 00:00:57,692
Why don't you stop right there?!

4
00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:04,146
I stopped, what do you want?

5
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:07,094
What did you do to Da Yang?
Huh?

6
00:01:07,094 --> 00:01:09,660
What did you do to her that
she comes in looking gloomy like this?

7
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,153
Why do you ask me that?!
Can't you just ask her?!

8
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:15,177
You really!

9
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:18,740
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

10
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,787
Hit me, if you know how to.

11
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:23,257
Don't you think I'll do it if you say so?

12
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:24,633
Hyung, don't do that!

13
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:26,348
Get out of the way!

14
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:29,829
You don't know how to beat up people?
Do you want me to show you?

15
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:31,780
Really!

16
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,900
This is not a place for you to be.
Don't come around. Get out.

17
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:41,316
Why do you decide that for me?
Are you the owner here?

18
00:01:41,316 --> 00:01:43,038
Are you the owner's boyfriend?!!

19
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:47,624
Ouch...

20
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:51,058
No matter how hard you try, 
you'll never win.

21
00:01:51,058 --> 00:01:52,836
Stop it right now!

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,064
He told you to stop it and get out!

23
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,771
I have no reason to see you anymore.

24
00:02:03,217 --> 00:02:04,961
Hey, Won Il.
Yeah.

25
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:06,911
See me for a moment.

26
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:21,208
Hyungnim.

27
00:02:22,488 --> 00:02:33,908

28
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:43,112
I...
When will I start working?

29
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:47,662
Why are you talking about that now?
What is Ko Seung Ji to you?
Huh?

30
00:02:47,662 --> 00:02:50,516
Can I start working right away?

31
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:56,767
Do whatever you want.
What did he do to you?
Huh?

32
00:02:56,767 --> 00:03:02,607
I have to know so I can kill him or beat him up...

33
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:08,813
It's hard for me to say this to you.

34
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:14,416
If I start working, would I get paid right away?

35
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,189
What?

36
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:51,690
Wait a minute!

37
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:00,990
Since I just drive...

38
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,265
Ah, so tiring!

39
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:06,606
It's so tiring.

40
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:09,394
I told them to stop. Ah, really.

41
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:11,811
Wait a minute. Wait.

42
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:14,201
I need a minute to catch my breath.

43
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:17,001
Why do you move so fast?

44
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:26,031
Why are you laughing?

45
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:27,981
What did Pan Da Yang say?

46
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:30,334
Does she want to date you?

47
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:37,373
If you really can't talk about it, then,
I'll find him and...

48
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:39,990
He loaned money to me.

49
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,056
Huh?

50
00:04:42,702 --> 00:04:47,235
Does it make any sense for me to
 pay interest in my situation?

51
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:50,153
That was it?

52
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:52,785
Ah, really. I'm getting crazy.

53
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:56,753
Hey, your friend is in a serious situation.
How can you laugh?

54
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,132
Ah, Okay. 
So, how much do you owe him?

55
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:08,855
The cost of the ingredients, painting,
 and his salary up to now.

56
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:13,573
So, I think I'd better start working as soon as possible.

57
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:16,363
Alright, I'll give you all of it. 
 No, I'll give you even more.

58
00:05:16,363 --> 00:05:20,951
I'll give you everything that you need. 
So, don't worry. 
Okay?

59
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,010
You saved our cafe.

60
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,248
What...?

61
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:26,607
Ouch.

62
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:28,079
Are you okay?

63
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,652
Yeah, I'm okay.

64
00:05:31,346 --> 00:05:34,726
What is wrong with you.
Why are you laughing?

65
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:37,701
Of course. I won.

66
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:43,087
In front of the girl, you got knocked down.

67
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:44,719
Is that winning, hyung?

68
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:51,215
You might have saved the cafe, but you've
killed any chance of getting a date.

69
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:55,529
Girls won't date guys like you.

70
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,216
Ko Seung Ji, that punk.

71
00:05:57,216 --> 00:05:59,883
You can't win over him. You'll never win.

72
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:04,786
He has extraordinary skills. He looked cool.

73
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:08,444
Who's side are you on, really?!

74
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,837
I'm on your side.

75
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:14,173
But, who are you?

76
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:20,550
I'm Da Yang's friend, 
and I'm President Choi Won Il's assistant.

77
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,602
Then, why are you doing this to me?

78
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:28,478
Please take care of Da Yang, I'll support you fully.

79
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,440
You started dating Da Yang, right?

80
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,880
That's why you had a fight, right? 
Right?

81
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:45,231
I did not fight.

82
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:48,601
What do you mean you didn't?
I could tell right away you were fighting.

83
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:52,999
Only people who are dating get into fights?

84
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:56,825
Drunks get into fights. 
Jerks with bad tempers get into fights.

85
00:06:56,825 --> 00:07:00,131
Jerks who have an itch to fight get into fights.

86
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:02,632
And chickens fight too.

87
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:08,252
What you're saying is not wrong, but why'd you make that face when I said "dating"?

88
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:14,233
What...about my face?

89
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,209
Not your face, but Da Yang's face.

90
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,247
That was the first time I have ever seen
 her looking like that.
Didn't you feel it?

91
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:25,221
I've never seen anybody like you before.
What are you talking about?

92
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,868
Right! That's it!

93
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:35,903
Da Yang likes you.

94
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:38,382
Wow, that's it, that's it!

95
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:42,267
Congratulations.

96
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:45,054
Congratulations for what?

97
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:55,299
I didn't tell Won Il about...

98
00:07:55,299 --> 00:08:01,879
The president... I don't need to call him president since I don't work at Saint Honore.

99
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:07,710
I don't think you should pay off your debt from Seung Ji oppa with Choi Won Il's money.

100
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,803
Oppa?

101
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:12,760
Hey, he tried to take over the cafe,
 how can you call him oppa?

102
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,571
It's not what Seung Ji oppa said. 
It was said by his friends.

103
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:18,402
It's the same thing.

104
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:21,416
What you say and what Kang Eun Bi 
say are the same then?

105
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,328
What?!

106
00:08:22,328 --> 00:08:27,364
Unni, you asked Choi Won Il to get money
 ready to pay off Seung Ji's debt.

107
00:08:27,364 --> 00:08:29,621
And Kang Eun Bi found out about it.

108
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:35,251
Then, Kang Eun Bi will say Pan Da Yang used
 Choi Won Il's friendship to get money.

109
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:37,565
That's what she'll do.

110
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:39,749
What I'm saying is right, isn't it?

111
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,120
But what does it matter?

112
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,648
Seung Ji oppa's friends could be like that too.
So I'm not going to cut him off.

113
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:55,510
Hey, am I the unni or are you the unni? 
Am I the boss or are you the boss here?!

114
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:03,408
What she said was not wrong.

115
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:14,480
There's nobody who knows Da Yang better than me.
If you just follow what I say, 
it's only a matter of time to get her
 away from Choi Won Il.

116
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,902
What do you have to gain from doing this to me?

117
00:09:18,902 --> 00:09:21,004
Choi Won Il.

118
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:25,875
So you want to use me to get what you want.

119
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,552
I don't say wrong things, so give me
 a call after you consider it carefully.

120
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:36,273
Anytime.

121
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,806
 Saint Honore
Kang Eun Bi

122
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:47,056
Where is noonim and Beom Bo hyung?

123
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,995
Oh, they went out to eat.

124
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:52,316
Hey, who's that?

125
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:54,600
I don't know. She's a strange person.

126
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,551
You'll get caught like that.

127
00:09:57,551 --> 00:09:58,576
By whom?

128
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:02,218
Who else could it be? 
It's the cafe owner. The journalist.

129
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:05,026
Don't even talk about her.
 I have a headache.

130
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:07,689
Did you get dumped?

131
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,400
Where did you learn to say that?

132
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,066
That's what you said to me.
"Did you get dumped by Cherry Blossom?"

133
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:17,003
This is not the time to tease me. 
I'm in a bad situation.

134
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:18,384
You got dumped.

135
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,460
That's enough.

136
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,092
You got dumped.

137
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:22,798
That's enough!

138
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:24,808
You got dumped.

139
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,827
You got dumped.

140
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:34,030
Grandpa...

141
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,838
If a girl is really angry, what should I do?

142
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:38,980
Just beg her.

143
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,371
How can I beg her?

144
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:46,011
There's no way without begging her.

145
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:49,666
Grandpa, you don't even know about women, do you?

146
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:53,518
I'm like this because I'm old.

147
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:57,428
What if you're not old? Well, Jang Dong Geun?

148
00:10:57,428 --> 00:10:59,197
Is that the face?

149
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:04,707
What did you do wrong?

150
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:07,818
I did something that she misunderstood.

151
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:13,223
Look right into her face and explain. 
Explain until she understands.

152
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:15,488
Grandpa, do you really know what you're talking about?

153
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:21,376
I do know. I'm saying this because I know women.

154
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,769
How can I believe you?

155
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,307

156
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:40,110
Let's talk.

157
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:10,048
Does he know what this place is?
How dare he think he can get it!

158
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:13,275
How frustrating!

159
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:05,702
If you pretend to be pitiful,
do you think I'd meet with you?

160
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:32,004
 I'll explain. Whether you get mad or not, give me a chance to explain.

161
00:13:42,307 --> 00:13:45,149
 It's a misunderstanding.

162
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:48,575
 I'm not that kind of person.

163
00:13:55,873 --> 00:14:06,341
 It's true. I wanted to take over this place so I came in.

164
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:29,011
 I can explain everything to you.
You can hate me, get mad at me, do whatever you want.

165
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:41,590
I won't ever forgive him.

166
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:47,595
Don't worry, mom and dad. I won't ever let this house get taken away.

167
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:09,939
All you send is one text?

168
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:17,312
Fine. I'll answer with what kind of level you are.

169
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:27,141
Why are you giving me flowers?

170
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,408
Give it to Panda!

171
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:34,479
Are you crazy?! Why would I?!

172
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,572
It's what people normally do.

173
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:39,500
No thanks!

174
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,075
Ahjumma made this, to give it to Panda.

175
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:47,410
Hurry, deliver it and come back.

176
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,985
I don't want to.

177
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:52,682
There is no place here for Seung Ji ssi to work. Right?

178
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:55,579
No. Of course not!

179
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,709
Aish, really!

180
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:05,129
Do I really have to go this far?

181
00:16:15,598 --> 00:16:18,097
 Patissier needed immediately

182
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:32,196
What are you doing here?

183
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:34,701
I can't believe Seung Ji's fired.

184
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:37,464
You're too empathetic, it doesn't match you.

185
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:40,797
Gosh, she should decide after 
looking at the bank account.

186
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:43,151
Why isn't it?

187
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:47,867
Please come out!

188
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:52,931
They came to the cafe opening, 
and they bought a lot.
Do you remember them?

189
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:56,850
Welcome! Thank you for coming here.

190
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,990
Please have a seat!

191
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,518
We didn't come here today to eat, but to order.

192
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:03,134
Alright!

193
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:05,019
Can it be the same cake as the last time?

194
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:07,137
Yes!

195
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:17,619
When I came back today I'll start looking for a new baker.

196
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:25,196
The cake boss? I wasn't sure about the one I met,
 so I was going to look for one again.

197
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:28,372
Unni, there's big trouble!
Hurry, get down here!

198
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:30,921
Won Il, I'll call you again.

199
00:17:31,393 --> 00:17:34,530
Why, what's up?

200
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,196
Not even fifty, but five hundred?

201
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:41,196
Yes, we're having a class reunion.

202
00:17:41,196 --> 00:17:44,532
This kind of cake is possible, right?

203
00:17:44,532 --> 00:17:47,507
Then, how much is all of that?

204
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:50,628
How much can you give me that for?

205
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:54,782
Our budget is 200. 
So I hope you can match that.

206
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:59,814
Of course we can do it! Why wouldn't we?

207
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:04,493
However, you have to make it the same as last time!

208
00:18:04,493 --> 00:18:12,116
Our dean told us to order the cakes from here after he tasted them. He is a very picky eater.

209
00:18:12,116 --> 00:18:18,020
I'm going to give it to the professors and Sunbaes at school so they I'll be happy for that.

210
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:23,293
Please don't worry! Write down the day of delivery, 
time, and location here.

211
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,418
Oh, hello?

212
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:33,380
Hey, Won Il that won't do, I think nothing will work out here!

213
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,118
Really? What you mean it's not working out?

214
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:44,537
How many patissiers do we have?
I'll discuss it and let you know...

215
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:50,535
What are you going to do with our patissier?

216
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,478
Looks like our boss has received a mass order!

217
00:18:56,478 --> 00:19:01,495
Seems only now, that you know what it takes to be a boss.

218
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:16,248
No, I can't do it!

219
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:21,313
I'm not sure if the president heard it, but since he did.. it's not easy to take out patissiers for you.

220
00:19:21,313 --> 00:19:27,237
Hyung, you can gather up a few patissiers to help out while you're working.

221
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:31,018
When is that day?

222
00:19:31,018 --> 00:19:32,386
Next Saturday.

223
00:19:32,386 --> 00:19:33,610
It won't work out anyway.

224
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,977
Why?!

225
00:19:34,977 --> 00:19:39,842
Starting the early part of the next week, for the next 8 days, I'll be really busy so I can't help you.

226
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,892
Hyung, don't you know other patissiers?

227
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:47,320
Do you think they will be idle?

228
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,342
Ah, really.

229
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:53,816
Hey, what happened with Ko Seung Ji that you're like this?

230
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:56,317
He got fired.

231
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:57,043
What?

232
00:19:57,043 --> 00:20:03,487
Hyung, how many cupcakes do we make for sale daily?

233
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,100
Ah, what should we do?

234
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,533
Hey, can't your family help out a little?

235
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:17,740
Of course I called him! He said he'd call back but I've gotten nothing so far.

236
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:24,111
What will we do?

237
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:29,550
What do mean? You should call Seung Ji oppa.
Is this the time to fool around?

238
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,170
Am I fooling around?

239
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:37,128
Then what is it? It doesn't make sense for the boss to act this way after receiving a mass order.

240
00:20:41,685 --> 00:20:44,923
Hey!

241
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:50,786
No, no, it wasn't me who drew the graffiti.

242
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:54,052
Patissier for hire: me.

243
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:02,333
For sure...
 What do you think, I'm really great right?

244
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,351
Hold on to him!

245
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:05,798
Hurry up and hold on to him!

246
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:17,253
Seung Ji, I'm sorry that I made you unemployed.

247
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:19,374
I'm really sorry.

248
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:26,229
You have nothing to do, nowhere to go...
It's suffocating, right?

249
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,954
Are you teasing me?

250
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,691
You can go to a club, should we go?

251
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:36,975
I really like girls there.

252
00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:44,527
Hold this.

253
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,557
What are you doing here instead of working?

254
00:21:54,557 --> 00:21:56,438
That is,

255
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:59,320
He got fired.
Because of me.

256
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,966
It's not Seung Ji's fault.

257
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:11,592
Were you really planning on eating up the store?

258
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,586
No.

259
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:16,327
Then why did you pay for everything?

260
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:20,301
Because we can't sell cakes without ingredients... 
And....

261
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:22,958
Panda looked pitiful.

262
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,580
Seems like there's more to it.

263
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:30,701
I wanted to make it a proper cake shop,
and move it to a bigger building.

264
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:36,861
And I wanted to win over Saint Honore with my  grandfather.

265
00:22:39,874 --> 00:22:42,620
Can you keep your promise?

266
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,529
Pardon me?

267
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:48,634
Can you keep your promise of making it into a proper cake shop?

268
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:54,113
Of course.

269
00:22:54,113 --> 00:22:56,727
If you can't keep your promise...

270
00:22:56,727 --> 00:23:01,967
If you make her cry -

271
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:07,186
You can't move to a bigger place..

272
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:11,771
that reason
hear it from Da Yang yourself.

273
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,944
What are you doing?
You're not going to follow me?

274
00:23:18,427 --> 00:23:21,026
HURRY UP!

275
00:23:39,848 --> 00:23:42,569
Auntie!!

276
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:46,522
Hedgehog oppa!

277
00:23:46,522 --> 00:23:48,245
Hedgehog's back!

278
00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:49,290
Where's Da Yang?

279
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,996
She went to Saint Honore.

280
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:57,446
She went to go meet Choi Won Il. He said he could help with our big order.

281
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:14,781
Choose the type you want, I'll deliver it for you right away.

282
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:18,669
They asked for it to be the same taste as then....

283
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:22,097
These cakes are much tastier than those cheap ones.

284
00:24:22,097 --> 00:24:24,329
Oh, how many did you say you needed again?

285
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:30,415
500 cupcakes and 1 three layer cake.

286
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:35,121
Don't worry. If you take ours, they'll say thank you.

287
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:42,790
President, you can see that you're mom is here!

288
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,705
 And this can't fall off.

289
00:24:47,705 --> 00:24:50,494
 And order more forks of these kind.

290
00:24:50,494 --> 00:24:53,431
 This is thin, so it works as a knife...

291
00:24:53,431 --> 00:24:55,128
Why? Who is it?

292
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:58,088
No one.

293
00:24:58,088 --> 00:25:00,036
Ah, okay.

294
00:25:02,724 --> 00:25:05,386
Wow, it's nice...

295
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,459
Your cakes are much more expensive than $2500, right?

296
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:13,243
I'll take care of everything, you just worry about receiving the money.

297
00:25:13,243 --> 00:25:14,480
Why??

298
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,547
Just do it.

299
00:25:17,547 --> 00:25:22,591
I don't think that's right... I get paid before I release an article, and that massage chair....

300
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:25,731
Enough with that massage chair talk...

301
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:32,001
I just couldn't straighten my back and you bought me a $8000 massage chair. I bet that if I hurt my leg a little, then you'd buy me a car.

302
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:34,474
Of course I would.

303
00:25:34,474 --> 00:25:39,564
Am I your girlfriend?
Are you my boyfriend? 
Say something that makes sense.

304
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:42,860
Then that Ko Seung Ji guy.
Does that make any sense?

305
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,661
Is he your boyfriend?
Are you his girlfriend?

306
00:25:45,661 --> 00:25:49,472
I knew you first, and I knew you for a longer period of time.

307
00:25:49,472 --> 00:25:52,814
How can you just use someone you don't even know? You don't even know what he's been doing!

308
00:25:52,814 --> 00:25:56,084
Do you not know how dangerous a man can be?

309
00:25:56,084 --> 00:25:58,965
Then, are you a girl?

310
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:02,606
I have my thoughts and ways. I'm using Ko Seung Ji for a good reason.

311
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:04,920
So you already fired him?

312
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,854
You didn't even receive a registration form from him, right? You don't even know his past life!

313
00:26:09,854 --> 00:26:12,963
See? You're so careless!

314
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:17,739
When you hire someone new, you have to receive a registration form and everything!

315
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:21,566
Whether it's a big company or a booger-sized store!

316
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:24,661
Booger-sized store?

317
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:28,755
If your booger is that size, then your nose hole must be the size of Saint Horone!

318
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,680
You know I don't mean it like that.

319
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,094
I won't accept your cake.

320
00:26:33,094 --> 00:26:36,591
Take that massage chair back and I don't want to work for your magazine anymore!

321
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:38,819
Ah, Da Yang.

322
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:42,463
Don't you dare follow me.

323
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:47,890
Aish, why would boogers come into this conversation? Am I crazy?

324
00:26:52,314 --> 00:26:56,288
Oh, Noona! Pan Da Yang noona! 
Noona!

325
00:26:56,288 --> 00:26:58,904
Pan Da Yang??

326
00:27:04,614 --> 00:27:08,773
This guy is bad.
That guy is also bad.

327
00:27:08,773 --> 00:27:12,499
Now what will I do?

328
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:18,251
Ah, Auntie.

329
00:27:18,251 --> 00:27:22,602
Auntie has a present for you. Don't throw it away and hold onto it.

330
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:28,541
If you throw it away again, I'm gonna take it that you don't care about what I think.

331
00:27:30,373 --> 00:27:35,475

332
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:43,836
Ya, without any money what kind of present does Auntie have for me?

333
00:27:57,252 --> 00:27:59,265
Wait a minute.

334
00:28:06,578 --> 00:28:08,725
Tear it.

335
00:28:08,725 --> 00:28:13,401
Since there's only one copy,
if you tear it up it'll be over.

336
00:28:22,474 --> 00:28:25,764
The stuff your friends said is true, right?

337
00:28:25,764 --> 00:28:29,738
Tell me how I can make you believe me.

338
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:32,878
I'll do what you say.

339
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:45,264
First, get on your knees.

340
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,529
If you don't want to, don't.

341
00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:13,361
It's my mom and dad.
Greet them.

342
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:18,553
Hello.

343
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:22,603
In front of my parents...

344
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:25,127
I want you to write an agreement.

345
00:29:25,127 --> 00:29:26,499
Agreement?

346
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:31,818
You said you'd do anything to get my trust again.

347
00:29:31,818 --> 00:29:34,364
Ah, really.

348
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:36,589
What do I write?

349
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:39,695
I, Ko Seung Ji,

350
00:29:44,468 --> 00:29:49,097
will always agree and not complain about Pan Da Yang's orders.

351
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:02,923
If I complain or disobey,

352
00:30:02,923 --> 00:30:06,130
I will give Pan Da Yang all my wealth.

353
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,504
Are you crazy?

354
00:30:07,504 --> 00:30:11,007
What, I can have my wealth stolen, but not anyone else?

355
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:12,685
Ah, it's not like that!

356
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,773
Then write it!

357
00:30:18,304 --> 00:30:22,267
Social number, name.

358
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:39,210
870606?

359
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,154
From now on, call me noona.
Do you understand?

360
00:30:42,154 --> 00:30:43,413
Noona?
Yeah right.

361
00:30:43,413 --> 00:30:47,785
I heard that there was someone who gave up their wealth because they didn't call someone noona...

362
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:51,390
I'll call you everything but noona.
Let's not do this.

363
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,355
Okay.

364
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:57,360
I'm gonna sit now.

365
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,319
I'm going down first.
Do some cleaning and then come.

366
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,850
Ah, she does whatever she wants.

367
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,280
Your wealth is at stake.

368
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:14,392
Ah, really.

369
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:26,684
Dad and mom.
She looks like them.

370
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,592
Ah, it's so pretty.
No wonder, it's Hedgehog.

371
00:31:31,592 --> 00:31:33,909
No wonder, it's Hedgehog, right?

372
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:40,234
If you throw away Auntie's present
 you'll be so dead!

373
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:42,872
Ah, that's right!
What is Auntie's present?

374
00:31:42,872 --> 00:31:47,355
Are you stupid or something?
Hedgehog is the present.

375
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:51,150
You still won't answer me?

376
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,696
AISH!! Mom, this is killing me, please! No more!

377
00:31:54,696 --> 00:32:02,197
Hurry up and answer me!
Who is this Pan Da Yang?
Did you introduce her to your brother?

378
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:04,650
-Say it.
-No.

379
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,871
-Hurry up and say it!
-Ah! I don't know!

380
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:08,270
What's wrong?

381
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,192
Won ll has fallen for this girl.
He's not in his right mind right now.

382
00:32:12,192 --> 00:32:13,557
Who is it?

383
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:16,786
I don't know! 
This wench is not saying anything.

384
00:32:16,786 --> 00:32:20,022
Even if I bribe her with all these checks!

385
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:23,967
Are you really not going to say anything?
I'll give you everything in this wallet. Hurry up and say it!

386
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:27,781
Hey! Hey! This wench!

387
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:32,907
So girls are his Achilles spot?

388
00:32:56,605 --> 00:33:00,999
What's the occasion?
I thought you were too busy to exercise.

389
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:03,974
When I think about it,
I need to increase my strength.

390
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:07,256
Oh, that's right hyung.
Do you know anyone who's good at fighting?

391
00:33:07,256 --> 00:33:11,955
Fighting...? Ah, yeah there is Jinho at our shop. He majored in martial arts.

392
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:13,772
Ah, hyung.
Introduce him to me.

393
00:33:13,772 --> 00:33:17,378
What kind of boss asks to introduce his employee to him?

394
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:21,425
Ah, wait.
Who are you going to fight?

395
00:33:29,534 --> 00:33:33,043
Ah, hyung.
What should I do to relieve the anger from girls like Da Yang?

396
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:34,873
Why is she angry?

397
00:33:34,873 --> 00:33:39,045
Well, I compared her cafe and our store....

398
00:33:39,045 --> 00:33:42,218
Wow, you're piercing your own foot. (Korean saying that you've been backstabbed)

399
00:33:42,218 --> 00:33:45,764
That's not what I meant.
That girl thought it herself.

400
00:33:45,764 --> 00:33:48,903
Then, what do I do to relieve that anger?

401
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:52,690
Who are you going to hit?
Answer me and then I'll tell you.

402
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,458
Who? What do you mean who?

403
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:58,293
Ko Seung Ji again?!

404
00:33:58,293 --> 00:34:00,782
I can't stop you, really.

405
00:34:00,782 --> 00:34:04,572
I answered so answer me now. What should I do?

406
00:34:04,572 --> 00:34:06,412
How would I know?

407
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:08,300
Aish seriously!

408
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:14,032
Oi, grandpa!

409
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:25,976
-Wow... 
 -You're here.

410
00:34:28,258 --> 00:34:30,217
It's good!

411
00:34:30,217 --> 00:34:34,625
I don't know if it will sell.... The customers here usually buy what they usually buy.

412
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,092
So...

413
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:41,133
this handsome Ko Seung Ji will definitely sell it for you.

414
00:34:42,842 --> 00:34:45,592
Now you can make cakes as much as you want.

415
00:34:45,592 --> 00:34:47,650
It's a good thing you guys made up, right?

416
00:34:49,025 --> 00:34:50,842
Well, yeah.

417
00:34:50,842 --> 00:34:52,425
But...

418
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:53,475
where did grandfather go?

419
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:55,597
He went shopping with Beom Bo.

420
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:58,633
I was going to borrow his car....

421
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:01,746
They just left.

422
00:35:04,192 --> 00:35:07,350
We'll need a car too, right?

423
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:10,842
W-w-why?

424
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:15,587
It was very nice to hear the word "we."

425
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,842
Why bother hiding something that isn't much?

426
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:39,092
With the $500...

427
00:35:39,092 --> 00:35:42,383
I was wondering if it could pay for the ingredients...

428
00:35:42,383 --> 00:35:44,317
Let's go.

429
00:35:44,317 --> 00:35:45,741
To the ingredients store?

430
00:35:45,741 --> 00:35:47,718
Not all stores are ingredient stores.

431
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:51,592
Why a car store?

432
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:54,383
We'll get more orders and stuff in the future.

433
00:35:54,383 --> 00:35:56,467
We should have a car too, right?

434
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:58,850
So we're really buying a car?!

435
00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:02,392
You were speaking so harshly and informally to me, what's with the sudden formality?

436
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:04,842
Are we really going to buy a car?

437
00:36:04,842 --> 00:36:06,931
I feel bad making your aunt come everyday...

438
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,093
And I don't think it's right to continuously borrow my gramp's car.

439
00:36:09,093 --> 00:36:12,109
So you're going to get interest from me like that again.

440
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:13,912
Says someone who ripped up the paper...

441
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,000
So you didn't rip it!

442
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,200
I tore it to shreds!

443
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:21,641
You didn't rip it!

444
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,225
What is this.

445
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:29,758
You will stop fooling around, that's an order!

446
00:36:29,758 --> 00:36:31,991
Why did you take a picture of this? Stop carrying it around.

447
00:36:31,991 --> 00:36:34,835
In case you don't follow Panda's orders.

448
00:36:34,835 --> 00:36:37,550
Ooh~ That car is nice! Don't you think?

449
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,273
Oh this one too!

450
00:36:39,273 --> 00:36:41,065
It's pretty!!!

451
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,967
What do you think about this one?

452
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,485
I'm good with all of them!

453
00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:50,742
How about we buy her a car?

454
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:55,230
The topic about buying her a car is what brought up the 'Are you my boyfriend?' fight.

455
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,449
What did you think?

456
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,667
Oh yeah, I forgot.

457
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:03,053
Oh, and you, why aren't you at Da Yang's right now?

458
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:06,762
She's mad at you...
 I thought it would make things worse if I went....

459
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,185
How is she going to take care of that big order?

460
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:14,558
Let's go to Cafe Panda first!

461
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:16,776
You guys can't continue on in this awkward relationship, hmm?

462
00:37:19,425 --> 00:37:21,278
Ah, I think today is my birthday...

463
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:24,869
Really?!

464
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:27,633
No, I'm saying I'm in a good mood as if it is my birthday!

465
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:28,809
Oh, that's what you meant..

466
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:31,966
If it really was my birthday, what were you going to do for me?

467
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:33,331
Bake you a cake, duh.

468
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:34,270
That's it?

469
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:39,758
That's it?! Are you kidding me? I bought you a car, made you a cake, what else do you want?

470
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,758
Good point.

471
00:37:41,758 --> 00:37:43,700
Hah... I'm in a good mood..

472
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,899
Our car is great, don't you think?

473
00:37:46,899 --> 00:37:48,523
Yeah, but...

474
00:37:48,523 --> 00:37:51,678
Maybe we bought a car that is too cheap....

475
00:37:51,678 --> 00:37:56,755
If we are going to put it in front of a cake shop, it has to be kind of 'bling bling' and pretty...

476
00:37:56,755 --> 00:37:59,692
We can always make it pretty!

477
00:38:12,058 --> 00:38:14,114
He can't think of an idea...

478
00:38:15,225 --> 00:38:18,492
Well, you guys are staring at me so intently...

479
00:38:18,492 --> 00:38:20,408
How will I get an idea?

480
00:38:20,408 --> 00:38:22,192
It's okay!

481
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:23,611
Be confident about it!

482
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:26,879
And if you can, make it FAT!!!!

483
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:30,898
Hey, let's leave him alone so he can draw in peace...

484
00:38:30,898 --> 00:38:32,903
I wanna see you draw!

485
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,862
Come on, let's go upstairs! Let's go! Go, go, go!

486
00:38:40,603 --> 00:38:43,851
 Maculinea teleius.

487
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:48,694
 Aspidomorpha transparipennis.

488
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:54,364
 Rhyssa persuasoria.

489
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:58,049
 Homotropus tarsatorius.

490
00:39:02,964 --> 00:39:05,101
It's done.

491
00:39:12,928 --> 00:39:15,983
OMG It's so pretty! 
I know right?

492
00:39:15,983 --> 00:39:19,349
It's so pretty! It looks like a real panda!

493
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:21,282
It is a real panda.

494
00:39:25,317 --> 00:39:26,735
Yeah it's so tasty!

495
00:39:28,176 --> 00:39:29,352
Let's go that way.

496
00:39:30,347 --> 00:39:31,275
Oh.

497
00:39:31,275 --> 00:39:33,861
Are you guys going somewhere?

498
00:39:39,037 --> 00:39:42,593
Is he wearing a cast on his neck or something? 
He isn't looking as sharp as before.

499
00:39:42,593 --> 00:39:47,889
Won Yi, while you were riding your oppa's car, since he kicked(?) you, you must be pissed.

500
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:50,137
Don't even talk about it..

501
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,265
Do you want dad to buy you a car?

502
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,231
REALLY?!

503
00:39:54,231 --> 00:39:56,992
Let's go buy one when you come back. Where are you guys going?

504
00:39:57,946 --> 00:40:01,855
To meet one of hyung's friends. Be back in a flash!

505
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:03,360
Hyung! Wait for me!

506
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:17,112
Oh? What's this?

507
00:40:22,027 --> 00:40:25,191
Ah! Hedgehog hyung must have bought it!

508
00:40:53,747 --> 00:40:56,396
If you're jealous, you lose..

509
00:41:09,978 --> 00:41:11,320
He doesn't even look.

510
00:41:22,972 --> 00:41:24,692
You lose if you're jealous?

511
00:41:25,905 --> 00:41:27,404
Okay...

512
00:41:29,422 --> 00:41:32,035
Aish, my hands still smell like a dirty wash cloth...

513
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:38,897
Oh! A hedgehog shape!

514
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:42,110
This? 
 Yeah it is! 
 I don't think so...

515
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,649
And this is a panda!

516
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:45,925
Ah don't buy this!

517
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:48,193
Oh a heart that will bring two lovers together?

518
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,396
Do we need to buy anything else?

519
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,700
Oh I love this!

520
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,800
No no no no! 
 Ah, but we need to buy more! 
 No more, no more! Come on let's go!

521
00:42:15,722 --> 00:42:17,950
Our Panda is really pretty, right?

522
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,009
Of course! I made it with a lot of care! Of course it's pretty!

523
00:42:21,009 --> 00:42:23,845
It's very pretty. It stuck on well.

524
00:42:23,845 --> 00:42:24,785
Get in the car.

525
00:42:24,785 --> 00:42:26,225
Yes.

526
00:42:40,964 --> 00:42:42,236
Won Il.

527
00:42:42,236 --> 00:42:44,007
Say hi, this is Jinho.

528
00:42:44,007 --> 00:42:45,883
Oh, hello.

529
00:42:45,883 --> 00:42:47,671
-Hello. 
-Ah, yes.

530
00:42:52,331 --> 00:42:54,176
Don't laugh.

531
00:44:35,928 --> 00:44:38,040
KYAA!!!! BUG BUG BUG BUG BUG!!!!! KYAA!!!!

532
00:44:39,897 --> 00:44:42,166
KYAAA!!! BUG BUG BUG BUG!!!! I HATE BUGS!!!!

533
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:43,572
What's wrong?

534
00:44:43,572 --> 00:44:44,645
COCKROACH!!!

535
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:46,602
I hate cockroaches the most!

536
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:48,599
Why would cockroaches start popping out of nowhere?

537
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:50,834
Especially when we have this big order coming up?

538
00:44:50,834 --> 00:44:52,623
Aish! It's Gil Dong Goo who did this!

539
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,166
What?

540
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:56,014
How do you know?

541
00:44:56,014 --> 00:44:58,401
Look at the panda over there!

542
00:45:14,926 --> 00:45:16,423
Why?

543
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:18,226
There's more in here as well?

544
00:45:18,226 --> 00:45:20,510
Since the ingredients have been opened...

545
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,675
We can't use these anymore...

546
00:45:22,675 --> 00:45:24,631
It's not like the cockroaches went into them!

547
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:26,970
We still can't!

548
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,893
I can't do cruel stuff like that.

549
00:45:44,621 --> 00:45:46,631
Hey Da Na! What are you doing here?

550
00:45:46,631 --> 00:45:49,637
I'm chasing a human cockroach.

551
00:45:49,637 --> 00:45:50,396
What?

552
00:45:50,396 --> 00:45:52,623
Gil Dong Goo released a bunch of cockroaches in the kitchen...

553
00:45:52,623 --> 00:45:56,805
So we might not be able to deliver our order!

554
00:45:56,805 --> 00:45:59,855
This Gil Dong Goo really...!

555
00:46:00,807 --> 00:46:04,530
But why are they like that?

556
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:08,183
The exterminators told us to get out while they work.

557
00:46:08,968 --> 00:46:09,949
This guy really!

558
00:46:09,949 --> 00:46:12,331
Hey! Let's go hunt down Gil Dong Goo!

559
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:15,401
This Gil Dong Goo I will really...!

560
00:46:16,392 --> 00:46:20,846
You're thinking, " I should've just asked Saint Honore, " right?

561
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:26,832
It's much easier to do that than to do it at grandpa's.

562
00:46:26,832 --> 00:46:30,869
We can do it at grandpa's kitchen today. And tomorrow, we can do it at our kitchen again.

563
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:33,783
By doing that, we can get the order in.

564
00:46:35,424 --> 00:46:40,730
I don't know if I can do it because all of
our ingredients became useless.

565
00:46:43,339 --> 00:46:44,690
Aish, really...

566
00:46:46,218 --> 00:46:48,810
Let's call Choi Won Il.

567
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:53,161
We have no time to linger around like this.

568
00:46:55,686 --> 00:46:59,685
One, two, three, go...

569
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:07,131
One, two, three, go!

570
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:09,667
Go?

571
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:11,474
Go!

572
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:22,725
So you're saying the problem is that
our oven is too small, right?

573
00:47:22,725 --> 00:47:28,149
And it will take some time for us to imitate your flower decoration for the cupcake, too.

574
00:47:28,149 --> 00:47:31,205
Which department ordered them?

575
00:47:31,205 --> 00:47:32,979
The English department.

576
00:47:32,979 --> 00:47:35,245
Let's do it!

577
00:47:35,245 --> 00:47:36,847
Oh, right?!

578
00:47:36,847 --> 00:47:39,765
You and your sister could help, too, right?

579
00:47:39,765 --> 00:47:41,145
Of course!

580
00:47:41,145 --> 00:47:42,954
But we don't really know how-

581
00:47:42,954 --> 00:47:45,927
You just have to know how to press.

582
00:47:49,253 --> 00:47:53,046
Maculinea teleius.

583
00:47:53,046 --> 00:47:56,919
Aspidomorpha transparipennis.

584
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:33,072
It stretches so well!

585
00:48:33,072 --> 00:48:34,927
You're not supposed to press that hard.

586
00:48:34,927 --> 00:48:37,260
Da Na, that...

587
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,379
So my cake will turn out like that?
- That's right.

588
00:48:41,263 --> 00:48:43,738
It's really pretty!

589
00:48:44,696 --> 00:48:45,743
 What's that?

590
00:48:45,743 --> 00:48:47,344
It's a decoration.

591
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:49,614
It's so cute!

592
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:03,031
 Mozzarto

593
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:19,642
Why aren't you sleeping?

594
00:49:19,642 --> 00:49:23,371
Switch with me. You should get some sleep.

595
00:49:23,371 --> 00:49:24,836
It's alright.

596
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:29,249
You have to rest in order to work more tomorrow.

597
00:49:30,731 --> 00:49:31,798
Okay.

598
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:34,050
Go rest. I'll wake you up.

599
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,971
Alright.

600
00:49:51,873 --> 00:49:54,009
Noonim!

601
00:49:55,752 --> 00:49:57,879
I love you!

602
00:50:41,487 --> 00:50:42,427
What?

603
00:50:42,427 --> 00:50:45,707
It's been a long time since I've heard you sing.

604
00:50:45,707 --> 00:50:48,330
It's been so long since the last time I worked.

605
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:50,260
It's all thanks to Seung Ji.

606
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,074
Yeah.

607
00:50:51,074 --> 00:50:55,787
That Seung Ji is so annoying! Making people do stuff...

608
00:51:35,201 --> 00:51:37,485
It's done!

609
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:40,393
You finished it?!

610
00:51:40,393 --> 00:51:42,724
Really? YAY!

611
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,460
You finished it!

612
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,746
You've worked hard!

613
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,597
It's hot in here...

614
00:52:08,193 --> 00:52:11,287
Hyungnim! Noona!

615
00:52:25,722 --> 00:52:30,430
Everyone's looking, you won't hug me or something like that, right?

616
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:37,290
Who said Cafe Panda was worse than Saint Honore?

617
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:41,974
Who said our cake was worse than Saint Honore's?

618
00:52:45,186 --> 00:52:48,113
Thank you, Hedgehog.

619
00:52:49,505 --> 00:52:51,499
Let's eat out! Let's eat out!

620
00:52:51,499 --> 00:52:53,087
Call, call! (Call=deal)

621
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:56,289
 Mozzarto

622
00:52:56,289 --> 00:52:59,002
Cheers!

623
00:53:08,775 --> 00:53:10,378
B-Boss!

624
00:53:10,378 --> 00:53:11,708
It's okay! It's okay!

625
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:14,248
Right?!

626
00:53:14,248 --> 00:53:17,011
You are sleeping here tonight!

627
00:53:17,011 --> 00:53:19,613
Another glass!

628
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:22,162
Here! More!

629
00:53:22,162 --> 00:53:24,621
Give me more!

630
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:25,360
I'm going to get wasted today.

631
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:30,204
 One shot! One shot! One shot! One shot!

632
00:53:33,298 --> 00:53:38,249
Grandpa! Because of you and noonim, I am so happy!

633
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:40,577
Go to sleep.

634
00:53:40,577 --> 00:53:43,418
Why?! I like it!

635
00:53:43,418 --> 00:53:46,722
Go to sleep you punk!

636
00:53:46,722 --> 00:53:51,697
Go to sleep! I can't go to sleep because of you...

637
00:53:51,697 --> 00:53:53,948
What's the problem? We love each other!

638
00:53:53,948 --> 00:53:56,227
Grandpa! Kiss! Kiss!

639
00:53:56,227 --> 00:53:59,254
Please!

640
00:54:05,346 --> 00:54:07,084
 I said I love you!

641
00:54:07,084 --> 00:54:10,350
 Let me sleep...

642
00:54:23,946 --> 00:54:26,988
Choi Won Yi!

643
00:54:26,988 --> 00:54:30,570
What's up with you today that made you get up so early?

644
00:54:31,623 --> 00:54:33,746
Good morning Hyung!

645
00:54:33,746 --> 00:54:35,979
My eyes just shot open today!

646
00:54:35,979 --> 00:54:38,495
Maybe I'm getting mature... I was drowning in my thoughts...

647
00:54:38,495 --> 00:54:40,410
What were you thinking about?

648
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:46,090
Cafe Panda's cakes are all so lively... 
But why do all our cakes seem so dead?

649
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,363
Did something happen yesterday?

650
00:54:48,363 --> 00:54:49,632
No.

651
00:54:49,632 --> 00:54:53,583
Well, we safely delivered the order... Had a mini-party...

652
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:59,176
I suddenly wanted to become a patissier....

653
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:02,593
I wanted to become a patissier like Ko Seung Ji...

654
00:55:19,586 --> 00:55:22,507
Boss, we need to decide on what to display in the magazine.

655
00:55:22,507 --> 00:55:24,963
Should I book a conference?

656
00:55:24,963 --> 00:55:27,946
Have you gone to Cafe Panda?

657
00:55:27,946 --> 00:55:30,838
I haven't gone ever since.

658
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:34,841
Can you tell Da Yang to cover my item?

659
00:55:34,841 --> 00:55:35,831
What?

660
00:55:35,831 --> 00:55:37,688
A certain patissier named Ko Seung Ji.

661
00:55:37,688 --> 00:55:39,852
Go Seung Ji?

662
00:55:47,373 --> 00:55:49,847
Please eat well.

663
00:55:50,797 --> 00:55:53,223
What is Choice Cream Cake?

664
00:55:53,223 --> 00:55:59,447
It's a cake where you can choose what to put on it and we make it right away.

665
00:55:59,447 --> 00:56:02,469
It's a new recipe on our menu. It's good, you should try it.

666
00:56:02,469 --> 00:56:03,833
Then I'll take that.

667
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:06,699
Could the topping be blueberry and raspberry?

668
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:09,816
Yes, thank you. We'll make it right now.

669
00:56:11,112 --> 00:56:12,398
Whoa! 
 -You came?

670
00:56:12,398 --> 00:56:15,215
Why are there so many customers?

671
00:56:15,215 --> 00:56:18,179
Ko Seung Ji came back. That's why.

672
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:19,363
Go Seung Ji?

673
00:56:19,363 --> 00:56:21,275
Yeah, look there.

674
00:56:21,275 --> 00:56:25,753
Maculinea teleius.

675
00:56:25,753 --> 00:56:29,175
Aspidomorpha transparipennis.

676
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:35,211
Rhyssa persuasoria.

677
00:56:36,332 --> 00:56:39,876
Homotropus...

678
00:56:40,668 --> 00:56:42,632
He was here a moment ago. Where is he?

679
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:44,876
We need more cakes...

680
00:56:44,876 --> 00:56:47,598
Then that guy from before, his name is Ko Seung Ji?

681
00:56:47,598 --> 00:56:51,079
Yeah. Eun Bi, wait here, let me just find Seung Ji.

682
00:56:56,149 --> 00:56:59,778
Why does boss want Ko Seung Ji?

683
00:57:04,179 --> 00:57:06,794
Homotropus...

684
00:57:33,636 --> 00:57:34,287
 War?

685
00:57:34,287 --> 00:57:37,321
 He was about to beat up the manager...

686
00:57:37,321 --> 00:57:38,623
 It's not a time that you can come in at!

687
00:57:38,623 --> 00:57:40,112
 I'm going to hold a meeting soon.

688
00:57:40,112 --> 00:57:42,332
 You two must attend.

689
00:57:42,332 --> 00:57:45,702
 He's trying to get the CEO to get out.

690
00:57:45,702 --> 00:57:46,827
 Why is he doing that?

691
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,800
 I think it's because he's sick of him.

692
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,100
 Grudge.
- What's wrong with him?

693
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,400
 I chose the wrong one.

694
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,500
 She must have a lot of grudges against things like me.

695
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,100
 You met your ill-fated relationships because you are tied to them.

696
00:57:57,723 --> 00:58:01,145
 It's hard for me.

697
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,100
 Because I don't know what's going to happen now.
