00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:48,897
 Episode 11

2
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:53,470

3
00:01:02,344 --> 00:01:05,269
You know everything we did last night, right?

4
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:10,399
Alright, you continue to keep your mouth shut like that, ok?

5
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,202
Here, it's your morning coffee.

6
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:20,940
It's delicious, right?

7
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,637
It's particularly delicious.

8
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:36,628
When did you come?

9
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:39,061
What did you do last night?

10
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:13,576
The repetition in my head

11
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:15,717
is not getting erased.

12
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,115
What are you repeating?

13
00:02:19,744 --> 00:02:21,381
Huh?

14
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:28,685
If I couldn't sleep because of all your tossing and turning during the night,
wouldn't it be a courtesy to tell me?

15
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:35,008
Alright...it's something you have to know, so I'll tell you.

16
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:38,946
What's the answer? Is it Mi Ra unni, Won Il, or Cook Gil?

17
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:40,921
Hedegehog oppa?

18
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:43,152
Let's leave out Hedgehog.

19
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:46,742
By the way, what's Hedgehog up to?

20
00:02:46,742 --> 00:02:50,586
He went out with the little hedgehog who was here yesterday.

21
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:56,647
Where did he go without telling me?
He should've brought me along too.

22
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:02,404
Girls who call guys!

23
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:05,751
Do you think he went out to work with him?

24
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:08,843
Do you think he went out to play then?

25
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:16,091
Where are you going?

26
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,570
To my past.

27
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,608
To where I used to live when I was young.

28
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:27,492
Why are you going there?

29
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:32,299
Because you're the first customer who didn't like my cake.

30
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:39,746
Hey, what did you eat that you're so prickly?

31
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:41,673
Tasteless things.

32
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:52,671
Hedgehog, I'm going to clean your room from now on. You got it?

33
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:54,058
Why?

34
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:56,321
Why did you get startled?

35
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:59,589
Did I get to you? How come? What did you do together?

36
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:01,901
Why is Hedgehog's room changed so much?

37
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:05,630
Why are you here instead of working...?

38
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,556
I came here to work, but I have to collect the evidence first.

39
00:04:09,943 --> 00:04:14,876
Stand there like that. Smile, smile.

40
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:19,241
Come over here, hurry. Smile.

41
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:25,632
Why is your vice president investigating me and Hedgehog?

42
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:30,043
The first reason: She cannot let someone like Pan Da Yang have Choi Won Il.

43
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:31,496
"Someone like me"?

44
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:36,465
You have no choice even though it may hurt your feelings. 
Mothers from his background are like that.

45
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:38,663
What's the second reason?

46
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:41,602
She has to find out Ko Seung Ji's identity.

47
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:43,932
Why Hedgehog?

48
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:46,578
It's because he turned everything upside down!

49
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:50,923
Mina promoted your macarons instead of ours!

50
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,045
You can just explain everything. 
Why did you come to investigate?

51
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:57,209
Why explain? It's better to pretend not to know.

52
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:02,215
And, is it better to have the vice president get involved,
 or have me talk to you like this?

53
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:05,679
Won Il's mom is so fussy!

54
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:09,697
She's not trying to do something bad to Hedgehog, right?

55
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:13,388
Would our Won Il leave it alone then?

56
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:20,264
But...your concern for Hedgehog seems so natural.

57
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:26,406
We started.... dating officially.

58
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:30,919
Omo! That's great, girl!

59
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:36,042
It's the best thing that you have ever done in your life for me! Oh, good job. Good job.

60
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:40,303
But, I have something to tell you about our relationship.

61
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:44,462
When Won Il comes, I'll say it in front of everyone.

62
00:05:44,462 --> 00:05:47,180
What is it that you're being like this?

63
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,885
Are you perhaps... pregnant ?!

64
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:57,125
Are you crazy?! We only kissed once. How could I be pregnant?

65
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,781
Oh my, you guys kissed already.

66
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:04,032
Was it good? Did you like it?

67
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,752
Yea.

68
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:11,962
I wish me and Won Il could kiss or something.

69
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:20,585
But what's with your facial expression?
Are you saying your lips are the only lips?

70
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,597
Your lips... are lips too.

71
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,901
Should I sue for slander?

72
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:33,828
What is a slander?

73
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:38,082
A secret method that will make that man mine.

74
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:40,004
A secret method?

75
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:02,344
Why is he looking at you like that all of sudden?

76
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:06,188
He probably doesn't know yet.

77
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:35,069
Mom was seriously asking me, if I'm able to run this business.

78
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:39,189
Why all of a sudden? Did she have a fight with her husband?

79
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:44,409
Whatever the reason, since the opportunity presented itself, we should bring mom to our side.

80
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:51,092
She makes us talk about how to bring her to our side. What kind of mother would do that?

81
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:56,486
Hyung, without Choi Jae Kyum, could you be responsible for Saint Honore?

82
00:07:56,486 --> 00:08:00,952
It's not that easy. We don't know how the others will react.

83
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:04,604
They will quit?

84
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,661
Just remember one thing...

85
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:12,497
You have to do it after you find replacements, get it?

86
00:08:12,497 --> 00:08:13,432
Yeah.

87
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:15,697
In return, find out as soon as possible.

88
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:19,371
How many will quit, and what's the circumstance like for getting replacements.

89
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:21,027
Okay, I got it.

90
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:24,094
What did you find out about Choi Jae Gyum?

91
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:30,785
They said there wasn't really anything, 
so I asked them to find out a little more. 
But try not to expect anything.

92
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:33,775
Then, should I ask a private investigating firm to do the job?

93
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:36,219
It's not that I didn't think of that either

94
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:40,157
But sometimes, they sell the information.

95
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:45,018
So let's not do it that way. You might end up getting fired.

96
00:08:56,637 --> 00:09:01,012
You really are doing all the pretty things.

97
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:14,346
Does that really go down your throat?

98
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,822
Of course, it goes down my throat. Would it go down my nose.

99
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:21,193
Why are you all behaving this way to me?

100
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:22,866
What do you mean "all of you"?

101
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:26,814
Your son is turning everything around in the kitchen all of a sudden.

102
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:29,690
And the wife is as unpleasant as she could possibly be.

103
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,415
I spent so much money

104
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:36,264
to get the macaron business, and you know how high my blood pressure got.

105
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:41,233
How could you do this?

106
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:43,513
What you want me to do then?

107
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:45,424
If the macaron makeup advertisement gets popular,

108
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:47,565
we can then spread our advertisement everywhere.

109
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:50,559
Just look at her like that...

110
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,767
Just eating dirty like that and doesn't even care.

111
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:58,474
Do you want me to live like the girls you go out with?!

112
00:09:58,574 --> 00:10:02,024
Wasn't that a mistake that you did?

113
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:13,018
Hey, Yi Na Gyung.

114
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:15,720
What is your waist measurement?

115
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,575
Your waist, what is the measurement?

116
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:20,761
It is 24 inches

117
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:22,381
What about you, the new one?

118
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:26,065
Me too, 24 inches

119
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:29,279
Is it you guys?

120
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,438
What are you saying you want to do?

121
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:33,882
You want to see everyhting turn upside down?

122
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:35,765
Sit,

123
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:38,608
before you really see everthing being turned upside down.

124
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:49,293
Your director only wears long sleeves in the mid summer even if it'll kill him.

125
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:53,171
Do you know why? I won't fire you if you do know, but I'll fire you if you don't.

126
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:57,409
That's...because he has a tattoo of a snake on his arm.

127
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:00,885
So you know it's that of a snake.

128
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,335
I don't think he was ever naked in front of the others.

129
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:11,091
That's just a rumor developed among the kitchen staff.

130
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:14,457
I heard it was a burn formed when working

131
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:16,876
We heard it from Mr Jang.

132
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:20,472
So he wants to hide behind Mr Jang.

133
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:24,680
Hide yourself well, I can see the tips of your hair.

134
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:29,461
I'm not sure what you are saying.

135
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:34,654
Of course, you guys wouldn't have started this.

136
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:38,907
Just remember that I'm watching you guys closely.

137
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:41,009
Yes.

138
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:55,350
Why? Your insides are bothering you?

139
00:11:56,243 --> 00:11:59,099
It's because I feel wronged and angry.

140
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:04,285
It's one thing to frame someone, and another to treat someone like your slave.

141
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:09,020
You feel better by making me look like poop in front of those employees?

142
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:11,816
If you get caught,

143
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:17,289
you'll get out with nothing, like when you first came.

144
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:23,464
How can I leave the same way I came in? I don't have Min Woo.

145
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:46,422

146
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:53,969
Get down.

147
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:55,712
Do I really have to get out?

148
00:12:56,746 --> 00:12:58,744
Yup.

149
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:10,951
One Heart  Animal Shelter

150
00:13:19,443 --> 00:13:22,616
These days you never ask about her.

151
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:25,564
Why is it so quiet?

152
00:13:26,587 --> 00:13:31,160
"I don't like Min Woo. 
I wish Min Woo wasn't here."

153
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,867
Don't tell me you forgot how many times you told me that.

154
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:37,344
You promised not to talk about that.

155
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:40,915
That's when I was still living with you.

156
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:46,101
When I am on the verge of being kicked out after being framed, do you think I would still keep my promise?

157
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:49,560
So, that's how you're going to be.

158
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,459
Who started this first?

159
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:57,104
After volunteering for 20 years and growing Saint Honore this much, you say,

160
00:13:57,104 --> 00:14:01,687
"My son came back. My son does not like you. So, now you are out.

161
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:04,898
Get out"

162
00:14:04,898 --> 00:14:09,232
Fine, I'll leave. However, my son Min Ho

163
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:11,696
because of Hwang Yong Im,

164
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:17,389
because of Choi Won Il, he was kicked out. So compensate him for living poorly for the last 20 years.

165
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,597
What?

166
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:22,498
After giving the compensatiion fee and alimony to Min Ho's mother all at once,

167
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:25,177
what more do I need to compensate?

168
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:26,661
Are you stupid?

169
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:30,301
Do you think money from 20 years ago is still the same money now?

170
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:35,384
Is the Saint Honore from then, the same Saint Honore now?

171
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:37,727
Paying the price

172
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:41,025
according to the economy is the basic thing one can do.

173
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:46,235
If the owner Madame doesn't even know that,

174
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:49,173
it's only makes sense for that person to give up the title of "owner".

175
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:52,844
Isn't that right?

176
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:04,331
There should be nothing good from seeing the end of me, Hwang Jung Rye.

177
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:13,783
If I don't step on this chance now,

178
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:18,115
these restless situtations will never stop.

179
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:21,932
Soon, I'm going to flip over this place so,

180
00:15:21,932 --> 00:15:24,945
go on a vacation and investigate something for me.

181
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:26,190
About what?

182
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,089
Orphanage

183
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:29,330
Orphanage?

184
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:33,588
Going well?

185
00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:35,922
Searching here and there,

186
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:39,382
is it good?

187
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,116
Did Won Il come from the orphanage?

188
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:45,129
What?

189
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:49,380
Because you told me to investigate the orphanage...

190
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,132
With that "smart" head of yours,

191
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:56,531
don't think and do the things I tell you to do. 
Got it?

192
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:57,824
Yes.

193
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:00,948
Aigo, really.

194
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:05,141
It's so dirty.

195
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:16,575
Umm.. I came to get confirmation for the next magazine article.

196
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,136
Where did Ms. Kang Eun Bi go for Ms.Park Ha Na to do this?

197
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:21,854
She is running an errand for Madam President

198
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:27,081
Do you remember that we have a appointment with Ms. Park Ha Na?

199
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:32,029
She was told to go to Cafe Panda and investigate Ko Seung Ji and Pan Da Yang.

200
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:33,905
What investigation?

201
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:38,918
Why Mina praised Ko Seung Ji's macaron in the interview.

202
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:43,928
Although investigating is my specialty, the Madame President doesn't know that.

203
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:45,941
Specialty?

204
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:51,364
I don't know whether or not I have luck with men, 
but all the men I have dated were cheating on me with two or three other women.

205
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:55,120
So after meeting up with so many investigators,

206
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,601
it resulted in the birth of a female Sherlock Holmes.

207
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:07,430
You know I swore loyalty to you, so if you give me something to investigate, I can assure it will be kept a secret.

208
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:12,267
I'll take care of it, so would you like to see?

209
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:13,915
Take care of what?

210
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:16,374
What you desire.

211
00:17:16,374 --> 00:17:18,282
Huh?

212
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,345
Let's rest before continuing.

213
00:17:41,345 --> 00:17:45,089
Hey. Are you tired from just lifting half of this?

214
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,950
Do you want to stay here for just 3 days?

215
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,204
Why?

216
00:17:49,204 --> 00:17:52,089
Because then you won't say anything tastes bad anymore.

217
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:55,867
Then, have you stayed here for 3 days before?

218
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,108
Three years.

219
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:05,486
Why?

220
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:08,388
Because the food people would not eat,

221
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:12,184
they shared with me.

222
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:48,880
Maculinea teleius.

223
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,992
It was very similar to where I live.

224
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:54,710
Why didn't we go to that place then?

225
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,473
It's gone

226
00:18:56,473 --> 00:18:58,454
Why?

227
00:18:58,454 --> 00:19:00,622
Gangsters broke it up

228
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:03,122
because they waanted the land.

229
00:19:03,122 --> 00:19:05,082
And?

230
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:07,294
And,

231
00:19:08,936 --> 00:19:12,324
they all went to heaven.

232
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:15,515
 Ahjumma! 
Even those kind dogs that gave me food.

233
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:18,386
 You can't die like that. Please get up. 
And the one who took care of me.

234
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:20,277
Even the ahjumma.

235
00:19:20,277 --> 00:19:24,491
But what about you?

236
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:26,783
I was in school.

237
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:33,274
Because of the ahjumma, for the first time I went to school.

238
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:41,463
Hyung, you didn't have family?

239
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:43,655
I don't have any.

240
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:47,567
Ahjumma and the dogs were my family.

241
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:53,154
Your family died but, you didn't do any thing?

242
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:56,653
I went after the gangsters and did exactly the same thing.

243
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,821
And?

244
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:02,968
I was sent to the juvenile detention.

245
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:08,205
You didn't notify the proper authorities?

246
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:13,129
I came out of the juvenile detention, but I was dying of anger.

247
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:17,225
So I reported to the police, but they were not on my side.

248
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:20,053
And then?

249
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,099
I went nuts at the police station.

250
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:27,783
And from that day on I went back to the life I used to live in.

251
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,780
Don't make that face.

252
00:20:49,177 --> 00:20:51,038
Look, it's Hedgehog.

253
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:59,134
Hey, nice to see you

254
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,798
What a coincidence that we arrive at the same time.

255
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:02,732
Where are you coming from?

256
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:04,721
Me, bathroom.

257
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,882
Go, and then come back

258
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:10,145
I thought he meant he went and came back from the bathroom. Who's that?

259
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,312
A customer.

260
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,793
Anyways, what's that?

261
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:19,199
Food that noonim packed for you and Pan Da Yang

262
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:23,133
Prepared for a couple when you guys are not even a couple.

263
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:24,836
Why is it so hot.

264
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:27,885
What's the matter?

265
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:32,069
You, you guys became a couple?

266
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:33,606
Yah, that's right.

267
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:36,116
Yah, when did this happened?

268
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:39,741
- Talk.   
 - Did you kiss?

269
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:42,197
- Kissed?     
- Did you kiss or not? - From when?

270
00:21:42,197 --> 00:21:43,419
Did we kiss?

271
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:46,330
We didn't, we didn't

272
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,954
Without Hedgehog's permission, I shouldn't have told you this, but

273
00:21:57,954 --> 00:22:01,308
the reason I told you about his past is

274
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:05,068
to ask all of you to help him.

275
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:08,676
Is there any unresolved problem?

276
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:12,044
That's not it.  Because of a problem with the husband of Grandpa's daughter

277
00:22:12,044 --> 00:22:17,188
because of Grandpa's daughter's ex-husband.

278
00:22:17,188 --> 00:22:20,054
What's there to worry about if it's about the ex-husband?

279
00:22:20,054 --> 00:22:26,848
I think it's serious. That's why I don't know if they will ask around or not.

280
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:29,890
It's natural for an ex-criminal to be suspected first,

281
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,427
so Hedgehog might be suspected .

282
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:37,176
Yea. That's why if detectives do happen to come...

283
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:38,857
No need to worry..

284
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:43,188
I will definitely protect Hedgehog.

285
00:22:43,188 --> 00:22:45,756
So, don't worry about a thing.

286
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,673
Thank you!

287
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,878
Da Na, why are you crying?

288
00:22:54,897 --> 00:23:01,321
Because, the life Hedgehog oppa lived was so sad.

289
00:23:01,321 --> 00:23:04,289
Da Yang and we will help him.

290
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:08,288
We just need to help Hedgehog from now on.

291
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:12,079
That's right, he needs to stop living like that and

292
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,648
he just needs to be happy from now on.

293
00:23:15,648 --> 00:23:21,447
Noonim, choosing Hedgehog instead of my hyung was the right thing to do.

294
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:28,895
You need that secret method too!

295
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:31,306
Why me?

296
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:36,111
It's a method for you and Hedgehog to live together forever happily, so just write one.

297
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:40,250
I'm telling you this specifically because it's you and Hedgehog.

298
00:23:41,664 --> 00:23:43,543
I understand.

299
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:46,198
Thanks.

300
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,252
-Aish... 
 - They definitely kissed!

301
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,531
Why does the face of someone who went to the restroom look like a dog that needs to poo?

302
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:59,411
Did you stop mid-way?

303
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:04,551
About the detectives...don't worry.

304
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:08,002
What detectives?
What is he talking about?

305
00:24:08,002 --> 00:24:11,434
Y-you said he was a customer... 
 How does he know about the detectives?

306
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:15,294
Then...your dad that bought the cake was...

307
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:17,279
Yes.

308
00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:21,319
Boss!

309
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:24,674
Hedgehog, you're already back.

310
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,296
But... why are you guys all standing?

311
00:24:30,296 --> 00:24:34,746
Because you have become Pan Da's boyfriend, we wanted to properly congratulate you.

312
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:36,373
Congratulations.

313
00:24:36,754 --> 00:24:38,992
Yeah.

314
00:24:38,992 --> 00:24:40,631
Applause!

315
00:24:40,631 --> 00:24:47,457
Applause! No, no! Three cheers for Hedgehog!

316
00:24:56,804 --> 00:25:00,421
Da Na, why are you crying?

317
00:25:01,662 --> 00:25:06,227
It's because I'm so happy that you and Pan Da are now dating.

318
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:13,811
Hello.

319
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:17,193
Hello! 
 Hello!

320
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:19,121
Oh.. why have you guys come?

321
00:25:19,121 --> 00:25:24,056
I'm just so hungry that I thought I would die, and they...

322
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:28,815
Because I have decided to date Seung Ji, I came to tell Grandpa.

323
00:25:28,815 --> 00:25:31,490
Oh, really! Okay.

324
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:36,381
As for me...whenever I see Hedgehog Oppa, tears keep forming, so I just came along.

325
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:37,757
You did well.

326
00:25:37,757 --> 00:25:40,153
You guys came well, you came well.

327
00:25:40,153 --> 00:25:43,330
Your bodyguard has arrived.

328
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,188
Who are you?

329
00:25:44,188 --> 00:25:45,885
Gil Dong Gu ahjussi.

330
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:48,756
That troublemaker, Gil Dong Gu?

331
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:51,215
I don't cause trouble anymore, grandpa.

332
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,394
Don't say grandpa.

333
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:55,979
Grandfather. (formal)

334
00:25:56,428 --> 00:25:58,707
Okay, have a seat!

335
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:06,474
Maculinea teleius 
 (Go-un-jeong-bagi Pu-reun-bujeom-nabi)

336
00:26:06,474 --> 00:26:09,383
Aspidomorpha transparipennis
 (Mo-sigeum-jara-nam Saeng-i-ip-beol-le)

337
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,003
Rhyssa persuasoria
 (Song-got-beolle-sali Nam-jak-maepsi-beol)

338
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:16,168
Homotropus tarsatorius 
 (Eoli-deunge-sali Mung-tuk-maepsi-beol)

339
00:26:16,168 --> 00:26:18,789
Homotropus tarsatorius 
 (Eoli-deunge-sali Mung-tuk-maepsi-beol)

340
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,320
Hedgehog!

341
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,339
What are you making?

342
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:07,801
Check the text message on my phone.

343
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:10,960
What kind of text is it?

344
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,377
When I eat with my dad, I thought everything would taste good...

345
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:22,284
But my dad's been so busy, so he hasn't had time to eat with me in a long time.

346
00:27:22,284 --> 00:27:28,092
Because my dad likes rice cakes the most, please make a cake that is like rice cakes

347
00:27:28,092 --> 00:27:30,796
so that while he's eating it, he will forget about all the things he is busy with.

348
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:35,168
So that while he's eating it, I can see him as much as I want.

349
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:40,139
Instead of hearing the words "I'm busy", so that I can talk to him about many things.

350
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:43,200
Please make that kind of cake for me.

351
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:51,532
Ah, so that's why he said your cake wasn't good... 
 Because he thought that if he was here he would be able to see his father.

352
00:27:53,994 --> 00:27:58,750
So, a cake made with rice cakes that you can eat for a long time (takes a long time to eat)...
 You're going to make that kind of cake?

353
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,551
Then..croque en bouche?

354
00:28:02,304 --> 00:28:04,531
So, you are a reporter specializing in cakes.

355
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:09,479
Of course, that's right! 
 Oh, right, let's set this aside for now and talk about us.

356
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,911
About us?

357
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:17,585
Us, we dont need a cake...having enough is plenty

358
00:28:17,585 --> 00:28:22,462
You're doing great...
Telling a patissiere that there's no need for cake.

359
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:26,543
You know what I meant!

360
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:37,476
Hedgehog, we're alone here and there is no one around now, and...

361
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:39,908
How about we kiss?

362
00:28:40,223 --> 00:28:44,217
Instead of that, go wash your mouth now! Didn't you eat garlic?

363
00:28:44,217 --> 00:28:48,226
How was I supposed to know?! Grandpa kept telling me to eat it...

364
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:55,409
Who are we? What to tell others?

365
00:28:55,409 --> 00:29:02,650
We make the best cakes in the world, and we were born this way!

366
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:15,463
How is it?
I'm so useful these days, right?

367
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:16,671
Yes!

368
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:21,373
I'm leaving.

369
00:29:50,517 --> 00:29:51,962
President.

370
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:54,931
What's all this?
Why are you posting all this up here?

371
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:58,457
This is all the Director's doing, he told us to put these up on all the windows...

372
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:00,668
Take them all down, right now.

373
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:02,942
Taking care of these won't be enough...

374
00:30:02,942 --> 00:30:04,447
Go inside and take a look.

375
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,385
Is he crazy...

376
00:30:10,385 --> 00:30:13,097
Why can't you understand what I'm saying?!

377
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:14,621
L-l-look at them....

378
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:18,559
What are you doing right now?

379
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,934
We're not making an advertisement video.

380
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:21,249
Then, what's this?

381
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:26,550
We're recording as evidence. That way if there's a problem, we'll know who to blame.

382
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,340
Do you want to take the blame?

383
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,464
Mom.

384
00:30:31,464 --> 00:30:36,741
Didn't you come in here to start a fight?

385
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:39,936
Hurry up and record everything.

386
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,824
Right there, thats good.

387
00:30:42,824 --> 00:30:44,575
Take them down right now.

388
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:46,767
Don't you know that this will cause problems?

389
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:51,622
If there's a problem, we can just solve it, so what's the big deal?

390
00:30:51,622 --> 00:30:54,977
What are you guys doing not working? Hurry up.

391
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:56,463
You don't have tape?

392
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:58,312
This is illegal.

393
00:30:58,312 --> 00:31:02,929
Stealing someone else's face and using it to advertise us...what is the reason for us having to do this?

394
00:31:05,128 --> 00:31:08,488
That is how I made this place grow.

395
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:12,252
So therefore we have to just keep doing it this way...

396
00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:17,835
Whether it is a person or a store, if they change, they usually die in one shot.

397
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:21,998
Then there may be no choice to see if we go in one shot or not, but to change.

398
00:31:21,998 --> 00:31:25,679
Remove the poster and go back to your positions.

399
00:31:29,797 --> 00:31:32,524
So now even you guys are teaming up against me?

400
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:38,350
We're not teaming up against you, it's that we've decided to give strength to Won Il.

401
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:42,855
You've grown a lot.

402
00:31:42,855 --> 00:31:50,016
You always told me that you can't do anything without me and kept asking me about the smallest things and...

403
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,835
Now you're saying you even make decisions by yourself now.

404
00:31:53,835 --> 00:31:57,417
Please watch your words. Is that something you can say in front of her son?

405
00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:03,283
A bastard like you who doesn't know how to respect your father is talking about courtesy 
between mother and son?

406
00:32:03,283 --> 00:32:05,592
Get out!

407
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:08,829
Get out?

408
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:13,894
You should know the conditions for me leaving.

409
00:32:13,894 --> 00:32:18,912
I'll fulfill that condition, so get out. 
 However, in return...

410
00:32:18,912 --> 00:32:20,475
In return, what?

411
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:23,408
I'm going to give it to Minho and Minho's mother directly.

412
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,210
What did you say?

413
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,765
What? You think I won't be able to find them?

414
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:42,922
What happened to you?

415
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:47,227
Mom doesn't even know..where Minho is..

416
00:32:47,227 --> 00:32:49,754
What are you talking about right now?

417
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:54,210
Choi Jae Geum's son. The kid that I lost....

418
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:59,359
Now's not the time to talk about that. I told you not to do anything until I was ready.

419
00:33:23,215 --> 00:33:27,582
Prepare yourselves. Today might be fine, but tomorrow...

420
00:33:27,582 --> 00:33:34,136
I already hired a patissier for the next 3 days. Since I hired a patissier during their vacation, there is nothing that can be done after that.

421
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:38,435
After that, you guys need to take care of it yourselves.

422
00:33:44,213 --> 00:33:48,251
From now on I'll try to look for some patissiers, and you, manager Kang, take care of...

423
00:33:48,251 --> 00:33:50,692
Yeah, I got it.

424
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:15,081
What?

425
00:34:15,677 --> 00:34:18,963
Minho...do you know where he is?

426
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:20,773
I don't know.

427
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:22,937
You really don't know?

428
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,169
Yes...

429
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,451
Shouldn't you be worrying about your younger sibling, Won Yi?

430
00:34:31,451 --> 00:34:33,758
Not talking about Minho...

431
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:38,247
You know that I'm the one who lost Minho...

432
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:44,111
Let's say that you didn't lose him... 
 Do you think that kid would have lived just fine with us?

433
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:48,116
I'm pretty sure his father would have kicked him out again.

434
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:52,720
I was hoping he wasn't that kind of man..

435
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,726
I kept telling myself that he's not that kind of man, he's not that kind of man...

436
00:34:57,726 --> 00:35:02,060
But, he's someone who can do worse things.

437
00:35:02,742 --> 00:35:06,708
So, you should just forget about Minho too...it's not your fault.

438
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:09,696
If you have that kind of time, then just take care of Won Yi.

439
00:35:10,784 --> 00:35:12,309
Hedgehog?

440
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:17,841
He's in the middle of making rice cake, so it would be hard to talk.

441
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:20,626
Why would you need a patissier?

442
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:26,007
Then what will you do?

443
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:32,180
All the patissiers already left, so why should I go to the park in the middle of the night?

444
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,947
There's a recipe to make patissiers return too?

445
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:42,430
That's why the more these situations occur, I need to support Won Il.

446
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:48,803
So in this company I'm the only one who...

447
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:54,854
Of course I don't know. Do you think I tried it yet?

448
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:59,135
And...what do you mean by why? I'm doing it because I think it is better than not doing it.

449
00:35:59,748 --> 00:36:03,156
Never give up, don't you know that?

450
00:36:04,905 --> 00:36:06,184
Fine.

451
00:36:06,184 --> 00:36:10,418
I know it's not that my language grades were good, it was only my language grades were good.

452
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:14,783
So, get Hedgehog ready. . .

453
00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:18,448
And Hedgehog can make a cake concept for Won Il.

454
00:36:18,448 --> 00:36:23,468
We just... need to get him here and be ready.

455
00:36:24,536 --> 00:36:30,137
Why do you keep telling me to do that and not do that?

456
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:32,460
Why are you telling me to choose only one?

457
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:35,491
Okay.

458
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:36,938
See you later.

459
00:36:39,312 --> 00:36:42,869
She's so frustrating. I don't know why Hedgehog likes her.

460
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:45,357
Can't you just bring Hedgehog?

461
00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:47,136
What is she saying again?

462
00:36:47,136 --> 00:36:48,283
What?

463
00:36:48,283 --> 00:36:50,672
As a patissier in Chairman's stead.

464
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:52,519
Kitchen work isn't very easy.

465
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:55,303
But Hedgehog is the guy that beat the President's macaroons

466
00:36:55,303 --> 00:36:58,724
and has the ability chosen by Mi Na.

467
00:36:59,422 --> 00:37:00,708
That's it!

468
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:02,562
There was also that way.

469
00:37:04,814 --> 00:37:05,993
Here.

470
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:09,969
Tell us if your father likes them.

471
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:11,189
Okay?

472
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:12,323
Promise.

473
00:37:15,591 --> 00:37:18,536
Come anytime if you have a cake you want to eat.

474
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,989
Yes.

475
00:37:20,241 --> 00:37:24,579
Hey, shouldn't you say something affectionate as you say goodbye?

476
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:27,536
He stayed up all night just to make that.

477
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,069
I'll send you a message.

478
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:34,779
What kind of goodbye do you send via message?

479
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:36,130
Look at him...

480
00:37:41,919 --> 00:37:43,600
Let's see.
What does it say?

481
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:48,920
Some grandpa came to watch you and noona affectionately, and

482
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,609
before, this noona went to the park at 6:30

483
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:53,983
to meet a man named Won Il.

484
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:57,867
As if we didn't know he was a detective's son.

485
00:37:58,725 --> 00:38:00,124
What a scary kid.

486
00:38:02,235 --> 00:38:03,280
Is the detective cake already done?

487
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,424
Did the detective come?

488
00:38:04,748 --> 00:38:09,584
The detective cake came out well and the small detective just left.

489
00:38:09,584 --> 00:38:10,533
What?

490
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:12,556
That kid came again?

491
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,450
Why did we run?

492
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:16,867
Won Yi,

493
00:38:16,867 --> 00:38:20,499
is it alright for you to be here?

494
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:22,715
Why? Can't I be here?

495
00:38:25,451 --> 00:38:27,712
No. Just. . .

496
00:38:28,385 --> 00:38:30,120
Won Il called.

497
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,790
The Chairman left with all the patissiers.

498
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:35,719
Why?

499
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:39,308
Because of the photoshopped picture of Mina and the macaroons,

500
00:38:39,308 --> 00:38:41,472
he had a big fight with Won Il.

501
00:38:41,472 --> 00:38:43,808
Is Won Il alright?

502
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:45,011
I don't know.

503
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:51,000
He didn't tell me that. And the only important thing now is how to make cakes.

504
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:56,031
It won't be easy to get a patissier.

505
00:38:56,412 --> 00:38:59,528
Won Il doesn't seem to know.

506
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:04,687
I shouldn't tell him, right?

507
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:12,741
Is there anything we can help with?

508
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:19,192
Though it's not our fault, but I think it all started with our macaroons.

509
00:39:21,962 --> 00:39:23,776
Let's think about it.

510
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,486
Why isn't she coming out?

511
00:39:58,543 --> 00:39:59,885
What are you doing?

512
00:40:00,401 --> 00:40:01,513
Oh my!

513
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,901
What are you hiding?

514
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:11,444
Can't you just close your eyes just this once?

515
00:40:11,444 --> 00:40:12,870
What is it?

516
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:16,673
What's this?

517
00:40:16,673 --> 00:40:18,821
Why are you touching someone else's undies?!

518
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:20,668
Are we strangers?

519
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,057
Why are you stealing your boyfriend's underwear?

520
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:27,541
Because... Eun Bi told me to bring them.

521
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:28,838
What?

522
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:30,796
Why did Eun Bi tell you to bring my undies?

523
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:34,051
That's because...

524
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:37,386
Hurry up and answer.

525
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:41,162
Eun Bi was in hurry and...

526
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:45,742
If we do that, it can give the boyfriend strength and we will never break up.

527
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:49,122
That's why I want to do it too.

528
00:40:49,122 --> 00:40:50,386
What?

529
00:40:50,938 --> 00:40:52,879
I'll buy you prettier ones.

530
00:40:52,879 --> 00:40:55,300
That's why, just let me use this.

531
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,723
Please?

532
00:40:56,823 --> 00:40:59,442
Then how is Eun Bi planning on bringing Won Il's undies?

533
00:40:59,442 --> 00:41:00,364
Is she going to take it off him?

534
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,010
Probably not...

535
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:15,412
Why is my life this hard?

536
00:41:15,412 --> 00:41:17,956
It's not like I can say, "I'll give you new underwear, so give me your old ones."

537
00:41:17,956 --> 00:41:23,214
Or, I can't just take off his panties.

538
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,764
Oh..........

539
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:29,644
Oh no. I must be going crazy.
What kind of perverted things am I saying?

540
00:41:29,644 --> 00:41:31,826
If Won Il hears this,

541
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:33,205
I'll be in big trouble.

542
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:34,833
Ah, scared me....

543
00:41:54,782 --> 00:41:57,365
Is there something you want to say to me?

544
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,031
No.

545
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:02,136
From before, you kept lingering outside of my room...

546
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:04,205
Tell me. What is it?

547
00:42:05,312 --> 00:42:06,980
Well, thats,

548
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,691
umm.. so...uhh..you see...

549
00:42:09,691 --> 00:42:12,429
Da Yang and...

550
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,134
Da Yang and what?

551
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:19,061
I got an idea during a conversation with Da Yang,

552
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:20,605
but how about filling the President's spot

553
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,476
by giving it to Hedgehog?

554
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:24,008
What do you think?

555
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:29,829
Do you not like it because Da Yang and Hedgehog are dating?

556
00:42:31,044 --> 00:42:34,080
Just think about it carefully.

557
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,240
It's not like I didn't think of that already,

558
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,008
but then what about Cafe Panda?

559
00:42:38,008 --> 00:42:40,528
It's just getting started.

560
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:44,435
Cafe Panda,

561
00:42:44,435 --> 00:42:51,260
has the help of Grandpa's workers, if Hedgehog does the most important things first.

562
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:54,962
Try speaking with Hedgehog personally.

563
00:42:54,962 --> 00:42:56,304
Preferably...

564
00:42:56,304 --> 00:42:57,926
tomorrow?

565
00:42:58,381 --> 00:43:00,312
Why preferably tomorrow?

566
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:05,003
Hedgehog said today...

567
00:43:05,003 --> 00:43:10,013
he is busy delivering a ricecake cake or something.

568
00:43:17,922 --> 00:43:21,787
Hey, just looking at this...

569
00:43:21,787 --> 00:43:24,057
and go get it from there, got it?

570
00:43:24,057 --> 00:43:24,967
Sunbaenim.

571
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:26,619
Your son came.

572
00:43:31,577 --> 00:43:34,951
Why is it so grand?

573
00:43:34,951 --> 00:43:36,889
Can I try one?

574
00:43:42,832 --> 00:43:44,812
It's really good.

575
00:43:46,451 --> 00:43:47,784
One more.

576
00:43:51,163 --> 00:43:56,562
Hey, but why is there cake inside this ricecake?

577
00:44:04,126 --> 00:44:09,404
 Because I didn't know what kind of ricecake your dad liked, so it was made using different fillings.

578
00:44:09,404 --> 00:44:13,706
 Also I think the things you want to say are of a wide variety too.

579
00:44:13,706 --> 00:44:18,006
 If he eats something different, I think he'll stay with you longer.

580
00:44:18,006 --> 00:44:24,861
 But Sung Bin, even if your dad says he's busy and he needs to go, understand him.

581
00:44:24,861 --> 00:44:27,632
 I know it's hard sometimes but,

582
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:30,982
 being a detective is a very difficult career.

583
00:44:30,982 --> 00:44:35,957
 So don't be disappointed, and cheer your dad up,

584
00:44:35,957 --> 00:44:41,154
 and eat all the food your dad buys with his hard-earned money deliciously.

585
00:44:41,154 --> 00:44:43,669
 And remember the school you hate to go to,

586
00:44:43,669 --> 00:44:46,867
 may be a wish for other kids out there that want to go but can't.

587
00:44:46,867 --> 00:44:50,813
 If you dont listen, I'm going to take you back to that place we went to...

588
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:55,556
 and make you stay there for 3 days, got it? Fighting~

589
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:00,418
That's right.

590
00:45:00,418 --> 00:45:03,657
I'll keep in mind

591
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:05,044
that the hyung you like is Ko Seung Ji.

592
00:45:06,678 --> 00:45:07,566
Here, you eat one too.

593
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,290
Here.

594
00:45:13,229 --> 00:45:14,792
Drink your beverage.

595
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:57,700

596
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:03,744
Why is this girl not coming out and always doing this to me?

597
00:46:03,744 --> 00:46:05,915
Come here quickly!

598
00:46:11,528 --> 00:46:12,976
What is this?

599
00:46:12,976 --> 00:46:14,095
Is it for washing it?!

600
00:46:14,095 --> 00:46:17,025
Why did you come out when don't understand anything?!

601
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:19,741
To make them stronger!

602
00:46:19,741 --> 00:46:21,428
You're going burn the briefs?

603
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:26,775
That's right!  Set the fire on right and...waaa

604
00:46:28,062 --> 00:46:31,082
Is that why you told me to bring water?

605
00:46:31,082 --> 00:46:34,328
Why don't you just do it in our yard where there is a faucet?

606
00:46:34,328 --> 00:46:37,765
Ah, I didn't think of that.

607
00:46:38,459 --> 00:46:42,048
Then, Hedgehog will see it!

608
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:48,591
Hedgehog knows.

609
00:46:48,591 --> 00:46:54,978
He must really likes you.  I'm envious.

610
00:46:55,457 --> 00:46:58,874
Anyway, how did you obtain Won Il's briefs?

611
00:46:58,874 --> 00:47:03,261
How did I obtain it?  I can't steal them.  I can take them off him.

612
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:05,904
So...

613
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,204
 Choi Won Il 
Ta da!

614
00:47:12,722 --> 00:47:15,766
Stop laughing!  I'm nervous about this.

615
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:18,843
If Won Il finds out about this...

616
00:47:18,843 --> 00:47:23,373
Let it go, it's a little bit...

617
00:47:25,173 --> 00:47:26,463
 Choi Won Il

618
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:44,695
This is an age-old traditional secret method.

619
00:48:08,173 --> 00:48:12,418
-But I have to do it too?
-Follow me, hurry.

620
00:48:16,111 --> 00:48:19,446
Follow me, quickly!  Right, left, right.

621
00:48:27,343 --> 00:48:28,995
What's the matter?

622
00:48:28,995 --> 00:48:32,424
Hyung, the chair feels like it is heating up?

623
00:48:32,424 --> 00:48:35,386
Probably because you've been sitting on it for so long.

624
00:48:35,386 --> 00:48:37,795
Could that be why?

625
00:48:41,405 --> 00:48:43,452
No, that's not it.

626
00:48:44,032 --> 00:48:47,179
Stop thinking about silly things.

627
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:50,642
What are you going to tell Won Yi?

628
00:48:50,642 --> 00:48:54,494
Ah hyung, do you know about Jin Shil game?

629
00:48:54,494 --> 00:48:58,336
It's the game where a man and a woman see each other's hearts.

630
00:48:58,336 --> 00:49:00,042
Oh, it's that kind of game.

631
00:49:00,042 --> 00:49:03,192
Ah, I thought you have to tell the truth.

632
00:49:03,192 --> 00:49:05,084
Why sudden interest in Jin Shil game?

633
00:49:05,084 --> 00:49:10,449
Kang Eun Bi talked about Notting Hill, and playing games like Brownie Time and Jin Shil.

634
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:13,121
I was going to talk to Won Yi then.

635
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:16,913
Wouldn't it be better for aunt to speak to her?

636
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,082
It sure is difficult.

637
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:25,060
Sir!

638
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:28,995
You did well.

639
00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:32,018
Did you pack everything I asked you to?

640
00:49:32,018 --> 00:49:35,287
But what are you doing with all those stuff, dad?

641
00:49:35,287 --> 00:49:38,187
Your dad's life.

642
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:41,047
Because you put your life in to such a tiny thing your life blew up.

643
00:49:41,047 --> 00:49:42,794
That's enough.

644
00:49:42,794 --> 00:49:44,100
What is your mom doing?

645
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,469
You told me to pack up while she is asleep.
Probably she is sleeping.

646
00:49:47,469 --> 00:49:50,411
Mom and Won Il hasn't said a word?

647
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:54,118
Who did you fight with?  With mom or hyung?

648
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:55,030
With both.

649
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,086
Geez! For how long would you leave home?

650
00:49:58,086 --> 00:50:00,157
Until things go back to how they used to be.

651
00:50:00,157 --> 00:50:01,056
Between husband and wife?

652
00:50:01,056 --> 00:50:05,062
No, before Won Il came back.

653
00:50:05,786 --> 00:50:06,797
What?

654
00:50:06,797 --> 00:50:08,382
That's not right, dad.

655
00:50:08,382 --> 00:50:11,110
What is not right about it?

656
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:14,414
You stop being childish now, and get your act together.

657
00:50:14,414 --> 00:50:18,244
If not, you'll lose your share to Won Il.

658
00:50:18,244 --> 00:50:20,508
You don't share the same bloodline.

659
00:50:20,508 --> 00:50:25,985
You're half-siblings. That means you're half strangers. Get it?

660
00:50:25,985 --> 00:50:31,261
So, all this time you thought of hyung as a stranger because you are not blood-related?

661
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:34,033
It would have been better if he was a stranger.

662
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:40,282
That rude bastard. I've never thought of him as my son.

663
00:50:40,282 --> 00:50:44,830
You know very well that he never treated me like his father.

664
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:51,689
You don't get deceived by him either.
Why do you think I gave up 
my position as a director, 
and ran away from there?

665
00:50:53,873 --> 00:50:56,304
What did you leave behind at Saint Honore, Dad?

666
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:58,793
Why? If you knew, would you get them back for me?

667
00:50:58,793 --> 00:51:00,131
What were they?

668
00:51:00,131 --> 00:51:03,660
Money, power, fame,

669
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,051
and ownership of cake.

670
00:51:06,051 --> 00:51:11,659
And, all the things that Saint Honore was able to gain because of my name.

671
00:51:24,685 --> 00:51:42,119

672
00:51:52,584 --> 00:51:54,310
You came?

673
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,088
Yes.

674
00:51:57,178 --> 00:51:59,079
Are you sick?

675
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:01,262
Why do you look lethargic?

676
00:52:01,262 --> 00:52:04,658
No. Did everyone leave?

677
00:52:04,658 --> 00:52:09,995
Gil Dong Goo and Da Na went to a wholesale market. And Panda is out with her aunt.

678
00:52:09,995 --> 00:52:11,268
That's good.

679
00:52:11,268 --> 00:52:15,019
I wanted to ask you something privately.

680
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:17,105
What could that be?

681
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:20,812
If you were to leave Cafe Panda,

682
00:52:20,812 --> 00:52:24,503
what would you leave behind?

683
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,794
The most precious

684
00:52:30,794 --> 00:52:33,484
things in the world.

685
00:52:34,043 --> 00:52:35,873
What could those things be?

686
00:52:35,873 --> 00:52:38,403
The people I like,

687
00:52:38,403 --> 00:52:42,669
and the people who like me. Also,

688
00:52:42,669 --> 00:52:46,083
the love that I built with them.

689
00:52:46,691 --> 00:52:50,542
What about money, fame, power, and other things that you gained from your cake?

690
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,018
Could those be more important than people?

691
00:52:55,036 --> 00:53:00,075
Right. Of course, that's the way one should be.

692
00:53:00,075 --> 00:53:01,272
Did something happen?

693
00:53:01,272 --> 00:53:04,631
Ah...it's nothing. I'm just very happy that you're here.

694
00:53:04,631 --> 00:53:07,126
Say it, if you have something to say.

695
00:53:07,126 --> 00:53:11,010
Hyung, did you know that Won Il hyung can't eat cake?

696
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:14,123
I heard that from Eun Bi.

697
00:53:14,123 --> 00:53:16,508
I was going to ask you about it anyway.

698
00:53:16,508 --> 00:53:18,582
How come he can't eat it?

699
00:53:18,582 --> 00:53:22,152
Since I was young, all I know is that he can't eat it.

700
00:53:22,152 --> 00:53:25,450
He can't eat it because of its shape, or

701
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,140
he can't tolerate its taste?

702
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:34,023
Well, I don't know since 
I never saw him eating cake. 
He can eat chocolates,
caramel, breads, ice cream, and other things well.

703
00:53:34,023 --> 00:53:39,052
Anyway, I was in the middle of making a cake for your hyung.

704
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:41,023
Do you think he will eat something like this?

705
00:53:41,023 --> 00:53:42,257
Yes.

706
00:53:44,404 --> 00:53:48,377
You're trying to help Won Il to eat cake?

707
00:53:48,377 --> 00:53:49,294
Yeah.

708
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:54,525
I wanted to ask you that favor, Hyung.

709
00:53:55,263 --> 00:54:01,480
Please help Won Il to become the owner of Saint Honore.

710
00:54:03,014 --> 00:54:06,629
Did you take care of things well with Won Il then?

711
00:54:06,629 --> 00:54:11,825
Yeah. Hedgehog and I decided to become friends with him.

712
00:54:11,825 --> 00:54:14,174
That's great.

713
00:54:14,174 --> 00:54:16,425
Your lover is one of life's treasures.

714
00:54:16,425 --> 00:54:19,596
Your friend is one of life's treasures.

715
00:54:19,596 --> 00:54:23,284
My aunt is one of life's treasures.
Your niece is one of life's treasures.

716
00:54:23,284 --> 00:54:25,756
Of course.

717
00:54:25,756 --> 00:54:29,391
By the way, where are we going?

718
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,344
Nowhere in particular. I'm just driving.

719
00:54:32,344 --> 00:54:33,178
How come?

720
00:54:33,178 --> 00:54:38,094
You said you can stay out until Eun Bi comes back.

721
00:54:38,094 --> 00:54:42,374
Then, that's that. Why are you just driving?

722
00:54:42,374 --> 00:54:46,349
I wanted to drive you for the last time.

723
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:49,523
What's for the last time...?

724
00:54:49,523 --> 00:54:52,315
I want to sell this taxi.

725
00:54:52,315 --> 00:54:53,743
Why?

726
00:54:53,743 --> 00:54:59,147
I think I'm getting old. It's difficult for me now.
 I'm scared of driving.

727
00:54:59,147 --> 00:55:01,052
I get drowsy too.

728
00:55:01,052 --> 00:55:06,286
If you get scared and drowsy, something bad can happen, Aunty.
 That's a good idea. Let's sell it and take a rest.

729
00:55:06,286 --> 00:55:08,196
That's what I want to do.

730
00:55:08,196 --> 00:55:13,822
So this is the last time.

731
00:55:14,614 --> 00:55:17,171
It was hard for you.

732
00:55:17,171 --> 00:55:21,160
You had a hard life too, Aunty.

733
00:55:21,997 --> 00:55:25,601
We both had hard lives.

734
00:55:25,601 --> 00:55:32,942
But we now have to say goodbye.

735
00:55:33,692 --> 00:55:37,907
Aunty, are you selling this because of a money problem?

736
00:55:37,907 --> 00:55:39,900
No.

737
00:55:40,578 --> 00:55:42,861
It's nothing like that.

738
00:55:42,861 --> 00:55:45,422
I'll talk to Hedgehog, and get the interest starting this month.

739
00:55:45,422 --> 00:55:48,054
It's alright, Miss.

740
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:49,601
Even if it's one percent of interest...

741
00:55:49,601 --> 00:55:51,355
Pan Da Yang,

742
00:55:51,355 --> 00:55:54,054
you shouldn't do that.

743
00:55:54,054 --> 00:55:56,615
Even though he's your boyfriend, you shouldn't do that.

744
00:55:56,615 --> 00:55:59,734
Hedgehog didn't get paid at all for his work.

745
00:55:59,734 --> 00:56:03,761
So how could you ask him to pay your debt and my debt?

746
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:09,803
It's not right to ask even a husband to spend all his earnings to help out his in-laws. But a boyfriend...?

747
00:56:09,803 --> 00:56:13,074
You can't do that. No way.

748
00:56:13,074 --> 00:56:16,166
I know you mean well, thanks.

749
00:56:17,399 --> 00:56:20,067
Is it because I'm driving a good person?

750
00:56:20,067 --> 00:56:27,876
Or, is it because I'm driving this for the last time? The road seems to be wide and open.

751
00:56:53,741 --> 00:56:55,272
I'll kill you, really.

752
00:56:55,272 --> 00:56:57,252
Oh!

753
00:56:58,689 --> 00:57:00,227
Aish!

754
00:57:09,047 --> 00:57:11,821
 That's what Grandpa thinks. 
What about you?

755
00:57:11,821 --> 00:57:14,950
 If I place a condition,

756
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:16,180
 would it be alright?

757
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,369
 What condition?

758
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:18,364
 A condition?

759
00:57:18,364 --> 00:57:21,290
 He is asking to take off all the posters of Director Choi at the entrance.

760
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:22,937
 You got Hedgehog.

761
00:57:22,937 --> 00:57:24,504
 Would a person like me be alright?

762
00:57:24,504 --> 00:57:26,729
 If it's you, it would be the best.

763
00:57:29,114 --> 00:57:31,698
 I finally came back

764
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,747
 to Saint Honore.

765
00:57:34,747 --> 00:57:37,267
 You're ready, right?
