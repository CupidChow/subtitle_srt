1
00:01:08,316 --> 00:01:17,369

2
00:01:36,419 --> 00:01:40,684
I didn't drink any alcohol.

3
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:45,605
I feel so dizzy.

4
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,666
You too?

5
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:53,421
You aren't going to blame me for taking advantage of a younger boy,

6
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:56,434
are you?

7
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:02,653
How could I?

8
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:06,599
Then why is your facial expression like that?

9
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,956

Episode 10

10
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,112
Me too.

11
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,454
Since we're close now, there's nothing wrong with your cup.

12
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:38,893
That's tasty.

13
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:41,047
Water is sweet, isn't it?

14
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:43,864
It's bitter.

15
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,488
Without me being aware...
 my lips automatically...

16
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:49,184
stuck to your lips,

17
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:51,691
like a magnet...

18
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:55,416
The truth is, this was my first time so

19
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:59,645
I'm confused and ashamed.

20
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:05,743
I liked it.

21
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:08,690
Really?

22
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:17,046
He really liked it?

23
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:22,476
Suddenly I feel like I have the whole world.

24
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:36,738
Then, would you like to initiate it this time?

25
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,793
It was nice...

26
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:43,252
and I would like to do it again...

27
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:46,165
but I don't think it should happen again.

28
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:48,803
Why? Ah...

29
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:52,189
Because you think it's best to go slow?

30
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:55,123
I already told you.

31
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:59,184
I haven't been able to come up with an answer to the question yet.

32
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:02,892
If we are to talk about qualifications,

33
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:05,165
I can't say much for myself.

34
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:08,664
If it wasn't for you, I would have lost this house,

35
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:11,416
and Da Na and I might have ended up out on the street.

36
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:15,137
But, I've chosen you over Won Il.

37
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:17,662
Not just because you settled our financial troubles.

38
00:04:17,662 --> 00:04:20,938
You saved us so I'm very grateful

39
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:23,809
and appreciative.

40
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:26,410
But the reason I'm like this...

41
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,542
The reason I like you is different from that.

42
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:32,178
You understand me, right?

43
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:34,619
Can I ask you one thing?

44
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:39,261
Will you separate after a while?

45
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:42,834
No, I hate separating.

46
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:49,516
Not being able to see mom and dad again and

47
00:04:49,516 --> 00:04:54,724
separating from someone I'm close to...

48
00:04:54,724 --> 00:04:57,330
Suddenly ending a relationship

49
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,868
and not being able to see each other

50
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:01,009
and pretending like nothing occurred

51
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,378
and continuing to live, I don't like it.

52
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:05,240
That's why

53
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,750
I think I spoke of marriage to you.

54
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:16,618
Are you worried that one day I might suddenly dislike you

55
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:21,499
just like I suddenly blurted out that I like you?

56
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:24,331
The concern is not about you abruptly disliking me

57
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:28,289
It's because there may be a dislikeable thing to dislike.

58
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,296
Because I lived in a different world

59
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:34,447
than the world you've lived in.

60
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:38,106
What does that have to do with anything?

61
00:05:38,106 --> 00:05:39,821
You want to know the relevance?

62
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:41,379
You're the one who smiles innocently.

63
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:45,493
And I'm the one who hopes you can continue to live innocently.

64
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:49,460
The way I see it, that's what may keep us apart.

65
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:54,003
So, you don't see it as possible.

66
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:56,959
Eventually we will break up,

67
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,804
so it's better not to begin the relationship.

68
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,200
Just 100 meters

69
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,375
For the last couple of days,

70
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,463
you've instantly gone 100 meters away from me

71
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:17,503
and I ran to you as fast as I can.

72
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:21,222
We were apart by 100 meters and the we shortened the distance by 100 meters.

73
00:06:21,222 --> 00:06:23,946
Then, it's the same thing.

74
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:28,198
So,

75
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:31,405
we are still at the same place, right?

76
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:35,253
I'll go upstairs. I want to stay,

77
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:38,602
but you look tired so I'll go.

78
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:42,160
Get some rest. I won't rush you.

79
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,536
Take as long as you need to think through.

80
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:48,853
Don't worry about me.

81
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:05,961
I'm sorry

82
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:08,872
and I'm thankful.

83
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:17,432
 The rain that drops on my hands

84
00:07:17,432 --> 00:07:25,194
 I wish it would also drop on your hands.

85
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:32,181
 The wind that blows through my hair,

86
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:39,991
 I wish it would reach your cheek.

87
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:46,988
 I wish the sound of my heart resound in your ears,

88
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:54,648
 and shake your heart.

89
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:58,194
 Should I say louder?

90
00:07:58,194 --> 00:08:01,733
 Would you hear it then?

91
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:08,343
 I have so much I would be sorry to you about.

92
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:16,411
 Would my prickled life hurt you?

93
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:20,513
 Carefully bring you to my arms,

94
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:23,717
 and hold you,

95
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:31,093
 yet I can't block the wind and make you cold,

96
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:36,336
 but the tears I shed would be warm.

97
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:40,766
What are you doing?
 I hope you'd know.

98
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:44,956
Did you get an overdue statement from the bank?

99
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:47,199
I no longer have any bills overdue.

100
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:51,750
Hedgehog didn't take his share of the income and instead paid off the bills.

101
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,433
Oh, that's right.

102
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:57,594
Then, why do you look like you're about to lose your house?

103
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:00,770
Because of this.

104
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,495
What is this?

105
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:04,797
Qualification comparison?

106
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:09,504
Looks: Hedgehog, A. Me, A?

107
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:11,740
Personality: Hedgehog, B. Me, A.

108
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,802
Age: Hedgehog, A. Me, B.

109
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:16,830
Capability: Hedgehog, A. Me, C.

110
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,105
Do you think those ratings are fair?

111
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:22,596
Are you two competing to be the owner?

112
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,854
It's not like that!

113
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:28,046
If it's not like that, why are you making a qualification comparison at the crack of dawn?

114
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,438
Hedgehog...

115
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,706
He doesn't know if he is

116
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:37,180
qualified to like me or not.

117
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,040
You like Hedgehog?

118
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:47,220
It already turned out that way.

119
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:17,019
I'm sorry.

120
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:19,729
I'm grateful.

121
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:39,306
Aish.

122
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,761
I'm going crazy

123
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:45,586
because I miss her.

124
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:48,402
Why am I like this?

125
00:10:48,402 --> 00:10:51,567
It wasn't to this extent before.

126
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:11,789
If you're not asleep, come downstairs. I'll tell you everything.

127
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:18,245
If Hedgehog is having a hard time talking about it,

128
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:23,590
then I want to find out about it first and tell him it's okay.

129
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,427
That's why, just give me the answer.

130
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:28,837
I'm in a dire situation!

131
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:34,407
There is one with all the answers.
What is the problem?

132
00:11:42,517 --> 00:11:44,832
Did you get hit by Hedgehog again?

133
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:47,768
Got hit again? 
When did I ever get hit by him?

134
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:48,731
At the Panda Cafe.

135
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:52,401
When Da Yang was upset because of Hedgehog.

136
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:56,122
Ah, you didn't get hit that time, you were roughed up.

137
00:11:57,922 --> 00:11:59,140
Please bring me some coffee.

138
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,770
Ah.

139
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:02,102
Here it is.

140
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:05,306
Bring me another one that's hot.

141
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:06,755
It hasn't even been here for one minute.

142
00:12:06,755 --> 00:12:07,998
It's still very hot.

143
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:09,696
Then, hurry up and go get back to your work.

144
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,761
I have work that I need to see you about.

145
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:13,998
Hyuuuung!

146
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:14,999
Hyung, hyung hyung, hyung~!

147
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,226
Hyung, hyung. Hyung, hyung!

148
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:17,508
What? What?

149
00:12:17,508 --> 00:12:20,089
This was made by Byun Woo Hyung. It's a killer!

150
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:22,631
Get rid of them!

151
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:25,955
Hyung, did you get a mosquito bite?

152
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:27,372
He didn't get  a mosquito bite.

153
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,226
He cried!

154
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:33,210
Ah, hurry up and give them back.

155
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,667
And tell others that...

156
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:36,662
It's an eye disorder.

157
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:38,548
You had a cosmetic surgery.

158
00:12:40,403 --> 00:12:42,489
Put them back on, it sticks out like a sore thumb.

159
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:44,762
Hurry, hurry.

160
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:50,590
What's wrong with your eyes?

161
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,249
Are you ill?

162
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:55,564
Ah, this?

163
00:12:55,564 --> 00:12:57,063
It's inherited.

164
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,341
An inherited... illness?

165
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:01,227
They're dark circles, Grandfather.

166
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:05,878
From what I know, those aren't dark circles.

167
00:13:05,878 --> 00:13:08,885
In our family, when distressed,

168
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:10,650
We become pandas.

169
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,463
I thought it was familiar. It was a panda!

170
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,597
Did something happen?

171
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:22,537
If it's to this extent, it must be pretty serious.

172
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:30,256
That's why I came to see you, grandpa.

173
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:31,896
Hey.

174
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:35,075
Let's talk.

175
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,489
Why don't you pack up some old kimchee and some new side dishes?

176
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:47,817
Since Beom Bo has to watch the store,

177
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:51,479
get Gi Tae to drive Seung Ji, and feed him a meal.

178
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,572
Is Seung Ji ill?

179
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:56,864
Because when he is troubled, he doesn't eat.

180
00:13:57,268 --> 00:13:59,723
Before Pan Da Yang returns, make sure he is fed.

181
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:01,478
What's going on?

182
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:04,736
He can't explain his past,

183
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:07,607
that he's about to lose his destined mate.

184
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:11,354
Since he is unable to tell her, I will do it for him

185
00:14:11,354 --> 00:14:15,615
Even though it is hard to talk about it, wouldn't it be better to be told by him.

186
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:19,719
It would be nice, but there's no way he could say it nicely.

187
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,426
He is referred to as a prickly hedgehog for a reason.

188
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:23,283
Even though he's soft inside,

189
00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:28,127
He will be prickled and just say, "So, I went to jail. What about it?"

190
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:31,679
No women will like him after hearing that.

191
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,240
I'm going tell her how pitiful and lonely he is,

192
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,608
and what a good person he is.

193
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:44,259
He already shed a lifetime's worth of tears.

194
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:48,549
I can't watch him shed anymore tears.
I won't leave him like that.

195
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:51,727
I'll not leave him like that. I won't.

196
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:12,912
They were good enough to use in an ad featuring macarons with cosmetics.

197
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,619
Hey, you know Siratoni Mina, right?

198
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:17,646
Of course I know her, the fashion icon queen.

199
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:21,322
She must only eat the macarons made by pastry chef Hedgehog.

200
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:22,687
Anyways, she says Cafe Panda's macarons are the best.

201
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:26,114
Then, why are we meeting here instead of there?

202
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:27,857
Let's go there right now.

203
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:29,937
Uh, excuse...

204
00:15:30,783 --> 00:15:32,527
Uh, wait...

205
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:33,187
Aish!

206
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:33,974
Daddy, daddy...

207
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,735
Those girls are on a diet and would not even eat much.

208
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,327
We don't need customers like that.

209
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:42,041
It's not like

210
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:45,484
he's going to come all the way over here... Hmm?

211
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:47,453
What did you say?

212
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:53,691
With the technology these days, it should be simple.  Huh?

213
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:58,273
I'm going to put my macarons on that girl's picture

214
00:15:58,273 --> 00:15:59,758
and put in on our front door, no,

215
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:03,601
I mean I'll put it all over on our entire bulding. I will.

216
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,532
I heard she's really picky.  Will it be alright?

217
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:06,968
Well, if it becomes a problem

218
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:11,103
we'll just change the macarons to macaron looking cosmetic cases.

219
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,677
If I got this job by paying money,

220
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:15,128
why should I lose out to him?

221
00:16:15,128 --> 00:16:17,266
Instead of doing that,

222
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:19,445
why don't you just go down to Cafe Panda

223
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,900
and give some money to the pastry chef and bring him here.

224
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,131
Then, all the customers of Cafe Panda will follow him here.

225
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:30,746
Why should I give the person who stole my idea money and a job? Am I stupid?

226
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:32,881
Not because you are stupid,

227
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:35,297
I'm just saying that this is the easiest way

228
00:16:35,297 --> 00:16:39,572
If you have time to meddle like this, then make yourself useful and go get Ms. Kang.

229
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:41,468
I told you to investigate how she's connected to Panda.

230
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:45,322
But you don't listen and keep following me around to annoy me.

231
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:46,404
Geez!

232
00:16:48,423 --> 00:16:50,198
Annoy?

233
00:16:51,153 --> 00:16:52,319
Panda!

234
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:52,939
Huh.

235
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:53,908
Panda!

236
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:57,434
Da Yang left with her aunt.

237
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,192
Where did she go this early?

238
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:02,060
I don't know. Why are you looking for Unni?

239
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,761
Because I have to talk to her.

240
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,631
Do that later and look at this!

241
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:07,366
Ta-da!

242
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:10,317
Our cake is so popular.

243
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:12,214
Thanks to Ye Won and Bo Ram for spreading the news.

244
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:13,898
We're buried with the orders.

245
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:18,376
I'm seeing Gil Dong Goo in a different light.

246
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:20,352
Don't call him Gi Dong Goo any more

247
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:21,796
Bo Ram is here too.

248
00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:24,225
Thank you, boss.

249
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:27,612
We'll make cakes like the lollipop cakes.

250
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:30,934
Boss, you take on special orders.

251
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:31,714
Yeah!

252
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:35,205
Just like Saint Honore, we have to adopt a system.

253
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:38,617
You never know, this may turn out awesome!

254
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:41,410
So you have to move upstairs.

255
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,413
What?

256
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,483
I told you on the phone.

257
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,610
When the sun went down and the moon came up.

258
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,011
I will take the basement and

259
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:53,294
you, on the second floor where Pan Da Yang is.....

260
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:56,949
Go upstairs where her bedroom is.

261
00:17:56,949 --> 00:18:00,117
I agree.  Don't you think Unni will agree as well?

262
00:18:00,117 --> 00:18:02,472
It's a system for mass production.

263
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:05,656
Hedgehog, if we sleep in the same room, my snoring will disturb your sleep and

264
00:18:05,656 --> 00:18:10,128
you will be too tired to make cakes.

265
00:18:11,981 --> 00:18:13,894
Let me think about it.

266
00:18:15,514 --> 00:18:17,122
I thought he would like the idea.

267
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:18,230
Why doesn't he?

268
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,941
Who knows?

269
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:42,649

270
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:52,536
Hey, Pan Dan Na.  Tell your Unni to change her name to poopy head.

271
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:55,551
Why does she never answer her phone when I need her?

272
00:18:55,817 --> 00:19:00,756
By the way, did Hedgehog and Won Il fight?

273
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:02,068
Did they hit each other?

274
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:05,455
Why don't you know?

275
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:07,050
Ah, whatever.

276
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,360
Checking by myself would be faster than asking you.

277
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,733
Tell Hedgehog to hurry on the cake I ordered.

278
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:20,621
Because I want to play a real hot truth telling game.

279
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:23,764
I have to find out why Won Il's eyes are all bloated.

280
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:25,547
Ah, what?! Seriously!

281
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:29,495
Vice President...

282
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:32,412
Do you want to get fired or hand over the phone?

283
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:34,625
I'm hanging up.

284
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:43,903
Should I find it or will you just say it with your own mouth?

285
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:45,285
What do you mean?

286
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:48,347
You keep talking about our Won Il.

287
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:50,000
Pan Da Na's unni, Pan Da Yang,

288
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,605
and Hedgehog Seung Ji.

289
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:54,225
What are their relationships?

290
00:19:54,225 --> 00:20:00,069
Pan Da Yang is a friend.  But, not a close friend.

291
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:05,389
And, the patissier at her cafe is Ko Seung Ji, Hedgehog.

292
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:06,535
And President...

293
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:07,823
Did you introduce him

294
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:08,984
to Pan Da Yang?

295
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:10,072
No!

296
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:13,100
They were classmates from elementary school.

297
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,540
Where's Hedgehog's picture?

298
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,046
I don't have it.

299
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:18,779
Then I expect you have Panda's picture?

300
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:19,899
I don't have hers either.

301
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:22,864
You said she is your friend! Why don't you have her pictures?

302
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:25,819
Well.. It's because we're not that close..

303
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:29,479
And also, I don't really take pictures of other people..

304
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,979
What the heck? This is just full of selcas.

305
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:41,045
Are you looking at pictures of President Won Il?

306
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:44,532
I took those to use for possible use in company material...

307
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:50,551
Vice-Presdient, this is.......

308
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:56,164
Pick the best picture among the frontals

309
00:20:56,164 --> 00:20:58,466
put it together with Saint Honore.

310
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,972
That would be a violation of image law.

311
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:06,364
Is it better to violate the law or to get you in trouble?

312
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:08,310
I understand. I will get it ready.

313
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,522
Make sure a good picture of the Macaroons get in there.

314
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:14,343
The picture of the cosmetics will be here soon, so make sure and get that in too.

315
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:17,766
Write "Macarons made by Saint Honore's Chairman Choi Jae Gyum"

316
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:20,134
in huge letters on top.

317
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:21,337
Immediately.

318
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:29,404
Cafe Panda... Ko Seung Ji...

319
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:33,197
and Choi Won Il.  Once I find out how they are all connected...

320
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:39,127
Pushing Choi Won Il out of the way is just a matter of time.

321
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:52,877
You just stood there watching while they kissed?

322
00:21:52,877 --> 00:21:55,526
I didn't just stand there and watch, I left.

323
00:21:57,725 --> 00:21:59,647
What do you mean, Ha?

324
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:02,748
Then would you have run in there and torn them apart?

325
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:06,553
It wasn't Hedgehog, but DaYang who took it upon herself.

326
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:09,979
You think you can give up on her?

327
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:11,743
Not like this.

328
00:22:11,743 --> 00:22:15,267
Then, what?  Are you going to have it out with Hedgehog for real then?

329
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,650
It doesn't mean I want to take Da Yang from him.

330
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,415
Then?

331
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:22,999
I want to ask Hedgehog, why he had to live in pr...

332
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:27,535
Why he had to live there for so long.

333
00:22:27,535 --> 00:22:30,019
I have to ask him.

334
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:38,861
You and you.

335
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:40,698
If you tell anyone I saw this picture...

336
00:22:40,698 --> 00:22:42,308
I'll never tell anyone.

337
00:22:42,308 --> 00:22:44,857
Me neither, Vice-President.

338
00:22:45,891 --> 00:22:51,762
Send this picture to my phone and erase it on your phone.

339
00:22:51,762 --> 00:22:54,153
Yes, I understand.

340
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:55,580
Erase it right now!

341
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,282
Yes, right away!

342
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:02,641
What the heck? You have it, too?

343
00:23:09,537 --> 00:23:11,789
Until I say so,

344
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:16,428
you, you and me,

345
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,787
no one knows about this, got it?

346
00:23:19,787 --> 00:23:22,101
Yes.

347
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:35,506
What are you doing?

348
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:37,912
President Choi Won Il.

349
00:23:37,912 --> 00:23:44,475
You think you can handle things on your own here?

350
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,003
Yes.

351
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:50,405
I have a condition then.

352
00:23:50,405 --> 00:23:51,986
What is it?

353
00:23:51,986 --> 00:23:55,109
Meet girls that I introduce to you.

354
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:57,763
I'm not saying you should get married right away.

355
00:23:57,763 --> 00:24:02,575
Meeting those kinds of girls is a way of giving strength to your mother.

356
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:06,710
I need it right now.

357
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:10,712
Please go ahead and arrange it.

358
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:20,523
Thanks. There's no one but my son.

359
00:24:20,523 --> 00:24:24,512
Please go and lie down. You aren't looking so well.

360
00:25:05,743 --> 00:25:09,211
Is it ok to do this without asking Hedgehog?

361
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:15,596
Of course, a helper can do their boss's job.
No need to ask.

362
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:20,708
Hey. Mr. Gil. I'm not his helper.  I'm his Hyung.  His Hyung.

363
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:24,522
Whether you're his Hyung or his younger brother doesn't matter to me.

364
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:29,520
I heard you were his closest and best friend.  Which is why I ask...

365
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,349
If Hedgehog moves upstairs, do you know what good comes of it?

366
00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:36,611
It's good for you, Mr.Gil.  You get this room.

367
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,445
Aish! You got your boogers on me!

368
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:48,624
Clean it up as you listen. There's a dark cloud hovering between Panda and Hedgehog.

369
00:25:48,624 --> 00:25:49,578
Why?

370
00:25:49,578 --> 00:25:51,404
Haven't you ever dated?

371
00:25:51,404 --> 00:25:55,275
The one thing you can't predict is a relationship's weather.

372
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:56,557
I know that.

373
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:57,698
So you know.

374
00:25:57,698 --> 00:26:00,417
Knowing that, you won't help Hedgehog move into the room next to Pan Da Yang?

375
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:02,493
Once upstairs

376
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:04,088
they'll see each other when the moon is in the sky,

377
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:07,301
they'll see each other on the way to the bathroom in the middle of the night,

378
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,813
they'll see each other on their way to get a glass of water because they can't sleep,

379
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:10,746
they'll see each other around every corner.

380
00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:12,210
If you want to date

381
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,942
you need to see each other during late hours

382
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:21,484
but instead in this room if he stares at the ceiling every night, Panda isn't going to fall down to him.

383
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:23,367
I guess that's right.

384
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:26,097
Pack. Hurry.

385
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:30,650
Pssh, you didn't want to eat when Gil Dong Goo Ahjusshi and I asked you.

386
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,186
When ahjumma is looking after you, you're eating well.

387
00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:36,906
Try this as well.

388
00:26:36,906 --> 00:26:40,466
How did you bring only those I like?

389
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,595
It's like a birthday feast!

390
00:26:42,595 --> 00:26:45,083
From now on, I'll make an abundant amount.

391
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:47,893
If you want to eat something, just tell me.

392
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:53,588
Then I want grilled beef, grilled fish, noodles, seasoned crab, spicy beef soup...

393
00:26:53,588 --> 00:26:56,146
Ok, I'll make you all of it.

394
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:59,303
I was joking. This is enough.

395
00:26:59,303 --> 00:27:03,185
You'll get indigestion, have it with the soup.

396
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:08,598
You guys look like mother and son when together like that.

397
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:10,034
Yah!

398
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:13,012
How does she look like my mom? She looks like my youngest older sister.

399
00:27:13,012 --> 00:27:16,144
Right?

400
00:27:16,144 --> 00:27:19,857
What is grandpa doing that he didn't come?

401
00:27:19,857 --> 00:27:22,288
I said I would come.

402
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:26,850
Oh.  I thought maybe he was upset with me for something.  If he's not, that's good.

403
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:31,486
Ah.. the meat is to kill for.

404
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:45,885
She's a good person..

405
00:27:45,885 --> 00:27:49,426
You can't lose her, you rascal!

406
00:28:09,303 --> 00:28:12,918
 Searching for a Missing Child

407
00:28:23,553 --> 00:28:25,130
Where are you coming back from?

408
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:28,121
I was walking around town.

409
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:30,728
Noona, did you cry too?

410
00:28:30,728 --> 00:28:35,775
No, it's just hot out... who else cried?

411
00:28:35,775 --> 00:28:40,865
My brother totally looks like a frog because he cried.  His eyes are like this.

412
00:28:40,865 --> 00:28:42,087
Why did he cry?

413
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,869
My foolish Hyung got his timing wrong again.

414
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:51,076
He saw you and Hyung-nim all puckered up together.

415
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:55,446
What should we do? It's something I overheard and it's awkward to see him now, so I'm avoiding him.

416
00:28:55,446 --> 00:28:58,672
Should we act like we don't know?

417
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,680
What should I do?

418
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,714
Are you crying?

419
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:10,310
No, it's because... I'm embarrassed...to you and Won Il.

420
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,288
You were human.

421
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:14,168
I mean, it's physiological...

422
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:19,737
No...It was a natural development between a man and woman's relationship, right?

423
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:21,774
Yeah...

424
00:29:21,774 --> 00:29:23,820
Then why are you embarrassed?

425
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,342
The one destined to lose the girl should lose.

426
00:29:25,342 --> 00:29:29,215
He'll grow that much stronger for the amount of pain he endures.

427
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:32,398
That's how they grow up.

428
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:58,873
 Campus of dreams and hope is near you.

429
00:30:13,764 --> 00:30:14,964
Yeah, Hyung?

430
00:30:14,964 --> 00:30:16,754
Why are you there?

431
00:30:16,754 --> 00:30:22,036
Just because... I wanted to see for myself what kind of place it was.

432
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:26,377
Byung Soo didn't want to look up Hedgehog's profile,

433
00:30:26,377 --> 00:30:29,911
so I asked my old classmate with a bit dodgy background.

434
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,104
It turned out that he knows Ko Seung Ji.

435
00:30:32,104 --> 00:30:35,980
The wide spread rumor is that as a young kid, he was a public menace.

436
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,822
In other words, he lived a life that we can't even imagine.

437
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:45,295
But..because he's such a strong man, he might risk his life to become a new person.

438
00:30:45,295 --> 00:30:50,510
Maybe I am being too generous
because I like Ko Seung Ji.

439
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:56,308
But I wish you wouldn’t judge him by everything that is written on paper.

440
00:30:56,308 --> 00:31:00,187
Okay. Thanks, Hyung.

441
00:31:07,344 --> 00:31:11,084
I need to talk to Won Il,

442
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:15,106
to apologize and explain..

443
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:18,420
Won Il hyung wants to speak to Hedgehog hyung.

444
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,089
I don't know for sure but,

445
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,309
did he say it was here or there?

446
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:28,236
Anyway, once he knows why Seung Ji lived there for so long, then he'll decide to give up or not.

447
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:31,983
But where is that place? Mozarto?

448
00:31:31,983 --> 00:31:35,532
Why does he want to ask about that?

449
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:39,162
Noona, even after their duel, Won Il wouldn't obsess,

450
00:31:39,162 --> 00:31:42,501
cry, become clingy and stuff, would he?

451
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,922
I hate weak men more than anything.

452
00:31:44,922 --> 00:31:50,409
A man should be able tackle problems head on.  Accept the result and admit it.

453
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:54,584
That's all men got to keep.

454
00:31:54,584 --> 00:31:59,195
Tackle problems?  Accept the result and admit it?

455
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:00,553
Yes!

456
00:32:00,553 --> 00:32:03,941
Tackle problems I can solve.

457
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:08,595
If I can't solve the problem or it isn't up to me, then entirely accept it.

458
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:12,525
Crying and thinking all day is going to change nothing.

459
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:16,112
Simple is the best.

460
00:32:17,788 --> 00:32:20,424
Won Yi, thanks.

461
00:32:20,424 --> 00:32:21,831
Why?

462
00:32:21,831 --> 00:32:26,077
For all that you've said.

463
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:31,171
I just feel like taking you for a piggyback ride for saying thanks, although it wasn't much!

464
00:32:31,171 --> 00:32:32,527
That's plenty.

465
00:32:32,527 --> 00:32:36,047
No no. I'll sing you a song! With good lyrics. Deal?

466
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:37,357
O...

467
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:38,496
Okay.

468
00:32:38,496 --> 00:32:42,748
You also want a cool girl like me would come and talk to you. Dance with me?

469
00:32:42,748 --> 00:32:46,796
I want to spend a night with Hedgehog, woohoo!

470
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,617
Hey, Hedgehog. It's me, are you busy?

471
00:32:56,617 --> 00:32:58,793
Is it okay to call?

472
00:32:59,401 --> 00:33:02,792
Give me some time to talk to you.

473
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:05,772
Suddenly, a bunch of orders came up so right now is a little iffy.

474
00:33:05,772 --> 00:33:08,906
After tomorrow, you can stop by whenever you want.

475
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:11,935
Yes, good? Okay.

476
00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:22,265
Hedgehog. Boss. Hurry up and come out. Hurry.

477
00:33:25,112 --> 00:33:27,119
What is it?

478
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:34,043
They came all of a sudden

479
00:33:34,043 --> 00:33:35,827
to interview you.

480
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:39,422
I am reporter, Kwon Sae Yeon, from Magazine Passion.

481
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:41,727
We recently had an interview with Siratoni Mina and

482
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:48,030
she complimented that Mr. Ko Seung Ji's cake and macarons were a piece of art rather than a desert.

483
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,697
What kind of obstacles you went through,

484
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:54,475
and what kind of experiences led you to make such wonderful creations?  We'd like a detailed interview.

485
00:33:54,475 --> 00:33:59,741
The parts you aren't so open about, we will make sure to keep them a secret so there is nothing to worry about.

486
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:02,780
I'm sorry.

487
00:34:05,027 --> 00:34:07,663
You can talk with me.

488
00:34:07,663 --> 00:34:10,649
Hello, I am Cafe Panda's owner, Pan DaYang.

489
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,759
Oh, hello.

490
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,440
My name is Kwon Sae Yeon and I am a reporter for Magazine Passion.

491
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,241
I requested an interview and I came because I received an okay.

492
00:34:19,241 --> 00:34:21,705
But then....

493
00:34:21,705 --> 00:34:26,158
I don't think you talked with Patissier Ko Seung Ji, but with my younger sister.

494
00:34:26,158 --> 00:34:28,917
I apologize for not being able to have the interview today.

495
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:31,656
If you can email the interview questions,

496
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:35,560
I'd like to organize Patissier Ko Seung Ji’s answers and send them to you.

497
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,195
Although that would be one of the possible options, I'd rather do the job since I'm a reporter...

498
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:42,374
I too, once worked for a magazine as a reporter.

499
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:46,402
I worked at Cake and Sweet for five years.

500
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,131
Then, I will leave it all up to you.

501
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:54,364
I am sorry that this is all we can do when you came all the way here.

502
00:34:54,364 --> 00:34:58,022
That's fine. Instead, I received such a nice present.

503
00:34:58,022 --> 00:35:02,046
As for the pictures of cakes and patissier, if you reply my email with answers,

504
00:35:02,046 --> 00:35:06,037
I will have them ready for photoshoots.

505
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,867
I feel like you're doing all of the work for me.

506
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:10,059
Excuse me,

507
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:12,223
please give me a cake.

508
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:18,237
I'm buying a cake for my son, but he is so picky.
He never liked what I bought for him.

509
00:35:18,237 --> 00:35:22,239
Please recommend a cake that will get me praise.

510
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,227
Since boys don't like sweets very much..

511
00:35:25,227 --> 00:35:27,549
I think that..

512
00:35:27,549 --> 00:35:28,803
this will be the best choice.

513
00:35:28,803 --> 00:35:32,434
Oh, that looks delicious. Please wrap it up for me.

514
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:34,264
Yes.

515
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:40,447
Young man, you must be famous.

516
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:44,487
A reporter even came to interview you.
From listening to the other customers,

517
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:47,180
it seems they came after seeing you in the newspaper.

518
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,677
There was this one Japanese customer that came,

519
00:35:48,677 --> 00:35:52,630
but I didn't know she was famous.
She turned out to be a top star.

520
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,356
She recommended my macarons in a newspaper interview.

521
00:35:57,356 --> 00:36:00,626
Would a top star put her name on it without a reason?

522
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:03,851
Where did you learn to make cakes?

523
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:09,423
I was thinking about turning my son into a patissier.

524
00:36:09,423 --> 00:36:15,080
I see. Why don't you let him learn the basics first?
You need to find out if it suits him.

525
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,471
He always says nothing suits him. There's no way other than to insist.

526
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:23,941
I'll come here often to discuss about him, so please give me a lot of advice.

527
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:29,684
It doesn't seem like I'm living because of my son.

528
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:31,554
Here.

529
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:41,952
Hyung, you've arrived!

530
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:44,039
What's all this? Did you open a pub?

531
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:47,850
I opened it today, a pub just for you.

532
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,405
You know I don't drink alcohol, so why all of this fuss?

533
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:52,967
You're just using this as an excuse to drink!

534
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:57,368
Just think whatever you want. Tonight, I'm going to teach you how to drink properly.

535
00:36:57,368 --> 00:37:00,052
You won't find a better teacher than me!

536
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,320
I don't have any reason to drink alcohol,

537
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,775
so just drink one bottle and clean all of this up!

538
00:37:04,775 --> 00:37:07,461
Tch!

539
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:13,200
Ahh! It's cold!

540
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,992
What are you doing?

541
00:37:14,992 --> 00:37:18,800
If you're not going to wash it away with alcohol, then freeze it with ice!

542
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,034
What?

543
00:37:20,034 --> 00:37:22,653
Your suffering heart.

544
00:37:22,653 --> 00:37:27,829
Hyung, you know that you're a really amazing hyung to me, right?

545
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,012
Be a good hyung to Hedgehog too.

546
00:37:31,012 --> 00:37:36,369
I think that's another way you can show your love.

547
00:37:37,022 --> 00:37:40,714
Oh gosh, you might blow me away with all that sighing!

548
00:37:40,714 --> 00:37:41,451
Don't do it.

549
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:45,133
-Freeze it.
-Don't.

550
00:37:45,448 --> 00:37:48,167
Ah! So refreshing... so refreshing.

551
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,546
My feet are going to get you!

552
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:55,916
Won Il can't eat cakes.

553
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,387
Why?

554
00:37:57,387 --> 00:38:01,948
The unluckiest person will eat the last piece.

555
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:05,626
Who is the most unlucky person?

556
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,909
Won Il?

557
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:10,428
Da Yang?

558
00:38:10,428 --> 00:38:12,357
Me?

559
00:38:18,748 --> 00:38:19,625
Me?

560
00:38:22,114 --> 00:38:24,006
Da Yang?

561
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:51,479

562
00:39:01,937 --> 00:39:06,118
The sound of Cheif Gil's snore is loud, right?

563
00:39:06,118 --> 00:39:06,756
Tch.

564
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:08,274
You're right.

565
00:39:08,274 --> 00:39:12,059
Go to the room upstairs. I finished cleaning up.

566
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:16,995
Wouldn't it be better for you if I sleep on the couch here?

567
00:39:16,995 --> 00:39:22,047
Could you sleep comfortably if I slept there?

568
00:39:22,047 --> 00:39:25,317
Let's go upstairs. When you're stuck with the designs, take a good rest.

569
00:39:25,317 --> 00:39:28,130
You've gone throught a lot of trouble alone.

570
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,166
Kang Eun Bi requested

571
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:33,692
to make Won Il's cake faster.

572
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,994
Won Il...

573
00:39:37,994 --> 00:39:40,987
He said he saw us kissing.

574
00:39:40,987 --> 00:39:43,187
What?

575
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:46,672
H-h-h-how?

576
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:52,282
When he came to the cafe, he saw us kissing and just left.

577
00:39:52,282 --> 00:39:56,391
Won Yi said he cried so much and his eyes turned puffy.

578
00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:58,869
Aish!

579
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:02,765
That was why Won Il was serious about having a talk with me.

580
00:40:02,765 --> 00:40:04,742
When did you plan on meeting him?

581
00:40:04,742 --> 00:40:08,965
I told him to come whenever he wants after tomorrow.

582
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,974
I'll talk to him first.

583
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:14,806
Can I do that?

584
00:40:14,806 --> 00:40:18,669
Think of it as a courtesy to a friend.

585
00:40:20,268 --> 00:40:22,328
Okay.

586
00:40:22,328 --> 00:40:27,299
Then, let's clean up and go upstairs.

587
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:51,169
I put up the pretty pictures

588
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:53,765
and drawings which I collected.

589
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:57,034
But all of them gathered together, don't amount to

590
00:40:57,034 --> 00:41:00,919
how special that picture is to me.

591
00:41:04,771 --> 00:41:07,263
Hedgehog, how is it?

592
00:41:07,263 --> 00:41:09,766
Is it good or bad?

593
00:41:11,454 --> 00:41:13,690
It's good.

594
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,091
It's all good then.

595
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:19,239
No matter what worries you have,

596
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:21,390
no matter what decisions you make,

597
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,408
and no matter what you say,

598
00:41:24,408 --> 00:41:27,764
I already heard your answer.

599
00:41:30,462 --> 00:41:32,734
And...

600
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:36,316
I'm the closest to you.

601
00:41:36,316 --> 00:41:39,941
When our lips touch, being so close, we can handle anything.

602
00:41:39,941 --> 00:41:43,138
I'll never leave you.

603
00:41:43,138 --> 00:41:44,893
Right now

604
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:49,571
or in the future, always.

605
00:41:49,571 --> 00:41:52,513
Without listening to what I have to say...

606
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:55,974
I told you.

607
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:59,875
No matter what you say, I won't change.

608
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:06,596
That's why... Rest in this new room with a new heart and let's talk on a day you don't have to bake any cakes.

609
00:42:06,596 --> 00:42:12,403
Because I'm always right by your side, whenever you call me,

610
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:15,221
I'll be able to be here in 5 seconds.

611
00:42:16,912 --> 00:42:19,713
Good night, Hedgehog.

612
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,729
Hedgehog's lips are mine.  Hedgehog's cheeks are mine.

613
00:42:25,729 --> 00:42:29,653
I wonder what I'll make mine tomorrow.

614
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,030
You're trembling right?

615
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:35,271
I will meet your expectations.

616
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:28,228
Because you have me now,

617
00:43:28,228 --> 00:43:30,965
don't be cold anymore, Hedgehog.

618
00:43:31,618 --> 00:43:35,726
Refunding what you already ate doesn't make any sense.

619
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:37,167
What don't you like about it?

620
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:39,623
It's not tasty.

621
00:43:40,086 --> 00:43:42,561
Then do you happen to like to eat anything?

622
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:43,596
I do.

623
00:43:43,596 --> 00:43:45,288
What is it?

624
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:46,318
Rice cakes.

625
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:47,089
Rice cakes?

626
00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:49,723
If you like rice cakes, then you have to go to a rice cake shop and buy rice cakes.

627
00:43:49,723 --> 00:43:52,183
Why are you at a cake shop and complaning?

628
00:43:52,183 --> 00:43:54,399
I didn't buy this cake.

629
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:56,760
I know.

630
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,742
Come back tomorrow then.

631
00:43:57,742 --> 00:43:59,243
I don't want to.

632
00:43:59,243 --> 00:44:00,292
Why don't you want to?

633
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:03,737
Just give me a refund, please.

634
00:44:03,737 --> 00:44:06,753
I can't give you a refund. It's against my principles.

635
00:44:06,753 --> 00:44:09,364
So stay here today.

636
00:44:10,836 --> 00:44:13,067
Let's do this.

637
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:18,531
Let's do this!

638
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,129
Eh?

639
00:44:21,129 --> 00:44:24,851
This kid knows how to look at people.

640
00:44:25,294 --> 00:44:29,149
When the meeting time gets scheduled, call me back.

641
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:32,121
Then I'll see you outside!

642
00:44:32,121 --> 00:44:35,143
Okay, see you later.

643
00:44:37,688 --> 00:44:42,250
You aren't going to tell Pan Da Yang, right?

644
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,477
No.

645
00:44:44,477 --> 00:44:49,384
Good. You thought well my little brother.

646
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:15,188
He's a complete butt.

647
00:45:25,168 --> 00:45:28,472
Enjoy!

648
00:45:33,552 --> 00:45:36,530
 I'll see you in the park at 6:30.

649
00:45:56,689 --> 00:45:58,352
I...

650
00:45:58,352 --> 00:45:59,746
came to have a dinner.

651
00:45:59,746 --> 00:46:00,956
Alright. Come in.

652
00:46:00,956 --> 00:46:01,940
You're not eating, Boss?

653
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,858
I'll eat later.

654
00:46:04,858 --> 00:46:08,244
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

655
00:46:08,956 --> 00:46:11,896
Why don't you sit down, Beom Bo?

656
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,035
Often,

657
00:46:14,035 --> 00:46:16,708
I... feel nervous eating here.

658
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:20,141
You don't need to be sorry to others for eating.
Why do you worry like that?

659
00:46:20,141 --> 00:46:23,157
Still, the boss is not feeling all that well.

660
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:27,110
He probably misses Seung Ji.

661
00:46:27,566 --> 00:46:30,279
You get jealous too, Beom Bo?

662
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:35,271
Dad likes Seung Ji better, and

663
00:46:35,271 --> 00:46:38,220
I like you better.

664
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,687
It's only fair.

665
00:46:39,687 --> 00:46:40,822
Really?

666
00:46:40,822 --> 00:46:43,061
Of course.

667
00:46:43,061 --> 00:46:49,202
If you weren't here, how could I have adapted so fast living here?

668
00:46:49,202 --> 00:46:50,749
Thank you, really.

669
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,979
You can't do that.

670
00:46:58,979 --> 00:47:01,573
Then, give me a kiss.

671
00:47:04,168 --> 00:47:06,722
Thank you.

672
00:47:06,722 --> 00:47:09,476
What happens if I do it?

673
00:47:09,476 --> 00:47:10,363
I'm not doing it.

674
00:47:11,064 --> 00:47:13,983
Thank you.

675
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:33,063

676
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:41,149
Why did you come so early?

677
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:44,283
Huh? I came not too long ago.

678
00:47:44,283 --> 00:47:46,298
Aren't you hungry?

679
00:47:46,298 --> 00:47:48,803
No. And you?

680
00:47:48,803 --> 00:47:50,700
Me neither.

681
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:55,287
So what did you want to talk about out here?

682
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:59,880
The thing that you wanted to say.

683
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,387
What could that be?

684
00:48:03,176 --> 00:48:08,602
The thing that you wanted to ask Hedgehog.

685
00:48:11,057 --> 00:48:15,413
I know all about it, Won Il.

686
00:48:15,413 --> 00:48:18,467
What would you know?

687
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:23,462
How Hedgehog had lived.

688
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,664
How would you know that?

689
00:48:28,664 --> 00:48:31,387
Did Hedgehog tell you?

690
00:48:32,247 --> 00:48:35,324
He couldn't bring himself to talk about it. He was suffering alone.

691
00:48:35,324 --> 00:48:38,728
So I asked Grandpa about it.

692
00:48:42,631 --> 00:48:44,047
I was hoping that

693
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:47,050
you wouldn't know about it.

694
00:48:48,331 --> 00:48:52,320
If I found out about it, you thought I might cry alone.

695
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,657
You didn't want me to cry.

696
00:48:55,657 --> 00:49:01,186
Did you cry because you were hurting for me?

697
00:49:05,874 --> 00:49:08,505
Hey, Won Il,

698
00:49:08,505 --> 00:49:09,775
I'm sorry.

699
00:49:09,775 --> 00:49:12,683
I'm really sorry.

700
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,206
But, I...

701
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:19,414
really like Hedgehog.

702
00:49:20,697 --> 00:49:26,179
What were you going to tell Hedgehog?
Not to tell me about it?

703
00:49:27,074 --> 00:49:29,713
To tell him not to date you.

704
00:49:31,925 --> 00:49:36,138
Hedgehog knows the best what it's like to live as his woman.

705
00:49:36,138 --> 00:49:38,175
If he truely cares about you...

706
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:41,134
Even if everyone in the world pointed their fingers at him,

707
00:49:41,134 --> 00:49:43,768
I still wouldn't care.

708
00:49:44,144 --> 00:49:46,660
Not everyone in the world

709
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,872
would accept Pan Da Yang,

710
00:49:48,872 --> 00:49:52,034
and would live up to my standards.

711
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:54,698
So, I will

712
00:49:54,698 --> 00:50:00,980
not be shaken by other peoples' gossip, criticisms, and opinions.

713
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:07,077
 I won't be ashamed of Hedgehog.

714
00:50:07,077 --> 00:50:10,258
 And I won't blame him either.

715
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:12,061
 Of course,

716
00:50:12,061 --> 00:50:14,343
 I acknowledge that he committed the crime.

717
00:50:14,343 --> 00:50:17,282
 But, anyone under the same circumstance

718
00:50:17,282 --> 00:50:19,845
 would have done the same thing.

719
00:50:19,845 --> 00:50:22,184
And I would have done even more.

720
00:50:22,994 --> 00:50:26,436
Among those who are critical of Hedgehog,

721
00:50:26,436 --> 00:50:29,093
how many would persevere more than Hedgehog?

722
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:31,492
How many would put more effort than Hedgehog, and

723
00:50:31,492 --> 00:50:35,148
get back on their feet?

724
00:50:35,753 --> 00:50:37,674
Therefore,

725
00:50:37,674 --> 00:50:40,759
I respect Hedgehog.

726
00:50:40,759 --> 00:50:43,771
Even if everyone in the world were critical of him,

727
00:50:43,771 --> 00:50:45,925
I'd always

728
00:50:45,925 --> 00:50:49,670
be at his side.

729
00:50:50,821 --> 00:50:53,407
If I standy by him, and

730
00:50:53,407 --> 00:50:56,964
if I have to get hit by the stones people throw,

731
00:50:56,964 --> 00:51:00,375
I'm ready to get hit for him.

732
00:51:02,505 --> 00:51:07,182
The love and protection he didn't get as a child,

733
00:51:07,182 --> 00:51:10,866
I'll will give to him in abundance starting now.

734
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:16,090
I realized this is my goal and duty.

735
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:20,231
A person

736
00:51:20,231 --> 00:51:23,347
has to have some sort of purpose

737
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:27,498
it's why it makes sense that we were born.

738
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:35,277
What?

739
00:51:39,235 --> 00:51:42,791
I envy Hedgehog.

740
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:47,044
This is our first and last date.

741
00:51:47,044 --> 00:51:50,188
I'm losing a great girl like you...

742
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:53,558
like this.

743
00:51:55,066 --> 00:51:58,413
I'm so proud of you,

744
00:51:58,413 --> 00:52:01,622
I feel sorry for you,

745
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:04,346
and I like you so much.

746
00:52:10,673 --> 00:52:13,128
I'm sorry.

747
00:52:13,128 --> 00:52:15,518
and I'm thankful.

748
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:18,911
I hate you.

749
00:52:21,019 --> 00:52:24,104
I hate Hedgehog more. Aish!

750
00:52:24,104 --> 00:52:26,121
Ok.

751
00:52:26,901 --> 00:52:30,264
Why are you holding my hand if you're saying you don't want to be with me?

752
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:35,500
Right now, you're a lot like you were when we were little.

753
00:52:37,339 --> 00:52:39,037
It's been 20 years.

754
00:52:39,037 --> 00:52:43,252
That's the last time I sang it. For you.

755
00:52:43,722 --> 00:52:49,658
I'm singing it now because I'm reminded of when I sang it to you to make you feel better when we were kids.

756
00:52:49,658 --> 00:52:51,061
What?

757
00:52:53,258 --> 00:52:59,336
 Maculinea teleius

758
00:52:59,336 --> 00:53:05,230
 Aspidomorpha transparipennis

759
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:10,746
 Rhyssa persuasoria

760
00:53:10,746 --> 00:53:17,704
 Homotropus tarsatorius

761
00:53:20,493 --> 00:53:23,144
Ah, are you leaving?

762
00:53:23,144 --> 00:53:26,121
Are you coming just now?

763
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:28,347
Yeah.

764
00:53:28,347 --> 00:53:29,602
I'll see you tomorrow.

765
00:53:29,602 --> 00:53:30,791
Are you coming tomorrow again?

766
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:33,398
He told me to come since he has something to show me.

767
00:53:33,398 --> 00:53:34,276
What?

768
00:53:34,276 --> 00:53:36,621
I don't know.

769
00:53:38,686 --> 00:53:43,861
Don't wander around, go home directly, get it?

770
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:48,041
Oh, a little hedgehog.

771
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,909
You made all this?

772
00:53:57,995 --> 00:54:01,065
Did you get mad because he said they didn't taste good?

773
00:54:01,065 --> 00:54:03,775
That's not why I'm mad.

774
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,749
Then?

775
00:54:05,749 --> 00:54:08,008
Because of this,

776
00:54:08,008 --> 00:54:10,074
I'd find peace,

777
00:54:10,074 --> 00:54:13,914
and I was able to endure. But he...

778
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,891
Since you're older than him and have more experience in life,

779
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:34,241
he'll learn fast because he has been watching you.

780
00:54:34,241 --> 00:54:37,498
Oh yes.  The prayer.

781
00:54:39,505 --> 00:54:44,508
Thank you for helping our Hedgehog endure the hard times on his own

782
00:54:44,508 --> 00:54:48,722
and grow to know how to make such delicious cakes.

783
00:54:48,722 --> 00:54:53,602
and for allowing me to eat his cakes.  Thank you.

784
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:55,875
The secrets of his life that are hidden

785
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:59,404
here in these

786
00:54:59,404 --> 00:55:01,246
Thank you for allowing me to learn them

787
00:55:01,246 --> 00:55:05,668
and share them with him.

788
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:13,106
Please help him to realize what an incredible person he is.

789
00:55:13,106 --> 00:55:15,547
The Hedgehog I see

790
00:55:15,547 --> 00:55:18,628
the Hedgehog I know

791
00:55:18,628 --> 00:55:22,698
compared to any men in this world I know, he is stronger

792
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:24,650
and cooler

793
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:28,139
and more amazing. Let him see that as well.

794
00:55:30,959 --> 00:55:34,508
Whatever his past

795
00:55:34,508 --> 00:55:38,742
however Hedgehog feels about where he's been

796
00:55:38,742 --> 00:55:42,286
the way I feel is...

797
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:49,548
I wish I'd...

798
00:55:49,548 --> 00:55:54,362
It would have been so much better if I'd been by Hedgehog's side.

799
00:55:54,362 --> 00:55:58,308
I hurt so much.

800
00:55:59,986 --> 00:56:05,003
It's so pitiful that he cried all alone.

801
00:56:06,788 --> 00:56:10,641
My heart hurts for him.

802
00:56:14,447 --> 00:56:19,045
And I will never...

803
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:21,898
never, never

804
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,578
leave him alone again.

805
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:16,929
 Hyung, you can take care of the business without Director Choi, right?

806
00:57:16,929 --> 00:57:21,757
 Keep one thing in mind. You have to do it once the replacement is found. Okay?

807
00:57:21,757 --> 00:57:25,757
 Why did you have to steal someone else's face to advertise us? Seriously, what's the reason?!

808
00:57:25,757 --> 00:57:30,604
 That's how I grew this business. You think you're really something.

809
00:57:30,604 --> 00:57:31,669
 Please watch what you say.

810
00:57:31,669 --> 00:57:32,454
 You jerk!

811
00:57:32,454 --> 00:57:34,186
 Get out!

812
00:57:34,186 --> 00:57:36,916
 I told you not to do it until I'm ready!

813
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:38,402
