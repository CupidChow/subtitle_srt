1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,346

2
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:50,219
Guys say hello. He's the representative for  the advertising company.

3
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,398
He is a famous advertising consultant.

4
00:00:52,398 --> 00:00:54,513
Hello.

5
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,596
I'm Ha In Ho.

6
00:00:55,596 --> 00:01:00,535
You could have called... 
Since you came in person, does that mean I was accepted?

7
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:02,779
I am sorry to you.

8
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:06,603
If I wasn't accepted, why did you come?

9
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:10,808
You mean he came earlier in the week?

10
00:01:10,808 --> 00:01:11,796
Yes.

11
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:15,353
He kept looking at only the panda and hedgehog macarons(sweet meringue cookie)  before leaving.

12
00:01:15,353 --> 00:01:19,505
His reason for coming here is exactly that!

13
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:22,368
He fell for the macarons you introduced took to the interview?

14
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:28,521
Do you think a busy person like him would come all the way here again to buy just macarons? 
If it's not work, what is it?

15
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,482
You mean he likes you?

16
00:01:30,482 --> 00:01:35,838
Hey, hey, hey! Even if you know, you're not supposed to say anything. You don't know the basics of dating.

17
00:01:35,838 --> 00:01:39,243
What are you doing? What will you do if she faints?

18
00:01:39,243 --> 00:01:42,146
Why did you come? 
Did he ask to come see what I was doing?

19
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:50,390
That's not why. 
He said he wants me to make macarons. 
Macarons that taste like dating. What's that?

20
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,625
This... who designed these?

21
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,860
The President made them...

22
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,723
How are they? They'll be successful, right?

23
00:02:17,723 --> 00:02:24,393
A person needs to rest. After resting, my mind is working and ideas are flowing.

24
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:33,319
You should rest too. 
Since you only study all the time, 
you're dissatisfied with everything, 
and offensive like that.

25
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,969
What did you look at before you made these?

26
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:38,243
What did I see?

27
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:48,845
I saw lamb clouds, bear-like caddies, and droppings of birds.

28
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:51,346
Who did this?!

29
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:54,570
I  did.

30
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,473
Just know I am embarrassed.

31
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:58,451
Why are you embarrassed?

32
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:01,798
Is it wrong for artists to express?

33
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:05,889
Then, throughout the world, artists should be embarrassed.

34
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,670
These macarons are definitely...!

35
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,336
The foreign customers are here. Please prepare quickly.

36
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:11,966
Prepare different products.

37
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:17,876
How far are we in the preparations for the customers?

38
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:20,699
We have already wrapped them.

39
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,128
Do you run the company like this?

40
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:27,254
Aigoo. Why is the atmosphere like this? 
Are you trying to fight with your father?

41
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:31,031
It's only been about a month and your making trouble already?!

42
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:35,021
Did you have a hard life in America?
You really don't have anywhere to vent your anger?

43
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:37,892
When that happens, a cake is the best.

44
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:38,710
The manager should eat some cake.

45
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,679
Please give me time.

46
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,164
Until tomorrow morning.

47
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,860
Okay.

48
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,769
I'll ask a question.

49
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,863
What kind of advertisement is it?

50
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:19,561
An item for two people who start dating.

51
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,048
So you can't say anything more than that...

52
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:27,265
That's okay. The next important discussion.

53
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:28,249
Money?

54
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:29,547
That's right!

55
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:34,967
After completing a hard assignment, 
just selling one 2,000-won macaron is a waste.

56
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:36,693
500.

57
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:43,191
Ahjusshi, are you joking? 
500 won isn't even enough to cover the materials. 
What do you mean by 500?

58
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,131
10,000 won?

59
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:53,825
One macaron 500 won. If you succeed, 100,000 won.

60
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:59,709
That is also a great condition.

61
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:03,424
Where'd you see me that you'd offer me this?

62
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:07,082
Your work is superior than the place I originally entrusted.

63
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:09,213
And where was that?

64
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:11,315
Saint Honore.

65
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,004
If you don't have any more questions...

66
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:16,044
I won't accept the money.

67
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:23,588
If you chose me over Saint Honore, I don't need your money. But,

68
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:24,855
But?

69
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:30,014
Please write about your decision to choose me over Saint Honore, and if it's right.

70
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:47,351
Ah! 500 just left.

71
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:49,471
Don't you know the saying?

72
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:53,423
I know, you'll lose the big thing
 while going after the small thing.

73
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:56,589
If you know, leave the man alone then.

74
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:05,776
I don't want to do anything i just want to get the money. If hedgehog doesn't get the supplies than he won't bake.

75
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:09,004
Are you really a journalist?

76
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:10,539
Yes, I am.

77
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:15,304
If you are a journalist, then you wouldn't think this badly.

78
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:21,201
If he could just say once "The macaron in the ad is..."!

79
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:30,345
Excuse me, what is that?

80
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:33,881
Ah, the President wanted me to take this to the manager.

81
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:36,089
Please give it to me. I'm going to meet the manager now.

82
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:41,029
The President said to explain it thoroughly to the manager before he tries it.

83
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:42,580
Explain what?

84
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:51,505
This is a welcome present for foreign customers. 
Lion, tiger, monkey, bear, sheep, he made our country's representatives...

85
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:58,037
This is...

86
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:12,319
Copying... Does Panda have evidence?

87
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,234
If it was an exact copy... but if it was altered...

88
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:19,225
Unless he can be honest about it...

89
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:23,370
Aren't we misunderstanding?

90
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:30,024
If he copied hedgehog's design, the President would try to hide it... But if he sent it up for you to eat.

91
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,808
You didn't ask them to bring it... 
He sent it so you could taste it?

92
00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:45,819
Have you ever dated?

93
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:50,672
At my age, you think I haven't dated...

94
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:54,978
Trick a ghost, why don't you?

95
00:07:54,978 --> 00:08:02,102
Okay. Let's say you've dated and you've been on a date. 
Go around like people who are dating.

96
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:03,866
With who?

97
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:06,890
Who do you think?

98
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:12,743
Hedgehog, you can make it well, right? 
It's not just a normal opportunity.

99
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,645
Say something that makes sense!

100
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:20,191
Then, do you want to go around with me?

101
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:21,539
Excuse me?

102
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:22,685
Excuse me?

103
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:28,519
Just keep staring and see if you can come up with a macaron that man wants.

104
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,832
Oh...

105
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:46,975
Don't you think it's a plan to corner the manager into a corner?

106
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:48,042
What does that mean?

107
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,981
There's a rumor that the manager doesn't eat cakes.

108
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:53,583
From the day he started work to now, he hasn't eaten one.

109
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,195
He might not have because he doesn't like the President's cakes.

110
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:59,411
Then why does he always eat sandwiches, it doesn't make sense.

111
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:05,072
Then... he knows the manager doesn't eat cakes but sent them up anyway?

112
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,312
Since he asked you to eat it, you're going to eat it?

113
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:11,597
I have to eat it to do something.

114
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:17,153
Whether or not the President copied Go Seung Ji,
Whether or not Saint Honore needs Choi Won Il.

115
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:22,086
And, Choi Won Il's patissier can only be Ko Seung Ji.

116
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:24,681
Eat it when you can eat it.

117
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,748
When will I be able to? When?

118
00:09:26,748 --> 00:09:28,512
You don't know when?

119
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:31,205
Are you saying this because you don't know why you're not allowed to eat it?

120
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:35,485
You have to change your way of thinking before you eat.

121
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:38,560
You're not the only one who shouldn't be eating.

122
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,253
President Choi is someone who shouldn't be making or eating cakes.

123
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:47,886
But, look at him boldly making, eating, peeling, and unraveling.

124
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:51,862
You doing this... means you've lost.

125
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:55,251
So come out of that memory!

126
00:10:11,164 --> 00:10:14,963
If other people saw, they would think you were doing something really important.

127
00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:19,267
It is important. Cafe Panda's future is at stake.

128
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:23,045
Making a macaron. What future is at stake?

129
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:28,293
It's not just a macaron. It's like Cinderella's pumpkin existence.

130
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:33,067
Then that's good! When the clock strikes 12, it's a pumpkin again.

131
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,369
How can one be so negative?

132
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:43,692
To think of it Unni did a really nice job tell a writer like that to come to see you, so you should pay her back.

133
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:46,782
I'll come down after I changed clothes, ok?

134
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:54,372
It's always those kind of clothes... Why does she need to change?

135
00:10:55,957 --> 00:10:56,948
We're back!

136
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,545
Hyung-nim, why are you outside?

137
00:10:58,545 --> 00:10:59,357
Did you buy everything?

138
00:10:59,357 --> 00:10:59,884
Yes.

139
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:00,570
Give it to me.

140
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,950
 He's really handsome.

141
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,165
But where are you going? Why did we have to come quickly?

142
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:08,929
We bought everything.

143
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,402
Tada!

144
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:19,091
But... the two of you... your clothes...

145
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:21,370
Are you going on a date, hyung-nim?

146
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:24,924
Ah! What are you doing?

147
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:29,175
Over here.

148
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:30,561
Ah, what's this?

149
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:31,808
What?

150
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:36,025
Does it make any sense for the cafe owner to bring her date to the cafe?

151
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:36,905
Is this strange?

152
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:37,913
Of course, it's strange.

153
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:41,247
Why do you even waste gas money?
You could have stay put at Panda Cafe.

154
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:44,380
Alright. Let's move on to the next course.

155
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,805
Give me your wallet. 
I have to know about our dating schedule.

156
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:52,984
Hey, it'll spoil the excitement.
 Just follow me, trust me.

157
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:55,831
One, two, three, go.

158
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:04,530
So what do you want to do?

159
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,565
What?!

160
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:09,256
All the couples i see do this, its a perfect date.

161
00:12:09,256 --> 00:12:12,602
What kind of girl wants to go to a public bath on her first date? You're not even a man.

162
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:15,377
It's not a public bath, it's a steam room.

163
00:12:15,377 --> 00:12:19,768
We can eat boiled eggs, put our hair up like this, and watch TV lying down side by side.

164
00:12:19,768 --> 00:12:21,630
What?

165
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,202
Lay down side by side?

166
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:30,397
If it's a little strange...Maybe one person can sit up.

167
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:37,020
You can put an electric blanket down, eat boiled eggs, and watch TV at home. Why do you need to come here?

168
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,133
You pick a place then.

169
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:42,028
Me?

170
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:45,041
How about this?

171
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,192
It's better that I pick, right?

172
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:48,415
This is the third course I thought about.

173
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:51,042
You don't have great ideas either.

174
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:52,325
Just pick a movie.

175
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:54,966
An action movie, of course.

176
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,677
No! It has to be a melodrama.

177
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:01,276
We're pretending to be dating.

178
00:13:01,276 --> 00:13:03,276
-We can do anything!
-Anything!

179
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:05,545
If we do it together!

180
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:07,572
 All of us together!

181
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:11,144
 This is our circus.

182
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:04,442
What's with her?

183
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:12,723
I'm sorry.

184
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,680
Boss, aren't you going home?

185
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,127
Ah...I still have some work left. Why?

186
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:38,068
I was going to go with you to Da Yang's.

187
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:42,657
To stay alone or go alone, isn't it so so?

188
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:50,933
Alright, let's go.

189
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:56,251
 The first step succeeded in breaking down
 the brick wall to get to his heart. Aja!

190
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,951
My body feels rested.

191
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:00,609
Should we start playing?

192
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,299
Playing?

193
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:05,415
I just go home and sleep. 
That is, sleep soundly.

194
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:09,133
Are you mad that I didn't watch the movie well?

195
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:13,153
I wanted to die because of embarrassment.

196
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:16,838
How can a girl snore like that?

197
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:20,155
Was I snoring?

198
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:22,761
That's my first time hearing that.

199
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,673
Didn't you hear what others said?

200
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:29,290
You couldn't hear me because of your snoring?

201
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:34,566
The snoring Panda is wrecking it, really.

202
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,558
What's being wrecked? It's just being human.

203
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:39,628
Let's go, to get replenished.

204
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:42,340
1, 2, 3 Go!

205
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,186
You're acting so natural right now.

206
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:47,615
The sense of lending money when you have a lot.

207
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,360
I look like a cash provider, right?

208
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,726
Yes.

209
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:57,207
I...don't have any tears to shed or blood to lose.

210
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:01,077
If you don't take my money seriously!

211
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:02,280
Scary, right?

212
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:09,086
Oh, you're scary...Like the tattoo your back...

213
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:12,354
Let's go

214
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:14,242
You make no sense at all!

215
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:21,537
A panda has so much fur that no matter how much a hedgehog pricks, it won't feel it.

216
00:16:25,764 --> 00:16:28,363
Woah, they're pretty.

217
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,058
What do you think of this one?

218
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,069
You mean me?

219
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:38,981
It's not for me. It's for Panda.

220
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:43,342
Let me see.

221
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:46,257
Ow, it's prickly!

222
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:46,997
Don't do that.

223
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:49,707
Did Da Yang really say she doesnn't want Ko Seung Ji to get hired?

224
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:53,914
Not only that, but she made all kinds of fuss about it.

225
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:57,984
If Hedgehog gets famous, gets recruited by someone else, would you take the responsibility?

226
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,001
What are we?

227
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:02,612
Would you like it if we went out of business?

228
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:05,068
That's what she said.

229
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:08,344
How could she think of me like that?

230
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:10,171
She's always like that.

231
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:12,073
That's why she doesn't have any friends.

232
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:15,211
Of course it's me, who is just putting up with her.

233
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:16,623
Oh, don't even talk about her.

234
00:17:16,623 --> 00:17:22,033
If I were to talk about her strange personality, 
we have to talk 5 nights/6 days.

235
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:27,100
Is there any other reason that I don't know, so why she's mad at me?

236
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,028
She's not mad at you.

237
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:31,492
She's just not interested in you.

238
00:17:31,492 --> 00:17:32,096
Why?

239
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:37,149
She totally fell for Hedgehog, why would she have her eyes on another man?

240
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:40,134
She only have 350 won ($30) in her bank account, now

241
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:42,724
she is worried about money and cake.

242
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:45,510
Man who can give me everything I want.

243
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,318
A set of assorted presents from heaven.

244
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,131
It's something to be completely absorbed to!

245
00:17:51,131 --> 00:17:55,980
Since she's a little thick-headed, she can focus well.

246
00:17:58,316 --> 00:18:04,115
I'm saying this because I'm the closest person to you.

247
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:07,084
Why can't you eat cake?

248
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:11,937
You probably had a bad indigestion.

249
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:16,030
Well that's why i can't eat from the dagok store.

250
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,940
Well its not my problem since I'm not running that business.

251
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,037
If you don't want to make saint honore better don't you have to try the cakes.

252
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:28,352
Should I be your lips and tongue?

253
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:29,773
Pardon?

254
00:18:29,773 --> 00:18:34,135
I don't know about anything else,
but I'm really good at tasting cakes.

255
00:18:34,135 --> 00:18:38,241
I got my position as a business director with my palate.

256
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:42,485
I scored the top on the practical exam, and I was noticed by the vice president.

257
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:46,166
The written exam was a disaster.

258
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:54,590
I...got carried away showing off my good points.
It brought me a notch down.

259
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:57,514
 They say time heals everything.

260
00:18:57,514 --> 00:19:02,269
 Anyway, the first step in breaking the brick wall was a success. Aja!

261
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,911
Ah, it's tiring.

262
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:19,168
Come with me, hurry up. Hurry.

263
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:22,496
For me, I like that one, so, what do you think, Hedgehog?

264
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,145
Everything's pretty.

265
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:28,873
Please don't be like this. This one's pretty. That one's pretty, too.

266
00:19:28,873 --> 00:19:30,621
Should I try them on?

267
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:32,824
If so, let's buy it all, then.

268
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:40,936
Wow, so cool!

269
00:19:42,856 --> 00:19:44,780
And this one...

270
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,001
Between these two, which one looks better on me? This one? Or this one?

271
00:19:49,993 --> 00:19:51,874
Ok.

272
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:08,106
Speaking of ByunBinGo, ByunBinGo came.

273
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,931
How are you?
How are you?

274
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,356
I'm not doing well.

275
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:15,981
If there were a lot of taxi customers, 
would I be sitting here at this hour?

276
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,211
Are Da Yang and Hedgehog here?

277
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:19,833
They went on a date.

278
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,681
I'm sorry, they went on what?

279
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:24,059
I said, they went on a date.

280
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,860
Did Da Na and Won Yi tag along with them?

281
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,395
Why would they bring those people along on their date?

282
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,741
Da Na and Won Yi went out to have dinner with Hedgehog's friends.

283
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:35,861
Won Yi hangs out with Ko Seung Ji's friends?

284
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,389
Wouldn't she hang out with anybody?

285
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:42,333
She follows Hedgehog's friends around calling them "Hyungnim".

286
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:47,788
By the way, where is the massage chair?

287
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,826
Boss has too many questions.

288
00:20:50,826 --> 00:20:55,376
Since Hedgehog uses it the most, 
we put it in his room.

289
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:06,500
It's pretty, isn't it?

290
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:11,697
Fan them.

291
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:15,444
Wow, so pretty~

292
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,896
Hedgehog, where should I apply?

293
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:32,337
What's this?

294
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,822
YA!!

295
00:21:34,822 --> 00:21:36,777
What's up with her temper?!

296
00:21:36,777 --> 00:21:38,453
How come a girl is that fast?

297
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:40,659
Ahjusshi!!!

298
00:21:44,214 --> 00:21:47,171
Why are you following me like a crazy?!

299
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,778
I'll get you properly today!

300
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:10,730
Why are you catching me?!

301
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,550
It's him!

302
00:22:16,183 --> 00:22:17,967
What are they doing?

303
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:19,887
No let go i have to catch him! 
 Why!?

304
00:22:19,887 --> 00:22:23,589
Oh, Kang Eun Bi!
Kang Eun Bi is my blind date!

305
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:26,797
Why is Choi Won Il suddenly kidnapping her?

306
00:22:26,797 --> 00:22:29,541
Aish, and I wore my clothes like this!!

307
00:22:32,195 --> 00:22:35,163
It would be like a riot relationship with her.

308
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:37,774
Instead of Kang Eun Bi dating Gi Tae,

309
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,862
it would be faster for me to marry Beom Bo.

310
00:22:40,862 --> 00:22:43,244
You have no manners!

311
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:50,840
I almost got him. It's because of Hyung he got away.

312
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,418
Who told you to catch Gil Dong Gu?

313
00:22:53,418 --> 00:22:56,991
Hedgehog Hyung told us to catch him right away when we see Gil Dong Gu.

314
00:22:56,991 --> 00:22:59,383
WHOSE SISTER ARE YOU?!

315
00:23:00,994 --> 00:23:03,724
Aish! Why is our Hyung being that angry?

316
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:06,213
It's because Da Yang and Hedgehog weren't there.

317
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:09,742
Why are you mad at people who went out to go work?

318
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:10,370
They went out to work?

319
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,304
Of course.

320
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:14,615
I heard they are went out on a date.

321
00:23:14,615 --> 00:23:19,373
They are not on a date, 
but went to find out about dating.

322
00:23:19,373 --> 00:23:22,279
What is "finding out about dating"?

323
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:29,115
An independent company told them to make macarons that just began dating, 
so they went out looking to date.

324
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:31,723
It was a project that couldn't be missed.

325
00:23:31,723 --> 00:23:35,680
They said they'll pay 500 for one macaron.

326
00:23:36,685 --> 00:23:37,723
Is that what it is?

327
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:39,890
Oh...that's what it is.

328
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,885
I didn't know that!

329
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:43,925
I knew you were acting strange for some reason.

330
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:46,807
Should we turn around and go after Gil Dong Goo?

331
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:49,227
Gil Dong Goo escaped a long time ago!

332
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,515
Probably so.

333
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:54,566
Just playing around...

334
00:24:12,027 --> 00:24:17,414
I can't live like this. 
I'm so frustrated that I can't make the macarons.

335
00:24:18,098 --> 00:24:21,014
This would be comfortable to wear at home, right?

336
00:24:21,014 --> 00:24:23,532
It really looks comfortable. 
Let's buy it, hurry.

337
00:24:23,532 --> 00:24:26,054
Just a moment. Let me look around a little more.

338
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:28,470
Just buy it for now. 
Look at it all you want at home.

339
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,390
Why do you insist on going home?

340
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,615
Because Da Na and Won Il may be waiting for us.

341
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:36,248
Why would they wait up for us? They'd play by themselves anyway.

342
00:24:36,248 --> 00:24:38,678
Has she been holding on to your wrists from early on?

343
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,134
Pardon?

344
00:24:40,134 --> 00:24:46,286
People usually go shopping with their kids.
It's more comfortable for husbands to stay home.

345
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,290
Let's go.

346
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,475
You're leaving without finishing looking? 
 Dad, why don't you buy this for Mom?

347
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:58,207
-I'm not a mom!
-She's not a mom!

348
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:16,035
I... didn't know it was this late already.

349
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:19,592
To buy these things, we spent 4 hours.

350
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:22,344
4 hours is normal.

351
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:24,192
Get the money. I'm tired.

352
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:29,324
It's not me who has to know about dating, but it's you.

353
00:25:29,324 --> 00:25:33,811
Is shopping a way to start dating?
It's continuation of a headache.

354
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:40,252
A person with a headache shouldn't make the macarons, so we'll go wherever you want tomorrow.

355
00:25:40,797 --> 00:25:43,956
You really mean it, right?

356
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:47,384
I won't complain.

357
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:52,386
Fine. Then, sleep well tonight and
 I'll see you in the morning.

358
00:25:58,046 --> 00:26:01,265
You worked hard today, "Dad".

359
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:14,252
So you just came back?

360
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:19,693
Nobody there for me to explain, apologize, or compensate...

361
00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:22,225
You could have waited until they came back.

362
00:26:22,225 --> 00:26:25,544
They went out on a date!
How can I wait for them? I'm a man too.

363
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:29,359
You went there yesterday as the president of Saint Honore, not as a man.

364
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:33,244
Ah, I just have to talk well today.

365
00:26:33,244 --> 00:26:34,928
Don't get into a fight.

366
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:39,782
No, I won't get into a fight.
After finding out about the Macaron sales,
 I feel ashamed in front of Ko Seung Ji...

367
00:26:39,782 --> 00:26:41,039
How much did you sell?

368
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,931
Sold 1,000 and another 1,000.

369
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:50,747
So the bear plays tricks and 
someone else makes the money.

370
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:53,783
Did you tell Won Yi?

371
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:56,218
I didn't tell her.

372
00:26:56,218 --> 00:27:00,471
I couldn't tell her that her father is that kind of person.

373
00:27:00,471 --> 00:27:08,441
Of course. You did the right thing.
I was worried that Won Yi would get excited
 and things might go wrong.

374
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:11,435
She would do something wrong to Ko Seung Ji.

375
00:27:11,435 --> 00:27:13,828
That's why I didn't tell her.

376
00:27:13,828 --> 00:27:16,645
By the way, where did she go this early?

377
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:20,301
I don't know. I wonder what she is up to.

378
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:22,497
After receiving help from you, Representative,

379
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:26,262
we should have paid you back by 120%.

380
00:27:26,262 --> 00:27:36,377
im sorry because of that wedding party...

381
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:46,058
When did you make them?

382
00:27:46,058 --> 00:27:51,026
Yesterday. As soon as they came out, we sold 2,000.

383
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:53,831
Do these give you completely different feeling from the ones you've seen before?

384
00:27:53,831 --> 00:27:54,725
Right?

385
00:27:54,725 --> 00:28:00,567
If you use these macarons for advertising, they'll more than likely be a big hit!

386
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:03,205
Probably you already had a hunch.

387
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:10,108
Of course, we are not going to make exactly like these designs. I just wanted you to have an idea.

388
00:28:10,108 --> 00:28:11,846
I understand.

389
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:19,231
Does that mean you would use the macarons he made for advertising?

390
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:25,501
This is not something that I can decide on my own.
I need to discuss it with an advertiser.

391
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:28,162
What kind of person is this advertiser?

392
00:28:28,162 --> 00:28:30,720
He's David.

393
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:34,865
Bastard, he thinks he's so great.

394
00:28:34,865 --> 00:28:41,117
Just because he is advertising for the company, does he think he became a director?

395
00:28:41,117 --> 00:28:46,424
Even it's hard to put up with, just bear it.
If we get the advertising company on our side, the bad...

396
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:50,657
By the way...why did that bastard have a sour look on his face as soon as he opened the box?

397
00:28:50,657 --> 00:28:53,512
Perhaps, he knows about Hedgehog's macarons?

398
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:54,351
Huh?

399
00:28:54,351 --> 00:28:59,230
We can tell Won Yi not to say anything, 
and ask her to find out?
 So we can at least give him some money to keep his mouth closed.

400
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:06,164
Would Won Yi listen to you?
Stop the nonsense.

401
00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:08,293
Alright.

402
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:12,289
But, by looking at the representative's expression, it doesn't look like he wants to use ours.

403
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:13,819
I'll have to meet with President Cho.

404
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,851
You said you wouldn't use him because he is not a broker, but he's a con-artist.

405
00:29:16,851 --> 00:29:18,955
Standards like him he...

406
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:22,792
President Cho?

407
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:24,982
It's me.
Yes.

408
00:29:24,982 --> 00:29:26,297
Are you busy?

409
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,274
I was wondering if I can see you.

410
00:29:29,274 --> 00:29:32,311
Oh, I have something to put on the internet urgently.

411
00:29:32,311 --> 00:29:35,855
Also, I need to do some networking with some advertisers.

412
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:39,811
Ta-dah!

413
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,056
You're shocked because it's pretty, right?

414
00:29:42,056 --> 00:29:43,978
What are you wearing?

415
00:29:43,978 --> 00:29:48,336
Why? You bought this yesterday.
 I wore it on purpose.

416
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:52,197
I didn't buy it for you to wear today.
Go get your clothes and shoes changed.

417
00:29:52,197 --> 00:29:55,158
This is perfect for going on a date.

418
00:29:55,158 --> 00:29:57,874
How can you walk like this?

419
00:29:57,874 --> 00:30:03,413
We must be going shopping again today! I got it, I'll go change and come back really quick!

420
00:30:03,413 --> 00:30:05,617
She's really talking about shopping...

421
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:11,776
Oh, Hyung! It looks like you're... not going on a date today. What would you do today...

422
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,165
Oppa, can we go shopping with you too?

423
00:30:14,165 --> 00:30:15,159
We're not going shopping!!!

424
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:16,342
Then where are you going?!

425
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:18,683
These guys are always talking about shopping, shopping.

426
00:30:24,812 --> 00:30:26,599
Get out. This is it.

427
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:34,291
Why are we at a small mountain without my agreement?

428
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,833
Because if we climb a high mountain, our legs will hurt and we'll be tired.

429
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:41,233
I mean, whether it's a high mountain or a low one, why are we climbing up?

430
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:43,572
You would climb up a mountain instead of down, right?

431
00:30:44,544 --> 00:30:46,863
What will be there when we go up the mountain?

432
00:30:46,863 --> 00:30:48,406
When we go up the mountain?

433
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:53,766
There are trees, pretty flowers, and mineral water.

434
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:57,141
The trees and the flowers...

435
00:30:57,141 --> 00:31:03,668
They're over there too. For the water, all you have to do is find someone who sells it. 
What's the point of going up a mountain to drink it?

436
00:31:03,668 --> 00:31:05,779
Young people don't know anything.

437
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:09,232
Mineral water straight from the ground is so refreshing!

438
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:14,301
You can just bring a cooler and drink the ice. What's the point of climbing up a whole mountain?

439
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:17,690
And, I don't want to mess up my makeup with sweat today.

440
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:21,234
Makeup wouldn't help you.
Just making excuses with it...

441
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:25,198
Anyway, climbing a mountain sickens me, so let's go somewhere else!

442
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:28,389
And, does it make sense to tell a Panda to climb a mountain?

443
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:30,858
I'm Pan Da Yang! Panda!

444
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:38,431
Fine. Then I'll take you somewhere that matches with Panda perfectly! Follow me.

445
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:55,174
Alright! This is a place that matches with Panda perfectly, so grab it.

446
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:57,719
Grab what?

447
00:31:57,719 --> 00:32:01,962
Panda lays on a tree and stomach. There's the bar.

448
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,145
Go up and grab it.

449
00:32:03,145 --> 00:32:06,901
I can't believe this. I'm not even a real panda, so how could I go up there and grab it?

450
00:32:08,689 --> 00:32:12,307
You are a panda when you're hiking, but not when you have to grab a bar?

451
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:15,109
Does it make sense that I'm not a Panda?

452
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:21,813
Then, let's go the place where Hedgehog wants to tomorrow. 
I'll make sure you won't be uncomfortable.

453
00:32:21,813 --> 00:32:23,706
Don't worry.

454
00:32:23,706 --> 00:32:27,881
Says the Hedghog. 
 Does your name make sense for you?

455
00:32:28,998 --> 00:32:31,572
Hurry up and change your name! To Duck Feet!

456
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:36,530
Where are you going?

457
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,817
I'm going to go ride the van somewhere.

458
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:41,892
Where do you want to ride the car to?

459
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:46,106
Car?

460
00:32:56,428 --> 00:32:57,854
Get off. Duck Feet.

461
00:32:57,854 --> 00:32:59,665
What are we going to do here?

462
00:32:59,665 --> 00:33:04,401
You said you like cars.
I'll llet you ride the car as much as you want, so get off first.

463
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:07,873
But your dating manners have come out. 
You even opened the door for me.

464
00:33:07,873 --> 00:33:09,915
Of course.

465
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:17,234
Why are you getting in there?

466
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:18,705
Get in.

467
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,657
You're crazy! You didn't look like it, but you're a total pervert!

468
00:33:22,657 --> 00:33:26,654
You brought me to this totally vacant lot, and now you're telling me to sit on your lap?!

469
00:33:26,654 --> 00:33:28,971
Don't say things like that mindlessly.

470
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:30,680
Get in over there.

471
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,456
Why? Why are you telling me to do that?

472
00:33:33,456 --> 00:33:38,261
What else could we do besides driving in broad daylight in a vacant lot?

473
00:33:39,991 --> 00:33:42,324
Are you telling me to drive?

474
00:33:42,324 --> 00:33:48,922
As the advertisement is going out well, I'm going to be busy all day making cake, 
Who's going to go buy the ingredients?

475
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:50,873
You said there's no other way.

476
00:33:50,873 --> 00:33:52,814
Then there's Won Yi.

477
00:33:52,814 --> 00:33:55,512
She's here because it's summer break.

478
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,221
I'm not good at driving.

479
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:03,303
That's why I said that I'll teach you.

480
00:34:03,303 --> 00:34:06,481
Move. I'm closing the door, it's hot.

481
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:22,714
Just a moment. I need to get ready.

482
00:34:22,714 --> 00:34:24,534
You're going to make a phone call before you drive?

483
00:34:24,534 --> 00:34:28,554
That's not it. I'm worried that my face might get burnt.

484
00:34:28,554 --> 00:34:33,558
When you shop, you don't get a sunburn. So when you drive, you get a burn, that face?

485
00:34:33,558 --> 00:34:42,687
The sun is beaming so strong on this side! It'd be so weird if one side got a burn.
 If that happens, my eyes will get dark circles!

486
00:34:42,687 --> 00:34:49,317
When hiking, it's Panda.
When it's a pull-up bar, not a Panda. Driving, she's Panda.

487
00:34:49,317 --> 00:34:52,714
What's so confusing? Why'd you take that out again?

488
00:34:52,714 --> 00:34:55,096
To take a picture.

489
00:34:55,096 --> 00:34:58,069
You sure do all sorts of things.

490
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:59,585
You should also put some on.

491
00:34:59,585 --> 00:35:03,640
No, it's okay. Since I'm a Hedgehog, I won't get dark circles.

492
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,074
When we take a picture together your skin will look like...

493
00:35:08,074 --> 00:35:11,822
Ah, really! You make me do all sorts of things, really!

494
00:35:11,822 --> 00:35:14,230
How do you do it?

495
00:35:19,432 --> 00:35:21,784
With this?

496
00:35:26,731 --> 00:35:29,075
You sure are being in disguise.

497
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:35,675
Don't do that! What are you doing?!

498
00:35:36,518 --> 00:35:37,828
You became a Rudolph Hedgehog!

499
00:35:37,828 --> 00:35:40,736
What if you make my face all messed up for the picture?!

500
00:35:41,777 --> 00:35:43,741
Ah, really!

501
00:35:47,092 --> 00:35:48,364
What?

502
00:35:57,343 --> 00:35:59,331
Wait, wait.

503
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,829
 Oh, what are you doing?

504
00:36:03,555 --> 00:36:07,030
I was going to contact bong-o

505
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,435
Driving?

506
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:11,844
I got it, hang up.

507
00:36:11,844 --> 00:36:15,700
Why is someone who already has a driver's license practicing?

508
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,485
He said that he's teaching Panda and doesn't know when he'll come.

509
00:36:18,485 --> 00:36:19,664
He'll come soon!

510
00:36:19,664 --> 00:36:25,530
Agioo, this boy is really flirting around these days...

511
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,968
What do you think of this one?
This one?

512
00:36:34,295 --> 00:36:37,321
I really don't know I'm just gonna buy some.

513
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:40,207
What style does miss likes?

514
00:36:40,207 --> 00:36:41,382
M-miss?!

515
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:45,466
You like that miss so you told me to come with you and buy some clothes.

516
00:36:45,466 --> 00:36:50,488
If you were buying clothes as usual, 
I think you would come with Gi Tae or Seung Ji.

517
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:54,160
Tell me, I'll keep it as a secret.

518
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,348
Well that...

519
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:02,534
What if... Let's say those two get together.

520
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:07,649
Seung Ji will call me hyung?
Am I his hyung?

521
00:37:07,649 --> 00:37:10,020
Do you like Miss Da Na?

522
00:37:10,713 --> 00:37:13,457
I don't know if I like her yet.

523
00:37:13,457 --> 00:37:15,753
I just want to look nice.

524
00:37:17,141 --> 00:37:18,176
Would it work out well?

525
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:23,159
Da Na is a smart girl, wouldn't she find out what a good guy Beom Bo is?

526
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:25,037
Am I a good man?

527
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:29,366
Of course, you're a loyal man who will never have a change of heart.

528
00:37:29,366 --> 00:37:32,403
You won't do anything to hurt women's feelings either.

529
00:37:32,403 --> 00:37:33,698
Aren't you idiot?

530
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:35,234
How many time should I say this?

531
00:37:35,234 --> 00:37:38,230
I told you turn the handle to the left, and then to the right.

532
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,902
Why do you keep doing that?

533
00:37:42,544 --> 00:37:47,003
Once you learn how to drive, 
it'll stay with you all your life.

534
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:52,464
you're killing my ears, stop it!

535
00:37:52,464 --> 00:37:54,981
Why are you yelling at me!
You didn't do anything right.

536
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:58,294
Because I'm having a hard time.

537
00:38:00,076 --> 00:38:02,064
You were sitting there comfortably just now.

538
00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:05,815
If you think turning the handle a few times is hard,
what do you think of me standing in the sun!

539
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:07,399
Who told you to stand there!

540
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:09,859
You went out there to show off.

541
00:38:12,132 --> 00:38:18,259
You said you didn't know the relationship
 between the degree of
 the handle turn and how the wheels move. 
I came out to explain that!

542
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:20,080
If I don't know that, can I not drive?

543
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,656
It just has to go straight.

544
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:23,949
Why are you telling me to go left and right with the handle??

545
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:25,893
Think again very carefully.

546
00:38:25,893 --> 00:38:30,730
In that complicated supermarket, see if it'll work if you just drive straight!

547
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,498
If it's not, then I'll go to a nearby man and say,

548
00:38:33,498 --> 00:38:36,801
Can you please park this car for us
 What's the problem with that!

549
00:38:36,801 --> 00:38:37,849
Fine.

550
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:42,039
If you come to live like that. Tell this man to drive the car, tell that man to drive the car!

551
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:46,781
If there are no men around, just drive straight!
Maybe something will come up.

552
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:50,615
You'll drive the car all the way to Busan like that. (talking informally)

553
00:38:50,615 --> 00:38:53,148
You? (informal)

554
00:38:53,148 --> 00:38:55,488
Yea, it's you. Then is it me?

555
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,650
Saying "you" isn't just coming out now, is it?

556
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,414
I put you through a hard time yesterday and today too,

557
00:39:00,414 --> 00:39:01,952
So you're calling me 'you', aren't you?!

558
00:39:01,952 --> 00:39:06,408
Say something that makes sense. There was nowhere to go and you said that you liked cars!

559
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:08,366
I came out here to teach you how to drive!

560
00:39:08,366 --> 00:39:10,365
Nowhere to go?

561
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:13,963
You have to understand how to start dating first! Are you that insincere?!

562
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:15,949
Then what kind of macarons are you going to make??

563
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:18,779
Tell that man to just go to Saint Honore!

564
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:21,258
That you can NEVER make them!

565
00:39:30,614 --> 00:39:33,141
What are you going to do if you meet him?

566
00:39:33,141 --> 00:39:38,987
I'll do that think you want me to do the left.. Right thing.

567
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:41,897
I'm really mad!

568
00:39:41,897 --> 00:39:44,216
Don't joke around and say it straight out.

569
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:47,862
I'll do everything that you tell me. What is it? Just tell me.

570
00:39:47,862 --> 00:39:53,008
If I say it? Are you sure you can even do that?

571
00:39:55,182 --> 00:39:59,754
Are you looking down on me because I'm poor right now?

572
00:40:04,865 --> 00:40:09,511

573
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:16,463
I'm not talking about money. Whether it's makeup, cooking, or driving...

574
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:18,390
There's nothing that you do well.

575
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:22,111
Move your hand if you don't want your fingers to get squished.

576
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:41,625
You're really going?

577
00:41:09,272 --> 00:41:14,585
Wait Pan Da Yang is driving the car?

578
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:16,655
What is she doing?

579
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:33,740
Down, down.

580
00:41:35,683 --> 00:41:39,565
Get out. I'll drive for you.

581
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:42,033
R-really?

582
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:45,562
Would you even be able to go home like this?

583
00:41:46,707 --> 00:41:47,828
Thank god.

584
00:41:47,828 --> 00:41:51,368
I was thinking how to get back home, driving like this.

585
00:41:51,965 --> 00:41:54,932
Aigoo.

586
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:58,570
So why'd you drive?

587
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:03,721
Just a second, I think my legs are asleep because I'm too stressed out.

588
00:42:06,837 --> 00:42:09,685
I really said that I'd drive for you.

589
00:42:09,685 --> 00:42:13,235
I said that I'd drive, but my mind  suddenly  changes!

590
00:42:13,235 --> 00:42:18,292
I'll borrow it for a few days and MAKE SURE I'll return it, so don't worry!

591
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:25,169
Gil Dong Gu! Gil Dong Gu!

592
00:42:26,263 --> 00:42:28,785
Won't you stop there?!

593
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:32,878
Why won't the shoes get off!

594
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,387
What happen with Pan Da Yang this time?

595
00:42:39,387 --> 00:42:43,481
I'm so mad, why won't the fan even work??

596
00:42:43,481 --> 00:42:47,070
What's okay about you?!

597
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,893
You should've gone out in a suit, what is that?!

598
00:42:50,893 --> 00:42:52,918
Do you think this is your date?

599
00:42:52,918 --> 00:42:56,193
Didn't Pan Da Yang wear something all fluttery and pretty when she came out?

600
00:42:56,193 --> 00:43:00,149
If she was all fluttery and pretty, would I have taught her how to drive?

601
00:43:00,149 --> 00:43:04,359
She wore something pretty and you told her to change?!

602
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:06,053
Hurry up and go beg for her forgiveness.

603
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:08,757
She didn't even say a word and just drove off. 
 Why would I?

604
00:43:08,757 --> 00:43:10,689
Am I the only one without pride?

605
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:15,609
A thing that you should NEVER do to a girl is teaching how to drive!! How do you not know that?

606
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:17,252
Then what would you have done?!

607
00:43:17,252 --> 00:43:20,083
It's the nation's formula!

608
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,016
That's all because of macroon.

609
00:43:24,016 --> 00:43:26,144
What's with macroons?

610
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:33,521
Someone from some company told me to make special dating concept macroons. 
 so, at least I should have some experience.

611
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:39,161
So, I tried to do some dating, but I only ended up flipping out.

612
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:41,514
Idea was...

613
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,137
Stop fooling around and just go sleep.

614
00:43:44,137 --> 00:43:46,403
Why do you always be nice when I'm mad!

615
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:51,018
The idea is in your head so just get it all organized!

616
00:43:51,018 --> 00:43:52,681
What is there?

617
00:43:52,681 --> 00:43:56,709
The only thing in my head is Pan Da Yang!

618
00:43:56,709 --> 00:44:01,338
That's the start of dating, that!

619
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,763
What?

620
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:05,154
Hey!
Hello!

621
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,446
What's up with this? Why are you dressed like that? To go on a date?

622
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:13,954
See, brat?! These are the basics of dating, the basics!

623
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:17,570
Yeah, this is just me. 
 Just me.

624
00:44:18,475 --> 00:44:22,474
From the team they chose this picture.

625
00:44:24,016 --> 00:44:25,498
Were these 3.

626
00:44:25,498 --> 00:44:32,089
However, after looking at the results of the customers' reactions at the store,
 me thinking this was right, I made this in advance.

627
00:44:43,297 --> 00:44:47,452
Let's go with the one that was prepared at first with the first choice; And let's wrap up the meeting.

628
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:50,979
For the last time it will be a great one.

629
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,238
You've worked hard.

630
00:44:52,238 --> 00:44:54,732
You worked hard.

631
00:44:56,078 --> 00:44:57,789
Get up, get up, get up!

632
00:44:57,789 --> 00:44:59,730
A customer is here.

633
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,201
Hedgehog?

634
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:04,993
Is he a customer? He's family.

635
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,604
Won Il is here.

636
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:10,260
Change your clothes! You smell like sweat.

637
00:45:13,102 --> 00:45:16,728
After driving, finding Gil Dong Gu, and walking,

638
00:45:16,728 --> 00:45:20,801
I had a dying experience. Obviously this is why I'm like this.

639
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:25,465
you get the car stolen, you lose the macroon making hedgehog and you're worried now!

640
00:45:25,465 --> 00:45:27,947
Of course...

641
00:45:29,216 --> 00:45:32,938
Make Won Il's rice, not Hedgehog's!

642
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,489
Hyungnim, have some juice.

643
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:42,347
Wow, now you're evening serving?

644
00:45:42,347 --> 00:45:46,048
Of course! I'm a great server.

645
00:45:46,048 --> 00:45:48,432
Where is Go Seung Ji?

646
00:45:48,432 --> 00:45:54,764
What to do my hyung is really worrying a lot these days, and I'm really awesome at talking...

647
00:45:55,574 --> 00:45:58,523
If you don't respond, I'm not giving allowance for next month!

648
00:45:58,523 --> 00:46:02,872
Him and panda fought..

649
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:08,609
Da Yang!

650
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:09,758
You're here?

651
00:46:09,758 --> 00:46:14,093
Oh... But I thought you were a different person.

652
00:46:15,846 --> 00:46:18,894
Hyung, wipe your drool.

653
00:46:21,598 --> 00:46:24,047
You're pretty.

654
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,245
I'm so hungry I'm going to flip.

655
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,959
Pan Da Yang, as you know,

656
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:39,326
Since i have  no card or allowance I'll take your money okay

657
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:43,361
I should have left the phone.

658
00:46:46,068 --> 00:46:50,117
What?! Look at these guys!

659
00:46:53,307 --> 00:46:57,702
Are they dating or not?

660
00:46:57,702 --> 00:46:59,845
Wow, these...

661
00:46:59,845 --> 00:47:04,303
Hold on a sec, let's just check out of curiosity.

662
00:47:04,303 --> 00:47:09,100
Hm, Go Seung Ji's phone number is.....

663
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:18,797
Hyung! Don't munch so loud! 
It's bothering me to death, really!

664
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:20,479
I got it.

665
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:25,397
Hey, you're not the only one who feels that way. 
Our mood is also totally down because of you!

666
00:47:25,397 --> 00:47:26,732
What did I do?

667
00:47:26,732 --> 00:47:28,646
What?

668
00:47:28,646 --> 00:47:34,629
Hey! I couldn't even go to a single blind date and what!

669
00:47:34,629 --> 00:47:41,185
Him.. Hahaha. He even bought clothes.
 He couldn't even go near Cafe Panda. He gets abused from you.

670
00:47:41,185 --> 00:47:44,814
Hyung why are you also being like this

671
00:47:44,814 --> 00:47:48,497
Hey, I'm not laughing. Hey,

672
00:47:48,497 --> 00:47:51,154
I've also become old enough to do that.

673
00:47:51,154 --> 00:47:54,269
Is it just enough? We're 3 years older than you!

674
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:56,264
We're the ones who are more urgent.

675
00:47:56,264 --> 00:47:57,707
Seung Ji!

676
00:47:57,707 --> 00:48:00,139
You got a message!

677
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:02,841
He's got sharp hearing...

678
00:48:02,841 --> 00:48:04,673
What is it?

679
00:48:05,605 --> 00:48:08,887
 I like you. What about you, baby?

680
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:11,681
Give it back!

681
00:48:12,649 --> 00:48:14,426
Hurry up and give it back!

682
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:17,703
Wow, you guys came out a lot!

683
00:48:17,703 --> 00:48:20,258
Go out, go out where.

684
00:48:20,258 --> 00:48:22,859
I'm leaving. Don't say anything, okay?

685
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:24,274
Then, let's go too-

686
00:48:24,274 --> 00:48:27,142
No, just let him go for today.

687
00:48:27,142 --> 00:48:28,734
What did she say that he's like that?

688
00:48:28,734 --> 00:48:32,492
Hey, Pan Da Yang is stronger than she looks.

689
00:48:41,156 --> 00:48:46,755
What do you mean, "What about me"? 
What should I answer?

690
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:53,586
Oh, this is good, this one.

691
00:48:54,741 --> 00:48:57,419
Good, good, good.

692
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,407
Good.

693
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:35,587
I'll give you Hedgehog's number, so just call him.

694
00:49:35,587 --> 00:49:38,095
It's because it's not something to talk about over the phone.

695
00:49:38,095 --> 00:49:42,960
Then let's meet another day. I'm kind of tired.

696
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,564
Really?

697
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,116
I got it. I'll tell them that.

698
00:49:47,116 --> 00:49:50,375
Ah, by the way, take the massage chair with you.

699
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:55,712
Wait. It's not, 'by the way'. Why is the massage chair in Hedgehog's room?

700
00:49:55,712 --> 00:49:58,348
Huh?

701
00:49:58,348 --> 00:49:59,837
That...

702
00:49:59,837 --> 00:50:01,972
Just use it, please.

703
00:50:01,972 --> 00:50:06,069
That present is my heart. You shouldn't talk about the heart through money.

704
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:09,917
You're not wrong, but it's still too expensive.

705
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:12,756
Enough! Stop talking about that.

706
00:50:12,756 --> 00:50:15,366
Should we go for a drive?

707
00:50:15,366 --> 00:50:19,288
Why? Because our cafe is a size of a booger, do you feel stuffy?

708
00:50:19,288 --> 00:50:23,788
Hey seriously! That's.. that's...

709
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:27,786
I was just telling you those "what-if" scenarios.
Do you think,

710
00:50:27,786 --> 00:50:33,097
that I would actually talk about your parents' cafe like that? It's not like I don't know them at all..

711
00:50:33,097 --> 00:50:35,405
Really, it's a misunderstanding. Release it.

712
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:40,026
I'm sorry if I ruined your mood, I was wrong, okay? Sorry.

713
00:50:40,026 --> 00:50:44,047
I got it. If you do that again next time, I really won't see you anymore.

714
00:50:44,047 --> 00:50:46,450
I got it. I really won't do it. Ok?

715
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:51,236
but instead we need to make a promise? okay?

716
00:50:51,236 --> 00:50:53,397
Do you know how mad I was because of you?

717
00:50:53,397 --> 00:50:57,126
I was mad too! How could you do me like that?

718
00:50:57,126 --> 00:51:00,237
You were too much, really!

719
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,460
Aish!

720
00:51:09,547 --> 00:51:12,937
So you sent me a text to make me see you with ByunBinGo, huh.

721
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:16,750
You're really using your head however you want.

722
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:26,130
I don't care. I'll just erase it.

723
00:51:29,709 --> 00:51:32,710
Aish, where is it?

724
00:51:46,962 --> 00:51:50,742
I'm not going to see you again, just watch!

725
00:51:50,742 --> 00:51:53,866
I'm not seeing you again.

726
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,090
Hurry!

727
00:52:44,399 --> 00:52:47,868
Maculinea teleius.

728
00:52:47,868 --> 00:52:51,004
Aspidomorpha transparipennis.

729
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:55,575
Rhyssa persuasoria.

730
00:52:55,575 --> 00:53:01,445
Homotropus tarsatorius.

731
00:53:02,754 --> 00:53:05,330
The start of dating!

732
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:10,172
1, 2, 3. Go!

733
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:41,471

734
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:19,096
 "Big Hit of Launching Sales With 2000 pieces, Opens the Macaron Generation"

735
00:55:19,334 --> 00:55:21,636
Oh, Da Yang! Are the macaroons done?

736
00:55:21,636 --> 00:55:25,667
Yes. It's on top of the table, so send them.

737
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:29,472
Hey, hey! Hey, where are you going?!

738
00:55:32,424 --> 00:55:36,020
As expected of Hedgehog!

739
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,517
So pretty!

740
00:55:37,517 --> 00:55:39,109
Hello.

741
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:40,893
Oh.

742
00:55:40,893 --> 00:55:43,582
Why are you here so early in the morning?

743
00:55:43,582 --> 00:55:47,050
Um, where is Seung Ji?

744
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:50,144
Right here.

745
00:55:57,201 --> 00:56:01,163
Beom Bo, Beom Bo! Where's Hedgehog?

746
00:56:01,163 --> 00:56:03,784
Hedgehog?

747
00:56:16,939 --> 00:56:22,003
Hedgehog! Hedgehog! Hedgehog!

748
00:56:56,735 --> 00:57:00,265
 Who would you want to kiss amongst the two of them?

749
00:57:00,265 --> 00:57:02,330
 I've never tried either, so I don't know.

750
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:03,452
 Then try it!

751
00:57:03,452 --> 00:57:09,893
 Beom Bo called, then Pan Da Yang and Choi Won Il were being strange in the car. But then,

752
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:11,535
 Seung Ji received that call.

753
00:57:11,535 --> 00:57:12,957
 Why are you looking at me like that?

754
00:57:12,957 --> 00:57:14,196
 Clean your mouth!

755
00:57:14,196 --> 00:57:16,027
 Would she still kill me eventhough she likes me?

756
00:57:16,027 --> 00:57:21,717
 Come to your senses Ko Seung Ji.
Do you still like women?
