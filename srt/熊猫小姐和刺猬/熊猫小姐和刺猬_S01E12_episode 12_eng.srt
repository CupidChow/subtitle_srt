1
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,286

2
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:50,739
 Episode 12

3
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:57,354
Say it again! Say "little bastard" again!

4
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:11,898
They're crazy! They're crazy!

5
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:14,581
How could they fistfight in a broad daylight?

6
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:19,299
Even though he likes me so much, 
why is Won Il  not getting over me?

7
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:22,404
And for Hedgehog, since he has me,

8
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:25,379
doesn't he feel sorry for Won Il, and treat him nicer?

9
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,699
He gave up on cake, patissier, and lost out in a love triangle.

10
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:31,878
Instead of consoling him, he beats him up?

11
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:34,234
He's even 2 years older than him.

12
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:37,095
I'll... those guys... really.

13
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:39,790
"Little bastard", huh?

14
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,119
Say it again. Say "little bastard" again!

15
00:01:43,824 --> 00:01:46,276
You're so annoying.

16
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:51,137
-Do it.
-You're dead!

17
00:01:51,137 --> 00:01:53,444
Alright!

18
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:54,919
What are you doing?

19
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:00,946
More?

20
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:05,404
Aish! Really...!

21
00:02:05,404 --> 00:02:08,113
You're no match for me

22
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:15,162
Stop it right now!

23
00:02:15,162 --> 00:02:17,510
Why?

24
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,780
Why aren't you breaking up the fight?

25
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,544
First fighting is the best one to watch.

26
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,560
Noonim, why don't you sit down here, hurry.

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,482
It started not long ago.

28
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:31,788
Choi Won Il!

29
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:39,335
Why are you hitting me?!

30
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:42,131
He's the one who started first!

31
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:43,909
Is that true?

32
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:45,064
Yeah.

33
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,688
Are you proud of it? Are you proud of it?

34
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:49,673
What gives you the right to pick a fight first? 
He doesn't even feel good emotionally.

35
00:02:49,673 --> 00:02:51,536
He wanted to fight. I should have just put up with it?

36
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:53,196
Of course that's what you should've done.

37
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:54,752
Put yourself in his situation.

38
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:58,625
If you, Hedgehog, were to lose out in a love triangle, won't you pick a fight too?

39
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,407
That's not why we had a fight!

40
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:07,089
-Then why?
-He called me a "little bastard", 
and he also told me to call him "Hyung".

41
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:11,049
Is that what you did?!

42
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:12,146
Yeah.

43
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:14,141
You said "yeah"? 
How can you talk like that here?

44
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:16,774
To someone who is 2 years older than you, 
you didn't even call him by his name, 
and you called him...

45
00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:18,922
a "little bastard"? How could you call him that?!

46
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:20,872
And, "Hyung"?

47
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:22,588
You want him to call you Hyung?

48
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:25,699
If you want to hear "Hyung" that badly, then you can go to a kindergarten, and hear all you want.

49
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,312
Why do you want to hear "Hyung" from Won Il? Why?

50
00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:29,319
I can't even joke?!

51
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,905
Is that a joke? Is that a joke?

52
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:32,724
You can't do it because of her, right?

53
00:03:32,724 --> 00:03:35,439
Because of you, the show is over.

54
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,203
Unni, you beat them up. When they beat up each other, nothing changes.

55
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:45,397
Noonim, you're the one who's picking a fight right now.

56
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:47,960
Why don't you calm down, and listen to me?

57
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,078
Hedgehog hyung is doing it on purpose.

58
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:52,492
What?

59
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:54,287
Come this way.

60
00:03:57,923 --> 00:04:01,533
Are you worried that my hyung won't eat it?

61
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,507
I think I can make him eat it, but

62
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:08,254
I wish I could make him eat it really well.

63
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:10,974
He eats a lot if he gets angry.

64
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:12,222
If he gets angry?

65
00:04:12,222 --> 00:04:17,517
Yes. My hyung can't drink alcohol, 
and he has never tried it.

66
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:18,389
Not even once?

67
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:22,010
Yes. The same goes for kissing. 
His present score is a zero.

68
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,878
I knew it.

69
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:27,934
Anyway, he's only interested in his health. 
But he can't always run to a fitness center 
whenever he's angry.

70
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,898
And he's not the type to take it out on others.

71
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:33,247
So eating is the only option for him.

72
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:36,121
Hey, then, what makes him angry the most?

73
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:37,719
When he flunks an exam?

74
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:38,971
Exam?

75
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:41,467
When you look at him, doesn't he look like a model student to you?

76
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:43,746
He bets his life on what he scores on his exams.

77
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:46,616
Didn't you feel it when you first met him?

78
00:04:46,616 --> 00:04:48,220
 What could it be?

79
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,746
 The worst situation that you can think of for yourself.

80
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:57,093
 A man who gets drunk?

81
00:04:57,093 --> 00:04:59,095
 You're so cute.

82
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:01,116
 "You"?   (informal)

83
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,346
I think Hyung came.

84
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:11,613
Why are you calling?

85
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:21,140
-Oh, it's me.
-You said you'd come, why aren't you here?

86
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,646
Hey, does your hyungnim have to go to you to see you?

87
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:28,067
Is this guy crazy?

88
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,539
It fits your hyung's standard perfectly.

89
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:39,801
You punk, you came right away when your hyung asked you to come.

90
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,864
What are you looking at, you little bastard?

91
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:43,573
"Little bastard"?!
Yeah.

92
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:45,060
Come here!

93
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,431
You're not coming here?!

94
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,884
You!

95
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:50,381
Alright. Alright.

96
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:55,075
I'm so angry anyway, this is a good opportunity to beat somebody up to take out my anger.
You're going to die in my hands...

97
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:55,892
Come out here now!

98
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:57,283
Hey!

99
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:57,963
Hey?!

100
00:05:57,963 --> 00:05:59,450
Wait!

101
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,554
Hyung will be back after I get changed.

102
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:02,836
-Hey?!
-Hey.

103
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:04,370
Is he crazy...?

104
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,640
Ah! Really!

105
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,224
What should I do with him, really?!

106
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:11,683
Hyung is already angry.

107
00:06:11,683 --> 00:06:16,004
He would be even more angry because Hedgehog oppa said he will beat him up.

108
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:17,998
He would want to eat everything in sight then.

109
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:21,387
Right then, you shouldn't give him anything other than the cake. You understand, right?

110
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:23,544
Do you think he'll eat the cake then?

111
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:25,655
Hedgehog hyung told me to memorize one thing.

112
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:29,355
The last piece of chocolate has to be eaten by Won Il.

113
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,563
The last piece of chocolate?

114
00:06:31,563 --> 00:06:34,826
Hey! What happened?!
 Is it over now, huh?!

115
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:37,144
It's almost over.
Are you ready?

116
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:39,685
I got it all ready!
Who am I?

117
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:42,154
I'm his assistant. Assistant!

118
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:42,780
Just a second.

119
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,945
Where are you going?

120
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,727
To close up the shop.

121
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:47,749
Why are you already closing?

122
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:53,409
Hedgehog said we have a VIP coming, and not to accept other customers.

123
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,358
Looks like it's ending.

124
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,681
Just a second. Really, really...

125
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,206
This is why Pan Da Yang came to me.

126
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,964
You want to die?!

127
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:26,244
Hey, if you want to fight one more round, then follow me.

128
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:30,769
Hey! Let's fight! Why are you running away?

129
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:35,603
You're cute still. So cute!

130
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:37,756
You want to die?!

131
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:49,841
Aigoo...only your appearance is good.

132
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:53,323
Why are you so weak?

133
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:02,018
Why don't you just call Hedgehog oppa "Hyung"?

134
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:07,667
What for did you learn this?

135
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:12,399
Did you start it yet?

136
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,135
Start what?!

137
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:16,760
I heard you guys will play the Jin Shil (truth) game today.

138
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,656
We'll play it?

139
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:20,823
Yeah. That's why I came.

140
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:23,934
Ah, really...

141
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:27,084
It looks cool.

142
00:08:27,084 --> 00:08:28,059
It looks like you didn't start it yet.

143
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:31,228
We want to play Jin Shil game too.

144
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:33,299
Come on, let's go.

145
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:43,363
-Hello! 
 -Oh you came?

146
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:44,881
Everyone have a seat.

147
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:46,086
Hi!

148
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:47,464
Sit, sit ,sit.

149
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:49,455
Sit wherever you want.

150
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:51,759
It feels like a dinner party.

151
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,618
It is a dinner party. For secrets.

152
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:02,099
Do you have to talk about your secrets in Jin Shil game...?

153
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:04,734
I don't really know because I haven't played it...

154
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:09,816
They'll ask like "When was your first kiss?", and you answer...

155
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,535
The first kiss?

156
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:14,956
It's been so long that you can't even remember!

157
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,904
Hedgehog, are you ready?

158
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:27,783
Open it.

159
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:30,072
- Me? 
 - Yeah.

160
00:09:45,512 --> 00:09:47,683
It's the best!

161
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:52,727
I'm getting nervous.

162
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:55,097
Oh it's here!

163
00:09:58,315 --> 00:10:00,187
It's so cool!

164
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:03,364
What is this?

165
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:05,808
It a French wedding cake.

166
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:08,023
It's Croque en Bouche

167
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:11,000
Hyung, everything is edible, don't worry.

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,317
Hey, did you really think that we'll go one round?

169
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:17,633
So I'm on your side.

170
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:20,518
Okay, I'll explain the rules of the game.

171
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:23,186
There is choux creme and chocolate in here.

172
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:29,896
If you eat one with choux creme, you pass. If you eat one with chocolate filling, you have to tell the truth and you get to choose the next person.

173
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,178
I don't understand.

174
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:35,859
First, lets just start. We'll learn as we play.

175
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:37,164
Please start the game.

176
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:39,381
Okay!

177
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:45,713
Mmmmm! It's to die for!

178
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:49,027
What the? I got caught immediately.

179
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:56,362
My secret is....

180
00:10:56,362 --> 00:11:00,047
the truth is, I'm really Sung Yong Min.

181
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:05,022
My eyes, nose, and v-line.

182
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:08,643
I've started with a big one! So you all should have good ones.

183
00:11:08,643 --> 00:11:11,557
Next, Gi Tae!

184
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:18,983
Chocolate, chocolate.

185
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,984
Hello, I am Jo Gi Tae.

186
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:31,220
I don't have a girlfriend.

187
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,190
You can sit down and talk.

188
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,328
Can I tell them?

189
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:39,370
What?

190
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,593
I'll say it.

191
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:47,321
I have no job right now.

192
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:52,051
Please give me employment at Saint Honore

193
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:53,759
Hey you!

194
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,759
You're supposed to tell a secret, but why are you saying a wish?

195
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,584
If you are okay with serving...

196
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:04,692
Of course, it's okay. That's what I wanted to do in the first place.

197
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:07,502
Thank You, Thank You.

198
00:12:07,502 --> 00:12:08,271
Wow...

199
00:12:08,271 --> 00:12:10,749
Okay the next person is Kang Eun Bi!

200
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:13,963
How did you know my name...

201
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:18,060
It's good.

202
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,107
If I have to tell you my secret,

203
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:26,492
my patissier certificate is fake.

204
00:12:26,492 --> 00:12:29,950
What kind of secret is that? We all know that already.

205
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:38,458
I really look young but the truth is I'm 44 years old.

206
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,831
It's not my secret but...

207
00:12:42,831 --> 00:12:45,691
knowing a secret is a secret.

208
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:51,801
The president's grandson died at a young age.

209
00:12:51,801 --> 00:12:54,402
Did you just say "died?"

210
00:12:54,402 --> 00:13:02,241
Noonim said that if he was alive, he would have been 26 years old.

211
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:05,696
There is a grandson Hedgehog doesn't know?

212
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:09,820
This kills the mood. Next, next, next.

213
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,397
My secret is that

214
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:20,113
I like my hyung way, way more than my dad.

215
00:13:21,704 --> 00:13:25,595
I had a touching secret too, but there seems to have been no impact...

216
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:27,587
100 points, 100 points.

217
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:40,938
I'm... I was born to console my sister after her loss of her first love.

218
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:45,280
First love at what age?

219
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,666
Who was your first love?

220
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,520
When Unnie was 8 year old,

221
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,383
She liked a boy at a bakery.

222
00:13:54,604 --> 00:13:57,250
He came to meet Unni

223
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,048
But unfortunately, became an orphan.

224
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,245
Since then she had lost all her strength.

225
00:14:03,782 --> 00:14:07,338
So, to take his place, they made me...

226
00:14:07,338 --> 00:14:09,384
Our parents.

227
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,497
Next, Unnie, you explain.

228
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:29,799
My father was an autopsy doctor

229
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:33,189
Autopsy? You mean those thing that we see in an American drama?

230
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:35,250
Opening up dead bodies?

231
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,397
That kind...

232
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:38,151
Yeah.

233
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:42,241
That's why my dad always had a weird smell around him,

234
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:46,659
but I was immature and told him that I hated how he smelled.

235
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:50,317
And I didn't go near him nor hug him.

236
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:52,959
He should have washed himself thoroughly.

237
00:14:56,104 --> 00:15:00,070
When he came home, no matter how many times he took a shower,

238
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,874
The smell of chemicals and,

239
00:15:01,874 --> 00:15:03,387
the smell of death.

240
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:06,250
it doesn't easily wash off.

241
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,920
That's why my dad's solution 
was to bring a cake home everyday after work.

242
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,345
I guess he thought the opposite of 
 unfortunate death was a cake.

243
00:15:20,874 --> 00:15:22,982
Hey.

244
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:26,330
- Dad!  
 - Cake is eaten on a happy occasion

245
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,727
Cake is to celebrate birthdays.

246
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:31,329
You like it?

247
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:39,384
Anyway, everyday I played at that cake shop, and my dad went and bought a cake from there.

248
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:43,645
But that cake shop burned down, and the shop lady was arrested, and

249
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:47,232
Ahjussi disappeared.

250
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:52,941
The child ended up living with us for a while.

251
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,076
He and I would wait for Dad 
in front of the house like a chore, and

252
00:15:58,076 --> 00:16:02,342
Won Il use to hang out with us.

253
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:14,621
Min Woo, you really draw well.

254
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:16,358
You're the best!

255
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:28,432
Then, his father came and took him away.

256
00:16:28,432 --> 00:16:31,542
And the rest of the story is what Da Na has stated.

257
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:36,411
My dad sent back that kid who came back to live with us.

258
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,447
No one has seen him since.

259
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:49,254
Because we grew up all our lives smelling the scent of dead people...

260
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:53,654
To live smelling the scent of cakes

261
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:56,580
That's why my father made it for us

262
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,945
Truthfully, my dad built it because of the guilt he had.

263
00:17:01,945 --> 00:17:09,487
After the boy disappeared, I shut my dad out.

264
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,852
My dad made this place because of me.

265
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,585
One day...

266
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:18,191
like a miracle, the boy might appear...

267
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:19,814
wishing and,

268
00:17:19,814 --> 00:17:21,505
praying.

269
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:27,153
The last thing my dad said to me is,

270
00:17:27,153 --> 00:17:34,052
"I'm sorry.  From now on, you wait for him,"

271
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,297
it was those words.

272
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:39,942
That's why even when business is terrible, you refuse to close this place and,

273
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:42,430
won't sell this house.

274
00:17:43,156 --> 00:17:47,061
That's the secret of Pan Da Yang and Cafe Panda.

275
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,620
There are three people remaining.

276
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,558
But, there are two chocolates.

277
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:56,304
Then one person wouldn't have the chance to reveal their secret.

278
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,713
I have a person I like.

279
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:02,962
Pass.

280
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:04,273
Why?

281
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:05,573
It's weak.

282
00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:06,408
It's too weak.

283
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:07,990
You wouldn't even be paid pennies...

284
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,467
to reveal your secret.

285
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:11,879
It's because you guys,

286
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:13,986
Said depressing stuff!

287
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:18,596
You can have your own 
 confession section later, Manager Kang.

288
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:22,704
Which brother is going to confess?

289
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,823
The child...

290
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,538
Didn't disappear because of you.

291
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:01,693
What are you saying?

292
00:19:01,693 --> 00:19:05,708
After your father turned him away, he came to me.

293
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:09,383
He was with me but, I lost him.

294
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:13,754
What are you saying?

295
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:21,995
He asked to be brought to you and,

296
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,374
was staying at our house.

297
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:31,034
Our house?

298
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,509
He wanted me to take him to you.

299
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:42,274
To stop him from crying, I went to get a cake.

300
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:45,441
He disappeared in the meantime.

301
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:50,600
That incident,

302
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,528
why are you telling me that now?

303
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:57,637
So since then,

304
00:19:57,637 --> 00:19:59,800
you couldn't eat a cake?

305
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:03,105
Because of the guilt?

306
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:05,279
Is that true, hyung?

307
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,745
It's not that I didn't eat, I couldn't.

308
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:15,203
Because I threw up to the point I bled.

309
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:22,871
But, how is the chocolate I made?

310
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,066
What?

311
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:27,966
Shouldn't you at least review the taste?

312
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:30,424
Is it the time for me to say that?

313
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:36,773
The last chocolate...

314
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,198
Last chocolate is here.

315
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:01,647
Congratulations.

316
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:06,044
Everyone, thank you for your help.

317
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:12,241
Today's event is to help you eat cake.

318
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:16,084
for you to eat cake once more.

319
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:22,799
Since you are staring at me with such gentle eyes,

320
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,132
there's no way, but to tell you the truth.

321
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:29,184
I'm only paying for the cake.

322
00:21:29,184 --> 00:21:31,551
This was Hedgehog's idea,

323
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:35,096
that Chairman would be so angry, lose his senses, and would eat the cake.

324
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,107
What are you looking at you '' little bastard ''

325
00:21:38,107 --> 00:21:40,445
That's why we did it.

326
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:50,474
What are you making now?

327
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:55,991
Now that you have tasted my cake,

328
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:58,157
I have to make it for you every day.

329
00:21:58,157 --> 00:22:01,038
Who likes the flavor, who?

330
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:02,506
Well, you know,

331
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:04,906
you can just call it winner's pride

332
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:07,721
What kind of winner are you?

333
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:09,236
You're Seung Ji.

334
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:13,876
Because of this kind of bad joke, Pan Da came to me.

335
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,319
You want to die?

336
00:22:16,598 --> 00:22:19,125
Okay. Finally,

337
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,223
tell me the truth.

338
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:22,793
What?

339
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:25,391
How does it feel to have lost Pan Da to me?

340
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:26,084
Bloody!

341
00:22:27,794 --> 00:22:30,337
This is cake, something you hate eating the most.

342
00:22:30,337 --> 00:22:33,016
Are you still going to bring it on?

343
00:22:35,672 --> 00:22:38,688
You're not going to sleep today.

344
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:39,963
What am I going to do instead of sleeping?

345
00:22:39,963 --> 00:22:41,561
Follow me!

346
00:22:42,197 --> 00:22:44,115
What...another fight?

347
00:22:44,115 --> 00:22:46,393
If hyung tells you to follow him, just follow him.

348
00:22:46,393 --> 00:22:47,358
Punk!

349
00:22:49,072 --> 00:22:50,927
"Hyung"?

350
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:57,149
Do you want noona to come along?

351
00:22:57,149 --> 00:22:59,375
No thanks.

352
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,367
Are you saying no thanks to going with Noona,

353
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:03,579
or calling me Noona?

354
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:06,114
Remember that I wrote a contract

355
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:10,338
so that I wouldn't have to call you Nuna.

356
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,080
Move,

357
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:17,675
Hedgehog!

358
00:23:17,675 --> 00:23:19,883
Don't be so prickly and play nice.

359
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:21,914
Shut up!

360
00:23:42,858 --> 00:23:45,297
Won Il,

361
00:23:45,297 --> 00:23:49,251
what is the secret

362
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:51,772
you haven't told yet?

363
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,542
Hey, we're going to spend all night looking for a bar?

364
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:59,429
Just pick any bar.

365
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:03,759
It's because this Hyung wants to take you to a clean and quiet place.

366
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:08,212
A bar has drunk people, so how can it be quiet and clean?

367
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:12,035
Have you ever seen drunk people quiet and clean?

368
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,564
You know a lot about bars?

369
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,643
Do you think I wouldn't know?

370
00:24:18,643 --> 00:24:22,702
Don't you know how I have lived up until now?

371
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:26,423
There was no information about you working at a bar on your profile.

372
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:32,548
After being released from the 
juvenile detention center at age 16,
 I couldn't get a job anywhere, 
 so I lived at bars. Got it now?

373
00:24:32,548 --> 00:24:34,825
Then you must be good at drinking.

374
00:24:34,825 --> 00:24:42,056
Is that all? I could even drink by boxfuls...stacked higher than your height.

375
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:43,428
Really?

376
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:48,561
So then..do we start with soju or yangju ( distilled liquor)?

377
00:24:50,507 --> 00:24:53,498
Soju? Yangju?! What are you talking about?!

378
00:24:53,498 --> 00:24:56,621
Let's just go drink beer.

379
00:24:56,621 --> 00:25:00,142
Why drink beer? It's the weakest.

380
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:02,673
It's hot right now.

381
00:25:02,673 --> 00:25:08,023
So let's just drink refreshing beer.

382
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:09,482
Really?

383
00:25:09,482 --> 00:25:16,017
Oh, beer! There's beer over there! Right there.

384
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:17,667
Okay!

385
00:25:20,064 --> 00:25:25,217
Since he said he doesn't drink ,he should be weaker than me right?

386
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:29,804
Whatever, I don't know... might as well as just drink.

387
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:38,264
Welcome, come in!

388
00:25:38,264 --> 00:25:41,468
Wow, you two are really good looking!

389
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:46,130
My god, you two are really handsome!

390
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,979
Its my first time seeing such a handsome guys!

391
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:55,836
Oh my god, are you guys gay?

392
00:25:55,836 --> 00:26:00,603
Of course they are! Guys like this wouldn't visit our bar.

393
00:26:00,603 --> 00:26:03,971
Yeah, just get a room for them.

394
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,509
Oh my goodness!

395
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:09,369
-Why'd you grab my hand?
-You're the one who grabbed my hand.

396
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:10,916
Are you done?

397
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:14,172
It's not like you're a pervert or anything.  Let's go, quickly!

398
00:26:20,264 --> 00:26:24,542
Instead of coming here, let's go to a place I know well.

399
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,372
Where's that?

400
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:30,127
The place is nice, the service is good, and if you get drunk, you can sleep there.

401
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:32,084
Do you get drunk and stay out all night?

402
00:26:32,084 --> 00:26:33,172
That's right.

403
00:26:33,172 --> 00:26:34,481
What?

404
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:37,557
You have Da Yang now but you go around acting like that?

405
00:26:37,557 --> 00:26:39,010
Yeah.

406
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:43,355
"Yeah", you punk.. Where are you looking?

407
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:45,545
I'm looking at you peeing.

408
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:52,225
Crap! It's on my hands...Crap! He's no help!

409
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,503
I wonder where the two of them went.

410
00:26:57,503 --> 00:27:01,058
Aren't they fighting at some health club or something?

411
00:27:01,058 --> 00:27:03,420
Won Il is pretty good at martial art!

412
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,264
Do you really think they would go to a place like that?

413
00:27:05,264 --> 00:27:07,217
They probably went out to drink.

414
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:09,871
But Hedgehog doesn't have a high tolerance for alcohol.

415
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:12,175
And my Hyung has never drank alcohol before.

416
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:14,883
How could he have never drank any?

417
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:19,006
He told me he didn't have any time to idle when he lived alone as a young person in a foreign country.

418
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:22,396
He is a totally serious person.

419
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:27,011
Can't even drink? Ah, I hate those type of guys

420
00:27:27,586 --> 00:27:30,509
Keep hating them.

421
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:35,465
Isn't there a GPS on Hedgehog's phone?

422
00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:38,104
No.

423
00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:41,666
Why would she do such a thing since 
 they are always stuck together?

424
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:46,475
Because, when men are out of your sight...

425
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:48,518
Is Won Il like that?

426
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:51,854
Of course not! Do you think he would be like that?

427
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:55,422
Of course my CEO

428
00:27:55,422 --> 00:28:00,121
Well, everyone knows that you like my hyung, so just speak comfortably.

429
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:03,805
Thank you, Miss.

430
00:28:04,223 --> 00:28:07,135
Psh, Miss.

431
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:10,075
Enough with me. Miss, why don't you drink some?

432
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:12,699
Yeah, only Won Yi didn't drink yet.

433
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:14,637
May I?

434
00:28:14,637 --> 00:28:20,503
Woohoo! I thought I was going to die from boredom, behaving myself since I'm the youngest.

435
00:28:20,503 --> 00:28:24,098
I was waiting to hear those words.

436
00:28:29,256 --> 00:28:32,857
I, too, have to get drunk.

437
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:45,684
Wow, now my throat can relax.

438
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,935
You're amazing. The best.

439
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:55,284
What I am good at...is this.  Noonim, you worked hard today.

440
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:57,996
Bottoms up!

441
00:29:03,902 --> 00:29:10,739
This alcohol is sweet. It's great!  Today, we are going until the end, ok? Go Go!

442
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:13,619
I'm heading off to work from here ok? Go Go!

443
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:18,115
Let's consider this as our vacation! Drink!

444
00:29:18,115 --> 00:29:21,024
Oh whatever! Think this as our summer vacation! Drink!

445
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,929
Everyone takes a drink, and then we'll move on to songs!

446
00:29:29,374 --> 00:29:31,592
Sit comfortably.

447
00:29:31,592 --> 00:29:35,419
Because your legs are long, you will feel uncomfortable sitting like that for a while.

448
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:36,811
I'm fine.

449
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:44,517
Seung Ji kept saying that you looked like a utility pole,
so I thought you would be bad looking,
 but you're very handsome.

450
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:46,398
That's not it, grandfather.

451
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:48,215
You're so polite.

452
00:29:48,642 --> 00:29:54,064
I have soju in the refrigerator, shall we have some?

453
00:29:54,064 --> 00:29:56,912
Ah, no, that's okay. I'm fine.

454
00:29:56,912 --> 00:30:02,024
Did Seung Ji go to a brewery to buy alcohol?
Why isn't he here yet?

455
00:30:02,024 --> 00:30:04,318
Should I go out looking for him?

456
00:30:04,318 --> 00:30:07,314
Why go out when it's so hot? He'll come soon anyway

457
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:08,814
Yes, grandpa.

458
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:14,904
If you keep sitting like that, then your legs will hurt and you wont be able to go home.

459
00:30:14,904 --> 00:30:17,899
Then I'll sit a bit more comfortably.

460
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:24,541
Lick your finger and touch your nose three times, it'll make your legs feel better.

461
00:30:31,316 --> 00:30:32,642
Aigoo.

462
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:36,554
Let's see, let's see...

463
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:41,122
Aigoo, wait, let me see.

464
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:43,403
Just hold on and be patient for a bit.

465
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:44,904
I'll do it Grandpa.

466
00:30:44,904 --> 00:30:49,838
You're like this because my house is not comfortable. So, I should do this for you. Just hold still.

467
00:30:52,865 --> 00:30:57,008
Did Seung Ji say "let's go to grandpa's place" and brought you here?

468
00:30:57,008 --> 00:31:03,763
He was taking me to a good bar before I was here.

469
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:05,782
That kid is playing tricks again.

470
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,522
I've been tricked a few times, Grandpa,

471
00:31:08,522 --> 00:31:11,665
It's because he likes you as a hyung.

472
00:31:11,665 --> 00:31:18,455
But he doesn't call me hyung and calls me by name or "Ya". And earlier, he called me bastard.

473
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:21,167
He's doing that because he likes you.

474
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:25,551
He's always calling me 'grandpa, grandpa', and then goes to his friends and uses banmal (informal language).

475
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:30,240
I guess it can be kind of cute.

476
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,039
Yes, Grandfather. I'm okay now.

477
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:36,687
Oh, that's good.

478
00:31:40,284 --> 00:31:42,017
It's your fourth one, is it still good?

479
00:31:43,272 --> 00:31:48,146
No matter how many I have, it's still good! I guess it's because I haven't had much when I was small.

480
00:31:48,427 --> 00:31:51,980
Noonim, why don't you take a sip too?

481
00:31:52,723 --> 00:31:55,078
You go ahead and eat it.

482
00:31:55,078 --> 00:31:58,909
Why? Do you think you're stealing off a kid who grew up not having much?

483
00:32:00,522 --> 00:32:04,673
I think you're quite amazing.

484
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:08,885
I'm optimistic, courageous, and nice.

485
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,405
And, you don't have any resentment either.

486
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,734
I thought to myself that I should not forget.

487
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:15,139
I should not have been abandoned.

488
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:16,628
I should not have been born.

489
00:32:16,628 --> 00:32:18,580
But in the end,

490
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,860
I decided to live as if I was born without parents.

491
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,499
When I stopped thinking about my parents, my resentment stopped as well.

492
00:32:26,499 --> 00:32:32,681
Not abandoned, but you could have been lost, or there may have been 
a dire situation which caused the separation too.

493
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,769
I wondered which trash can might have something that was not too rotten for me to eat.

494
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:40,177
I wondered which subway station that I could sleep in, so I wouldn't get hurt by gangsters.

495
00:32:40,177 --> 00:32:42,471
I thought If I went to jail, I would not get wet by the rain,

496
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:47,212
I wouldn't be cold, and I would get fed everyday.
The children who like these things,

497
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:49,716
they wouldn't understand anything about their parents' circumstances.

498
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:54,052
They might even think it's better not to have parents.

499
00:32:54,857 --> 00:33:00,960
The ice cream melted while I was talking.

500
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:10,661
President Choi...

501
00:33:10,661 --> 00:33:14,594
Please call me Won Il.  Also, please speak comfortably.

502
00:33:14,594 --> 00:33:22,856
Okay then, when he heard that Won Il was president, he seemed very troubled deep in his heart.

503
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:30,921
Although the way he speaks may be all prickly,
 if you get to know him, you won't be able to find anyone like him in this world.

504
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:35,709
So, be friends without misunderstanding, and come by here often.

505
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:37,627
Yes.

506
00:33:39,738 --> 00:33:43,486
What? You can tell me.

507
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:50,117
My step-father took many of the patissier's with him when he left..

508
00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:56,512
While trying to figure out a solution with Hedgehog--I mean Seung Ji, I ended up following him here.

509
00:33:56,512 --> 00:34:01,709
I'm sorry for coming without anything when it's the first time meeting you.

510
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:09,383
Nonsense. I'm Seung Ji's grandpa, so I'm grandpa to his friends too. So you don't need to do things like that.

511
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:11,258
You don't have to worry much.

512
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,845
Thank you.

513
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:18,756
Anyway, how will you find that many pastry chefs

514
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,029
at the same time?

515
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:26,389
My cousin is an assistant pastry chef. 
He was only able to recruit five.

516
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:30,604
All the temporary workers will resign by the day after tomorrow.

517
00:34:30,604 --> 00:34:34,955
We have a lot to do next week.
What should we do in this case, Grandpa?

518
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,368
Grandpa!

519
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:42,693
Where did you go, you punk?

520
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:46,263
It took some time to pick out the most refreshing ones in the neighborhood.

521
00:34:52,688 --> 00:34:54,526
You're ready to fight, huh?

522
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:58,965
Wipe your mouth before talking.

523
00:35:00,395 --> 00:35:02,785
Oh...this.

524
00:35:02,785 --> 00:35:06,146
I bought only one because it was so hot.

525
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,300
This is cheating, you know.

526
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,647
Why is it cheating when I ate something I bought with my own money?

527
00:35:11,647 --> 00:35:14,761
You went and ate that without me so you wouldn't get as drunk and win over me.

528
00:35:14,761 --> 00:35:20,999
How can ice cream ward off getting drunk? I'll win without eating, I'll win with eating.

529
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:25,026
I guess I should go to the bed

530
00:35:25,026 --> 00:35:27,257
Grandpa.

531
00:35:27,257 --> 00:35:29,577
What are you looking at, punk?

532
00:35:29,577 --> 00:35:31,678
How dare you speak like that to your hyung?

533
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:33,536
My family register is wrong!

534
00:35:33,536 --> 00:35:34,609
You are well aware of that, grandpa.

535
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:39,535
This punk doesn't address me properly either, blaming it on his family register.

536
00:35:39,535 --> 00:35:40,572
Grandpa.

537
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:43,104
Did you not say that?

538
00:36:12,115 --> 00:36:14,995
Why did they close so early?

539
00:36:23,855 --> 00:36:26,078
Aunt will go.

540
00:36:26,473 --> 00:36:29,741
It's not right to bother them when they're resting for once in a long time.

541
00:36:30,351 --> 00:36:32,023
That's right.

542
00:36:35,502 --> 00:36:37,760
It's okay, don't worry.

543
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,886
I can just go to the bath house.

544
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:46,634
Good night.

545
00:36:53,529 --> 00:36:57,721
His alcohol tolerance is extremely low.

546
00:36:58,194 --> 00:37:00,259
He just drank a little beer.

547
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:04,996
But, he told me he could drink alcohol 
by boxfuls even if they were
 stacked higher than my height 
without a problem.

548
00:37:04,996 --> 00:37:06,662
They must have been empty boxes.

549
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,605
I laid out the blankets already. Should I take him and lay him down?

550
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,103
It'll be loud when he wakes up.

551
00:37:15,103 --> 00:37:17,426
But how can we let him sleep here?

552
00:37:17,426 --> 00:37:19,074
Ah, I'll do it.

553
00:37:19,074 --> 00:37:19,927
Would you do that?

554
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:21,327
Yes.

555
00:37:21,327 --> 00:37:22,131
Ah!

556
00:37:22,131 --> 00:37:25,377
Everything...I ate will come up.
Let go of me a little.

557
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:28,159
Seung Ji is paying! ( sorta like '' it's on me '' )

558
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,397
Why is he so strong?

559
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:32,499
They say drunks are the strongest.

560
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:35,186
-What do we do with him?
-Really...

561
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:39,090
Aigoo aigoo, Grandpa Grandpa!

562
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:45,838
Are you a dog or what? Why are you biting me when it hurts? Hurry up and lie down.

563
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:51,293
You have a high tolerance for alcohol?

564
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:56,220
There's a guy that looks like Byun Bin Goo.

565
00:37:56,726 --> 00:37:59,258
When you sober up, you're dead!

566
00:37:59,258 --> 00:38:00,607
Why?

567
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:02,572
You lied to me.

568
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:03,714
Lie?

569
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,123
LIE.

570
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:06,863
What?

571
00:38:07,209 --> 00:38:08,606
What a surprise, dude.

572
00:38:08,606 --> 00:38:13,163
I love you..

573
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:17,785
Hey, hurry up and sleep.

574
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,308
You sleep here, too.

575
00:38:20,308 --> 00:38:21,980
"You"?(informal)

576
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,177
Let's sleep with Grandpa.

577
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,693
Hyung.

578
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:30,413
I'm your hyung. Punk.

579
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:39,227
From tomorrow, you go help Da Yang.

580
00:38:39,227 --> 00:38:42,150
Let Beom Bo take care of our business.

581
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,575
Why?

582
00:38:57,272 --> 00:39:01,357
I couldn't get changed, and my makeup...my hair...my pathetic look...

583
00:39:01,357 --> 00:39:04,661
What would Won Il say if he saw me like this?

584
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:18,277
Assistant Kang, you drank last night?

585
00:39:18,277 --> 00:39:21,556
President, where did you drink, and where did you sleep last night?

586
00:39:21,556 --> 00:39:25,351
No, I was at Hedgehog's and Grandfather's place.

587
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:27,405
Ahh, Grandfather.

588
00:39:27,405 --> 00:39:29,486
Good morning! Mr.CEO

589
00:39:29,486 --> 00:39:30,487
Yes.

590
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:34,296
You were told yesterday, and you reported to work today?

591
00:39:34,296 --> 00:39:37,397
I have a very hasty personality.

592
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,372
It's a good thing you came. Let's go in.

593
00:39:39,372 --> 00:39:40,618
Yes.

594
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:54,799

595
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:03,203
What? He's already bringing in new employees?

596
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:08,785
Choi Won Il is acting like normal, as if there's no problem.

597
00:40:08,785 --> 00:40:11,368
He may hold up for a day or two.

598
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:15,210
With what I've made, he'll be able to survive that long.

599
00:40:15,644 --> 00:40:18,243
What is he going to do after that?

600
00:40:18,243 --> 00:40:22,419
Furthermore, there'll be mass orders next week, do you think he can meet the need?

601
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:23,592
That's impossible.

602
00:40:23,592 --> 00:40:28,365
Then would it be me or Choi Won Il

603
00:40:28,365 --> 00:40:31,272
begging on his knees?

604
00:40:32,368 --> 00:40:36,064
Let's rest completely for the next few days.

605
00:40:36,592 --> 00:40:43,880
After this vacation, Saint-Honore will be in the palm of my hand completely.

606
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:55,850
If you...are going to continue looking disappointed like that in front of me,

607
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:59,130
go and investigate this.

608
00:40:59,908 --> 00:41:03,016
Angel Orphanage, Jang Min Woo? Who's that?

609
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:07,583
Don't ask anymore and go investigate it completely.

610
00:41:10,298 --> 00:41:13,412
That's what I think. How about you?

611
00:41:15,548 --> 00:41:18,602
What, you don't want to?

612
00:41:19,272 --> 00:41:22,169
It's not that I don't want to.

613
00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:24,537
I'm just thankful to Grandpa.

614
00:41:24,537 --> 00:41:27,334
Then why do you have so many thoughts?

615
00:41:29,444 --> 00:41:34,393
Would it be alright if I place a condition?

616
00:41:34,393 --> 00:41:35,916
What condition?

617
00:41:37,366 --> 00:41:39,755
Are you out of your mind?!

618
00:41:39,755 --> 00:41:43,127
We are in the worst situation at the moment!

619
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:47,638
We can't afford to waste 
one hour, one minute, or one second,
 but the president and his assistant both have

620
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:50,985
''I totally relaxed and drank last night'' written all over their faces!

621
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:56,353
If you come to work looking like that, 
how could you explain yourselves 
to the employees, and what are you
 going to do with Saint Honore?

622
00:41:56,353 --> 00:41:58,315
I'm sorry.

623
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,950
Yesterday, Won Il and Eun Bi went to meet the new potential head patissier...

624
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,356
Went there and just drank?

625
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,082
Did you recruit him?

626
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,245
I couldn't tell him exactly.

627
00:42:09,245 --> 00:42:12,594
Aigoo.....and yet you say that I can trust you with Saint Honore?

628
00:42:12,594 --> 00:42:15,273
And you want the ownership to run it?!

629
00:42:15,273 --> 00:42:20,789
If something bad happens next week, it's only a matter of time for us.

630
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:23,122
Not only our regular customers, but

631
00:42:23,122 --> 00:42:25,071
our general customers too...

632
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:27,017
Who is that?!

633
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:38,709
It's Hedgehog.

634
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,428
Hello?

635
00:42:45,979 --> 00:42:48,164
Huh?

636
00:42:48,164 --> 00:42:49,926
What's your condition?

637
00:42:52,053 --> 00:42:55,255
Ok. I'll call you back.

638
00:42:55,255 --> 00:42:56,640
Yeah.

639
00:42:58,764 --> 00:43:00,364
What'd he say?

640
00:43:00,364 --> 00:43:02,752
Is Ko Seung Ji going to do it?

641
00:43:02,752 --> 00:43:05,404
You know who Ko Seung Ji is, right?

642
00:43:05,404 --> 00:43:07,045
Yes, I know.

643
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:09,287
His skills and talents are guaranteed by Gyun Woo hyung.

644
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:14,078
I told Won Il to recruit Seung Ji no matter what.

645
00:43:14,078 --> 00:43:14,866
But?

646
00:43:14,866 --> 00:43:16,427
He says he has a condition.

647
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,796
What condition?

648
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:19,999
Does he want money?

649
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,626
He asked to take down all of President Choi's posters at the entrance.

650
00:43:24,626 --> 00:43:28,438
Then he'll work even without getting paid.

651
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:33,605
Should I decide or...

652
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:37,894
Okay, I understand.

653
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,223
Okay.

654
00:44:06,502 --> 00:44:08,159
Mom, fighting!

655
00:44:09,122 --> 00:44:10,423
For what?

656
00:44:10,423 --> 00:44:13,337
Just because. Fighting!

657
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:16,110
You must have met your brother.

658
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,081
No , dad.

659
00:44:18,802 --> 00:44:20,701
You met dad?

660
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:23,496
He asked to bring him something so I went.

661
00:44:23,496 --> 00:44:25,207
What did he ask for?

662
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:30,051
Just his stuff.... and a box which looks like a safe.

663
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:31,367
What?!

664
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:33,916
How can you give him that?

665
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,878
Why did you do something you weren't told to do?

666
00:44:35,878 --> 00:44:38,664
Why? What was it?

667
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:44,381
Mom, hold on.

668
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:47,027
Why are you being like this?

669
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:53,313
Whats the matter, Vice President?

670
00:44:54,570 --> 00:45:00,598
Do you think you can find a really trustworthy lawyer soon?

671
00:45:01,813 --> 00:45:03,841
Why do you need a lawyer?

672
00:45:03,841 --> 00:45:07,052
You don't need to know that. So can you find one by today or what?

673
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:08,194
Well, that's because...

674
00:45:08,194 --> 00:45:10,234
Her dad is a lawyer.

675
00:45:10,234 --> 00:45:11,701
Is that so?

676
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:13,657
Why did you hide that?

677
00:45:13,657 --> 00:45:19,476
It's true that he's a lawyer by profession, however, 
he has no interest in the work of lawyers, and he doesn't work well...

678
00:45:19,476 --> 00:45:22,144
Not only does he focus all his attention on other things besides work...

679
00:45:22,144 --> 00:45:26,771
His lips are really loose, so you can't guarantee that he'll keep everything confidential...

680
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:31,174
Also, because he knows so many secrets...even if he met you...he wouldn't be of any use to you.

681
00:45:31,174 --> 00:45:34,855
He's the worst lawyer.

682
00:45:34,855 --> 00:45:36,758
Be quiet.

683
00:45:36,758 --> 00:45:40,996
The lawyer will have to know everything about our company.

684
00:45:40,996 --> 00:45:44,774
Can you make an appointment as fast as possible?

685
00:45:44,774 --> 00:45:47,777
How about finding another lawyer?

686
00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:50,451
Be quiet, don't say anything else.

687
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:52,866
. . .

688
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:58,260
I'll take down all the posters by tonight so... I'm depending on you, Hedgehog.

689
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,485
Are you sure a guy like me is okay?

690
00:46:00,485 --> 00:46:02,444
Do you have to say that now?

691
00:46:02,444 --> 00:46:07,845
It's not a guy like me, it's guys like me. (implying his criminal record)

692
00:46:07,845 --> 00:46:12,536
If it's you, It's the best.

693
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:15,334
Hello?

694
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:19,216
Ok, I got it. I'll start from tomorrow.

695
00:46:19,635 --> 00:46:21,988
Okay, talk to you later.

696
00:46:30,188 --> 00:46:35,400
Grandpa, it's me. Choi Won Il called me the best.

697
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,073
Okay, don't worry, I'll take care of it.

698
00:46:40,073 --> 00:46:43,776
You just take care of things with Pan Da Yang, okay?

699
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:47,957
Thanks, grandpa.

700
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,696
 I know how talented you are, but you'll never win over Saint Honore.

701
00:46:56,696 --> 00:46:58,650
 You're really looking down on me.

702
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:03,496
 I don't think you know Saint Honore well.
They have the best of the best...

703
00:47:03,496 --> 00:47:06,443
 Who said where I worked is worse than them?

704
00:47:06,443 --> 00:47:07,549
 Huh?

705
00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:11,920
 And, who said I was worse than Assistant at Saint Honore?

706
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,066
 I was really hoping that you would work at my shop...

707
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:20,099
 I'm afraid that you might get embarrassed and disappear if you lose, so let's not start the competition.

708
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:24,457
 What's the use? You already got the job, and there's no one else.

709
00:47:24,457 --> 00:47:26,039
 Then, let's do it this way.

710
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:31,115
 If I win, you'll hire me without a resume, and I get 50% of the total profit.

711
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:33,625
 However,

712
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:40,737
 if you win, I, Ko Seung Ji, will work for free for a half year.

713
00:47:41,472 --> 00:47:46,122
 They both are good for me.

714
00:47:46,122 --> 00:47:50,823
 So what you can start doing for me is to memorize the orders that will inspire me.

715
00:47:50,823 --> 00:47:52,669
 Inspirational orders?

716
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:53,430
 One.

717
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:54,900
 Two.

718
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,080
 Three. Go.

719
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:03,822
 One, two, three, go?

720
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:14,027
What?

721
00:48:14,027 --> 00:48:18,555
I was thinking that you're a really great guy.

722
00:48:18,555 --> 00:48:23,095
What's so great?

723
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:29,187
I know how talented you are, 
but you'll never win over Saint Honore.

724
00:48:30,124 --> 00:48:34,866
Then you should say,"you really look down on me."

725
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:39,375
You really look down on me.

726
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:43,874
I don't think you know Sant Honore very well.
They have the best of the best...

727
00:48:43,874 --> 00:48:47,447
Who said Cafe Panda where I worked is worse than them?

728
00:48:47,447 --> 00:48:52,077
And who said I'm worse than Choi Jae Gyum?

729
00:48:52,077 --> 00:48:57,218
I was really hoping that you would work at my shop...

730
00:48:57,218 --> 00:49:00,922
I'll do it. I said I'll do it.

731
00:49:00,922 --> 00:49:04,034
Until when?

732
00:49:04,034 --> 00:49:06,519
Until the little kid from the cake shop

733
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:09,610
that Panda has been waiting for reappears.

734
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:14,718
What would happen if that little kid came back?

735
00:49:17,003 --> 00:49:22,883
Are you perhaps jealous of that little kid?
Because he was my first love?

736
00:49:22,883 --> 00:49:24,951
I don't know why, but

737
00:49:24,951 --> 00:49:29,143
I thought he might have become a patissier also.

738
00:49:29,143 --> 00:49:34,388
-Then?
-Then, you can be in charge,
 and he can be your assistant. 
What's the problem?

739
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:42,046
He's been my first love for 20 years.
 But with you, I have the next 20 years, 
the next 20 years, and the next 20 years to lov...

740
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:44,555
Lov...what?

741
00:49:46,381 --> 00:49:48,562
Lov...what?

742
00:49:51,147 --> 00:49:53,032
Lov...what?

743
00:49:54,089 --> 00:49:56,276
Give me

744
00:49:56,276 --> 00:50:01,436
some inspiring orders.

745
00:50:01,436 --> 00:50:04,162
Inspiring orders?

746
00:50:04,162 --> 00:50:08,550
Yeah...if you say one, two, three, go...

747
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:13,058
I will...tell you...

748
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:15,724
One.

749
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:17,845
Two.

750
00:50:17,845 --> 00:50:19,849
Three.

751
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,727
I love you.

752
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:31,718
Once more...tell me once more...huh?

753
00:50:31,718 --> 00:50:34,748
If you take care of our house well while I'm gone,

754
00:50:34,748 --> 00:50:37,261
I'll tell you after I come home.

755
00:50:37,261 --> 00:50:41,294
Where...are you going that you're 
telling me to take care of our house?

756
00:50:41,294 --> 00:50:43,358
Where would I be going?

757
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,305
I'll be going to Saint Honore starting tomorrow.

758
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:51,301
Then, I won't be with you!

759
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:53,446
You didn't know that?

760
00:50:53,446 --> 00:50:56,579
That place...so many girls are there!

761
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:59,968
I just can't let you go there.

762
00:51:00,905 --> 00:51:04,159
One, two, three.

763
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:16,093
What's this? Your face looks so small. Come forward, boyfriend.

764
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:23,141

765
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:30,110
I'm going to take a picture. One, two, three.

766
00:51:38,998 --> 00:51:39,551
Here...

767
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:43,386
Not a smiling one...give me a kiss.

768
00:51:43,386 --> 00:51:44,335
I'll do it after I come back.

769
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:49,471
No. We have to do it now for a keepsake.
Kiss, hurry.

770
00:51:54,134 --> 00:51:57,885
One, two, three.

771
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:01,908
One, two, three.

772
00:52:36,415 --> 00:52:38,826
Is Grandpa already asleep?

773
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:42,294
He said he has to leave early tomorrow.

774
00:52:42,294 --> 00:52:47,258
He seemed worried, and
 looked like he was having a hard time.

775
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:53,731
Starting tomorrow, please look after Cafe Panda.

776
00:52:53,731 --> 00:52:59,361
I don't think I will ever do as well as you. 
I'll do my best.

777
00:52:59,361 --> 00:53:04,159
That's not right. Your cake is great too, 
so please have  confidence in yourself.

778
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:07,381
I understand, Sunbaenim.

779
00:53:08,233 --> 00:53:10,946
But,

780
00:53:10,946 --> 00:53:15,046
what happened to your son?

781
00:53:17,015 --> 00:53:21,323
I couldn't ask Grandpa.

782
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:28,201
I'm sorry, I think it's a painful story for you.

783
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:33,325
Let's talk about it after you're settled 
with your work at Saint Honore.

784
00:53:33,325 --> 00:53:37,595
Tomorrow is more important than the past.

785
00:53:38,016 --> 00:53:39,373
Alright.

786
00:53:39,373 --> 00:53:42,717
Noonim, fighting!

787
00:53:45,448 --> 00:53:47,994
I'll do well.

788
00:54:05,664 --> 00:54:07,481
What are you doing?

789
00:54:07,882 --> 00:54:08,892
Huh?

790
00:54:08,892 --> 00:54:13,844
I ironed your uniform. 
You have to get up now.

791
00:54:13,844 --> 00:54:15,897
Come over here.

792
00:54:17,873 --> 00:54:21,651
What's that about? 
Come over here.

793
00:54:35,214 --> 00:54:38,395
Since we won't see each other all day,

794
00:54:38,395 --> 00:54:40,929
this is it for today.

795
00:54:44,332 --> 00:54:48,481
Oppa, get up and eat before you go, hurry!

796
00:54:49,814 --> 00:54:52,723
Get ready Hedgehog, hurry!

797
00:55:28,772 --> 00:55:31,427
How are you?

798
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:33,858
Please come this way.

799
00:55:44,786 --> 00:55:46,535
Who are all these people?

800
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:16,986
Saint Honore,

801
00:56:16,986 --> 00:56:20,073
I finally came back.

802
00:56:20,073 --> 00:56:21,757
You're ready, right?

803
00:56:49,454 --> 00:56:52,909
 Maculinea teleius

804
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,171
 Aspidomorpha transparipennis

805
00:56:56,171 --> 00:56:59,820
 Rhyssa persuasoria

806
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:05,398
 Homotropus tarsatorius

807
00:57:36,042 --> 00:57:37,544
 Grandpa,

808
00:57:37,544 --> 00:57:39,424
 take charge of the business.

809
00:57:39,424 --> 00:57:44,928
 Don't stay back of me, take the lead! You said you want three of us to be happy.

810
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:47,071
 So let's switch our places with

811
00:57:47,071 --> 00:57:48,127
 President Choi Won Il.

812
00:57:48,127 --> 00:57:50,636
 I thought she disappeared, and died.

813
00:57:50,636 --> 00:57:52,023
 Who is that person?

814
00:57:52,023 --> 00:57:54,415
 Someone

815
00:57:54,415 --> 00:57:55,580
 who could be a threat to me.

816
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,618
 Can I do as I see fit?

817
00:57:57,618 --> 00:57:59,091
 Yes.

818
00:57:59,091 --> 00:57:59,697
 Yes,

819
00:57:59,697 --> 00:58:01,119
 I'll follow you.

820
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:04,364
 Let's start then.
