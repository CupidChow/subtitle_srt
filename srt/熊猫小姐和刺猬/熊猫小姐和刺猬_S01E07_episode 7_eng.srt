1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,150

2
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:00,625
Hey, Hegdehog! Hedgehog! Hedgehog!

3
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:13,583
What are you doing, Hedgehog? 
 Are you troubled by our relationship going bad?

4
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,800
Why would I feel like that because of you?

5
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,611
Huh?

6
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,171
Why don't you let my hands go if you're done talking.

7
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:27,948
Your hands...I held your hands because I saw your macarons. I'm really touched.

8
00:01:27,948 --> 00:01:32,470
You don't even know about it.
I told you I'd do anything if you make macarons.

9
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,363
You said before that I couldn't make them!

10
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:48,894
Hey...I said that before because I was having a hard time learning how to drive from you.

11
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:54,259
If we put our efforts together, there is nothing we cannot do. We're business partners.

12
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,888
Right?

13
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:59,170
When did we ever put our efforts together?!

14
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:05,223
I'll give you ideas; you'll make macarons; we are a business couple.

15
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:10,630
We're only a couple when we make money, but you're someone else's couple to play?

16
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:16,097
Who's someone else? 
I don't have anyone else.

17
00:02:19,028 --> 00:02:22,294
Da Yang!

18
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:27,299
Why are you here?

19
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:28,604
Are you here to see Hedgehog?

20
00:02:28,604 --> 00:02:30,718
Yeah.

21
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,951
Let's talk.

22
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:35,245
Me??

23
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,343
He wanted to see you yesterday. He wanted to go to your grandpa's bakery.

24
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:45,655
I got stressed out when I got in the car, so I said, "Let's go later..."

25
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,600
Ah! Then, you sent me a text message and were waiting for me.

26
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:54,347
But an uninvited guest came.

27
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:55,665
Uninvited guest?

28
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:57,419
Text message?

29
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,603
 Episode 7

30
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:02,288
Do these guys not know anything about phone etiquette?

31
00:03:02,288 --> 00:03:06,371
If a text is sent, then there should be a text coming back.

32
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:08,817
Why are these two not doing anything?

33
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:10,027
Pan Da Yang,

34
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:16,933
how can you live without getting attention from men? Huh?

35
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,900
I sent a text message??

36
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,268
Saying what??

37
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,181
Why are you asking me when you sent it?

38
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,901
Just hurry up and show me.

39
00:03:34,203 --> 00:03:39,100
Right now, are you doing this on purpose?

40
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:45,207
(reading text message) I like you... how do you feel about me?

41
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:48,679
Hey...you can't forget the heart!

42
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:52,683
Y-you...send texts like that to just any person?!

43
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:59,095
It's just not anyone. She only does it for me.
Did you even see it? The text with the hearts.

44
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:08,977
Who are you to have taken my heart away? There are 2 hearts.

45
00:04:09,888 --> 00:04:13,212
No... Those are just song lyrics.

46
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,591
That's because...I don't really know Korean songs...

47
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,680
Why are you sending song lyrics as messages?!

48
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,504
Why all of a sudden he's yelling?!

49
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:25,617
Hey, Pan Da Yang, are you two-timing right now?

50
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:29,424
What's with you?! Are you playing with us?!

51
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:35,957
T-that's...

52
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:38,552
What is that?

53
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:44,752
 I'll be very lonely tonight.

54
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:47,601
How about you?

55
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:49,600
Three hearts?

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,217
Aish! Gil Dong Goo...with people

57
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:57,690
Huh? Why are you talking about Gil Dong Goo all of a sudden?

58
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,154
Truth is...

59
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:06,462
Gil Dong Goo... With my phone...my wallet...

60
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:10,607
he took the car...

61
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:12,128
What?

62
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:16,298
You just said he took the car right?!

63
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:20,830
To say it correctly,

64
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:26,610
Why'd you wait till now to say this!

65
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,267
Aish...this punk.

66
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:38,420
Selca

67
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,249
Ko Seung Ji

68
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:42,361
It came, it came.

69
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:47,823
Hello? Hedgehog-ssi...

70
00:05:47,823 --> 00:05:49,017
AREN'T YOU GOING TO BRING THE CAR RIGHT NOW?!

71
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:52,295
Ah...scared me... Aish!

72
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:56,263
Hello!
HELLO!

73
00:05:57,488 --> 00:06:01,336
He said he would return it! 
He just didn't say when...

74
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:03,373
BELIEVE IN A BELIEVABLE HUMAN BEING! 
Aish...

75
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:07,798
Right now, track your phone and report the missing car.

76
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:17,967
Hyung, come to the park.
It's urgent.

77
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:20,209
Where are you going? I said I had to speak with you.

78
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:23,504
Where do you think I'm going?
I need to get Gil Dong Goo.

79
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:29,198
Aish..I didn't come here for this...

80
00:06:29,198 --> 00:06:33,584
If you didn't come here for this, than why did you come!?

81
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:38,058
Oh, I was trying to get Gil Dong Goo, but I lost him.

82
00:06:38,058 --> 00:06:39,981
Ok, noona! Okay!

83
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:43,460
In this nice weather, we couldn't even meet girls.

84
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,528
Instead we go around trying to catch a guy who takes money and cars and runs away.

85
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:50,207
Ah...such a waste of time.

86
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:54,262
If it's such a waste of time, then just go.

87
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:58,318
Are you upset about the car 
or because of Choi Won Il?

88
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:02,194
Why, do you get mad just from hearing "Choi Won Il"? 
Do you feel your head spinning?

89
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:04,659
That's the start of love.

90
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:07,082
Saying the words "dating" like you're so into it..

91
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:10,273
Oh! Look! 
There's Pan Da Yang and Choi Won Il!

92
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:16,565
Yah, our Hedgehog has fallen 
fallen in love!

93
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:18,407
Get over here! 
Get over here!

94
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:19,727
Oh! You're here! Over here!

95
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:23,785
Hyung-ah! 
 I'll be there soon!

96
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:27,304
Hyung, didn't you like Da Na?

97
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:31,850
This punk. Isn't he just a playboy?

98
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,788
Hey, if you were to have one foot in two boats,
how could you do it to 
the girls who are so close to each other?

99
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:43,219
What are you guys talking about?
Won Yi called me to get Gil Dong Goo.

100
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:45,283
Aigoo. Aigoo. You can talk.

101
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:47,630
Hey, let's go~~

102
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:48,671
You didnt catch him yet, right?

103
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:51,176
Of course not. Let's go now. One, two, three. Go!

104
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:53,860
Okay!

105
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,364
Why is he saying one, two, three with her now?

106
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:05,070
People who need to have a foot in two boats feel like losers if both feet are in the same boat.

107
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:10,392
It doesn't feel like someone else's predicament. Are you a little crazy about Panda...?

108
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:13,017
Scared she won't choose you?!

109
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:13,837
Get over here! Aish.

110
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:16,032
Panda, panda, panda...

111
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:22,742
Actually it's Pan Da Na.

112
00:08:22,742 --> 00:08:27,649
 Oppa, the representative from the advertising company is still waiting. Hurry up!

113
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:46,295
Why did they ask to send pictures first?
They can just come later...

114
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:49,900
It's better to just send the pictures now...

115
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,196
Anyways, I hope Hedghog becomes well known after this.

116
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,638
Oh! He's here!

117
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,748
He's so busy. His phone was ringing off the hook, but he still waited for you.

118
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:05,429
How do you do?
My name is Jo Gi Tae.

119
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:07,547
Hey, let's go inside

120
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,370
Good or bad?

121
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,200
It's not the official decision but... 
 good

122
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,334
How good?

123
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:23,147
I can make a good ad, thanks to you.

124
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:27,064
Can you still not tell me what kind of advertisement it's going to be?

125
00:09:27,064 --> 00:09:34,115
For women who are beginning to date..
makeup

126
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:38,177
The name of the product...Macaron

127
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,582
  W-what... S-stop it!

128
00:09:51,582 --> 00:09:55,715
She really did it.

129
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:58,866
If it's turned off.. 
 we probably won't be able to find it, right?

130
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,904
I wouldn't know

131
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:04,923
Why are you speaking strangely?

132
00:10:04,923 --> 00:10:07,792
For you, the timing when you said it was off.

133
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:08,501
How so?

134
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:10,703
The car was stolen yesterday, right?

135
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:11,201
So...

136
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:15,154
But you didn't tell me yesterday. 
 You tell Ko Seung Ji today. What is that?

137
00:10:15,154 --> 00:10:21,733
Well, because the situation before was like that. 
 Plus, Hedgehog is my business partner.

138
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,839
So, if people are business partners, 
would they be arm in arm?

139
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,497
People would be arm in arm 
with their business partners. 
Would they do it with people just passing by?

140
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:31,257
Are you dating Ko Seung Ji?

141
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,443
It's not that we're dating...

142
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:36,255
You're not even dating so why are you linking arms?

143
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:43,172
Today was because I had messed up earlier and I was worried that Hedgehog would run away again!

144
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:44,408
So it's because you wrere worried that someone would steal him away?

145
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:47,141
No. We are business partners with 
equal division of money.

146
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:52,588
If you're business partners, 
then just divide up your money. 
Don't be arm in arm with him. 
It looks disgusting.

147
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:55,087
Pan Da Yang-sii

148
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,331
Ah, what is it?!

149
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,165
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:07,943
Because your phone is turned off, we couldn't track it.

151
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:13,615
I knew this was gonna happen. 
 Go pick one out, I'll buy it for you.

152
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:16,822
How could a dirty person like me use a clean phone?

153
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,644
I was a little harsh.. 
 I'm sorry.

154
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:30,591
When I see you we always fight, and it ruins my mood 
 so let's just not see each other. Okay?

155
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:36,416
I wasn't saying it to you. Those words that were meant for someone else just came out!

156
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:46,666
I really hate lies. 
 If you're lying, then I really won't see you again.

157
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,119
Mom.

158
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:52,857
Huh?

159
00:11:52,857 --> 00:11:57,000
I said it's mom... My mom.

160
00:11:58,168 --> 00:11:59,907
Right when the final is over.

161
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:02,336
I'll contact you. Please get ready.

162
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:04,621
You still didn't do what I wanted.

163
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:06,576
Ko Seung Ji.

164
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:09,599
About Choi Jae Gyum...

165
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:19,732
In a fair competition, Choi Jae Gyum
 cannot win over Ko Seung Ji.

166
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:24,161
If it's not a fair competition.

167
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:26,848
Famous international businessmen,

168
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:28,480
won't just be like this.

169
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,377
They'll take a fantastic idea and steal it.

170
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:34,557
You get money because of Choi Jae Gyum.

171
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:35,933
But steal an idea?

172
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:38,723
I told you he's a famous business man.

173
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:41,051
Not a person with a great talent.

174
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,785
It's more important to be famous than having the talent.

175
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,259
There are people who steal other people's talents

176
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:49,517
and become famous.

177
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:02,645
Ah...why is everything just round.

178
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:04,828
There's nothing that I can use for the ad.

179
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:06,945
It's all done?!

180
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:11,410
As expected, President Jo is the best!

181
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,056
Bonus?

182
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:14,849
I'll definitely give it to you!

183
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:19,407
Okay, I got it, so send me the picture right away.

184
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:23,209
Why do you always talk about money when you open your mouth?

185
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:27,203
He needs money to get things done.

186
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:28,689
It came!

187
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:30,352
What is it?

188
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:31,819
What picture is it that you're so excited about it?

189
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:33,998
The macarons I made.

190
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,752
They want it to make it like this?

191
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,668
Have you been doing business once or twice?

192
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:41,451
It's not like this,

193
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:43,926
We'll use this as a reference, and upgrade it.

194
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:46,630
Aigoo, what an expensive macaron!

195
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,740
Shortly after my dad passed away, my mom became the president of Saint Honore

196
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,303
and that person came in as a patissier.

197
00:13:54,807 --> 00:14:00,391
But one day, I saw him arm in arm with my mom.

198
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:03,736
I sensed something with a young mind,

199
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:06,373
I asked what she was doing, and the words that my mother said were,

200
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:08,140
"It's because we're business partners."

201
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:12,459
Because he was her business partner, she even let him into our house.

202
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:14,453
She let him use Dad's things.

203
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,244
She let him sit on the seat Dad used to sit on,
Because they were business partners.

204
00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:19,027
Even where he laid down at...

205
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:35,573
It's because we're friends.

206
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:40,666
Hey, look!

207
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,264
You saw, right?

208
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:44,553
Since when were those two like that?

209
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:50,948
Since you're his little sister, you should cheer for him, but, since I'm Hedgehog's friend, I need to disturb them.

210
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:52,655
I'm a sandwich!

211
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:55,406
I'm rooting for hyung but I also want Hedgehog to do well too!

212
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:58,530
Seung Ji's a little sensitive because of your hyung.

213
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,187
If he finds out those two did that,

214
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:03,983
Hey, hey. Hedgehog probably isn't coming this way to catch Dong Goo, right?

215
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:06,973
I should hurry and call Gi Tae!

216
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,856
Hurry and call him! Hurry hurry.

217
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:11,810
I said stop it!

218
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:16,491
This is also Pan Da Yang! Favor her, too.

219
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,106
Wow, it's really hot in this thing.

220
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:23,168
If you put this on and exercise, you would lose all the fat right away.

221
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:26,764
He called, Beom Bo.

222
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:27,826
You're not a gentleman.

223
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,000
You pick it up.

224
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:35,544
Gi Tae, don't ever let Seung Ji come here.

225
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:38,695
Right now, Choi Won Il and Panda are in the car and..

226
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,584
They're both acting weird.

227
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:42,792
Those two are holding hands and linking arms-

228
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:43,879
Aish!

229
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:44,902
Oh, linking arms!

230
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,648
And then?

231
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:01,056
Make a full setting by Saturday 5pm.

232
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:03,442
And complete the cake by 4pm no matter what.

233
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:06,509
And show us the design ahead of time by tomorrow.

234
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,898
You want us to show you the design ahead of time?

235
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:10,569
This is our 4th place.

236
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,386
We made all the other places withdraw because we didn't like them.

237
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,798
I found this place with a special interest.

238
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:17,461
So please do it right.

239
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:21,501
We do it right.

240
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:23,224
Even if we don't look up designs.

241
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:26,895
Instead of this person, is there another patissier?

242
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:33,310
He's such a great patissier that we don't even think of getting another one.

243
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,022
Don't worry and go, customer.

244
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:38,938
If it doesn't come out how I like it properly,

245
00:16:38,938 --> 00:16:41,262
I might not be able to pay the price properly.

246
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,517
I'm giving you a warning right now.

247
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:45,231
Yes.

248
00:16:54,855 --> 00:16:59,170
If that advertisement becomes well known, I might not be able to make your cake properly.

249
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,169
I'm warning you too.

250
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:02,621
OPPA!

251
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,570
What?

252
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,103
It's the Special case!

253
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:08,166
This is the first time we have to rent the whole place out.

254
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,417
So what is the event?

255
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,342
The event to celebrate the 30 days anniversary of dating.

256
00:17:14,507 --> 00:17:16,868
"Orderer - Chae Won Gil
Call Info: 010-9931-____"

257
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,227
Crazy bastard, it's not even 30 years.

258
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,840
You like my best friend so...

259
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,260
Do it right.

260
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,342
You must!

261
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:31,290
No wonder, I knew he was no luck right when I saw him..

262
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:39,042
For what reason is he being like that?

263
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:41,077
Choi Won Gil

264
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:43,471
Chae Won Gil...

265
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:45,403

266
00:17:55,622 --> 00:17:57,960

271
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:15,950
Do I want to go this far to date?

272
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:22,315
Choi Won Gil, Choi Won Il

273
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:25,925
Choi Won Gil, Choi Won Il

274
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:29,114
Aish..

275
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:33,280
Did they set up to live in a car?
Why aren't they here yet?

276
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:52,730

277
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,448
Hedgehog, you already came.

278
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:03,288
Won Il has to go.

279
00:19:03,288 --> 00:19:06,004
I'll come tomorrow, have time for me.

280
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:07,412
I have to tell you something important.

281
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,761
Say it right now! Why come again tomorrow?

282
00:19:09,761 --> 00:19:11,929
There's no time today.

283
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:14,322
I have to go to the airport to pick up foreign customers and go to a meeting.

284
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:16,066
Then what are you doing wasting so much time?

285
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:19,922
I went to track down my phone like you told me to but it failed.

286
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:21,850
We came back from the police station.

287
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,424
"We"?

288
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,553
That's nice to hear.

289
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:29,562
I'm sorry for today.

290
00:19:29,562 --> 00:19:30,791
Let's talk tomorrow.

291
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,222
I don't have time tomorrow.

292
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:33,787
Why not?

293
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:35,022
What are you going to do yourself?

294
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:38,335
I can't not know! We're business part-

295
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,407
I'll just come the day after tomorrow then!

296
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:46,575
I'm going then, Da Yang!

297
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:49,023
Be careful on your way! See you the day after tomorrow!

298
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:56,933
Why are you treating Won Il badly?

299
00:19:56,933 --> 00:20:01,015
Just like when you made the ByunBinGo macaron, maintain yourself.

300
00:20:01,515 --> 00:20:03,160
You got it?

301
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:07,326
Did you get it??

302
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:09,226
Are you addicted to linking arms or something?

303
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:12,415
Stop linking arms with me and just clean your elbow.

304
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,575
Move your hand.

305
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:23,212
They talk like that about one's elbow as an insult.

306
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:25,384
Not once, but three times.

307
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:30,147
And also, "disgusting"?!

308
00:20:35,347 --> 00:20:39,722
From now on, I'm not going to eat with him and not face each other. Know that!

309
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:42,233
How will you work if you both don't face each other?

310
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:43,843
Panda will be wearing a mask?

311
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,021
You do it yourself!

312
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:46,920
I'll do everything later!

313
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:49,176
Oh my...

314
00:20:49,176 --> 00:20:51,287
Why is she so angry?

315
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:00,837
I see, you're not following me?

316
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,971
Did Pan Da Yang come yet?

317
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,416
What? Why are you here?

318
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:06,200
You told me to sleep.

319
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,785
You sleep just because I told you to sleep?!

320
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:10,204
Ah, this punk tells me to do this and that.

321
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:13,080
Did Pan Da Yang kiss with Choi Won Il?

322
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,496
How would I know that??

323
00:21:14,496 --> 00:21:17,350
Why would a person who doesn't know everything get mad!

324
00:21:17,632 --> 00:21:20,676
Get out, get out. Get out, get out, get out!

325
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:22,716
Aish.

326
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:28,597
I thought really hard about it.

327
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:29,574
Just sleep.

328
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:33,495
You get sensitive and mad at everything because you're lacking sleep.

329
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:35,177
Just think of it as a good thing.

330
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:36,924
Just because they were embracing their arms.

331
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:40,187
Do you think Choi Won Il would be tattooed there?

332
00:21:40,187 --> 00:21:41,526
You told me sleep!

333
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:44,565
But, as I saw today,

334
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:46,692
you're so into Pan Da Yang!

335
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:48,520
What?!

336
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,447
You're not a hedgehog that gets burned up with a fighting spirit,

337
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:54,619
but a hedgehog that gets burned up with jealousy.

338
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:57,207
Stop talking bull and just get out!

339
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:02,069
Okay. I'll go.

340
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:05,646
So, you put your 2 hands here, and think well.

341
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:09,203
Whether or not you've started liking Panda without even knowing it.

342
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,589
Will you confess?

343
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:12,055
Will it be with a cake because you're embarrassed?

344
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:14,437
Will Choi Won Il take her?

345
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:15,097
Okay?

346
00:22:20,534 --> 00:22:22,334
What should I do?

347
00:22:22,796 --> 00:22:25,930
I MUST BE CRAZY!

348
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:40,018
I see how it is, you're not even apologizing, and it has become night!

349
00:22:40,554 --> 00:22:44,151
Fine, let's see...

350
00:22:52,895 --> 00:22:59,820
Hyung, doesn't this hand shine more than the other?

351
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,700
Did you eat something wrong? Why do you keep on acting disgusting, punk?

352
00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:11,288
This arm was embraced by Da Yang's arm, and this hand was held by Da Yang's hand!

353
00:23:11,288 --> 00:23:13,161
You lost your mind...

354
00:23:13,161 --> 00:23:16,971
Hey, you went to meet Ko Seung Ji, not to hold Pan Da Yang's hands!

355
00:23:16,971 --> 00:23:18,749
Don't you know it?

356
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:19,844
What is it?

357
00:23:19,844 --> 00:23:22,865
Your business comes before your private life.

358
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:26,466
Really...Hyung, you've never dated, right?

359
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:27,890
What are you talking about?

360
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,574
When Da Yang holds my arm and hand,

361
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:34,490
would I let that go, and do my business
 with Ko Seung Ji?

362
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,940
Where am I...?
What am I doing now...?

363
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,043
When I wake up, it would all be wrecked.

364
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:43,679
Boss, please don't play around here.

365
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,812
The director has been watching both of you.

366
00:23:46,812 --> 00:23:50,024
So...Please be careful...

367
00:23:51,436 --> 00:23:53,498
He left.

368
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:23,380
I can't just give my unnie like that to your oppa!

369
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,394
If it's 2 to 1, my hyung would be at a disadvantage.

370
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:27,456
Hey, it should be 1 to 1.

371
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:28,639
Aren't you at your brother's side?

372
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:31,993
1 point to my brother, 1 point to Hedgehog.

373
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:34,640
Then, that's that.

374
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,937
I'll fire you if you don't listen to me.

375
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:43,275
Why are you talking in a way that makes me scared?!

376
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,470
What's the strategy?

377
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,749
What's the need for it?

378
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:50,275
We just have to get them to watch the store together.

379
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,137
Who are you calling?

380
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:55,136
Gil Dong Goo.

381
00:24:55,136 --> 00:24:56,657
Stop wasting your time...

382
00:24:56,657 --> 00:25:00,340
I have to deliver a cake, so watch the store.

383
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:04,241
Ask Hedgehog to do it.

384
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:05,272
He's not here.

385
00:25:05,272 --> 00:25:06,746
Where did he go?

386
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:10,970
I don't know. He went out.

387
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:15,800
Probably he went to find the car, 
it's more precious than me.

388
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:20,196
 Favorite color: pink,  favoirte flower: white rose, favorite season: summer.

389
00:25:20,196 --> 00:25:26,106
 Favorite color? Favorite snack? Favorite thing? Favorite word?

390
00:25:26,106 --> 00:25:28,484
Why is it so difficult?!

391
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:29,647
I won't be able to figure it out even if I stayed up all night.

392
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:32,070
I am coming in!

393
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,814
Hey, why don't you knock?

394
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:36,819
Women here don't know how to knock.

395
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:39,798
I am not from here.

396
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:42,850
What are you doing?

397
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,374
Why did you come here?

398
00:25:44,374 --> 00:25:45,517
Please watch the store.

399
00:25:45,517 --> 00:25:49,289
We have to make 2 urgent deliveries, 
so Da Na and I have to go.

400
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:50,757
Panda is here, right?

401
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,742
She's not here.

402
00:25:51,742 --> 00:25:52,939
Where did she go?

403
00:25:52,939 --> 00:25:56,761
Not sure, she looked like she left for an appointment...

404
00:25:56,761 --> 00:25:58,605
I'll leave it in your hands.

405
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:06,658
Did Choi Won Il ask for her?

406
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:21,184
Why are you looking at me like that?

407
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:24,220
Just wipe your mouth!

408
00:26:27,635 --> 00:26:30,424
"Wipe your elbow". "Wipe your mouth".

409
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:34,651
Most women won't hear those things in their life time.

410
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:39,361
If you step on a snail, it will twitch around.

411
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,864
This is not what I thought about all night.

412
00:26:49,864 --> 00:26:52,004
Why did I say "Just wipe your mouth"?

413
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:54,397
Why did I say such a thing?!

414
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:56,317
This mouth!

415
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:58,933
 Think about it carefully.

416
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:03,671
 Would you confess to her? Or, would you wait so long, and Choi Won Il will get her?

417
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:06,485
Would she still kill me even though 
she told me she likes me?

418
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:07,427
I don't know.

419
00:27:07,427 --> 00:27:11,811
Alright, one, two, three, go! Go!

420
00:27:18,822 --> 00:27:28,407

421
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:36,728
Ah, really! where is she?

422
00:27:54,135 --> 00:27:56,550
Pan Da...

423
00:27:57,535 --> 00:28:01,857
Pan Da Yang, are you in there?

424
00:28:13,587 --> 00:28:15,904
Hey, Pan Da Yang,

425
00:28:16,876 --> 00:28:18,708
are you in there?

426
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:27,098
Why don't you come out?

427
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:36,300
Why don't you come out?

428
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:01,187
I was going to get a job, but I have a problem.

429
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:03,682
I came to ask Boss for a favor.

430
00:29:03,682 --> 00:29:05,093
Where's Beom Bo?

431
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:09,015
He went to take a cake to Da Na and Won Yi.

432
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:13,825
That punk, he has more than two girls. A whole fan club.

433
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:15,552
I'm confused.

434
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:20,251
He wanted Da Yang and Seung Ji
 left together by themselves, 
so they can reconcile.

435
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:23,931
When did they ever fight?
 Seung Ji was a little mad.

436
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:27,045
Pan Da Yang and Choi Won Il seem to be kind of

437
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:29,241
Why doesn't he tell her that he likes her?

438
00:29:29,241 --> 00:29:31,331
I coached him to do that too.

439
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:32,870
It's not that easy.

440
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,762
Seung Ji and I are not in good situation to get girls.

441
00:29:36,762 --> 00:29:41,994
Gi Tae, since you wanted to look nice
 for your date that was introduced, 
I didn't know you thought like that.

442
00:29:41,994 --> 00:29:46,557
I don't have anything to show off 
and I have a lot to hide, 
so I'm concerned about how look outside.

443
00:29:46,557 --> 00:29:48,806
But no matter how much we try,

444
00:29:48,806 --> 00:29:51,103
won't girls choose someone like Choi Won Il?

445
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:52,835
Each girl is different.

446
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:55,883
Da Yang won't just go after a guy
 for what he has to offer.

447
00:29:55,883 --> 00:30:00,787
If Beom Bo found out that I made a mistake,
I was afraid that I won't be able to work. 
That's why I couldn't tell you before.

448
00:30:00,787 --> 00:30:07,805
Beom Bo called to say "Pan Da Yang and Choi Won Il were arm in arm gazing at each other in the car."

449
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,165
What? What were they doing...?

450
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:13,104
And, Seung Ji answered that call.

451
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:16,281
What should we do?

452
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:18,100
Hyungnim!

453
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,709
Come...come here for a sec.

454
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:22,742
-What is it?
-Look at this!

455
00:30:22,742 --> 00:30:27,301
Oppa! Oh,oppa! Oppa!

456
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:29,344
Something bad happened!

457
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:32,312
Look at this.

458
00:30:32,312 --> 00:30:34,935
 To: Hedgehog
I won't return unless I find the car.

459
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:37,288
 You shouldn't belittle people like that, Hedgehog.

460
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:39,057
Did your unni want you to do this?

461
00:30:39,057 --> 00:30:40,768
I didn't contact unni.

462
00:30:40,768 --> 00:30:42,949
We're not in this together with unni.

463
00:30:42,949 --> 00:30:44,849
I found it on the ground.

464
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:48,185
I think the customers accidently dropped it from where unni put it...

465
00:30:48,185 --> 00:30:51,099
You really do things to make me happy, don't you?

466
00:30:52,114 --> 00:30:54,317
Boss...

467
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,518
Hey, Da Na, your aunt will do it.
 Get out of there.

468
00:31:03,518 --> 00:31:05,669
I'll do it.

469
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:08,874
What a fool Pan Da Yang is, trying to find the car.

470
00:31:08,874 --> 00:31:14,137
Hedgehog, who went out to find Panda, 
is even more of a fool!
 They are a pair of fools!

471
00:31:14,137 --> 00:31:15,425
Anyway, hurry...

472
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:17,394
Isn't that all because they like each other?

473
00:31:17,394 --> 00:31:21,038
Then why can't they just say that they like each other? It's so frustrating!

474
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:22,257
Aunty will do it!

475
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:24,238
-I'll do it!
-Why?!

476
00:31:24,238 --> 00:31:26,477
You're going to rip that dishwashing cloth!

477
00:31:26,477 --> 00:31:28,712
I just came to check on the design.

478
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:31,828
Why is he coming to check on it every single day?

479
00:31:31,828 --> 00:31:33,423
He doesn't look like the type to be convinced with words.

480
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:34,814
Let's pretend we are looking for it.

481
00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:37,393
He's just ordering a cake.
Why is being so difficult?

482
00:31:37,393 --> 00:31:38,340
Being like this...

483
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,950
He wants our cafe to himself for a party.

484
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:44,563
He will pay 1,000,000 won.

485
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:45,835
Really?!

486
00:31:45,835 --> 00:31:48,317
Then let's find it, hurry!

487
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,104
What's this?

488
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:55,657
Did you find it?

489
00:31:55,657 --> 00:32:00,427
I think I found something even more important.

490
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:08,641
We're working hard to find it.
Why don't you have a seat?

491
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:18,846
Favorite color? White? Black?
No.

492
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:22,428
Favorite Snack? Bamboo Tree?
 No!

493
00:32:22,428 --> 00:32:26,178
Favorite flower?  Bamboo flower?
No.

494
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:30,386
Favorite thing? Cosmetic? Flower? Car?

495
00:32:30,386 --> 00:32:33,098
Favorite word? Money?
No.

496
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:34,883
What are you doing right now?

497
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:40,097
I was looking through the list of questions and answers our patissier made about my niece.

498
00:32:42,722 --> 00:32:46,950
Customer, I couldn't find it anywhere. 
What should I do...?

499
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,627
That's okay.

500
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:52,424
From looking at this, I know he'll do a good job.

501
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:55,203
Thank you.

502
00:32:55,203 --> 00:32:57,892
Good bye.

503
00:32:59,407 --> 00:33:01,768
What's the score?

504
00:33:01,768 --> 00:33:04,081
Zero.

505
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:11,942
Why?

506
00:33:11,942 --> 00:33:13,296
Are you busy?

507
00:33:13,296 --> 00:33:14,314
I'm busy.

508
00:33:14,314 --> 00:33:16,049
Why don't you come, I'll make you not "busy".

509
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:17,355
I said I'm busy!

510
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:21,704
So why don't you come immediately, you punk.

511
00:33:21,704 --> 00:33:24,733
Hello? Grandpa?!

512
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:26,825
I said I was busy. Does he make any sense?! Aish.

513
00:33:26,825 --> 00:33:28,604
Really, he's not any help.

514
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:33,439
-Grandpa, one shot!
-One shot.

515
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,178
Come in please.

516
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:45,279
Huh? He looks familiar.

517
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:51,118
Hey, why are you just looking?
Take her home right now.

518
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:53,695
You're the one who got her drunk. 
Why should I be bothered?

519
00:33:53,695 --> 00:33:55,867
Of course you should be, since she's like that because of you.

520
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,177
You have a good excuse.

521
00:33:57,177 --> 00:33:58,752
I wanted to find out how she feels, punk.

522
00:33:58,752 --> 00:34:02,496
-What feelings?
-If she likes the telephone pole or you.

523
00:34:02,496 --> 00:34:04,089
You get into all kinds of nonsense.

524
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:05,874
I can't live because of you, grandpa.

525
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:10,968
Oh, really? Then, I'll just go to sleep without telling you what Pan Da Yang told me.

526
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:14,323
-Grandpa, it's not your bedtime yet.
-I want to go to bed a little early.

527
00:34:14,323 --> 00:34:17,609
Anyway, he's not any help...

528
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:18,525
So what did she say?

529
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:21,714
I have to go to bed a little early too.

530
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:26,629
Noonim, why are you doing this too?
Do you think I'll say that
 you're not his daughter?

531
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,357
Hey, be quiet...!

532
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:47,116
Hey, ugly guy!

533
00:34:47,116 --> 00:34:51,354
Just stay still.

534
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:54,139
If we stay still, how are we going to go home?

535
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:58,367
Do you know how hard is riding this?

536
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:01,811
Come here and ride it.

537
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:04,013
Then stand up.

538
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:06,091
I can't take this.

539
00:35:06,091 --> 00:35:11,228
I'm dizzy just from sitting here, so how can I ride standing up?

540
00:35:11,228 --> 00:35:13,657
I'll give you a piggyback ride, so stand up.

541
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:18,163
You should've done that before, why now?

542
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:21,902
I feel so dizzy right now.

543
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:24,888
How can I piggyback you all the way from Grandpa's to here?

544
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:27,829
Then, we can take a taxi.

545
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:30,137
You said you'll feel like throwing up if we take it.

546
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:33,134
Then, we can walk.

547
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:36,610
You said your legs will get sore, so you can't walk.

548
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,842
Who said?

549
00:35:38,842 --> 00:35:41,469
How much alcohol did he feed her?

550
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:45,342
A lot~

551
00:35:45,342 --> 00:35:48,564
Sit here! I'll push you.

552
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,780
What is that?

553
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:55,374
We're taking turns!

554
00:35:55,374 --> 00:35:58,839
You try it...

555
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:01,373
You go through it once!

556
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,766
Oh, be careful!

557
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:12,457
Hedgehog..

558
00:36:12,457 --> 00:36:15,646
Why are you here?

559
00:36:15,646 --> 00:36:17,876
I'm going to go crazy.

560
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:20,158
I'm also going to go crazy.

561
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:25,556
No matter how much I look for it, I can't find the car.

562
00:36:25,556 --> 00:36:28,517
What should I do?

563
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:31,211
What do you mean, "what should I do"..

564
00:36:33,822 --> 00:36:39,887
Let's go somewhere more comfortable.

565
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:49,717
Get a hold of yourself, Go Seung Ji. Would you like a girl even if she's like this?

566
00:36:57,016 --> 00:36:59,731
Let's go home.

567
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:12,689
I'm seriously crazy.

568
00:37:22,837 --> 00:37:27,149
I'm a crazy guy, did you hear me?

569
00:37:27,149 --> 00:37:29,967
What's up with this, seriously.

570
00:37:44,794 --> 00:37:47,740
How much did you drink?

571
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:53,335
How did I get home?

572
00:37:53,335 --> 00:37:57,025
How did you come? Hedghog Oppa piggybacked you.

573
00:37:57,025 --> 00:38:03,948
What a muddled situation. We were fighting when I left, and then when I came back he piggybacked me.

574
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,673
What should I do?

575
00:38:05,673 --> 00:38:08,682
What do you me "what should I do?
You useless girl!

576
00:38:08,682 --> 00:38:12,219
How could you come home like that...?

577
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:30,276
Sober now?

578
00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:36,646
But, what is this?

579
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:39,666
Are you sure you're sober?

580
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:51,881
This is not right...

581
00:39:07,752 --> 00:39:09,978
Is your back okay?

582
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:12,037
I heard you piggybacked me.

583
00:39:12,037 --> 00:39:13,453
Are you stupid?

584
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:16,492
So stupid that you'd run away and go to my house?

585
00:39:16,492 --> 00:39:19,275
The closest things are the hardest to see. 
  (An old saying. Literally, 'the darkest place is the base of a lamp.')

586
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:22,259
Does my grandpa look like a lamp to you?

587
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:25,857
I have no money and phone, then where do I go eat?

588
00:39:25,857 --> 00:39:27,603
Do you die if you don't eat 1 meal?

589
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:29,154
It's not just 1 meal!

590
00:39:29,154 --> 00:39:33,185
I only ate 1 toast and continued to starve.

591
00:39:34,723 --> 00:39:37,088
So instead of food, you drank alcohol?

592
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:43,803
Since Grandpa bought me meat,
 I ate as much as I wanted.

593
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:46,074
I heard Grandpa asked you something.

594
00:39:46,074 --> 00:39:47,000
What?

595
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,793
 Da Yang!

596
00:39:48,793 --> 00:39:50,196
 Go Seung Ji!

597
00:39:50,196 --> 00:39:54,007
Why does that guy come when I'm trying to have a talk with you?

598
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:06,764
You're here?

599
00:40:06,764 --> 00:40:07,917
Yeah.

600
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:09,562
Why are you both walking up from there?

601
00:40:09,562 --> 00:40:12,383
We walk up from the basement, do we go down then?!

602
00:40:12,383 --> 00:40:13,974
Let's talk.

603
00:40:13,974 --> 00:40:19,006
Am I crazy to talk to you?!

604
00:40:19,865 --> 00:40:21,776
Why is he so prickly so early in the morning?

605
00:40:21,776 --> 00:40:24,887
I think I got really drunk last night.

606
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:25,969
What?

607
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:29,962
Hedgehog won't really want to see me since he's mad, so I'll go upstairs.

608
00:40:29,962 --> 00:40:32,266
Should I buy you hangover soup?

609
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:33,729
Da Na already made it.

610
00:40:33,729 --> 00:40:35,894
Go talk with him.

611
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:52,227
Why? You should buy her hangover soup.

612
00:40:52,227 --> 00:40:53,034
Let's talk.

613
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:56,378
Then do it! TALK!

614
00:41:04,668 --> 00:41:07,059
Hedgehog is always in a bad mood.

615
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:09,046
Because I didn't find the car.

616
00:41:09,046 --> 00:41:10,221
You stupid.

617
00:41:10,221 --> 00:41:14,698
It's not the car, it's because he was afraid you'll get taken away.

618
00:41:14,698 --> 00:41:20,592
You really don't know that Choi Won Il and Hedgehog are fighting over you?

619
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,822
I guess I'm not sober enough.

620
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:27,316
I'm hearing stuff like Hedgehog and Won Il are fighting over me.

621
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:29,797
It's right!

622
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:30,928
WHAT?

623
00:41:30,928 --> 00:41:35,777
WHY? Why aren't you speaking? Say it!

624
00:41:35,777 --> 00:41:37,056
It's gone.

625
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:38,485
What you wanted to say?

626
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:40,543
No!

627
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:43,748
The macarons that you sent to me disappeared

628
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:50,410
and the next morning, Saint Honoure stole released the designs from those.

629
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,668
 There are people who steal other people's skills and become famous.

630
00:41:53,668 --> 00:41:58,209
Those designs Choi Jae Gyum stole... they were mine?

631
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:01,175
You already knew?

632
00:42:09,508 --> 00:42:15,611
Why do they like me?
What did I do?

633
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:19,479
Think carefully.

634
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:23,058
Who do you like as a man?

635
00:42:26,854 --> 00:42:30,866
I've never thought both of them as men.

636
00:42:30,866 --> 00:42:37,686
Then, out of the two, who would you prefer to kiss with?

637
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:40,319
HUH?!

638
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,246
What do you mean, "huh?" You're already 28.

639
00:42:43,246 --> 00:42:47,255
Just get a hold of yourself and think hard about it!

640
00:42:50,172 --> 00:42:53,472
I didn't kiss any of them, so I don't know.

641
00:42:53,472 --> 00:42:54,864
Ahh, so frustrating!

642
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,031
Then try doing it!

643
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,956
I can't do that! As a human, or as a thief.

644
00:42:58,956 --> 00:43:01,529
I'm not telling you to kiss them!

645
00:43:01,529 --> 00:43:03,945
I'm telling you to date both of them.

646
00:43:03,945 --> 00:43:06,770
Who you want to be with more,

647
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:12,777
Who you miss more, feel that, you STUPID.

648
00:43:12,777 --> 00:43:15,351
I did that with Hedgehog.

649
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:18,547
Is that, a real date?

650
00:43:18,547 --> 00:43:21,705
Oh, real date?

651
00:43:21,705 --> 00:43:27,127
But, if I two-time, wouldn't I get punished?

652
00:43:28,412 --> 00:43:31,869
What a happy dilemma! Then be upfront with the guys about trying out both of them.

653
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:33,940
Can I get some water?

654
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,511
You go drink it.

655
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:37,829
Jeez, as if I'm not a paying customer...

656
00:43:39,695 --> 00:43:41,987
Choi Jae Gyum copied my macarons-

657
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:45,769
why are you telling me this?

658
00:43:45,769 --> 00:43:49,936
What's the reason you dislike that person so much?

659
00:43:49,936 --> 00:43:54,632
Because he's a person who has no skills to make cake.

660
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,886
Why do you dislike him?

661
00:43:57,737 --> 00:44:01,331
Because he's a person who SHOULDN'T make cake.

662
00:44:01,331 --> 00:44:03,671
You...

663
00:44:03,671 --> 00:44:06,386
Are you copying me because I look cool?

664
00:44:06,386 --> 00:44:09,245
Is that why you're also into Panda?

665
00:44:09,245 --> 00:44:11,475
Let's lodge an appeal.

666
00:44:11,475 --> 00:44:14,303
With regards to the theft of the macarons, we could compensate you or split the profit...

667
00:44:14,303 --> 00:44:16,364
I dont know that means,  'appeal.'

668
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:18,411
Aye, seriously...

669
00:44:18,411 --> 00:44:22,912
It means that first we have to-
 I don't literally mean that I don't understand, 
I mean that  my personal affairs gets all mixed up together with my business matters...
like a 'public-private  jjamppong.'

670
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:25,169
What's a "public-private jjamppong"?

671
00:44:25,169 --> 00:44:30,761
Oh. Because President Choi did wrong,
you obviously give up?

672
00:44:30,761 --> 00:44:34,380
You don't know me yet?!

673
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:40,130
"In exchange for receiving compensation for Choi Jae Gyum's wrongdoings, give up on Miss Panda"?

674
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,698
Is that all she's worth to you, the price of a macaron?

675
00:44:41,698 --> 00:44:45,891
And what was it you said? "Receive compensation or share the profits?"

676
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:53,866
That macaron, you, me, and Pan Da Yang, is an expression of ourselves.

677
00:44:53,866 --> 00:44:57,796
Choi Jae Gyum is selling us any way he wants, but with that money, we compensated him.

678
00:44:57,796 --> 00:45:00,162
Do we say we received it well?

679
00:45:00,162 --> 00:45:02,288
Do you even have pride?

680
00:45:02,288 --> 00:45:06,203
Then explain it properly, what you meant by the "public-private jjamppong"!

681
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:09,393
If I "publically" make a cake,

682
00:45:09,393 --> 00:45:12,648
I "privately" think of your face.

683
00:45:12,648 --> 00:45:14,569
I can no longer keep my private thoughts from invading my (public) work!

684
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:16,027
Why would you think of my face?

685
00:45:16,027 --> 00:45:19,746
What do you mean, why?!
Because I want to hit you!

686
00:45:21,268 --> 00:45:23,711
Aren't you being way too honest?

687
00:45:23,711 --> 00:45:27,600
Then, should I sneak around right in front of you?

688
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,975
If you're such a great guy, then act like a man!

689
00:45:30,975 --> 00:45:34,086
I... I want to punch you once too!

690
00:45:34,086 --> 00:45:37,004
Alright, then let's go out and have a fight.

691
00:45:37,004 --> 00:45:40,076
What should we compete with? What, one two?

692
00:45:40,076 --> 00:45:42,432
A streetfight?

693
00:45:42,432 --> 00:45:45,648
Oh! Pencak Silat!

694
00:45:45,648 --> 00:45:46,665
What's that?

695
00:45:46,665 --> 00:45:48,491
A traditional Malaysian martial art.

696
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:51,826
Like I have the time to learn a Malaysian martial art and fight you!

697
00:45:51,826 --> 00:45:56,351
Then just fight the way you usually do, and if you lose.. then you have to step back from Da yang.

698
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,401
That's your job so do whatever you want.

699
00:45:58,401 --> 00:46:00,962
You should set some ground rules! "I'll back off-"

700
00:46:00,962 --> 00:46:02,484
I'LL BACK OFF, OKAY!

701
00:46:02,484 --> 00:46:05,418
End of the love triangle!

702
00:46:13,047 --> 00:46:15,829
Who is that?

703
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:20,153
Do you really don't know? 
With those clothing really...

704
00:46:21,262 --> 00:46:23,000
That...

705
00:46:23,117 --> 00:46:24,795
Are you Da Yang?

706
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:28,797
Da Yang, get up

707
00:46:28,797 --> 00:46:31,574
Are you okay?

708
00:46:31,574 --> 00:46:32,691
Why are you hiding your face?

709
00:46:32,691 --> 00:46:37,097
Since I overheard, I don't think I can face you.

710
00:46:37,097 --> 00:46:39,108
What did you hear?

711
00:46:39,108 --> 00:46:42,097
Because of me, you'll give up your duel.

712
00:46:42,097 --> 00:46:43,971
Because you like me so much that you can't go on.

713
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:45,530
Get a hold of yourself.

714
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,459
I didn't say I would live or die because of you.

715
00:46:49,197 --> 00:46:51,498
You didn't say it in front of me,

716
00:46:51,498 --> 00:46:55,222
but the mood's already become all shaken up.

717
00:46:55,222 --> 00:46:58,086
But, even if you like me,

718
00:46:58,086 --> 00:47:02,202
I hope you won't fight.

719
00:47:02,202 --> 00:47:06,172
Then answer! Who do you like out of us two?

720
00:47:08,055 --> 00:47:10,791
Honestly?
Yes.

721
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:20,734
Because you both said you'll have a match, I suddenly like both of you.

722
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:27,326
You can't date both of us!

723
00:47:27,326 --> 00:47:30,665
Then, to make it easier to decide,

724
00:47:30,665 --> 00:47:33,024
how about run around my way?

725
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:37,085
Why do you have to go there?

726
00:47:37,085 --> 00:47:39,755
Hedgehog! This is not the time for cake!

727
00:47:39,755 --> 00:47:42,563
I have the power to decide.

728
00:47:42,563 --> 00:47:49,938
Oh, then Da Yang will...

729
00:47:49,938 --> 00:47:52,880
Wow! You lost!

730
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,751
You said that you were backing off!

731
00:47:54,751 --> 00:47:57,452
I'm not a person to back off like this!

732
00:47:57,452 --> 00:48:01,685
I'll definitely DO IT!

733
00:48:03,456 --> 00:48:07,503
Then, Round 1, 
Start!

734
00:48:12,837 --> 00:48:15,838
Clean your saliva, the floor will get dirty.

735
00:48:16,953 --> 00:48:22,109
Hey stupid, how can we start? You should tell us how.

736
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:23,847
Ah, right. Okay,

737
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:29,226
Anyway, you have to do good thing for each other.

738
00:48:29,226 --> 00:48:32,750
Like in a cake competition, you'll be judged fairly.

739
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,383
I'll decide who I'll have my first date with.

740
00:48:35,383 --> 00:48:40,776
Let's get back together next time and talk!

741
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,831
What do you want me to teach?

742
00:48:45,831 --> 00:48:49,274
What can I do for Choi Won Il that he would like?

743
00:48:49,274 --> 00:48:52,125
Did you beat him up?
He won't reconcile?

744
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:55,466
Then, did you set fire to Saint Honore?

745
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:57,000
It's not like that

746
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,517
Then you should tell me what.

747
00:49:00,517 --> 00:49:05,422
Pan Da said that she will decide who to like and...

748
00:49:05,422 --> 00:49:06,844
Date the first man?

749
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:09,044
Why do you know so much about dating?

750
00:49:09,044 --> 00:49:10,375
Then just go!

751
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:14,784
No, let's no do this. Just teach how to do that.

752
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:17,963
There are three types of rivals.

753
00:49:17,963 --> 00:49:20,154
Just listen to me.

754
00:49:20,154 --> 00:49:23,045
First, a guy who is smaller than you.

755
00:49:23,045 --> 00:49:25,479
Second, a guy who is about your size.

756
00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:28,724
Third, a guy who is bigger than you.

757
00:49:28,724 --> 00:49:29,978
What, are you joking?

758
00:49:29,978 --> 00:49:31,581
I told you to listen to the end!

759
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:36,991
Guys, who are tall like a telephone pole, are soft.

760
00:49:36,991 --> 00:49:39,537
So?
The crying method.

761
00:49:39,537 --> 00:49:40,840
You're telling me to cry?

762
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:47,109
I'm saying that you have to shed some moving tears so that her heart will become weak, and then catch her.

763
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,847
Oh talk in a way so I can understand!

764
00:49:49,847 --> 00:49:53,329
What don't you understand?

765
00:49:55,415 --> 00:49:58,489
Just tell me! I'll just buy everything you tell me to.

766
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:00,167
I'm not hungry

767
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:03,579
Then, we can buy something that won't make you hungry.

768
00:50:03,579 --> 00:50:05,211
Go buy ice cream.

769
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:06,999
Ice cream, alright

770
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:12,143
I'll go buy that quickly, so go think of a really good strategy, okay?

771
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:14,681
Come back early!

772
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:18,195
What's wrong with my Hyung?!
I'm really dying to know!

773
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:20,449
Just think of something quick, okay?

774
00:50:20,449 --> 00:50:22,371
You know Ko Seung Ji well.

775
00:50:22,371 --> 00:50:24,533
So what is that one can do for ko Seung Ji?

776
00:50:24,533 --> 00:50:27,394
Well, one can help him to date Pan Da Yang.

777
00:50:27,394 --> 00:50:28,640
You, really.

778
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,961
Then you say something.

779
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:34,569
I would sincerely enjoy eating his cake.

780
00:50:34,569 --> 00:50:38,246
Hyung, you can't get yourself to do that!

781
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:42,262
Then, why did Pan Da Yang say nonsense and make someone so tiresome?

782
00:50:42,262 --> 00:50:44,336
She should have just left them to beat up each other.

783
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:46,124
Hyung, you get pressured from only one side.

784
00:50:46,124 --> 00:50:48,622
I'll get tormented again tomorrow!

785
00:50:48,622 --> 00:50:53,093
You might easily become a scapegoat if you're in the middle, so watch your mouth.

786
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:57,759
It would be nice to not go to Cafe Panda until Round 1 is over, right?

787
00:50:59,785 --> 00:51:02,075
I thought of it.

788
00:51:10,656 --> 00:51:13,936
Maculinea teleius.

789
00:51:13,936 --> 00:51:17,313
Aspidomorpha trans...

790
00:51:21,733 --> 00:51:24,136
What are you doing?

791
00:51:35,899 --> 00:51:38,394
What is it?

792
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:42,748
I came here for Won Yi, to assist you.

793
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,444
You're ditching being the President?

794
00:51:45,444 --> 00:51:48,020
It's the summer!

795
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,336
Don't you guys do business during the summer?

796
00:51:50,336 --> 00:51:52,732
I have vacation in the summer!

797
00:51:52,732 --> 00:51:56,318
If something urgent happens, Ga Eun will notify me.

798
00:51:56,318 --> 00:51:58,155
You're trying hard.

799
00:51:58,155 --> 00:52:00,832
I don't have any choice!

800
00:52:00,832 --> 00:52:02,983
You cut your hair?

801
00:52:02,983 --> 00:52:05,531
It's not that good.

802
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,518
Father, eat lunch.

803
00:52:12,518 --> 00:52:14,526
Why don't you make noodles for lunch?

804
00:52:14,526 --> 00:52:17,427
Grandpa! I came.

805
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:21,269
From now, I, Won Yi, will be working with you.

806
00:52:21,269 --> 00:52:24,327
She said that things are a bit touchy right now at Panda's cafe,

807
00:52:24,327 --> 00:52:26,762
so she's coming here.

808
00:52:26,762 --> 00:52:30,844
Also there was something Seung Ji 
 discussed with you, Dad.

809
00:52:30,844 --> 00:52:36,846
Right. then ask her what she likes? What's kind of meat do you like so I can go buy it?

810
00:52:36,846 --> 00:52:39,254
I can't even smell it!
No way!

811
00:52:39,254 --> 00:52:41,626
I have to follow the Lord.

812
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:45,148
Then, we'll have noodles.

813
00:52:45,148 --> 00:52:50,139
Ah...I was going train Seung Ji's assistant, but

814
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:54,654
I should stop now. Seung Ji teaches much better than I do.

815
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,313
Aish, really. Do it here!

816
00:53:12,809 --> 00:53:14,968
Move!

817
00:53:16,892 --> 00:53:19,283
Move.

818
00:53:22,347 --> 00:53:26,852
Why cleaning now, I'm not done yet?!

819
00:53:39,214 --> 00:53:42,519
The pen ink won't come out.

820
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,184
Bring it to me.

821
00:53:44,184 --> 00:53:47,514
Get a pen. It won't come out.

822
00:53:48,654 --> 00:53:51,084
Hurry!

823
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:56,424
What he think he is?!

824
00:53:56,424 --> 00:53:59,101
Where is it?

825
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:07,630
Ugh, really.

826
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:12,296
Here, eat it.

827
00:54:13,114 --> 00:54:15,648
It's okay.

828
00:54:15,648 --> 00:54:19,036
I'm specially letting you taste it, so eat it.

829
00:54:19,036 --> 00:54:21,691
Just make this! Are we going to stay up all night?

830
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:23,191
Of course we have to stay up all night!

831
00:54:23,191 --> 00:54:26,788
Is a patissier someone who just takes it easy the day before his cake comes out?

832
00:54:27,745 --> 00:54:30,119
You're right.

833
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:32,583
My dad was also like that.

834
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:38,617
The day before the new cake was delivered, he would look at the cake and do an all-nighter.

835
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,518
It's been twenty years since I 
watched someone making a cake.

836
00:54:42,518 --> 00:54:45,726
Someone who makes cakes good!

837
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:50,059
Hey, you really came here to steal my cake, right?

838
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:51,470
Aish, really, do you want to die?

839
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:54,994
Da Yang! Choi Won Il is trying to kill me!

840
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,687
I definitely made myself clear to you that you have to do something good for each other.

841
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:06,415
One says "Do you want to die?" And the other tattletales.

842
00:55:06,415 --> 00:55:08,247
The mood is never good.

843
00:55:08,247 --> 00:55:09,762
What do you mean it's not good?

844
00:55:09,762 --> 00:55:13,544
Ko Seung Ji is protecting Choi Won Il.
What can be better than that?

845
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:15,327
I'm the one who began the admiration!

846
00:55:15,327 --> 00:55:19,745
I came here with my own two feet for Ko Seung Ji.

847
00:55:20,961 --> 00:55:26,173
If you keep up like this, I could meet a third man.

848
00:55:28,317 --> 00:55:29,519
Let's work.

849
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:33,039
Let's work hard.
Let's work hard!

850
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:38,340
Ohh it's feels so great to be like this!

851
00:55:42,348 --> 00:55:47,555
Da Yang! Da Yang!

852
00:55:52,727 --> 00:55:58,496
They're cute. They are really following what I said.
 I wasn't even serious about it.

853
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:05,242
They both are desirable, what should I do?

854
00:56:46,921 --> 00:56:49,559
Yes. I like it.

855
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:52,038
Really?

856
00:57:07,419 --> 00:57:09,337
Hey, Won Il, can you talk?

857
00:57:09,337 --> 00:57:11,592
Yeah Hyung, what is it?

858
00:57:11,592 --> 00:57:13,580
I think they stole again.

859
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,431
What did you say?

860
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:19,812
The person who made macaroons is suddenly disappeared.

861
00:57:40,602 --> 00:57:42,332
 Why do you endure that?

862
00:57:42,332 --> 00:57:44,419
 Why do you let them keep on taking from you, 
like you're stupid? Why?!

863
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,834
 Because I have nothing.

864
00:57:45,834 --> 00:57:49,540
 I've always gotten stolen, so if I don't endure, I know something will happen!

865
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:54,403
 You didn't come as Saint Honore's President, but as Ko Seung Ji's friend. 
You came for Ko Seung Ji?

866
00:57:54,403 --> 00:57:55,888
 Yes, that's right.

867
00:57:55,888 --> 00:57:57,766
 What happened?

868
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:00,121
 Maculinea teleius.

869
00:58:00,121 --> 00:58:02,687
 Aspidomorpha transparipennis.

870
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:05,537
 Rhyssa persuasoria.

871
00:58:05,537 --> 00:58:09,417
 Homotropus tarsatorius.
