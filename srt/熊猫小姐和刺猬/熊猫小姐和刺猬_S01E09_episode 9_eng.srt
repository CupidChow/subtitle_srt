1
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,417
Let's kiss once while there's nobody around.

2
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:53,019
Huh?

3
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,685
Let's do it.

4
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:57,038
Hedgehog, it's a foul play. This is your first warning.

5
00:00:57,038 --> 00:00:59,435
-If I have to give you a third warning...
-Out.

6
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:04,156
I'll give a chance to go on a date to Won Il...

7
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:07,993
Then, let's just kiss three times,

8
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:10,077
and go see Won Il.

9
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:15,722
It's alright. I'm not an easy woman.

10
00:01:18,102 --> 00:01:20,823
I'm not an easy man either.

11
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:22,845
Are you going to...

12
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:25,168
marry me?

13
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,860
What...?

14
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,203
If we kiss once, twice, three times,

15
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:36,271
after we do it again and again, you might say"it's not fun anymore, it's going too slow."

16
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:40,083
Then, we'll be doing everything.

17
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,896
Still, we won't marry?

18
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,653
Why is it so hot all of a sudden...?

19
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,946
Are you going to marry me?

20
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:56,365
Why don't you get up?

21
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:01,364
I'm Jajangmyun, right?

22
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:02,105
What?

23
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:06,915
It's an easy menu. The one you can decide easily if you want to eat.

24
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:13,200
It's always around, not burdensome, and take care of your hunger like Jajangmyun!

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,395
Talk sensibly. I just asked to kiss once. Why are you talking about marriage and Jajangmyun?

26
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:22,359
Don't do it if you don't want to.

27
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:25,089
Go ahead.

28
00:02:25,089 --> 00:02:27,771
You wrecked the mood. What do you want to do?

29
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:36,132
If you have the confidence to be the best dad to our children, then you can kiss me.

30
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:41,680
See! I'm Jajangmyun!

31
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,857
 Episode 9.

32
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,312
How dare does he want to kiss me randomly? I am speechless.

33
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:07,322
There are proper steps to follow. There's a time and place for everything.

34
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:12,858
After talking about Eun Bi...Won Il...does it make any sense to kiss once?

35
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:15,452
Is he always aggressive with girls?

36
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:21,726
If it's a first kiss, then why can't we do it inside where it's cozy, 
or under an umbrellla on a rainy day, 
or under a  romantic moonlight.

37
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:24,325
There's nothing memorable for a lifetime here.

38
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:28,946
My sister's upstairs, and people passing by can see through the wide and open windows.

39
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:30,856
Does it make any sense to kiss?

40
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:35,483
Why not just do it during rush hour at a subway station?

41
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:43,456
Why did she bring up having kids all of a sudden?!

42
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,777
I am really speechless.

43
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:50,036
Everything has proper steps to follow. 
Just decide on marriage without kissing?

44
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:53,192
Is it panda's way?

45
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:53,787
Of course,

46
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:56,390
if she likes me, would she have me compete against Choi Won Il?

47
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:01,364
Why is the first round necessary? Why do we even  have to do three rounds?

48
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:07,503
If there were more, we would have to schledule a tornament.

49
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:11,579
Aishi, really...Is she a panda or a fox?

50
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:17,114
Why did he call it a peck? Just call it a first kiss!

51
00:04:17,114 --> 00:04:21,921
Does he think I'm a child, not to even have kissed?

52
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:26,198
And, I already had my first kiss in the first grade.

53
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:28,381
With whom?

54
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:29,496
Weren't you sleeping?

55
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:31,704
Who did you kiss?

56
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,835
The baker's son in the neighborhood.

57
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:35,482
Then, how come I don't know him?

58
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:39,122
Because it was before you were born.
Oh...

59
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:43,162
But, do you consider it as a kiss if you did it in the first grade?

60
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:46,917
All of a sudden, he said he'll definitely marry Noona,

61
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:49,204
then he suddenly

62
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:52,392
did it intensely for a long time.

63
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:57,578
It must have been really intense since you, who have a bad memory, can still remember it.

64
00:04:57,578 --> 00:05:00,585
Of course I can't forget. How could I?

65
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:05,042
His fate might have changed because of me.

66
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:07,317
Why?

67
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:10,167
They had a bakery.

68
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:14,630
The bakery burned down in a fire, so the police took his mom.

69
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,831
I had been admiring the cakes in the window at the time  
and wound up acting as his guardian.

70
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:22,367
-Mom!
-Since his father didn't come for him,
 he lived us for a while.
-Mom!

71
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:26,318
After a while his dad came for him,

72
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:28,829
but he came back, saying he wanted to live with me instead.

73
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:34,195
Our father said no, and told him to go back to his father. He was turned away.

74
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:40,781
But according to the neighbors, he never went back  to his father and just disappeared.

75
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:43,601
What do you mean he disappeared?

76
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:46,958
When he came to find me because his father abandoned him,

77
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:52,470
I never got to see him. Because he was rejected by our father, he went away somewhere alone.

78
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,322
How old was he then?

79
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:55,989
He was 6 years old.

80
00:05:55,989 --> 00:06:00,865
Where could a six year old go? 
Unni, you didn't do anything about it after hearing that?

81
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:04,359
What you mean I didn't do anything? 
I looked for him everyday crying.

82
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:07,461
I didn't eat. I didn't go to school.

83
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:09,226
So?

84
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:14,483
Our parents thought I would be wrecked this way, so they decided to have a sibling for me.

85
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:18,917
That's why...I was born...?

86
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:22,255
Was I born so that you could stop crying?

87
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:27,189
Instead of the neighborhood's baker's son who you had the first kiss with?

88
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:31,481
Is it important to know why one is conceived?
Some are conceived while their parents are drunk.

89
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:34,861
Some are conceived during a one-night stand when their parents cheat.

90
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,329
There are many different reasons that aren't too proud.

91
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:40,531
Do you think that would make me feel better?

92
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:44,337
How many would be conceived after a holy prayer?

93
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:48,752
Eventhough the beginning may have been precarious, 
isn't it good enough as long as they grew up with love?

94
00:06:48,752 --> 00:06:54,019
Did I grow up with love? Dad was always trying to please you, and I always came in second.

95
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:57,146
My whole life has been a supplement to you.

96
00:06:57,146 --> 00:07:01,325
You misunderstood!
I thought I was the supplement to you, all this time.

97
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:07,336
Don't be silly!
I'm seriously mad at Mom and Dad.

98
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,209
Why did Hedgehog want to kiss me, and

99
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:14,992
ended up talking about one's conception.

100
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:25,414
So, what is "the best dad"?

101
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:28,166
Does he have a lot of money, education, and comes from a good family background?

102
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,662
A director of a big company? Or,

103
00:07:30,662 --> 00:07:33,005
a president?

104
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,806
You choose Choi Won Il.

105
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:40,624
You're beating around the bush, right?

106
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:44,420
Aishi!

107
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:54,320
Why did things have to get so messed up that I can't even sleep?

108
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,213
What are you going to do about this?
Are you going to take responsibility, Hedghog?

109
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,401
Perhaps, thinking that I dumped him,

110
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:06,712
could he be crying?

111
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:27,078

112
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:17,749
Perhaps, he ran away...?

113
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:30,069
 Oppa will give it to you.

114
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,230
 How old are you So Hee?

115
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,475
 24 years old?
Love shot?

116
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:37,500
 Love shot, fine.

117
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,329
Where are you?

118
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:56,345
What are you doing?

119
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:03,264
Are you mad?

120
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,460
I did wrong.

121
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:18,209
It's not because I hate you.

122
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:28,120
Calm down. Calm down.

123
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,943
I have to think through why I'm so nervous.

124
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:40,996
Is it because I imagined Hedgehog with another woman?
Ah...

125
00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:46,410
What other women would Hedgehog have?
If I go there, wouldn't I just see Grandpa?

126
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:52,749
Then, that's that. I'll sleep with my legs straight. Why

127
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,027
did I talk about kids?

128
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:59,023
I'm not a fish who's hatching her eggs in her mouth.

129
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:07,700
Hedgehog even told me to kiss him three times and just date Won Il. He is not being greedy,

130
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,762
And I even talked about marriage,

131
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:13,986
of course, he could leave home from the shock.

132
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:18,571
Why is it like this?

133
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,826
Perhaps,

134
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:33,439
Is it Hedghog...?

135
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:38,093
Am I not in between Hedgehog and Won Il?

136
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:42,263
 Love shot.
-Ah...

137
00:11:44,483 --> 00:11:47,641
 It's bitter. Give me a side dish.

138
00:11:56,381 --> 00:12:00,070
I don't have any feelings for Won Il.

139
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,927
All my thoughts are for Hedgehog.

140
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:11,200
Am I already in love with Hedgehog?

141
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,632

142
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:23,029
What is this?

143
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:28,023
Why is this bastard sleeping here?

144
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:36,192
Do you know who this is? It's grandpa, grandpa!

145
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:39,104
Aigoo...

146
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:43,548
I hope she'd know he likes her this much.

147
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,154
Hey, here.

148
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:53,499
Why do you look so tired when you are in a vacation?

149
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:57,255
Your friend, Beom Soo Young, he became a district attorney, right?

150
00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:00,321
Yeah, so what?

151
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,199
Did Ko Seung Ji not drop the makeup macaron thing?

152
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:11,739
In the 2006 prisoner patissiers' competition, Ko Seung Ji was listed as the first prize winner.

153
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:20,916
I couldn't find him when I searched
 the directories listing all the
 graduates of the patisserie schools.
That's why.

154
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:26,303
Can we ask Beom Soo Young to find out?
Is it against the law?

155
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:27,936
I'll ask.

156
00:13:27,936 --> 00:13:30,874
Of course, he knows not to do it if it's against the law.

157
00:13:33,934 --> 00:13:36,527
Find out about Choi Jae Gyum also.

158
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:40,335
When you ask me to find out about Ko Seung Ji and Director Choi,

159
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:42,750
there is a big difference in your facial expression.

160
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:50,163
You're doing this so you can understand Ko Seung Ji, and to fire Director Choi, right?

161
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:55,748
No matter what evidence we can find to fire him, he won't quit easily.

162
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:58,039
Don't forget that even for a minute.

163
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:02,102
Are you doing well with Pan Da Yang?

164
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,824
Instead of PanDa, I'm hanging out with Hedgehog

165
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:06,291
Why?

166
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,917
Are you blocking his way, so he won’t get closer to PanDa?

167
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:14,332
No, just that it’s fun being around him, and he likes having me around too.

168
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:15,880
So, Da Yang is jealous.

169
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,111
Are you guys elementary school kids or something, playing around together?

170
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:21,759
Ah, its because of you.

171
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,371
What's my fault?

172
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:24,665
You said that your business comes before your private life.

173
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:26,055
What does that have to do with it?

174
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:29,398
Making cake with Hedgehog first, playing with PanDa last.

175
00:14:29,398 --> 00:14:33,939
Because you told me that, I became friends with Hedgedog.

176
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:38,722
You might lose your romance with Panda while trying to protect your friendship with Hedgehog.

177
00:14:38,722 --> 00:14:39,780
Never!

178
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,769
Whatever!

179
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:46,407
Before you get too friendly with Ko Seung Ji, confess to Pan Da Yang.

180
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:48,456
Girls like that kind of stuff.

181
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:49,435
Is that so?

182
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:55,388
I don't care about those stuff, you just tell her by yourself!

183
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:57,186
It's Beom Bo oppa.

184
00:14:57,186 --> 00:14:59,815
He asked if you two had a fight.

185
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,742
What do you mean by fight?

186
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:11,311
He slept over there?

187
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,591
Ah, that's what happened

188
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:19,652
Please regard Seung Ji pleasantly. He never dated before so he doesn't know and makes mistakes.

189
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,102
So please don't misunderstand.

190
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:23,520
Yes!

191
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,533
Goodbye.

192
00:15:28,116 --> 00:15:30,716
I think Pan Da Yang somehow likes Ko Seung Ji now.

193
00:15:30,716 --> 00:15:36,017
When I told her to date him, her voice suddenly changed and said "Oh, really?"

194
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:39,934
You did well. That's so nice.

195
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:44,009
It's been a long time since I've seen you smile.

196
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:48,992
You were concerned about me.  I'm sorry.

197
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,835
Did something happen?

198
00:15:56,203 --> 00:15:59,876
Now you can comfortably tell me

199
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:03,788
If you don't, I think I'll be disappointed

200
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:11,702
If someone comes by when my father and I are not around, can you call me right away?

201
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:14,372
Who would come?

202
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:16,003
Detectives.

203
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:17,992
Detectives?

204
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:20,311
Why?

205
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:22,153
It has to do with my child's dad.

206
00:16:22,153 --> 00:16:24,421
A child?

207
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:28,596
Do you have a child?

208
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:32,703
I used your phone really well.

209
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:34,377
I do it, sis.

210
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:37,708
Don't laugh, I'm still mad.

211
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,457
Hey, what's the use of being mad at our parents who are in heaven?

212
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:45,480
My lips did wrong. Hit it once.

213
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,299
So Hedgehog oppa would punish me for hurting your lips?

214
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,507
My lips are not Hedgehog's, why would he punish you?

215
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:55,138
Anyway, I think Hedgehog will take care of them.

216
00:16:55,138 --> 00:16:57,900
Why do you think like that?

217
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,212
Unni, you like Hedgehog oppa, too.

218
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:04,050
Those dark circles are evidence.

219
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,169
Instead of dark circles, don't you have any other evidence?

220
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:11,814
I really want to know if I like him or if we are just friends...

221
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:14,941
Should I introduce a girl to him?

222
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:18,310
A girl who Hedgehog oppa can kiss with?

223
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,829
You will die if you do that.

224
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:25,615
Would a confused person talk decisively like that and want to kill her sister?

225
00:17:27,322 --> 00:17:32,544
I totally fell for Hedgehog, right?

226
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:38,777
That's right, so you better make the first move tonight.

227
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:40,134
How?

228
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:42,185
Just smack him with your lips!

229
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:43,556
Where?

230
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:44,655
Here.

231
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:47,348
When no one is here.

232
00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:49,308
Won Il will be coming, though.

233
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:52,451
Ah, tell him not to come today.

234
00:17:58,257 --> 00:18:03,614
Hurry up and figure it out. If you take more time it'll become complicated

235
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:10,361
How would I find that...?

236
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:12,576
How will I do it?!

237
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:13,886
Where's Hedgehog?

238
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,543
Huh? He's not here!

239
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:18,296
He went to his grandpa.

240
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:21,264
What about the Jajang cake? Did he finish it?

241
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:23,678
There was no way he could make it last night

242
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:25,722
Did something happen last night?!

243
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:28,912
No! What are you talking about?

244
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:32,270
You're really strange acting all like this!

245
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,332
What did I say?

246
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:36,293
The cake is all ready?

247
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:38,639
Ye Won!

248
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:40,595
You came?

249
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:52,277
What are you doing?

250
00:18:52,277 --> 00:18:54,867
I was going to make dumpling soup for you. I was making the dough.

251
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,688
Ah, I can't think of food right now. I'll eat later tonight.

252
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,489
You're going to be here tonight?

253
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:02,302
Yeah.

254
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:03,934
Did you get dumped?

255
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,005
Yeah.

256
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:09,044
What happened? You're admitting to it readily.

257
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:12,499
It's the truth.

258
00:19:13,513 --> 00:19:15,831
Ah, how did that happen?

259
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:20,128
She said I can date her if I have the confidence to be the best dad.

260
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,260
How can I be a good dad when I don't even know how!

261
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,496
So I just...

262
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:30,562
Hey, look!  Why can't you do it? It's not too hard.

263
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:33,233
You couldn't handle an easy situation, and get dumped?

264
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,639
You idiot!

265
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:36,908
You're doing well.

266
00:19:36,908 --> 00:19:39,158
You know a lot about love...

267
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:44,905
Right, you punk! You do whatever 
you need to do in a  war or in love. 
It's a national common sense!

268
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:47,699
So, where did you learn about such a common sense?

269
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:50,080
Only the ex-convicts don't know it then?

270
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,262
Why are you talking about jail... all of a sudden?

271
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:57,738
Until when are you going to live like this?
Huh?

272
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,945
What about me?

273
00:19:58,945 --> 00:20:04,129
You're telling people not to come close to you. You're hiding in your shell.

274
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:08,083
I don't know who gave your nickname, Hedgehog. It suits you well.

275
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,664
Hedgehog doesn't mean that!

276
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:15,392
I don't know who gave me the name. Ko Seung Ji is Hedgehog.

277
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:19,358
Hey, get out!
I have to use the bathroom.

278
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:35,589
For someone who doesn't know how he got the three characters of his name, he's being too greedy.

279
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:39,951
Because Panda was nice, didn't make a good judgement.

280
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:41,879
It was a mistake.

281
00:20:42,812 --> 00:20:49,389
What woman would choose an ex-convict over an American college graduate?

282
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:52,695
Pan Da Yang is smart.

283
00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:56,418
You see, she talked about me being the best dad. That makes it easier to decide.

284
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:02,995
The kind of man that Panda wants...

285
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,098
What score would she give me as a boyfriend?

286
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:08,133
Are you going to do that?

287
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:11,561
What kind of score do you think I got?

288
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,606
A zero.

289
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:21,406
How can you say that in front of me?

290
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:27,441
To my eyes, you're the best guy, and you'll be the best dad.

291
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:30,342
Do you think I'll see wrongly with my eyes that are 70 years old?

292
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:34,840
Even a ghost cannot win over an old person's eyes.

293
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:41,224
I'm not going to wear old peoples' makeup. I'll wear Noonim's lotion.

294
00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:43,475
This jerk...

295
00:21:56,063 --> 00:21:59,454
Why are you looking at me like this?
You're the one who put it on.

296
00:21:59,928 --> 00:22:02,084
You like it, what are you complaining about?

297
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:05,228
What's good about it? It's just damp.

298
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:09,460
You said you're better looking than Jang Dong Gun. Why don't you date?

299
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,757
There is no problem.

300
00:22:11,757 --> 00:22:16,277
This is not for you, Grandpa. Do it for Noonim.

301
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:23,426
Would she start over again even if she gets a lover, and leave you behind?

302
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:28,383
She'll get horrified if you talk about men.

303
00:22:28,383 --> 00:22:30,166
Why?

304
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,098
She didn't have any luck with men?

305
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:38,735
Her dead husband was the worst kind.

306
00:22:38,735 --> 00:22:42,103
She's pretty. How did a guy like that win her over?

307
00:22:42,103 --> 00:22:44,173
Who won her over?

308
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:47,700
He almost kidnapped her.

309
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,833
He didn't even live long, and why did he put a nail through your heart?

310
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:55,046
They say he could be alive.

311
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:57,273
Did he come back alive after he died?

312
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:59,748
Something like that.

313
00:23:00,271 --> 00:23:03,795
Then what is that?
Then, did he pretend to die?

314
00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:08,074
If I come to think about it I don't really know...

315
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:11,273
A guy acts all like that.

316
00:23:11,273 --> 00:23:12,900
Did you tell her?

317
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,359
We both met with the detective.

318
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:20,205
What?

319
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:22,594
The police are in our neighborhood?

320
00:23:22,594 --> 00:23:26,697
Ah, really, we went to the police station because we felt so wronged.

321
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,972
It seems like there are more than one or two victims.

322
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:32,283
The detective said he will get him for sure.

323
00:23:32,693 --> 00:23:37,904
Then, it means they'll be coming to your house soon.

324
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:42,302
They're not coming to get you. Why are you worried?

325
00:23:43,294 --> 00:23:46,099
Grandpa.

326
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:52,885
I probably have to tell Panda that I'm an ex-convict, right?

327
00:23:56,341 --> 00:24:01,836
I feel bad... that I didn't tell her something that I should have told her from the beginning.

328
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:11,053
I couldn't get myself to talk to her about it.
 I ended up doing stupid things to her, 
and just thought about running away.

329
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,358
What are you doing?

330
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:20,012
Praying.

331
00:24:22,655 --> 00:24:24,749
Why are you praying all of sudden?

332
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:30,726
So Pan Da Yang can hear all the things that you couldn't tell her.

333
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:34,121
So she can accept you.

334
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:41,071
To me it's great.

335
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:46,361
Pan Da Yang is not someone who can't decide well for herself.

336
00:24:58,991 --> 00:25:00,220
Hello.

337
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,873
Ah, I'm busy right now. Call back later.

338
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:28,334
Hey. Are you Bo Ram?

339
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:29,783
Who are you?

340
00:25:29,783 --> 00:25:32,887
I'm someone Ye Won knows. Let's talk for a bit.

341
00:25:33,046 --> 00:25:36,050
How did you find our house?

342
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:41,586
You're living with Ye Won so let's talk.

343
00:25:46,424 --> 00:25:51,930
Hey, I brought you this. Why are you not eating it?

344
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,530
You're someone that I don't know, how can I just eat it?

345
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,460
I told you I'm someone Ye Won knows, you brat.

346
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,241
How can a person trust everyone?

347
00:26:02,506 --> 00:26:03,497
Then why are you eating now?

348
00:26:03,497 --> 00:26:05,538
I'm someone that you don't know!

349
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,920
You don't seem like a bad person when I talk to you.

350
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,079
Hey, I'm not a bad man.

351
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,915
I came here to make a good cake without getting paid.

352
00:26:16,286 --> 00:26:17,970
Are you a patissier?

353
00:26:18,547 --> 00:26:21,285
How did you know I was a patissier?

354
00:26:21,285 --> 00:26:24,547
My dad is also a patissier.

355
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,267
So, you've already eaten a lot of normal cake,

356
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:30,582
so you want to eat a black bean noodle cake?

357
00:26:30,582 --> 00:26:32,958
What's a black bean noodle cake?

358
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:39,376
They said you like Jajangmyun the best.
 I was asked to make your birthday cake with Jajangmyun flavor.

359
00:26:39,376 --> 00:26:42,425
They asked me to put in the flavor of that candy as well.

360
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,022
Do you think making a cake is that easy?

361
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,902
You're totally a patissier's son.

362
00:26:48,455 --> 00:26:50,147
When you're done, call me.

363
00:26:50,147 --> 00:26:52,033
I won't have my birthday celebration.

364
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:53,440
Hey, you tell her.

365
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,118
I'm scared of Ye Won.

366
00:26:55,854 --> 00:26:56,794
I got it.

367
00:26:56,794 --> 00:26:57,849
Goodbye.

368
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:58,751
Hey.

369
00:26:58,751 --> 00:26:59,946
Hey.

370
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:05,667
What you like black bean cake, do you want me to do it for you?

371
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,670
Black bean cake is not what I like the most!

372
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,000
Then what do you like?

373
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,227
You're a patissier's son!

374
00:27:13,227 --> 00:27:15,893
If a patissier doesn't make a cake that his customer is happy with,

375
00:27:15,893 --> 00:27:17,644
do you know how that is?

376
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:19,785
Hurry up and talk, you brat.

377
00:27:19,785 --> 00:27:22,750
I can't be treated badly by Ye Won.

378
00:27:23,698 --> 00:27:25,430
I like meat.

379
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:29,243
I like beef.

380
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:50,077
This is all money. Hurry and eat.

381
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:55,286
Are you poor too?

382
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:57,774
If I was poor, would I be this way?

383
00:27:57,774 --> 00:28:02,346
I thought you were poor because you talked about money like my mom.

384
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,964
Is your dad having a hard time selling his cakes?

385
00:28:04,964 --> 00:28:07,737
He's a patissier that can't make cakes.

386
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,046
Why can't he make cakes? He's a patissier.

387
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:14,378
He didn't learn very well.

388
00:28:14,378 --> 00:28:16,552
He doesn't have skills.

389
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:18,673
Then, he has to find another job.

390
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:20,369
He has to come to his senses first.

391
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:24,543
Hey, you shouldn't talk about your dad that way.

392
00:28:24,543 --> 00:28:26,172
That's what my mom used to say.

393
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:29,858
He has come to his senses first, then she would allow him to meet me comfortably,

394
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:33,032
and allow him to come home for visits.

395
00:28:33,032 --> 00:28:34,876
Where does your dad live?

396
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:36,133
I don't know.

397
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:38,231
The creditors would be after him if they knew.

398
00:28:38,231 --> 00:28:40,219
They would find my dad.

399
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,637
I was told it's better not to know.

400
00:28:43,643 --> 00:28:46,865
Not everyone can be a dad.

401
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,945
I'm not talking about your dad.

402
00:28:50,945 --> 00:28:53,330
It's because I got a girl unexpectedly.

403
00:28:53,926 --> 00:28:57,947
I just asked to kiss once. She asked me if I could be the best dad.

404
00:28:57,947 --> 00:29:00,798
It sounds like she is not interested in dating you.

405
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:03,723
Don't just trust people by what they say.

406
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:07,266
Does that mean I shouldn't trust

407
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:08,955
that you like Jajangmyun the best?

408
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:12,316
My dad could only afford to buy things like Jajangmyun.

409
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:14,835
I had to tell him I liked Jajangmyun.

410
00:29:14,835 --> 00:29:18,423
I couldn't have told him that I like beef.

411
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:23,261
After eating Jajangmyun with my dad, whom I have not seen for a while, I met Ye Won.

412
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:28,164
She told me she has never seen me cry so much before.

413
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:31,952
I just told him that I like Jajangmyun.

414
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:35,895
It was my first time seeing my dad like that.

415
00:29:35,895 --> 00:29:39,299
I can't say I cried because I was happy.

416
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,808
Is it good?

417
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,081
Am I eating because it tastes good?
I just want to spend my time.

418
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:49,704
Why are you like this little miss?

419
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,464
What is that?

420
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:54,395
You're the little miss.

421
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:57,253
What?

422
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,180
Because you're pathetic, Oppa.

423
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,585
Why am I pathetic?

424
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:04,072
You don't do much, and you're not very helpful.

425
00:30:04,072 --> 00:30:06,622
Unni doesn't like you either.

426
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:08,982
That's why you're spending time with me.

427
00:30:08,982 --> 00:30:10,196
That's not it!

428
00:30:10,196 --> 00:30:11,500
What not it?

429
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:17,510
Unni is not interested in you and keeps waiting for Hedgehog oppa.

430
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,229
Did Unni tell you this?

431
00:30:20,229 --> 00:30:22,888
Oppa, can you not see it?

432
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:26,279
But, I like Hedgehog oppa more than you, too.

433
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,334
Why?

434
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,376
Oppa, you're not much fun to be with, and you're not that attractive.

435
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,975
Ye Won. Oppa is a very fun person.

436
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:39,686
And, am I not attractive enough? My legs are much longer than Hedgehog's.

437
00:30:39,686 --> 00:30:41,022
I'm taller, too.

438
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:43,814
If having long legs is attractive, then why don't you wear a skirt?

439
00:30:43,814 --> 00:30:45,849
How can a man wear a skirt?

440
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:49,359
That means having long legs is not an attractive feature for men.

441
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,876
Then, what's attractive about men?

442
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:54,255
Player one.

443
00:30:54,255 --> 00:30:55,359
Is Bo Ram like that?

444
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,554
Of course he is.

445
00:30:57,554 --> 00:30:59,658
If I do something slightly wrong, he'll give me a piercing dirty look.

446
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:02,970
He's really so cool.

447
00:31:04,035 --> 00:31:05,850
Women don't know anything.

448
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,848
You're going to have a hard time if you meet a guy like that.

449
00:31:07,848 --> 00:31:10,652
He will always give you those piercing looks.
How are you going to live comfortably?

450
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:14,602
You'll always be on your guard, nervous, and try to feel  him out.

451
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:17,325
That's why one starts to like a guy like that.

452
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:18,491
What?

453
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:21,612
'Why is he like that?' You would think about him that way when you get home.

454
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:26,308
And still, you think about him when you go to bed and, when you wake up in the morning.

455
00:31:26,308 --> 00:31:31,663
Because you constanly think about him, you miss him more.

456
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:36,845
Because you don't know these things, Unni is not interested in you.

457
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:39,475
So you lose to Hedgehog oppa.

458
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:44,448
Don't eat it. Don't eat it.

459
00:31:48,162 --> 00:31:49,478
I ate well.

460
00:31:49,478 --> 00:31:53,449
Because I was able to eat meat today, my spirits are up.

461
00:31:53,449 --> 00:31:56,319
Other than meat should I show you how to have strength all the time?

462
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,499
What is that?

463
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,614
A song.

464
00:31:58,614 --> 00:32:00,150
Cake song?

465
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,028
Not that dude. A real song that will give you strength.

466
00:32:05,128 --> 00:32:07,529
What kind of song is that?

467
00:32:13,618 --> 00:32:19,615
Maculinea teleius. Aspidomorpha transparipennis. Rhyssa persuasoria.

468
00:32:19,615 --> 00:32:22,835
Homotropus tarsatorius.

469
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:25,982
Rhyssa persuasoria.

470
00:32:25,982 --> 00:32:28,800
I don't really know what that means!

471
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:54,588
What the heck?

472
00:32:54,588 --> 00:32:56,689
 Cartoon drawings for ugly Choi Won Il

473
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:09,561

474
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:16,428
 You wouldn't know what they are if you hear about them.
 It feels like you would never have anything to do with them in your lifetime: butterflies, bees,

475
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:20,419
 and insects, which can have such long and beautiful names...

476
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:22,689
 Who gave those names?

477
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:25,546
 They were given with a lot of care and thought.

478
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:28,433
 If their lives were precious,

479
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:30,187
 then, how are our lives?

480
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:32,918
 We're probably better off than them, right?

481
00:33:32,918 --> 00:33:36,857
 No matter how bad things are. The fact that we were born as human beings...

482
00:33:36,857 --> 00:33:42,851
 Right, we should not be worse off than them.

483
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:45,063
 Wake up and live well.

484
00:33:45,063 --> 00:33:46,708
 Doing our very best.

485
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,252
 Is that what it means?

486
00:33:49,252 --> 00:33:50,208
 No.

487
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:53,545
 When I'm alone...

488
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:54,613
 That's the only thing that helps me.

489
00:33:54,613 --> 00:33:56,696
 Things that I like...

490
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:01,039
Favorite snack:

491
00:34:03,743 --> 00:34:06,559
 Cake.

492
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:10,432
Favorite flower:

493
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:13,705
 Hydrangea.

494
00:34:13,705 --> 00:34:16,839
My favorite thing:

495
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:23,353
 Jewelry.

496
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:30,503
 I don't remember anything about my childhood. Why I was here alone?

497
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:34,287
 Who am I? Who is looking for me?

498
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:37,200
 I can't ever forget that.

499
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,362
 That's what I told myself everyday.

500
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:46,339
 That was the only thing that gave me strength when I was alone.

501
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:48,267
 Aspidomorpha transparipennis.

502
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:52,654
 Without parents and not even knowing who am I?

503
00:34:52,654 --> 00:35:00,155
 I told myself that I can do, I can do.
Be strong.

504
00:35:02,862 --> 00:35:08,132
 Homotropus tarsatorius.

505
00:35:08,132 --> 00:35:12,050
Homotropus tarsatorius.

506
00:35:17,006 --> 00:35:19,536
Maculinea teleius.

507
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:22,452
Aspidomorpha transparipennis.

508
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:24,881
Rhyssa persuasoria.

509
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:27,398
Homotropus tarsatorius.

510
00:35:27,398 --> 00:35:30,599
Wow, your brain must be really good.

511
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,425
How can you sing it that well?

512
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:33,515
I have a good head.

513
00:35:33,515 --> 00:35:36,649
So I understood everything that you told me.

514
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:38,761
Thank you.

515
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:43,261
I'll make you a really cool cake.

516
00:35:44,555 --> 00:35:46,103
Is that good?

517
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:49,578
I'm leaving, goodbye.

518
00:35:51,628 --> 00:35:54,227
What do you like, brat?

519
00:35:54,227 --> 00:35:57,034
I believe you. You will make an amazing cake,

520
00:35:57,034 --> 00:35:59,739
and my dad is amazing.

521
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:19,052
Gil Dong Goo, that punk, you're dead.

522
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,616
Dad!

523
00:36:20,616 --> 00:36:25,110
Oh! Bo Ram!

524
00:36:26,523 --> 00:36:29,413
Let me give you a hug.

525
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:32,338
Did you miss me a lot?

526
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:34,807
You grew a lot!

527
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:38,888
Gil Dong Goo is his dad?

528
00:36:38,888 --> 00:36:40,789
Did you eat well?
Yes.

529
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:44,407
Please leave carefully. 
Please come again.

530
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:59,258
Just talk to her in the coffee place when no one is there!

531
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,147
I saw Won Il all day.

532
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:20,705
But I missed Hedgehog.

533
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:25,054
It's the right thing to tell him.

534
00:37:27,465 --> 00:37:29,461
Let's talk!

535
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:30,562
You too?

536
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:34,108
What you too?
Let's sit first.

537
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:35,847
Okay.

538
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,974
It's not an easy thing for me to say.

539
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:49,248
No matter what, I think I should talk first.

540
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:52,191
No, I'll go first.

541
00:37:52,191 --> 00:37:54,951
Nowadays, is it a trend for the girl to go first?

542
00:37:54,951 --> 00:37:56,073
What about it?

543
00:37:56,073 --> 00:38:00,652
I mean I lived in United States so I don't really know about here.

544
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:05,475
Since you lived in the United States for so long, you might not understand what people say very well.

545
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:09,399
So, you don't like talking to me?

546
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:11,375
When did I say that?

547
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,614
Then why did you leave the kitchen when I went into the kitchen?

548
00:38:13,614 --> 00:38:16,329
Then when I left the kitchen to find you, why did you come out here?

549
00:38:17,385 --> 00:38:19,694
Are you mad?
Yeah!

550
00:38:19,694 --> 00:38:22,029
Are you really in a bad mood?

551
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:26,023
Of course I am, it's not like I can avoid it.

552
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,579
Because I felt pricked (Korean saying: meaning "by guilt") by you.

553
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:37,425
Am I Hedgehog?  I don't have spines.  Why would I prick you?

554
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:41,811
You really lived for so long in America.

555
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:44,955
I should have come just one month sooner.

556
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:48,565
Why would one month have made a difference?

557
00:38:48,565 --> 00:38:53,203
Then I would have gotten to you before Hedgehog.

558
00:38:55,073 --> 00:38:58,076
Da Yang.
Let's...

559
00:38:58,076 --> 00:39:00,089
Da Yang.

560
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:02,647
Oh?!

561
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:05,470
How come you guys are together?

562
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:09,596
I caught a taxi...

563
00:39:09,596 --> 00:39:12,072
...it happened to my car, wouldn't you know.

564
00:39:12,072 --> 00:39:14,154
It's not like I couldn't give her a ride.

565
00:39:14,154 --> 00:39:18,148
It's not like she couldn't give me a ride, so here I am.

566
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:21,412
Thats okay. Lets go inside. You come inside too, aunt. 
 Okay.

567
00:39:21,412 --> 00:39:23,217
Okay.

568
00:39:27,384 --> 00:39:29,101
Oh!  You're looking good.

569
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:31,973
Are you dating?

570
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,566
What were you talking about?

571
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:41,437
Why was your expression like that?  What did Won Il say?

572
00:39:41,437 --> 00:39:45,570
Just talking about how long he lived in America.

573
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,176
Is there a problem because he lived too long in America?  Is it hard for him to adjust to Korea?

574
00:39:49,176 --> 00:39:52,547
Is he fnding it hard to be President of the company?

575
00:39:52,547 --> 00:39:55,583
Is he sad his vacation is over?

576
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:59,868
You ask by yourself.

577
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:01,695
I want to.

578
00:40:01,695 --> 00:40:05,767
But I can't speak as easily when Won Il is around.

579
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:08,242
When I open my mouth I sound like a fool.

580
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:12,668
It's not easy.
I really don't know what to do.

581
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:16,769
I must really like him a lot.

582
00:40:19,205 --> 00:40:20,942
Why?

583
00:40:20,942 --> 00:40:22,545
Do you like him, too?

584
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,665
WON II?

585
00:40:24,665 --> 00:40:27,069
No! Hedgehog.

586
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,630
I knew you wouldn't erase my hope.

587
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,194
My dear friend who looks like a lovely pumpkin

588
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:37,146
and takes care of her friends.

589
00:40:37,146 --> 00:40:39,126
You did good!  So how is it going with him?

590
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:42,352
We kissed.

591
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:44,396
So, you did it?

592
00:40:44,396 --> 00:40:46,314
No not the kiss...

593
00:40:46,314 --> 00:40:48,938
It was a mistake!

594
00:40:48,938 --> 00:40:52,628
Why are you doing this? You stupid!

595
00:40:52,628 --> 00:40:55,576
What should I do?

596
00:40:55,576 --> 00:41:01,363
Our thoughts, their thoughts. I wish there was a way to reveal them all at once.

597
00:41:01,363 --> 00:41:03,297
All at once?!

598
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:05,844
Of course all at once.  Would we do it one card at a time then?

599
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:07,822
Are the four of us playing Go Stop (Korean card game)?

600
00:41:07,822 --> 00:41:12,100
Revealing everything at once is the only way Won Il will realize you two aren't meant to be.

601
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,853
A public relational conference.

602
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:19,219
So, the four of us should have a cake together?

603
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:23,079
Of course not, Won II can't eat that cake.

604
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:25,933
Why can't Won Il eat cake?

605
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:28,258
He has some trauma.

606
00:41:28,258 --> 00:41:31,564
What kind of trauma?

607
00:41:31,564 --> 00:41:33,219
Well, that's,

608
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:37,956
something Ahjumma taught me I can really tell you.

609
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:43,595
Anyway, think of something else besides cake.

610
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:48,705
Isn't it a problem if the president of a cake company can't eat cake?

611
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:54,153
You just worry about Hedgehog.  I'll worry about Won Il.

612
00:41:54,153 --> 00:41:56,904
So annoying really...

613
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,710
Why are you smiling? Why?

614
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:10,935
You got the date.
Why did you appear in front of me at the time...? Really!

615
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:12,824
Its been a while.

616
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:16,886
Huh, why are you with him?

617
00:42:16,886 --> 00:42:19,923
He will work today, so you can go home.

618
00:42:19,923 --> 00:42:21,262
What?

619
00:42:21,262 --> 00:42:26,538
The Jajangmyun cake should be ready by tomorrow. What would you do with such a trouble maker?

620
00:42:31,111 --> 00:42:34,015
Gil Dong Gu!

621
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:39,818
What on earth are you doing? Why are you bringing someone like him here again?

622
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:42,340
Bo Ram's dad, is Gil Dong Gu.

623
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,362
What did he say?

624
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:50,567
Hedgehog said that the dad should make  
the best birthday cake for his son personally. 
He asked me to come.

625
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:54,748
So I won't cause any trouble. Don't worry.

626
00:42:54,748 --> 00:42:58,207
Hedgehog let's go together.

627
00:42:59,888 --> 00:43:05,005
Then the worst patissier was the best dad?

628
00:43:05,005 --> 00:43:09,367
The best dad?

629
00:43:12,262 --> 00:43:15,184
Da Yang is regretting that she didn't kiss you.

630
00:43:16,268 --> 00:43:18,608
She likes you, Hedgehog.

631
00:43:18,608 --> 00:43:22,598
But she said that she doesn't know what to do.

632
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:28,698
That's really good, I don't know how I can do that either.

633
00:43:28,698 --> 00:43:29,905
Do you like me?

634
00:43:29,905 --> 00:43:33,181
Why would I like you, when Won Il's right here?

635
00:43:33,181 --> 00:43:37,203
Do you think I'm a strange person like Da Yang?

636
00:43:39,101 --> 00:43:41,394
Have you seen Notting Hill?

637
00:43:41,394 --> 00:43:42,349
What is that?

638
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:46,824
Why does she like this kind of man?

639
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:50,501
It's a movie. If you watch it,

640
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:52,761
they leave a brownie

641
00:43:52,761 --> 00:43:54,615
for the most unfortunate person to eat.

642
00:43:54,615 --> 00:43:56,676
There's a scene where the characters play a truth or dare game and

643
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:59,413
they reveal their true feelings and thoughts like their hand in a Go Stop card game.

644
00:43:59,413 --> 00:44:00,305
So, then what?

645
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:06,196
Please make one like that for me. It's an official order. I'll pay.

646
00:44:06,196 --> 00:44:09,258
If you're done talking...

647
00:44:09,258 --> 00:44:11,938
Get out, I will change.

648
00:44:14,256 --> 00:44:15,306
Aren't you leaving?

649
00:44:15,306 --> 00:44:18,015
You're timid. Does he think he's going to get eaten?

650
00:44:18,015 --> 00:44:22,098
I'm trying to decided if I'm going to give him additional information he may need.

651
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:25,345
What was that?

652
00:44:26,327 --> 00:44:28,818
Choi Won Il can't eat cake.

653
00:44:28,818 --> 00:44:33,958
So, make a cake that isn't a cake.

654
00:44:34,777 --> 00:44:38,405
And please kiss Da Yang.

655
00:44:38,405 --> 00:44:40,620
Fighting.

656
00:44:45,275 --> 00:44:47,894
He can't eat cake?

657
00:44:49,673 --> 00:44:52,821
Kiss her?

658
00:44:59,442 --> 00:45:01,367
You can do this much right?

659
00:45:01,367 --> 00:45:06,209
I know! I'm a patissier, too.

660
00:45:06,209 --> 00:45:08,900
Is that for real that you're a patissier, huh?

661
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,498
I'll try my best!

662
00:45:12,498 --> 00:45:16,903
Put your heart in making it. Think about the face of the person who will be eating it.

663
00:45:16,903 --> 00:45:21,337
I miss Bo Ram's happy face.

664
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,073
Go back safely.

665
00:45:36,073 --> 00:45:37,353
Go.

666
00:45:37,353 --> 00:45:38,644
Let's go.

667
00:45:41,724 --> 00:45:50,940

668
00:45:55,581 --> 00:45:58,044
Why are you sighing?

669
00:45:58,044 --> 00:46:00,405
Is your love life not going well?

670
00:46:00,405 --> 00:46:03,524
The ordered Jajangmyun cake is not.

671
00:46:03,524 --> 00:46:08,919
Why is it hard? You just have to make it like this.

672
00:46:08,919 --> 00:46:14,222
Without worrying about it that much, just do it!

673
00:46:14,222 --> 00:46:17,730
If it's that simple,

674
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:18,975
why didn't I think of it?

675
00:46:18,975 --> 00:46:21,995
Because you are a notch below me.

676
00:46:21,995 --> 00:46:24,150
Don't fool, huh?

677
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:27,171
No, I'm not fooling around.

678
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:36,231
Because Hedgehog came back, it feels like the world is brighter all of a sudden.

679
00:46:36,231 --> 00:46:40,960
Hedghog is like the sun during rainy days, and the strong rain during a drought.

680
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,568
We can't live without Hedgehog, right?

681
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:52,234
I am a comfort cushion.

682
00:46:52,234 --> 00:46:54,843
You can lean on it if you need to.

683
00:46:54,843 --> 00:46:59,619
If you don't need it, you can just leave it next to you. I'm that kind of cushion.

684
00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:04,816
If you press me, I can also talk.

685
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,614
What will you say?

686
00:47:07,614 --> 00:47:09,517
Have you seen Notting Hill?

687
00:47:09,517 --> 00:47:10,712
Yes I did.

688
00:47:10,712 --> 00:47:12,732
Typical~

689
00:47:12,732 --> 00:47:15,771
Then let's have a brownie time.

690
00:47:15,771 --> 00:47:20,137
You, Me, Hedgehog, Panda, the four of us. Let's have a brownie time.

691
00:47:21,834 --> 00:47:28,117
Da Yang said that she couldn't say it herself, so she wanted some help.

692
00:47:31,068 --> 00:47:34,360
Here.

693
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,200
  I like Jajangmyun,

694
00:47:48,135 --> 00:47:50,829
This cake.... Who made it for you?

695
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:53,856
Someone who makes cakes.

696
00:48:01,153 --> 00:48:02,396
What?

697
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:04,585
Does it taste bad?

698
00:48:04,585 --> 00:48:10,983
No... It's good... I just think I know who made these.

699
00:48:10,983 --> 00:48:13,155
What the heck?

700
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:16,736
Why are you suddenly talking with an accent?

701
00:48:16,736 --> 00:48:19,716
You eat one too.

702
00:48:24,587 --> 00:48:28,303
You must have spent a lot of money, from buying all these.

703
00:48:28,303 --> 00:48:30,557
He wouldn't take the money.

704
00:48:30,557 --> 00:48:34,188
So technically, I didn't get a birthday present for you...

705
00:48:34,188 --> 00:48:36,717
It's the same thing, whether you paid for it or not.

706
00:48:36,717 --> 00:48:39,164
Thanks for the birthday present.

707
00:48:39,164 --> 00:48:41,053
Close your eyes.

708
00:48:41,053 --> 00:48:42,505
Why?

709
00:48:42,505 --> 00:48:45,654
No reason. Just close your eyes for a moment.

710
00:48:58,858 --> 00:49:00,677
What?

711
00:49:00,677 --> 00:49:03,896
What kind of father watches his sons kiss scene?

712
00:49:03,896 --> 00:49:07,025
Come on let's go. Hurry hurry.

713
00:49:15,227 --> 00:49:18,776
How long are you going to ignore me like this?

714
00:49:21,389 --> 00:49:23,802
We need to talk.

715
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,601
There's no one here...

716
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:40,355
So what?

717
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:43,462
Let's do it. The kiss...

718
00:49:43,462 --> 00:49:49,284
I take back what I said about getting married and being the best dad in the world.

719
00:49:50,132 --> 00:49:54,024
The bags under my eyes are becoming worse.

720
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:58,464
There's no medicine for bags.

721
00:49:58,464 --> 00:50:00,174
What the heck are you babbling about?

722
00:50:00,174 --> 00:50:06,427
My eyebags are about to come down to my belly button, since I'm busy thinking about you... You take charge of it.

723
00:50:06,427 --> 00:50:08,692
Then cover it with the cosmetics I bought you.

724
00:50:08,692 --> 00:50:11,996
Let's just kiss..

725
00:50:21,176 --> 00:50:25,309
I have something to tell you...

726
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:27,104
Tell me.

727
00:50:27,104 --> 00:50:29,505
But I need some time to think.

728
00:50:29,505 --> 00:50:32,112
So just wait a bit longer.

729
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:35,710
Can't you just give me hint about what it is?

730
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:40,910
I think my eyebags are going to come all the way down to my ankles if I don't know.

731
00:50:57,393 --> 00:51:03,412
Do I, have the right to like you?

732
00:51:03,412 --> 00:51:07,044
I need time to think about that.

733
00:51:27,281 --> 00:51:29,072
Oh, hello~

734
00:51:29,072 --> 00:51:31,164
Hello Da Yang-ssi~

735
00:51:35,896 --> 00:51:38,039
Come on.

736
00:51:42,412 --> 00:51:45,885
Ayo Hedgehog~

737
00:51:47,506 --> 00:51:48,659
You're here.

738
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:51,480
Is there some kind of disease going around in this neighbourhood?

739
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,421
Panda is down, you are gloomy as well...

740
00:51:54,421 --> 00:51:57,043
The two people at Mozart are also down and gloomy...

741
00:51:57,043 --> 00:52:00,837
Boss and Noonim... They're gloomy because they met detectives.

742
00:52:00,837 --> 00:52:02,095
Detectives?

743
00:52:02,095 --> 00:52:04,286
WHy would Detectives suddenly appear out of nowhere? It makes me nervous...

744
00:52:04,286 --> 00:52:06,789
It's because of noonim's husband.

745
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:08,993
Husband?

746
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:10,724
Gramps has a grandson?

747
00:52:10,724 --> 00:52:12,684
I don't know if it's a grandson or a grand daughter...

748
00:52:12,684 --> 00:52:14,930
All I know is that detective will come soon.

749
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,416
Aish then they'll come here as well...

750
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:19,109
Did you meet them already?

751
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:21,129
No. Not yet.

752
00:52:21,129 --> 00:52:23,049
Does Panda know?

753
00:52:23,049 --> 00:52:24,173
Know what?

754
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:26,627
The fact that Seung Ji once went to jail. That's what.

755
00:52:26,627 --> 00:52:29,355
If a detective came, would he only see Seung Ji?

756
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:31,338
He'd also give Panda a hard time.

757
00:52:31,338 --> 00:52:36,459
What does Seung Ji, and Panda have to do with Noonim's husband?

758
00:52:36,459 --> 00:52:39,404
Even if they have nothing to do with them, they bother them anyway. That's what all detectives do.

759
00:52:39,404 --> 00:52:42,999
And it's always guys like us who get caught.

760
00:52:46,105 --> 00:52:48,411
Hyung!

761
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:50,740
Your break ends tomorrow! Why are you here?

762
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,021
Did you get dumped by Panda Noona?

763
00:52:52,021 --> 00:52:54,238
Did you get fired by Hedgehog hyung? That must be it!

764
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:56,521
Hedgehog hired a new assistant.

765
00:52:56,521 --> 00:52:58,491
New assistant?

766
00:52:58,491 --> 00:52:59,638
Then what happens to you?

767
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:01,298
Gil Dong Gu came back..

768
00:53:01,298 --> 00:53:02,699
WHAT?!

769
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:07,242
Has he gone crazy?! Why would he accept him?!

770
00:53:07,242 --> 00:53:08,756
He said he changed.

771
00:53:08,756 --> 00:53:10,152
And you, why are you here?

772
00:53:10,152 --> 00:53:13,434
Well you're on vacation, and mom and dad are at the photoshoot..

773
00:53:13,434 --> 00:53:15,104
They told me to protect the shop.

774
00:53:15,104 --> 00:53:16,778
They went to the Macaroon photoshoot?

775
00:53:16,778 --> 00:53:19,960
Not Macaroons! Cosmestics!

776
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,449
Don't you think it makes zero sense?

777
00:53:25,362 --> 00:53:27,133
Wow! OMG.

778
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:30,977
Ah, excuse me!

779
00:53:30,977 --> 00:53:33,088
How can I help you?

780
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:36,195
Uh, we came for a photo shoot.

781
00:53:36,195 --> 00:53:37,571
Ah, which newspaper company are you from?

782
00:53:37,571 --> 00:53:42,317
Newspaper? Ah, we aren't a newspaper company..

783
00:53:42,317 --> 00:53:43,658
We're from Saint Horone.

784
00:53:43,658 --> 00:53:46,016
We are the people who made the macaroons.

785
00:53:46,016 --> 00:53:49,072
The celebration shooting is as negotiated with the advertisement company.

786
00:53:49,072 --> 00:53:54,347
In our efforts to not to burden the model, we came to shoot here.

787
00:53:54,347 --> 00:53:57,201
Ah please wait a moment. She's getting dressed.

788
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:59,649
She'll be out in a moment.

789
00:54:01,736 --> 00:54:04,966
What the...? I don't think I've seen her before! Is she a model?!

790
00:54:04,966 --> 00:54:09,189
She's the Japanese top star Mina!

791
00:54:09,189 --> 00:54:12,178
Oh really?

792
00:54:12,178 --> 00:54:15,150
Since you can speak Japanese, translate for us!

793
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:19,967
With the macaroons I made, let's take a picture to celebrate them and promote them!

794
00:54:19,967 --> 00:54:24,436
We'll put it up at out door and promote you!

795
00:54:24,436 --> 00:54:30,286
If you take the pictures with me and the macaroons I made...

796
00:54:30,286 --> 00:54:36,421
We'll hang a really big copy of it at the entrance of Saint Horone and promote you and our macaroons!

797
00:54:36,421 --> 00:54:41,314
Are you done? 
 Yes 
 Tell her that there are a lot of well known customers,

798
00:54:41,314 --> 00:54:43,418
That it's going to be an advantage for her as well.

799
00:54:43,418 --> 00:54:49,859
In Saint Horone, we have very well known, and rich customers... So it'll be good for you as well.

800
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:51,947
Yes.

801
00:54:56,997 --> 00:55:00,392
She says she can't do this photo shoot.

802
00:55:00,392 --> 00:55:02,536
Why?

803
00:55:02,536 --> 00:55:06,104
Tell her that we've talked to the advirtising company and everything!

804
00:55:06,104 --> 00:55:10,797
I am a model for the company 'Macaroon'. I am not a model for Saint Horone's Macaroons.

805
00:55:10,797 --> 00:55:14,080
What the? I thought she was Japanese! Is a Japanese person imitating a Korean?

806
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,265
Are Japanese people not allowed to speak Korean?

807
00:55:16,265 --> 00:55:18,488
No! That's not what I mean!

808
00:55:18,488 --> 00:55:22,279
Let's just say this person is in a bad mood and say she apologised..

809
00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:27,481
Then if you don't want to advertise, let's just take a celebration picture!

810
00:55:27,481 --> 00:55:31,266
Why do I have to take pictures for Saint Horone's macaroons?

811
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:35,722
It's not you that's the main point, it's me!

812
00:55:35,722 --> 00:55:37,965
Excuse me, please leave.

813
00:55:37,965 --> 00:55:39,202
Ah, wait a moment!

814
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:43,368
All we want is one photo shoot! It's not rocket science or something!

815
00:55:43,368 --> 00:55:45,298
What the heck... What a rude Japanese girl...

816
00:55:45,298 --> 00:55:49,808
Isn't that cafe panda's packaging box?

817
00:55:53,122 --> 00:55:56,678
I like Cafe Panda.

818

820
00:56:14,645 --> 00:56:18,063
HYUNG!!!! OMG THIS IS AWESOME!!!!

821
00:56:18,063 --> 00:56:19,372
Why are you so excited?

822
00:56:19,372 --> 00:56:23,849
Look at this! Mina repayed Hedgehog!

823
00:56:25,094 --> 00:56:27,944
  Japan's top actrees; Siratori Mina, falls in love with Korean Macaroons. The best macaroons that the prettiest lady chose. 'Ko Seung Ji's Macaroons were the best that I ever tasted."

824
00:56:32,153 --> 00:56:34,759
Hedgehog! Hedgehog!

825
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:36,975
Look at this!

826
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:40,099
  Siratoria Mina, falls in love with Korean Macaroons.

827
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:44,244
 The best macaroon that the prettiest actress chose.

828
00:57:40,235 --> 00:57:41,691
 Did something happen?

829
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:44,481
 I came for Grandpa's help...

830
00:57:44,481 --> 00:57:48,872
 I can't tell her where she's from... so I'm afraid they might fall apart..

831
00:57:48,872 --> 00:57:51,623
 If I was hard I'll take care of it.

832
00:57:51,623 --> 00:57:54,705
 How poor that guy is..

833
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:57,895
 How lonely he is, how kind he is... Do you want me to tell you everything?

834
00:57:57,895 --> 00:58:01,151
 She's a good kid, you can't lost her brat.

835
00:58:01,151 --> 00:58:04,336
 I went to look for him...

836
00:58:04,336 --> 00:58:06,217
 We can't even imagin where he's gone through.

837
00:58:06,217 --> 00:58:09,161
 What were you going to say to Hedgehog?
