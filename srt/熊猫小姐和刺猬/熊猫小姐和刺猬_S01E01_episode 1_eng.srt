 Panda memorized that entire song?

7
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,602
Catch him! Stop right there!

8
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:08,404
Stop where you are!

9
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:09,404
Aish!

10
00:02:09,404 --> 00:02:11,337
Hey! Stop right there!

11
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:13,708
Why is he so damn fast?

12
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,316
Aish!

13
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:19,289
Hey!

14
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:25,319
If you don't stop right there, I'm going to charge you 30% more in interest. OKAY?!

15
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:27,860
Hey, why are you doing this?!
I need to catch someone too!

16
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:36,283
I heard that a swindler was in this area,
so I was trying to find him.

17
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:39,248
I need to get him to get my money back.

18
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:42,047
Then, we have to get him together, right?!

19
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:45,024
No! Oh, really...

20
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:51,829
Aish.

21
00:02:56,273 --> 00:02:58,484
What the heck is that panda?

22
00:02:58,484 --> 00:03:00,698
Are they in this together?

23
00:03:04,964 --> 00:03:06,855
 Seung Ji, the building collapsed.

24
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:07,925
What?

25
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:09,720
 Episode 1 
Oh, Seung Ji!

26
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,608
Hurry! Hurry!

27
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,458
The boss said there was something important to do.

28
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,697
I told him not to worry and that I'd take care of everything.

29
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:23,852
But I slipped while moving it...

30
00:03:23,852 --> 00:03:24,907
What time do you have to be there?

31
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:26,248
3 o'clock is the opening.

32
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,345
Do you think you can restore it?

33
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:33,344
Not " restore ", but " reconstruct "...

34
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,625
Me, human Go Seung Ji,

35
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,937
I know, you don't eat from

36
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:40,198
other people's dish.

37
00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:46,106
Hyung.
Huh?

38
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:48,283
Go buy some glitter.

39
00:03:48,283 --> 00:03:51,134
We don't even have time, can't we just do it as it is?

40
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:52,053
One!

41
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:53,267
Hey!

42
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:53,837
Two!

43
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:54,663
Seung Ji!

44
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:55,470
Three!

45
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,160
I get it! 
Geez.

46
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:14,303
Maculinea teleius.

47
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:17,382
Aspidomorpha transparipennis.

48
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:37,387
Megarhyssa groliosa.

49
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,378
Homotropus tarsatorius.

50
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:47,322
Homotropus tarsatorius.

51
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:21,108
Sir, why don't you blow them out!

52
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:22,669
Sure.

53
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:27,566
I told you I was right, they don't need anything fancy.

54
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:31,998
 "Urgent loan available on the day"
Low interest! Nice interest!

55
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,653
Did you take care of your business, Boss?

56
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:40,312
Did you come here because we were worried?
The cake has been delivered safely...

57
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:44,311
I told  you  to do it, who told you to tell this loach to do it?

58
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,498
Grandpa.

59
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:52,443
What's this?

60
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:56,102
Did you start flirting with someone?

61
00:06:57,361 --> 00:06:59,703
So suspicious.

62
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:08,329
Come with me for a sec, come on.

63
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:10,751
If your tail is long, you're bound to get caught.

64
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:15,002
So let's not work within Sunderella's territory.

65
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:15,963
If you're unlucky and get caught...

66
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:18,172
Aish.

67
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:21,547
What's the problem with me making
an investment with my own money?

68
00:07:21,547 --> 00:07:23,681
It's not like I chased their customers
away in front of the office,

69
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:25,962
I didn't loan out or loan them money.

70
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:28,564
I was being fair and was posting posters.

71
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,251
You, really!

72
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:32,192
You're so strong for a grandpa!

73
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:34,464
Is that because you kneaded dough everyday?

74
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:36,056
Your palm feels like a bear's claw.

75
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,594
Have you ever been hit by a bear's claw?

76
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:40,503
Did you get dumped by Cherry Blossom?

77
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,048
Why are you so cranky?

78
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:46,841
If I hear a rumor once more about you trying 
to get interest on your loans like thugs!

79
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,693
Are you saying that you are going to lend me some?

80
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:50,316
You bastard.

81
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:51,819
Get out this instant.

82
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,614
Who's going to make profit if I'm gone?

83
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:58,304
We can live on without you so just go somewhere you can earn more money.

84
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:01,288
Why are you so mad about me making money within short amount of time?

85
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:06,543
We should also get ourselves
a bigger bakery like the others!

86
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:08,331
Grandpa.

87
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:09,952
GRANDPA!

88
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:12,262
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

89
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:14,779
What?

90
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,632
One.

91
00:08:16,632 --> 00:08:18,268
Two.

92
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:20,184
Three! Go!

93
00:08:20,184 --> 00:08:21,802
Over there! Aish!

94
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,471
Stop right there, huh?!

95
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,874
Hey!

96
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:08,093
Let's go.

97
00:09:20,374 --> 00:09:22,676
 cafe PANDA
Cafe Panda. Please come over!

98
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:38,040
Hey, are you bored?

99
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,285
Talk, why don't you?

100
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:47,163
I'm doing this because the business is so bad these days!

101
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:49,272
Fix your hair.

102
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:51,462
Get a hairstyle that suits the size of your head.

103
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:52,634
Was a bird wearing it?

104
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,687
Your head is small, but the helmet is so small for your head

105
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,541
that it makes your hair messed up like this.

106
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:03,691
Panda, I'm sorry. Because of me,

107
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:09,009
My cake isn't working in this low level neighborhood.

108
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:13,263
So why don't we relocate to Kang Nam?

109
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:17,511
Hey!

110
00:10:21,857 --> 00:10:23,665
Why not?

111
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:24,894
Do you have insufficient funds?

112
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:28,278
It's not that I have insufficient funds, we have no money at all! Especially with the business slow like this.

113
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:30,135
What, nothing?

114
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:34,375
Hey, where did you learn that from?

115
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:38,435
Me, Kil Dong Gu has made the new cake, "
Scent of Love" with sensitivity and devotion...

116
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:42,264
And when we put it out, it was sold out just like that!

117
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:43,551
Only  one ?

118
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:44,768
What?

119
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:48,987
Hey! I'm returning this and pay for all the damages! Now!

120
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:50,615
Why are you being like this, customer?

121
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:52,515
You know that I live across the street, right?

122
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:53,574
Yes.

123
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:57,215
You've never seen me with a guy, right?

124
00:10:57,215 --> 00:10:58,345
Yes.

125
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:02,659
I've finally met a guy, after 10 years.

126
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:03,923
That's great!

127
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:07,642
It's great, but after he ate this cake, he vomited.

128
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:08,646
Morning sickness?

129
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:11,648
No, it's not that. He said "did you buy this cake thinking it's delicious?"

130
00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:13,796
"I don't have confidence that I can eat with you everyday."

131
00:11:13,796 --> 00:11:16,358
"Meet someone else" and left me!

132
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:18,285
Why?

133
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:23,319
This is " Scent of Love " that I made
with sensitivty and devotion!

134
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:26,921
Hey! Is... Is this..." Scent of Love " to you? Huh?!

135
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:30,767
This is the stench of a dish washcloth! Huh?!

136
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:42,087
Auntie, are you busy?

137
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:48,084
Thank you, bye.

138
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:54,577
I haven't seen you at all these days. Are you going to a different restaurant?

139
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:58,366
What nonsense. I pack rice and kimchi from home!

140
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:01,489
Aigoo. You're going to contruct a building, right?

141
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:05,699
How many times do I tell you we're not done settling my brother's debt?

142
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:07,761
We're living on $300 a month.

143
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,299
You...

144
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:19,118
Just one serving, please!

145
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:21,518
I'm not hungry. You can just eat, Auntie.

146
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:24,423
I just ate a while ago.

147
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:27,459
So what brings you to take your aunt out today?

148
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:31,662
Just because. I suddenly missed you.

149
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:35,946
Are you having a hard time? Is business bad?

150
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:37,722
It's alright.

151
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:41,746
The response from neighbors are good and...

152
00:12:41,746 --> 00:12:48,868
Instead of suffering more, you should sell it, 
pay off your debt, and live happier, right?

153
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,692
I feel like if I sell it,

154
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:56,247
I'll be saying good-bye to my parents forever.

155
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,225
Unni. Brother-in-law!

156
00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:06,862
Send a cool guy to help her out!

157
00:13:06,862 --> 00:13:11,956
Someone who has lots of money to make the cake shop succeed with flying colors!

158
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:16,387
Also an innocent one that only knows Panda!

159
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:18,908
Is there a guy like that in this world?

160
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:21,410
Why wouldn't there be?

161
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:28,215
Welcome.

162
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:54,613

163
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,286
It's difficult to answer the phone...

164
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:31,748
Ugh, it's always Unni.

165
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:34,565
What is it? I'm in the middle of throwing away the trash.

166
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:36,157
Where?

167
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:38,535
Here.

168
00:14:38,535 --> 00:14:40,834
Why did you come all the way here?

169
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:43,050
Surprise!

170
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,831
I'm so busy, why did you come?

171
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:48,518
Because I missed you.
 Right.

172
00:14:48,518 --> 00:14:50,787
I'm sorry.

173
00:14:50,787 --> 00:14:54,220
But, why are we talking through our phones?

174
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,411
You're right!

175
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:00,352
So why did you come?

176
00:15:00,352 --> 00:15:03,036
I thought I could get some money.
I went to meet Auntie.

177
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,790
You know my situation!

178
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,401
So I didn't say anything. 
Since the day after tomorrow is the end, I came.

179
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:14,009
It's finished. Why did you come? 
To take a picture for a keepsake?

180
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:17,646
No, that's not what I mean.

181
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:20,557
Since we haven't figured out the secret to its taste after investigating for three months, so...

182
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:23,814
During the short time we have left,
why don't we put our efforts together.

183
00:15:23,814 --> 00:15:27,636
Aigoo, really.

184
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,392
I tried them all.

185
00:15:30,392 --> 00:15:33,680
It's no use.

186
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,302
Hyung.

187
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,486
Finish the cake up.

188
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,356
Hey, I can't do that.

189
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:44,697
I think since I've been making soft cakes these days,

190
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:46,542
my thorns have become blunt.

191
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:49,587
Where are you going again?

192
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:53,512
I'll come back after getting my thorns straight.

193
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:55,905
Huh?

194
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:11,053
I told you it's useless.

195
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,604
It's tomorrow. You won't even be able to get it at that time!

196
00:16:14,604 --> 00:16:19,123
What should I do. I really want to try my best and get it.

197
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:22,738
But, why does my dad and mom never do what I want.

198
00:16:22,738 --> 00:16:25,864
What's the use of complaining about it?

199
00:16:25,864 --> 00:16:29,047
When they come in, we'll get in trouble.

200
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:34,078
Why don't you go up to Eun Bi
and talk about your money problem.

201
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,179
The last time, I just happened to talk a little...

202
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:42,454
"What? Lending money between friends is ridiculous!"

203
00:16:43,484 --> 00:16:47,660
Try to turn things around and convince her.

204
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:51,064
Like this?

205
00:16:51,064 --> 00:16:54,076
That's pathetic.

206
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:58,423
Like this.

207
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:00,851
Like this?

208
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:02,683
Yeah.

209
00:17:07,706 --> 00:17:12,583
I'm envious. You're very talented

210
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:18,243
and have lots of money.

211
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:25,950
How much do you make?

212
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,812
350.

213
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:31,224
That's great. I wish I could have that much.

214
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:34,461
It's not too bad.

215
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:36,020
350 Won.

216
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,162
350 Won?

217
00:17:38,162 --> 00:17:40,624
You, how much did you make before opening the cafe?

218
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,400
Everything went into the cafe.

219
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,627
I told you to fire that patissier in the kitchen. He's the problem!

220
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:53,089
I can't fire him yet because I
 gave his salary as a present.

221
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:57,315
Da Yang, he can go to your cafe as
 he's supposed to, and you come here.

222
00:17:57,315 --> 00:18:01,183
They're choosing a new part-timer?

223
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:02,786
Then, I can just work here.

224
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:07,227
They're not choosing a new part-time worker. The boss' oldest son is coming from America.

225
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:09,644
Oh, they say he's really great.

226
00:18:09,644 --> 00:18:16,461
They say that his face and body is really in shape.

227
00:18:24,848 --> 00:18:26,931
 New York.

228
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:34,249
 But he's way to great that you can't really describe him and he's really so handsome and also,

229
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:38,616
 he graduated at the top of his class with an MBA.

230
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:41,527
Are you okay? You didn't get hurt?

231
00:18:41,527 --> 00:18:44,178
Get up.

232
00:18:44,178 --> 00:18:46,761
Oh! You like pandas, don't you?

233
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:49,807
Pandas are most prettiest in the world.

234
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:52,340
I also think that pandas are the most prettiest in world.

235
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,881
Where are your parents?

236
00:18:55,881 --> 00:19:01,066
Dad! 
Dad!

237
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,743
Oh, hyung!!!

238
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:12,039
 The younger sibling thought studying was like dying.

239
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,928
 They're siblings that aren't similar.

240
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:16,790
Have you been well?

241
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,213
Welcome!

242
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:22,638
Anyways I think he's no joke, and soon a lot of people will get fired soon and

243
00:19:22,638 --> 00:19:26,582
he'll be accepting new people!

244
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:33,632
Hey, isn't that great?
Don't you think I can also apply here that time, 
oh just like sun shining!!

245
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:37,787
Shining is a bit... 
I guess it's like that.

246
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:41,016
I have to go.

247
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:43,143
Where would you go to so suddenly?

248
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:45,957
To write my resume!

249
00:19:45,957 --> 00:19:50,755
Don't you dare to think about getting a part-timer job here!

250
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:03,788
Just you wait, Saint Honore -  I'll get accepted.

251
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:19,603
Just you wait, Saint Honore - I'll eat you up.

252
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:34,407
Just you wait, Saint Honore -

253
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:37,588
I'll protect you.

254
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:52,994
You must be doing real good.

255
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:58,253
I know, you got a million dollar inheritance from Father.

256
00:20:58,253 --> 00:21:02,942
Anyway, Mom might go crazy if she finds out that you returned a day early.

257
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:05,745
I need to rest even if it's like this.

258
00:21:06,854 --> 00:21:10,106
But, what have you been trying to find since earlier?
Huh?

259
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:13,227
No, it's just that I don't see my present.

260
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:15,344
Aigoo.

261
00:21:15,344 --> 00:21:18,120
The whole bag is yours.

262
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,120
HYUNG! You did great, hyung!
There no one else like you.

263
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,870
After I declared that I won't go to college, 
I got treated badly by Mom, 
my allowance was cut off 500 years ago.

264
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:34,253
And I didn't have money for gas to
 pick you up from the airport. 
So I barely borrowed from Gye Neung.

265
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:43,277
You're going to school.

266
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:44,818
You know my skills, Hyung.

267
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:48,581
You know my temper. 
I'll show it to you.

268
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:50,622
I'll start studying after summer ends.

269
00:21:50,622 --> 00:21:52,325
Hey, are you a student?

270
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:57,326
Hyung! Even students get a summer break! How can I study now that I'm not even a student?

271
00:21:57,326 --> 00:22:00,926
Immediately after it gets cooler, 
you'll start your studies. 
Huh?

272
00:22:00,926 --> 00:22:02,132
Okay?

273
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:06,519
I'll do it! I'll do it, hyungnim.
I'll do it.

274
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:10,347
If you don't keep your promise...

275
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:11,874
Deaaaath!

276
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,425
Here.

277
00:22:13,425 --> 00:22:16,160
Oppa, I love you!

278
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,510
It's so hard just to hear "Oppa".

279
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,529
Oppa, oppa.
Oppa.

280
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:24,194
I came to give it to you.

281
00:22:24,194 --> 00:22:25,228
Oppa!

282
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:34,892
If I had money,

283
00:22:34,892 --> 00:22:39,149
I could rent a room or a store.

284
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,746
Aigoo.

285
00:22:41,746 --> 00:22:44,506
Being a father...

286
00:22:44,506 --> 00:22:47,141
 To what shop are you going to?

287
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:50,714
 To my sister's.

288
00:22:50,714 --> 00:22:56,476
 Just promise me one thing,
that you will definitely answer the phone when I call.

289
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:01,465
Here are the instructions. 
Why don't you read them?

290
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:03,604
They say even the first-time users

291
00:23:03,604 --> 00:23:07,283
won't have a hard time with the one I picked.

292
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:40,843

293
00:23:45,644 --> 00:23:50,373
Anyway, whether you're old or young, 
when you get a girl,
 you take care of your phone first.

294
00:23:52,877 --> 00:23:55,532
Are you dreaming about Cherry Blossom?

295
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:59,082
I'm saying this since Grandpa can't hear this.

296
00:23:59,082 --> 00:24:02,045
Earlier, that was too much.

297
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:08,163
It's okay for you to love a woman, but please don't make yourself suffer because of that.

298
00:24:08,766 --> 00:24:13,159
From now on, don't do that. You got it?

299
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,358
Grandpa! I love you!

300
00:24:40,884 --> 00:24:43,784
I can't tell a boy who does that to just leave.

301
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:47,871
And I can't leave my daughter to live with him too.

302
00:24:47,871 --> 00:24:51,120
Aigoo, really...

303
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:04,687
Here's what you wanted.

304
00:25:17,489 --> 00:25:20,544
Honey! What are you doing there?

305
00:25:20,544 --> 00:25:23,696
Our president finally showed up, right?

306
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:26,470
Welcome, my son.

307
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,016
How are you?

308
00:25:32,016 --> 00:25:36,481
Because I wanted to see you I wasn't.

309
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:43,865
Wait, weren't you suppose to come here at dinner? 
What the? You tricked your mom! You!

310
00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:47,959
Why are you arguing?
It's alright since he came.

311
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:52,741
Because my son came, it feels like the kitchen is full of joy, don't you think so?

312
00:25:52,741 --> 00:26:00,225
That's right. All of a sudden, the kitchen looks smaller, feels suffocating... Welcome!

313
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:07,347
Our new manager looks really perfect today.

314
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:09,976
Of course your son looks like his dad.

315
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:14,797
He resembles my brother-in-law.
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

316
00:26:27,197 --> 00:26:30,755
My son, I welcome you.

317
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:46,201
Say something. It's not like you'll get this chance again.
And if you are promoted,
you'll have no reason to come here.

318
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:58,213
Hello. I'm Choi Won Il.
 I'm back after finishing my studies with the 
money you made from all your hard work.

319
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,799
What is that person saying?

320
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:13,576
Not long ago, my mother asked me to be the manager of this company.

321
00:27:13,576 --> 00:27:22,464
I'll try to make everyone's dream here come true and make the national franchise cake company the best one.

322
00:27:22,464 --> 00:27:25,082
That'll be my job from now on.

323
00:27:25,082 --> 00:27:28,837
Yes! Yes!
Bravo!

324
00:27:32,475 --> 00:27:38,686
So that way I'll need everyone's help here and we'll do great together.

325
00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:41,284
Please take care of me.
Thank you.

326
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,297
Our son's the best! Our son's the best!

327
00:27:47,722 --> 00:27:53,448
Okay, now we will start the highlight! 
The cake cutting!

328
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:55,471
The president Choi Won Il!

329
00:27:55,471 --> 00:28:02,544
Oh, wow! Our Jang Soo Suk is calling him
 the president for the first time! Our prince.

330
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:05,450
Our Prince! What are you doing? Come here.

331
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:09,366
Give me the flowers, Wonie.

332
00:28:24,097 --> 00:28:29,851
President, you have to cut...

333
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:52,693
Did Ko Seung Ji come?

334
00:28:54,055 --> 00:28:57,192
He didn't just come, he was so awesome!

335
00:28:57,192 --> 00:29:00,490
He's already there and told you guys what he wanted?

336
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,005
 What do you think of that?

337
00:29:03,005 --> 00:29:09,441
It's a jackpot! 
Let's talk later, my eyes are to busy right now.

338
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:13,820
How unusual would he look like if he made her eyes so busy.

339
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,936
Hey, stop! Stop!

340
00:29:18,699 --> 00:29:20,726
Stop right there!

341
00:29:21,804 --> 00:29:23,672
Hey!

342
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,188
Aish...

343
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,716
Why are you always chasing me
 when I'm trying to find the debtors?

344
00:29:32,716 --> 00:29:37,342
How can I repay you your money like this? 
Ah, so frustrating.

345
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:45,841
You think he's just laughing through his nose.
It's acually the sound of a steam about to blow off.

346
00:29:45,841 --> 00:29:50,361
He'll take off like the sound of a train.
Then, you'll be dead!

347
00:29:50,361 --> 00:29:56,802
Hey, hey, I don't know anything about that, 
if you have time,
why don't you help me out?

348
00:29:56,802 --> 00:29:59,715
One! 
Two!

349
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:00,904
Hey! No, no, Hey!

350
00:30:00,904 --> 00:30:01,984
Three!

351
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,606
GO!

352
00:30:20,322 --> 00:30:24,875
What the heck! What's with the panda appearing at this time?! Aish.

353
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,814
You couldn't find him?

354
00:30:29,814 --> 00:30:32,920
Yeah. Hey, he has, like, a motor on his legs.

355
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:38,658
Wow~I'm about to go crazy! Does it make sense that you lost him when he was right in front of you?

356
00:30:38,658 --> 00:30:43,305
Hey, in this light day how could you lose him?

357
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:46,166
Aish, some weird b****.

358
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:51,515
Hey, you couldn't catch him because you lost your mind on a girl?

359
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:55,716
They're accomplices for sure.
They're accomplices.

360
00:30:55,716 --> 00:31:02,514
Ahjussi, why are you selling this stuff to her that she doesn't even give you money for it, huh?

361
00:31:03,304 --> 00:31:06,424
She had said her cafe is named Panda,

362
00:31:06,424 --> 00:31:09,471
so she bought a panda.

363
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:11,243
Panda cafe?

364
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:15,256
How can you say it doesn't matter to you, huh?

365
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:22,850
You have to take the money from her as soon as you can, 
you don't know what if she just never pay you back?

366
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,108
What are you talking about, you little punk?

367
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:31,215
I'm gonna go outside for a bit, so you guys don't do anything foolish and take care of the business.

368
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:33,531
Have a nice trip.

369
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:36,485
 Grandpa, how have you been?

370
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:42,140
You! You're not working during the day, and
you're just following him around?

371
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:49,475
Asking a night club waiter why he's not working in the day is weird. 
The night club got its name 'night' because it opens in the night.

372
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:53,802
During the day, at least you can give out
your business cards so you can make a little
 more money for yourself.

373
00:31:53,802 --> 00:31:56,804
Grandpa! No, 
manager!

374
00:31:56,804 --> 00:32:00,008
That, 
how do you know that?

375
00:32:00,008 --> 00:32:02,252
Ah, you must go to the night sometimes.

376
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:05,318
What's wrong with you? What the-

377
00:32:05,318 --> 00:32:09,889
Bye Boss, I won't go too far.

378
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:13,257
You're becoming charming.

379
00:32:13,257 --> 00:32:17,726
You need to make money.
What's the use of being charming?

380
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:23,462
Of course. Anyway, where is Panda Cafe?

381
00:32:25,957 --> 00:32:27,294
BUS!

382
00:32:27,294 --> 00:32:29,086
What?

383
00:32:29,086 --> 00:32:30,341
The panda was taking a bus.

384
00:32:30,341 --> 00:32:32,524
What was the bus's number?

385
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,259
Ah! I didn't see the number.

386
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:55,727
This is too weak.

387
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:59,841
Ah!

388
00:33:01,702 --> 00:33:04,246
Ta-da!

389
00:33:04,246 --> 00:33:05,723
Ta-da?

390
00:33:05,723 --> 00:33:08,274
Sorry aunt, making you come when you're busy.

391
00:33:08,274 --> 00:33:10,998
It's not busy. 
There are no customers.

392
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:14,771
Don't you think handing this to people isn't enough?

393
00:33:14,771 --> 00:33:18,074
Then, should I hand this out on the big street?

394
00:33:18,074 --> 00:33:21,303
That's a plan too,

395
00:33:22,563 --> 00:33:27,440
Lets make this bigger, 
post it on a car and drive around?

396
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,702
I have some left over materials.

397
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:45,091
This is too weak.

398
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:49,709
Hey, it's manager.

399
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:52,712
That Grandpa, how long did he have the cell phone?

400
00:33:52,712 --> 00:33:53,836
Did Cherry Blossom buy it for him?

401
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:54,879
Huh?

402
00:33:54,879 --> 00:34:01,564
Shall we follow him? 
She bought a cell phone for him too.
 Maybe she will come today.

403
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:02,678
Shall we?

404
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:04,160
Let's go.

405
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:15,856
This cell phone is under my name,
 I heard I can use GPS

406
00:34:15,856 --> 00:34:19,017
as it was explained to me.

407
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:21,356
I'll find out.

408
00:34:27,387 --> 00:34:42,209

409
00:34:50,312 --> 00:34:52,378
As if! 
( the place the manager is about to go in = girl's inn )

410
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:54,689
No, no it's not.

411
00:35:00,722 --> 00:35:03,395
Wow!

412
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:05,890
I'm going crazy.

413
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:08,992
Ah! Gross!

414
00:35:10,245 --> 00:35:21,779

415
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,121
What's wrong with him?

416
00:35:42,776 --> 00:35:45,491
He's alone.
Is anyone coming to see him?

417
00:35:53,706 --> 00:35:56,569
What's wrong with grandpa's face?

418
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,429
That's a face of only those who fall in love.
That's really embarrassing.

419
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:23,900
Wow... It's not a joke.

420
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,029
It's cherry blossom ahjumma.

421
00:36:29,494 --> 00:36:30,697
Cherry blossoms?

422
00:36:31,902 --> 00:36:34,107
 What is this?

423
00:36:38,044 --> 00:36:40,010
It was cherry blossoms.

424
00:37:17,531 --> 00:37:20,148
Where did you come from?

425
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:22,293
Grandpa!

426
00:37:22,293 --> 00:37:24,036
Where were you?

427
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:25,077
You can't hear me?

428
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:28,592
Why do you care about where I came from!

429
00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:31,494
Why are you getting angry? What did I do wrong?

430
00:37:31,494 --> 00:37:32,791
I was calmly working.

431
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:36,385
Wow... You've worked in such a long time!

432
00:37:36,385 --> 00:37:37,899
Anyway, did you eat?

433
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:39,144
I don't want to.

434
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:40,796
I'm going to sleep.

435
00:37:41,578 --> 00:37:43,606
Why are you going to sleep so early?

436
00:37:43,606 --> 00:37:46,448
Do I need your permission to go to sleep!?

437
00:37:46,448 --> 00:37:49,507
Why do you hate me so suddenly?

438
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:52,528
Did you get dumped by cherry blossom grandma?

439
00:37:52,528 --> 00:37:55,166
Yeah! I got dumped! What are you going to do?!

440
00:37:57,311 --> 00:38:00,737
At this small place, she said she can't live together!

441
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:06,040
You wanted to live with her?

442
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,632
What are you going to do after meeting the president's daughter?

443
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:23,167
I'll make grandpa live well after that...

444
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,336
Grandpa did something for me.

445
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,016
Don't you think I have to do at least that?

446
00:38:29,244 --> 00:38:33,382
If it were me and I had a father, I would go immediately.

447
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:36,167
Is their relationship bad?

448
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:39,704
Grandpa said he made a grave sin to his daughter.

449
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,045
I only know up to that.

450
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:46,564
Then, if his daughter comes, you have to give her your room.

451
00:38:46,796 --> 00:38:51,517
Then I can stay in Grandpa's room. How is that a problem?

452
00:38:52,718 --> 00:38:53,893
It's Byung Moo.

453
00:38:53,893 --> 00:38:55,357
Byung Moo!

454
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:01,837
What are you thinking about that 
you don't even know where you're going, man?

455
00:39:01,837 --> 00:39:05,987
Why... is a strange woman looking for the president here?

456
00:39:05,987 --> 00:39:07,442
What?

457
00:39:07,442 --> 00:39:11,548
She came here and asked for a favor from me.

458
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:13,372
Hey, is that manager's daughter?

459
00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:16,200
Manager had a daughter?!

460
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:20,496
Isn't that from your father side?
Why?

461
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:32,215
Hyung!

462
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:36,039
Our Grandpa, how much does he make in a month?

463
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,538
Well...

464
00:39:37,538 --> 00:39:38,794
not sure.

465
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:42,374
I think to put everything together...

466
00:39:42,374 --> 00:39:46,577
President only gets 70-80 won for himself.

467
00:39:47,064 --> 00:39:48,915
70-80?

468
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:51,221
He only gets that amount?

469
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:52,577
Of course.

470
00:39:52,577 --> 00:39:55,882
He always wants his employees get more than him.

471
00:39:55,882 --> 00:39:58,896
He never lets his payment get borrowed.

472
00:39:59,562 --> 00:40:01,961
My payment is 2,000,000 (won).

473
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:04,434
But grandpa gets 700,000 (won)?

474
00:40:06,645 --> 00:40:08,776
Then how much do you get, hyung?

475
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,438
Well for me...
I get 1,200,000 won.

476
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:15,467
I get 2,000,000 (won),
but you get 1,200,000(won)?

477
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:19,003
Hey, it's not a big deal...

478
00:40:19,003 --> 00:40:22,049
If it's 1,200,000 (won), there's a lot of places that pay that much, too.

479
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,312
I was wondering why grandpa was poor.

480
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,028
I guess it was because of me.

481
00:40:39,338 --> 00:40:41,936
Ahjusshi, give me one of those.

482
00:40:42,535 --> 00:40:44,278
For how many people?

483
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:45,580
One person.

484
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,929
Then, 1/2 kg?

485
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:49,277
What do you mean 1/2 kg?

486
00:40:49,277 --> 00:40:50,639
5 kg!

487
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,597
No, 10 kg, give me 10 kg.

488
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:54,855
Ah, why are you getting mad?

489
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:57,321
Your grandpa personally bought them himself.

490
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:59,480
But because he ordered you a little task, you're getting revenge, right?

491
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,712
Nevermind that,
 the meat grandpa bought, how much was that?

492
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:05,969
Ha, look at him.

493
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:07,901
Now you're even secretly investigating him?

494
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:11,045
He only bought the best meat, why?

495
00:41:12,393 --> 00:41:14,062
A guy like me... Really...

496
00:41:14,062 --> 00:41:15,829
What did you say, punk?

497
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:19,504
I asked you to give me the best meat,
Best meat, huh?!

498
00:41:19,504 --> 00:41:21,899
You really became a person.

499
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:25,910
You never even gave your Grandpa 
any allowance before, and now you buy meat for him?

500
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,663
Where is an employee who gives allowance to his manager?

501
00:41:28,663 --> 00:41:32,479
Are you just an employee, bastard?
You're more precious to him than his real Grandson.

502
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:39,513
Ah, hurry up and give it to me.

503
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,355
He only gets 700,000 won in a month...

504
00:42:09,355 --> 00:42:12,514
The refrigerator is also in this condition.

505
00:42:31,302 --> 00:42:33,881
Don't smile, old man.

506
00:42:33,881 --> 00:42:36,814
Am I that great to do that for me?!

507
00:42:36,814 --> 00:42:41,012
How can the refrigerator be like that, you don't even have money, huh?

508
00:42:41,012 --> 00:42:43,612
To make me forget it, right?

509
00:42:46,547 --> 00:42:51,522
With my payment, 
WHY CAN'T YOU MOVE TO A BIGGER HOUSE AND GET A BIGGER SHOP?

510
00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:55,758
Or, "Our daughter came, what a good thing!"

511
00:42:55,758 --> 00:42:59,017
You could tell me those things!!

512
00:43:02,853 --> 00:43:04,802
Or is it because I'm not blood-related?

513
00:43:09,162 --> 00:43:14,865
I'm not blood-related that's why you never count on me for anything...

514
00:43:14,865 --> 00:43:18,875
From this house, I'll move out!

515
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:30,568
He's to die for, isn't he? He's awesome, isn't he?

516
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:33,440
Where is the awesome...?

517
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,917
It's definitely not our's type.

518
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:42,107
You guys are stupid that's why you don't know what handsome it is...
But still that's a relief!

519
00:43:42,107 --> 00:43:46,063
There won't be any reason to fight with a friend.

520
00:43:47,032 --> 00:43:50,197
I think I saw his face before.

521
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:52,268
Ah!

522
00:43:53,156 --> 00:43:54,821
Did you give in my resume?

523
00:43:54,821 --> 00:43:58,656
Who did you give the resume to?
Who am I?

524
00:43:58,656 --> 00:44:02,199
Really? Take care of me well!

525
00:44:02,605 --> 00:44:06,525
Why are you bowing to her?
She just collects resumes. 
She has no power to hire anybody.

526
00:44:06,525 --> 00:44:08,461
Who has the power to decide?

527
00:44:08,461 --> 00:44:12,378
Who do you think?
Of course our great president.

528
00:44:12,378 --> 00:44:15,512
Please, I request of you!

529
00:44:17,644 --> 00:44:20,359
I think I know him.

530
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:26,147
How would you know him? The level you guys live on are different.

531
00:44:26,147 --> 00:44:27,637
RIght?

532
00:44:59,398 --> 00:45:01,159
Hello.

533
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:03,975
Hello.

534
00:45:03,975 --> 00:45:06,835
Hello.

535
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:33,730
So he is coming on this path.

536
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:37,047
How dare he.

537
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,705
What is it that you don't know?

538
00:45:43,705 --> 00:45:47,414
I was going through this, and
 I found a lot of strange things.

539
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:49,922
Please tell me the wholesale prices of the materials.

540
00:45:49,922 --> 00:45:53,343
You drew your sword finally, President.

541
00:45:53,343 --> 00:45:55,959
I don't know what the other side is planning.

542
00:45:55,959 --> 00:46:02,216
Perhaps, won't they get a daughter-in-law 
from a family that can give more support?

543
00:46:02,216 --> 00:46:04,523
That's enough.

544
00:46:04,523 --> 00:46:07,112
I already have a woman I'm seeing.

545
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:09,681
Who is that?
Huh?

546
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,881
Panda.

547
00:46:12,881 --> 00:46:15,008
What?

548
00:46:15,008 --> 00:46:19,100
Ah, right Hyung, how can I find my middle school class mates?

549
00:46:21,466 --> 00:46:24,777
I thought you might get rusty.
I was just making you exercise.

550
00:46:24,777 --> 00:46:26,519
Hey hey

551
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:32,294
Even people can't sell cakes.
Why are you putting so much effort
 to have a panda sell them?

552
00:46:32,294 --> 00:46:36,777
THEN - shall we change patissiers?

553
00:46:36,777 --> 00:46:39,378
Are you threatening me?

554
00:46:39,378 --> 00:46:40,615
Yes.

555
00:46:40,615 --> 00:46:46,158
Suddenly, I have an idea for a new cake..

556
00:46:46,158 --> 00:46:49,180
This one's great.

557
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,230
Ah nice.

558
00:47:03,393 --> 00:47:06,934
 Panda Cafe Resume.

559
00:47:06,934 --> 00:47:11,871
Right. I have nothing to lose. 
 I'm just going to do it.

560
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:21,515
 Resume.
 Birthday, Address, E-mail, Past Experiences.

561
00:47:21,515 --> 00:47:25,494
 Confectionery baker 2005: qualification 
 2006-2007 student .. Kyungpook National vocational training in prison 
 2008-2012: Mozart Scottsdale bakery.

562
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:33,729
Hello?

563
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:36,437
What are you doing? 
Why aren't you coming when the boss is like this?

564
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:41,215
Hey, now the president keeps doing....

565
00:47:45,104 --> 00:47:49,576
I don't know. I won't go in. Bye.

566
00:47:57,062 --> 00:47:58,202
Excuse me.

567
00:47:58,202 --> 00:47:59,176
Yes.

568
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,558
When you take the picture,

569
00:48:01,558 --> 00:48:05,308
please make me look as good as possible.

570
00:48:07,111 --> 00:48:09,765
You're not going to tell, right?

571
00:48:09,765 --> 00:48:11,354
Yes, I understand.

572
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:14,770
I will take the picture.

573
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,721
Please take it one more time.

574
00:48:44,785 --> 00:48:46,970
Now you should stop.

575
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:48,475
Why do you want to stop it?

576
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:54,638
There has to be a huge picture of our handsome president on tomorrow's headlines!

577
00:48:54,638 --> 00:49:01,676
That's why your father said OK to this!

578
00:49:01,676 --> 00:49:03,707
Didn't he give the authority?

579
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,851
Isn't like that to follow whatever the president say?!

580
00:49:06,851 --> 00:49:07,556
Then I will get out now.

581
00:49:07,556 --> 00:49:08,758
No no no.

582
00:49:08,758 --> 00:49:15,900
Okay, ok. I got it.

583
00:49:18,053 --> 00:49:19,615
Let's go.

584
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:23,123
Work, my son. Work.

585
00:49:31,365 --> 00:49:34,027
Here?

586
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:40,191
Isn't that you have something to show me?

587
00:49:40,191 --> 00:49:42,167
Oh...

588
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:45,154
The resume.

589
00:49:49,587 --> 00:49:53,921
Here are some records about that...

590
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:56,531
Oh yeah.

591
00:50:35,468 --> 00:50:39,440
Why is he so restless?

592
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,445
Do you know who she is?

593
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:50,688
No.

594
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:53,116
You don't know even with that?

595
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:54,731
It's the school you went to before going abroad.

596
00:50:54,731 --> 00:50:56,845
That's right.

597
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,658
  Pan Da Yang.

598
00:50:59,658 --> 00:51:01,867
Pan Da Yang?

599
00:51:01,867 --> 00:51:04,700
Panda? Hahaha.

600
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,316
What kind of name-

601
00:51:07,316 --> 00:51:09,013
Ah, Panda.

602
00:51:09,013 --> 00:51:09,932
Yes, Panda.

603
00:51:09,932 --> 00:51:10,720
Hyung's first love?!

604
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,646
Now you're right!- last love.

605
00:51:14,646 --> 00:51:19,314
Huh?!  You have never been in love?

606
00:51:19,314 --> 00:51:25,107
It's not l that I don't want to date, but I'm way too busy for those things now.

607
00:51:25,107 --> 00:51:29,517
You can date even if you're that busy.

608
00:51:29,517 --> 00:51:31,421
You.. did you date?

609
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,477
Do you have to date to know?

610
00:51:33,477 --> 00:51:38,787
I lived on the money I made from counseling about
 love for my friends since I didn't get allowance.

611
00:51:38,787 --> 00:51:40,753
I'll give you a counseling fee also.

612
00:51:40,753 --> 00:51:42,997
Leave it to me!
Just leave it to me!

613
00:51:42,997 --> 00:51:47,028
Hyung, after people got my counseling, there isn't anyone who didn't find their match.

614
00:51:47,028 --> 00:51:50,564
You're not pretending to not know, right?

615
00:51:50,564 --> 00:51:52,417
Trust me. Huh?

616
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:54,521
Would you like to use a sample strategy?

617
00:51:54,521 --> 00:51:55,910
What is that?

618
00:51:55,910 --> 00:52:01,011
Women will definitely fall for gentlemen very easily.

619
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:03,391
Stro-ng?

620
00:52:03,391 --> 00:52:07,385
Not STRONG!
I said gentle!

621
00:52:07,385 --> 00:52:11,746
Bingo!

622
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:30,348

623
00:52:42,548 --> 00:52:44,967
Cafe Panda

624
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:41,292
Give me some good things.

625
00:53:41,292 --> 00:53:43,977
How much did I reduce on your interest?

626
00:53:43,977 --> 00:53:48,522
Hey, how can I just let you in like this?

627
00:53:48,522 --> 00:53:51,680
Why? There are a lot of good things.

628
00:53:52,347 --> 00:53:56,551
I also want to open a bakery 
under my name and show to others. So?

629
00:53:56,551 --> 00:54:02,222
Hey, now days there are a lot of people who can open a bakery.

630
00:54:02,222 --> 00:54:09,348
No matter how good your skills are, if you don't have money, you can't.

631
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,769
Then,

632
00:54:13,769 --> 00:54:16,301
how much would I need to get anywhere?

633
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:18,883
Around,  1 million?

634
00:54:18,883 --> 00:54:21,221
1 million?

635
00:54:23,115 --> 00:54:24,968
1 million, my butt.

636
00:54:24,968 --> 00:54:26,481
Where would I have 1 million?!

637
00:54:26,481 --> 00:54:32,939
That's why I'm telling you not to do it! Try working first. You can't do it yourself.

638
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:35,675
Then what am I supposed to do?

639
00:54:35,675 --> 00:54:37,832
No, our grandpa, what if we move to our bigger bread shop?

640
00:54:37,832 --> 00:54:40,798
Hey, just continue where you usually do.

641
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:44,207
At least, you have regulars there.

642
00:54:44,207 --> 00:54:48,192
If you move, you'll just lose your customers.

643
00:54:50,298 --> 00:54:52,971
Why is this so hard..

644
00:55:05,959 --> 00:55:09,310
Do you think we can do this job?

645
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:13,946
You and I will have to combine our strengths and do our best.

646
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,316
Aja Aja Fighting!

647
00:55:18,746 --> 00:55:21,427
Seung Ji!

648
00:55:21,427 --> 00:55:23,736
Did Seung Ji come? 
He didn't come.

649
00:55:23,736 --> 00:55:26,478
Oh, oh

650
00:55:26,478 --> 00:55:27,552
Look look.

651
00:55:27,552 --> 00:55:29,828
Where did you get that?

652
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:32,674
I picked it up.

653
00:55:32,674 --> 00:55:33,782
What is that?

654
00:55:33,782 --> 00:55:35,659
Panda Cafe.

655
00:55:35,659 --> 00:55:37,623
What do you mean?

656
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:43,897
Patissier wanted?

657
00:55:45,472 --> 00:55:48,157
Room offered?

658
00:55:48,157 --> 00:55:51,861
Immediately hired!

659
00:55:52,521 --> 00:55:55,098
You guys did well.

660
00:55:55,098 --> 00:55:56,053
1.

661
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:56,661
1?

662
00:55:56,661 --> 00:55:57,713
2.

663
00:55:57,713 --> 00:55:58,232
2.

664
00:55:58,232 --> 00:56:01,557
3. Go.

665
00:56:10,604 --> 00:56:15,147
Hey, lose some weight.

666
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:26,419
Sorry.

667
00:56:26,419 --> 00:56:33,027
You and I are doing well, right?

668
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,575
Yeah, Eun Bi. Yeah.

669
00:56:46,575 --> 00:56:50,257
Did you give in the resume?

670
00:56:50,257 --> 00:56:55,435
Really?
So I can really open it?

671
00:56:55,435 --> 00:56:58,505
Really?

672
00:57:37,774 --> 00:57:39,798
 Is she a girl? Did she get your baby?

673
00:57:39,798 --> 00:57:40,944
 So what happened is,

674
00:57:40,944 --> 00:57:45,095
 after looking at that woman, I just fell RIGHT for her.

675
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:47,528
 That customer, what is he doing there?

676
00:57:47,528 --> 00:57:50,241
 Maculinea teleius..

677
00:57:50,241 --> 00:57:55,054
 This is the cake we fell for!

678
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,432
 I don't know.

679
00:57:56,432 --> 00:57:58,248
 Hey punk, how can you just drink like that?!

680
00:57:58,248 --> 00:57:59,911
Then how do you expect me to drink?

681
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:03,390
 Do you not know me? I'm Won Il!

682
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:05,369
 You always called me Pangy.
Pangy!

683
00:58:05,369 --> 00:58:07,172
 Pangy?!
