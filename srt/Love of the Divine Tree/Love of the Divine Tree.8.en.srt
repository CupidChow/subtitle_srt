[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,940
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,610
Why?

4
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,760
Why do you always make decisions on your own?

5
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,230
You don't trust me,

6
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,230
yet why do you take the blame for me?

7
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,490
Just because you're my master,

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,030
you think you can say nothing

9
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,960
and die for me?

10
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,950
Using your death to punish me,

11
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,910
is this your way of being a master?

12
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,630
Master.

13
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,329
You can't just end it this way.

14
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,530
I will never accept your kindness.

15
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,620
Even if I have to tear down the sky,

16
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,430
I'll bring you back to life.

17
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,750
I'll pay

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,190
my own debt.

19
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,240
What I owe you,

20
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,710
I'll definitely pay you back.

21
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,690
Master.

22
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,630
Mu Qingge!

23
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,830
Yishui.

24
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,950
Su Yishui.

25
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,310
Su Yishui.

26
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,040
Yishui.

27
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,870
I can

28
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,470
let bygones be bygones.

29
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,950
Did Mu Qingge

30
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,090
tell you

31
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,950
the whereabouts of the Spirit Spring?

32
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,390
We still have a chance to turn the tables.

33
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,270
Yishui,

34
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,780
you are still the Demon's child.

35
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,040
As long as you're willing,

36
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,800
we can

37
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,720
find the Spirit Spring again

38
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,720
and reclaim the universe.

39
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,720
Leading the entire universe,

40
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,920
isn't that what you want?

41
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,310
Su Yishui!

42
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,970
You, an immortal master of the mortal world,

43
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,160
are becoming increasingly outrageous.

44
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,870
You stole the Ice Lotus before

45
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,040
and chased away the guardian cat.

46
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,800
Today you broke into my cave.

47
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,980
Do you no longer care for your mortal body?

48
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,390
I, Su Yishui,

49
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,130
beg you to grant me the Reincarnation Tree

50
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,000
to save my master.

51
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,120
The Reincarnation Tree is such a divine object.

52
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,240
You're just an immortal master of the mortal world.

53
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,510
You can't just simply ask for it.

54
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,830
I beg for your mercy.

55
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,550
The Reincarnation Tree

56
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,240
is right behind the Thousand Light Beams.

57
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,390
Let's see if you can risk your life to get it.

58
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,000
Su Yishui.

59
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,390
Su Yishui.

60
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,360
Su Yishui.

61
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,930
Even if you risked your life

62
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,750
to get the Reincarnation Tree,

63
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,840
it would not be enough

64
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,720
to compensate for the kindness you owe Master.

65
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,190
It has borne fruit.

66
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,720
These two

67
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,420
are Master and Mu Ranwu.

68
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,240
But why did Mu Ranwu

69
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,840
have to rush into the formation at the end

70
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,510
and lose her life?

71
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,670
She was insignificant,

72
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,330
but under the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Curse,

73
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,010
their souls were shattered

74
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,960
and mixed together.

75
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,270
They can only be reborn together now.

76
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,630
When will Master be able to return?

77
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,120
The Reincarnation Tree defies the heavens.

78
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,520
It will take 18 years for her to return.

79
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,960
You're so severely injured.

80
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,150
You need to go into seclusion to preserve your life.

81
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,760
During these 18 years,

82
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,790
if anything happens,

83
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,550
how will you protect her?

84
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,670
I have my own ways.

85
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,600
Why are you extracting your own soul?

86
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,320
The Reincarnation Tree absorbs the Golden Core,

87
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,120
using the soul as a guide.

88
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,240
After this, I will seclude myself and lose all five senses.

89
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,910
This part of my soul

90
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,480
can accompany her.

91
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,670
You've also placed a restriction on her appearance.

92
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,250
After she is reborn,

93
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,000
what everyone sees

94
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,920
will no longer be Mu Qingge's appearance.

95
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,220
This time,

96
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,640
I absolutely won't

97
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,960
let worldly affairs disturb her.

98
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,630
Su Yishui,

99
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,720
when you eliminated Mu Qingge,

100
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,390
the barrier you raised

101
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,510
was actually

102
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,580
to collect her remaining soul.

103
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,210
Why did you give up

104
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,000
the Transcendence Realm that was within your grasp

105
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,480
and use half a Golden Core

106
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,790
to reincarnate Mu Qingge?

107
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,790
To break the curse.

108
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,960
Besides the Face-and-Heart Burning Curse,

109
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,200
Mu Qingge also placed another curse.

110
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,300
It was to

111
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,650
tie the lifeline of Mount Wester's disciples

112
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,870
to her own.

113
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,120
If she dies tragically,

114
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,320
the descendants of Mount Wester

115
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,720
will suffer the same fate for generations.

116
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,480
Your Mount Wester

117
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,200
has only a few dozen people.

118
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,080
How can she risk the lives of all people?

119
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,550
After Mu Qingge's death,

120
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,640
the Spirit Spring's whereabouts became unknown.

121
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,240
Don't you want to find the Spirit Spring anymore?

122
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,920
If you don't agree,

123
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,640
then I will fight to the death

124
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,700
against all of you.

125
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,550
In 18 years,

126
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,510
you will face the heavenly tribulation.

127
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,080
If Mu Qingge reincarnates,

128
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,790
she can break the curse on Mount Wester

129
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,580
and help you withstand the tribulation.

130
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,200
Do you want to risk death today

131
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,570
or fight for survival in 18 years?

132
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,370
Fine.

133
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,360
Heaven values all life.

134
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,790
I'll agree to your request.

135
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,670
We'll leave this Reincarnation Tree.

136
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,960
When the Reincarnation Tree bears fruit in 18 years,

137
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,230
we will come back to personally oversee it.

138
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,600
Even if Mu Qingge can reincarnate,

139
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,910
we won't give her any chance to do evil.

140
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,130
In 18 years,

141
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,150
I'll come to pick you up.

142
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,120
You're already at the end of your rope.

143
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,510
Why don't you go into seclusion quickly?

144
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,270
There's one more thing she entrusted me with.

145
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,660
[Wangxiang Pass, Cave]

146
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
I originally wanted to seal the Spirit Spring back in the netherworld,

147
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,680
but I found out

148
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,410
only the Demon's child at the stage of Transcendence

149
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,160
could do it.

150
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,310
I could only exhaust my Golden Core

151
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,310
to temporarily seal this source of all demons in the mortal world.

152
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,510
Su Yishui,

153
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,720
if you still

154
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,270
have a sense of gratitude to me,

155
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,480
just promise me one thing.

156
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,640
I've sealed the Spirit Spring at Wangxiang Pass.

157
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,070
Please return it to the netherworld for me.

158
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,640
Where's the Spirit Spring?

159
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,960
Master said she sealed the Spirit Spring here.

160
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,440
Why is it gone?

161
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,280
Are you alright?

162
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,000
I can't sense

163
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,200
any trace of demonic energy.

164
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,270
This indicates that the Spirit Spring

165
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,480
is still well-sealed.

166
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,000
For some unknown reason,

167
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,240
it has been relocated.

168
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,200
In your current state,

169
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,280
you'd better

170
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,440
go into seclusion and recuperate.

171
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,350
Don't end up losing your life

172
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,640
without finding the Spirit Spring.

173
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,680
After 18 years,

174
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,880
how will you protect Master?

175
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,040
[Mount Wester]

176
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,720
With this Reincarnation Tree,

177
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,650
you still need to use half a Golden Core

178
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,200
and a fraction of your soul as a guide

179
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,200
to ensure her safe reincarnation.

180
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,750
Do you know that?

181
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,160
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

182
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,920
But are you willing to

183
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,160
fail her final wish?

184
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,040
Only the Demon's child at the stage of Transcendence

185
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,030
can seal the Spirit Spring back into the netherworld.

186
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,270
But with only nine-tenths of your spiritual sense remaining,

187
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,030
you'll never be able to advance to the stage of Transcendence.

188
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,110
Reviving her or fulfilling her wish,

189
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,750
you can only choose one.

190
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,070
I beg you to grant me a way to achieve both.

191
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,070
A way to achieve both

192
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,240
is nothing more than a temporary solution

193
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,720
in exchange for your suffering.

194
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,790
Please.

195
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,930
My twelve-petaled Ice Lotus

196
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,270
is the purest.

197
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,880
If you use the Ice Lotus to complete the incomplete core,

198
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,310
you should be able to regain the power of Transcendence.

199
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,370
However, to incorporate the Ice Lotus into your technique,

200
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,030
you must cultivate it without emotions.

201
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,240
Otherwise, when your seven emotions are disturbed,

202
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,960
the technique will backfire.

203
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,520
If you experience extreme emotions,

204
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,720
or give up completely to natural impulse,

205
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,350
causing the Ice Lotus Technique to break,

206
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,510
you'll suffer extreme pain.

207
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,550
And then

208
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,640
you'll lose the power of Transcendence.

209
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,720
If you still want to fulfill her wish,

210
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,240
you can only do so

211
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,030
by sacrificing your life to seal the Spirit Spring.

212
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,030
I won't go down

213
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,920
such a desperate path.

214
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,720
Hopefully not.

215
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,070
Remember,

216
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,830
in the future,

217
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,030
Mu Qingge will be a brand new person,

218
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,930
and you, Su Yishui,

219
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,110
will become emotionless.

220
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,550
When you return

221
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,680
in 18 years,

222
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,240
no one will be able to hurt you.

223
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,400
Master put the Face-and-Heart Burning Curse on you

224
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,010
to cover up your Silencing Curse.

225
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,240
She hoped everything would end with her.

226
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,750
If you hadn't sincerely repented

227
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,680
and lived a life worse than death for 18 years,

228
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,240
I certainly wouldn't have forgiven you.

229
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,210
Don't expect any of the other disciples

230
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,430
to treat you kindly.

231
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,720
I don't need that.

232
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,540
Master treated you so differently,

233
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,830
and even died for you,

234
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,690
yet you're still so stubborn.

235
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,720
What's the difference?

236
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,440
If this had happened

237
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
to you back then,

238
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,270
or to any other

239
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,920
disciple,

240
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,830
she would have done the same.

241
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,030
It just happened to be me.

242
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,110
She did it for her own path,

243
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,830
for the greater good of the universe,

244
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,750
for the peaceful and prosperous world

245
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,960
she cherished in her eyes,

246
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,800
and for the benevolent ruler

247
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,030
she believed was more suitable for this land.

248
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,920
But she still died because of me.

249
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
I will never be indebted to her.

250
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,510
You...

251
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,210
[Carefree Pavilion]

252
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,000
What's going on?

253
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,720
It's the Soul-Devouring Lock.

254
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,510
It's the evil magic weapon

255
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,720
that is said to be able to absorb completely

256
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,360
others' spiritual power

257
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,380
until they perish.

258
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,720
How did she

259
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,790
get it inside her?

260
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,590
Who did this?

261
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,480
Who else could it be?

262
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,590
Mu Ranwu.

263
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,160
I thought

264
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,030
she was forced by the Heavenly

265
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,030
to do this.

266
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,920
I didn't expect it was all planned.

267
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,480
It seems she wanted to steal

268
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,570
Mu Qingge's spiritual power.

269
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,240
That's why she entered the formation and lost her life.

270
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,440
Master was her only family.

271
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,960
Moreover, at that time,

272
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,650
Master was so good to her.

273
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,010
How could she do this?

274
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,480
We'll settle her score later.

275
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,680
Let's remove the Soul-Devouring Lock first.

276
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,830
Alright.

277
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,720
I'll try.

278
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,270
What's going on?

279
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,070
I didn't expect that

280
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,590
this Soul-Devouring Lock would merge with her heart

281
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,640
after her reincarnation.

282
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,720
Master's heart is unstable now.

283
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,400
If we rashly remove the lock,

284
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,960
I'm afraid she won't be able to withstand it.

285
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,110
Mu Ranwu will be born

286
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,310
in three months.

287
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,590
Once she advances in the future,

288
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,000
as one rises, the other falls,

289
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,750
Master will surely die.

290
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,830
Then I'll just kill her.

291
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,640
No, you can't.

292
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,270
The Soul-Devouring Lock has bound the two of them

293
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,350
tightly together.

294
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,400
If she dies,

295
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,960
Master will die too.

296
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
Now we can only help Master

297
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,510
increase her spiritual power as quickly as possible.

298
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,070
Stabilize her heart first.

299
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,680
We'll figure out how to remove the lock later.

300
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,830
Fortunately, Master is blessed by heaven.

301
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,720
Although her Five Spirit Roots were taken,

302
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,960
it was a blessing in disguise.

303
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,000
It has been reborn as a Formless Spirit Root

304
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,110
through the Reincarnation Tree.

305
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,160
What are you going to do?

306
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,110
If it weren't for you,

307
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,110
how could Mu Ranwu possibly

308
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,750
have the opportunity?

309
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,200
Master can't stay here.

310
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,510
I'm taking her back to my Tea Inscription Mountain.

311
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,240
Don't you dare!

312
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,830
I'm taking my Master away.

313
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,790
What right do you have to stop me?

314
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,480
If you keep Master here,

315
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,200
what good will it do?

316
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,790
When Master remembers all

317
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,070
in the future,

318
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,680
do you think she will forgive you

319
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,640
for the harm and betrayal

320
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,200
you have done to her?

321
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,480
No matter what she does to you

322
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,510
in the future,

323
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
you'll have to

324
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,960
bear the blood debt you owe alone.

325
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,310
If she doesn't forgive me, so be it.

326
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,830
I'll pay for her with my life.

327
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,510
If she wants to kill me,

328
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
I'll prepare the knife for her.

329
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,750
If she never wants to see me again,

330
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,400
I'll arrange everything for her

331
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,270
and send her away.

332
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,880
I swore that

333
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,410
I would protect her in this life,

334
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,070
and no one, including me,

335
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,790
could hurt her.

336
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,350
Moreover,

337
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,040
I still have some questions

338
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,960
that remain unanswered.

339
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,510
Back then, before the Heavenly siege,

340
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,490
she was already severely injured.

341
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,480
Who hurt her?

342
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,160
And at that time,

343
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,960
if she wanted to carry the Spirit Spring with her,

344
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,040
suppressing the Spirit Spring

345
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,880
wasn't impossible.

346
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,650
Why did she rush to seal it with the Golden Core

347
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,550
and hide it in Wangxiang Pass?

348
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,350
What exactly did she encounter?

349
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,160
There must be something behind this.

350
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,200
I must figure it out.

351
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,680
I must remove this Soul-Devouring Lock.

352
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,240
Work hard.

353
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,920
Complete the task I entrusted to you.

354
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,720
Then, you and I,

355
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,510
for all lifetimes,

356
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,070
shall never meet again.

357
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,590
Every injustice has its perpetrator.

358
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,130
Go look for the one who made you die

359
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,070
beyond recognition.

360
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,400
It's not my fault.

361
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,500
You don't remember anything?

362
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,650
To incorporate the Ice Lotus into your technique,

363
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,400
you must cultivate it without emotions.

364
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,350
Otherwise, when your seven emotions are disturbed,

365
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,000
the technique will backfire.

366
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,650
The Ice Lotus in your body

367
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,960
will turn into ice needles piercing into the bloodstream,

368
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,400
making you feel so painful

369
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,880
that you would rather die.

370
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,580
Don't be obsessive!

371
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,750
Disillusion!

372
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,480
What's wrong?

373
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,350
I can't even criticize you?

374
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,110
What's with your attitude?

375
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,020
You were the one who treated Master badly,

376
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,510
or would she have run away?

377
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,160
You're confused and can't figure out your own feelings.

378
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,480
Why are you torturing her?

379
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,520
Immortal Master, you've misunderstood.

380
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,750
Guardian has never done such things.

381
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,350
Actually,

382
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,510
Guardian is the one bearing everything.

383
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,590
It doesn't hurt much anymore.

384
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,200
Really?

385
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,070
Guardian has always

386
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,200
transferred her cultivation hardships

387
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,480
through immortal techniques.

388
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,550
He just never said anything.

389
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,750
There's no need to say anything to him.

390
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,160
I...

391
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,400
Look.

392
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,310
He's just

393
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,200
too arrogant.

394
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,160
I really don't know how you and Yu Chen

395
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,750
have endured it

396
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,680
all these years.

397
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,310
You're awake.

398
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,270
Go ahead and ask whatever you want.

399
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,310
Why did I become like that

400
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,270
after I left the mountain?

401
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,110
What does it have to do with this branch?

402
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,830
You were born prematurely,

403
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,930
weak from birth.

404
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,110
Even your heart,

405
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,590
the source of life, was unstable.

406
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,260
That's why your life was in danger.

407
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,750
So

408
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,400
your master brought back

409
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,830
this branch from the Reincarnation Tree

410
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,550
to connect with your heart,

411
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,350
providing you with life-sustaining spiritual power.

412
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,960
If you're too far from the branch,

413
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,920
the spiritual power will be insufficient,

414
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,680
and your life will be in danger.

415
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,680
Keeping you on the mountain to practice

416
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,480
was also to help stabilize your heart.

417
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,580
Ranran, don't be afraid.

418
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,350
I am your

419
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,640
Fourteenth Senior.

420
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,280
My name is

421
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,920
Zeng Yi.

422
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,410
With me here,

423
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,310
on this mountain,

424
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,750
no one can bully you.

425
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,820
Fourteenth Senior.

426
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,350
What are you looking at?

427
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,710
There's no thunder here.

428
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,890
I mean

429
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,550
the weather today

430
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,440
is nice.

431
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,350
I see.

432
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,200
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

433
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,480
How could I have known

434
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,590
you would be so ridiculous

435
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,070
to think I wanted to eat you?

436
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,360
That's your problem.

437
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,510
You're always looking so fierce,

438
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,400
no wonder you scared Ranran away.

439
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,660
The misunderstanding earlier

440
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,720
was my fault.

441
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,070
But I still don't understand.

442
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,240
You and I met by chance.

443
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,620
Why are you taking such good care of me?

444
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,480
He owes it to someone else.

445
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,160
He should do this.

446
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,790
Owes it to someone else?

447
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,890
Could it be my parents?

448
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,110
No.

449
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,440
Then who is it?

450
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,550
Could it be Master's friend?

451
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,830
-Yes.
-No.

452
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,240
I understand.

453
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,830
If that's the case,

454
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,590
then thank you, Master,

455
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,640
for taking care of me.

456
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,160
You want to stay?

457
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,000
Since I can only survive

458
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,000
by staying and practicing on Mount Wester,

459
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,960
then I'll practice.

460
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,510
Although Master didn't make it clear today,

461
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,200
he has saved me many times.

462
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,790
I believe he won't harm me.

463
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,110
When he's ready to tell me,

464
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,420
it won't be too late.

465
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,640
Carry it with you from now on

466
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,200
to prevent any more accidents.

467
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,160
Although the Reincarnation Tree is good,

468
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,200
its spiritual power will eventually be depleted.

469
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
If you want to stay alive,

470
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,350
you still need to practice diligently.

471
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:53,830
I understand.

472
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:55,750
Oh, right.

473
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,310
I have something to confess.

474
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,070
When I came up the mountain before,

475
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,070
I had my own plan.

476
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,350
I wanted to save my friend.

477
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,680
Your friend?

478
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,790
It's a fragment of a divine soul.

479
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,880
It's been away from its master for too long and is close to death.

480
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,650
It's said that only Liang Wumeng

481
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,240
can save it by using the Blood Chalcedony.

482
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,270
That's why

483
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,920
I took your Blood Chalcedony.

484
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,610
Just for this thing,

485
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,760
you're willing to risk your life?

486
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,110
Do you value your life so little?

487
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,630
What are you doing?

488
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,790
Mind your attitude.

489
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,400
Ranran has just recovered.

490
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,310
Since I can remember,

491
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,070
Ling Xiao has always protected me.

492
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,510
It's my most important friend.

493
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,400
I can't stand by and watch it die.

494
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,510
So you came down the mountain

495
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,550
to save this divine soul.

496
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,830
What a bad fate!

497
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,270
Once I find Liang Wumeng

498
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,480
and save Ling Xiao,

499
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,510
I promise to focus on

500
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,750
cultivation on the mountain.

501
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,200
As for your Blood Chalcedony,

502
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,070
I'll find a new one

503
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,920
to replace it for you.

504
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:00,880
Is that okay?

505
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,670
[Liang Wumeng's residence]

506
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,450
This is

507
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,510
Liang Wumeng's residence?

508
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,680
That's right.

509
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,750
Sorry.

510
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Master is currently in seclusion

511
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,260
and cannot receive visitors.

512
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,850
Then when will he

513
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,750
come out of seclusion?

514
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,280
Master is advancing in power

515
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,590
at a critical moment.

516
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,840
Two years, at most.

517
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
One year, at least.

518
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,510
It all depends.

519
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,110
One or two years?

520
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,200
Can it hold on

521
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,200
until then?

522
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,040
If there is more Blood Chalcedony

523
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,960
to nourish this divine soul,

524
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,310
it might last until Master comes out of seclusion.

525
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,510
Blood Chalcedony

526
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,030
is a rare spiritual treasure in the world.

527
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,720
Finding one piece is already difficult.

528
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,720
Where can I get

529
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,960
more Blood Chalcedony?

530
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,000
The key to Blood Chalcedony's ability

531
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,550
to nourish divine souls

532
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,400
is that it can simultaneously integrate

533
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,480
the five spiritual energies.

534
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,000
However,

535
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,370
in the cultivation world, there's another

536
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,960
extremely rare thing,

537
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,190
namely Formless Spirit Root.

538
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,110
It can encompass all five Spirit Roots,

539
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,570
cultivating one to gain five.

540
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,040
It's even better at nourishing divine souls than Blood Chalcedony.

541
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,280
The Formless Spirit Root is that powerful?

542
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,540
It can even nourish divine souls?

543
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,920
However,

544
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,800
Blood Chalcedony is hard to find,

545
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,480
and the Formless Spirit Root is even rarer.

546
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,960
I wish you good luck.

547
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,230
Farewell.

548
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,630
Master,

549
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,190
Ling Xiao can be saved!

550
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,960
[Auspicious and peaceful]

551
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,840
It's all happening.

552
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,920
It turns out that your Formless Spirit Root

553
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,010
can also nourish divine souls.

554
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,560
I've connected Ling Xiao

555
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,000
to your Formless Spirit Root.

556
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,330
From now on, you can use your Spirit Root

557
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,190
to nourish the divine soul.

558
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,630
In this way,

559
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,630
even if we can't find the soul master right away,

560
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,550
it won't be a big problem.

561
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,190
If you want it to regain vitality,

562
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,030
you need to improve your cultivation quickly.

563
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,480
While waiting for Liang Wumeng

564
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,760
to come out of seclusion,

565
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,280
Ranran, you should start cultivating first.

566
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,440
But remember,

567
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,410
don't let others know about

568
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,230
your Formless Spirit Root.

569
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,000
I will definitely practice diligently,

570
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,550
whether I'm baked by the scorching sun,

571
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,440
soaked in ice water,

572
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,710
or starving from fasting.

573
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,030
I will take it all seriously.

574
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,230
How can that be?

575
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,190
How can we let you...

576
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,970
As a master,

577
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,960
how can you be so cruel?

578
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,070
That's a pretty

579
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,370
extreme way of training.

580
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,250
Back then, Master

581
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,480
taught me the same way, didn't she?

582
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,840
Nonsense!

583
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,470
Master never tortured you!

584
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,280
It was because you were so unruly

585
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,400
that Master had no choice

586
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,320
but to use both soft and hard approaches.

587
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,970
Do you dare say her teachings

588
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,800
weren't thoughtful enough

589
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,710
or effective enough?

590
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,850
Look,

591
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,360
being a master is not that easy.

592
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,190
You need to pay attention to the methods.

593
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,440
You're still far from it.

594
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,400
Think it over carefully.

595
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,630
It seems that

596
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,480
the relationship between Master and Founder Mu

597
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,230
is not as bad as

598
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,630
it is said to be.

599
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,760
So,

600
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,330
your guidance for Ranran

601
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,250
should follow

602
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
our Mount Wester's principles:

603
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,880
teach according to one's aptitude,

604
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,070
and prioritize happiness.

605
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,510
In this world,

606
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,920
is there really such a thing as happy immortal cultivation?

607
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,710
Of course.

608
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,030
At Mount Wester,

609
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,400
as long as you don't violate the sect rules,

610
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,710
no one can control you.

611
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,480
Really?

612
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,190
As long as you can complete your tasks,

613
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,590
everything else is up to you.

614
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,480
Thank you, Master.

615
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,800
I promise I won't be lazy.

616
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,320
However,

617
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,080
I only want to practice until I can protect myself

618
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,190
and my friends.

619
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,000
As for attaining ascension and becoming an immortal,

620
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,230
or advancing to become a great cultivator,

621
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,400
I'm not interested.

622
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,840
I still prefer

623
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,150
the lively mortal life.

624
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,440
Is that okay?

625
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,630
Great!

626
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,070
I'll go make some delicious food right away.

627
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,030
Master,

628
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,000
you can try my cooking.

629
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,800
Your body is in such a condition,

630
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,030
and you're still thinking about food?

631
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,610
Even if it's

632
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,440
the last day of life,

633
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,710
one should still eat and drink well.

634
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,030
I, Xue Ranran,

635
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,380
have always believed in

636
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,290
being low-key in life

637
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,070
but high-key in dining.

638
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,230
Only in this way

639
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,190
can I live up to my life.

640
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,440
Master,

641
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,510
what do you think?

642
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,320
Do as you please.

643
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,030
But I've already abstained from grains.

644
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,290
These worldly things

645
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,150
don't interest me.

646
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,110
Don't count me in.

647
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,120
He won't eat,

648
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,280
but I didn't say I wouldn't.

649
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,030
He is

650
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,320
such a killjoy.

651
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,480
Just ignore him.

652
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,590
Senior,

653
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,040
we met too late.

654
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:33,840
No.

655
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:34,480
It's not late.

656
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,190
Not late at all.

657
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,840
Then I'll go cooking.

658
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,360
After Liang Wumeng comes out of seclusion,

659
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,480
Ranran

660
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,400
will remember everything.

661
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,030
You might not be able

662
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,190
to get your soul back.

663
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,440
That's just a pretext

664
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,510
to urge her to practice.

665
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,550
I didn't expect her to give it back.

666
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,070
But without this fragment of soul,

667
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,550
you won't be able to repair your Golden Core.

668
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,590
You'll be forever cut off from the Transcendence Realm,

669
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,480
only able to maintain your power through the Ice Lotus Technique.

670
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,150
Isn't that a pity?

671
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,280
Su Yishui

672
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,190
has successfully brought back Xue Ranran.

673
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,510
Wei Jiu is still not satisfied

674
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,330
and has sent disciples to search everywhere.

675
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,510
It seems

676
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,600
he won't give up easily.

677
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,110
Just as you predicted,

678
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,640
only Xue Ranran

679
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,710
can stir up this storm.

680
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,840
The day we're waiting for

681
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,230
isn't far off.

682
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,370
[Mount Wester]

683
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,150
Ranran,

684
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,110
I didn't expect that this time

685
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,340
you'd run down the mountain and come back,

686
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,000
and even make Master

687
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,870
break our fast.

688
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,360
You can still laugh about it?

689
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,590
Listen.

690
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,760
It doesn't matter

691
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,920
if you give up halfway yourself,

692
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,920
but don't ruin our reputation.

693
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,310
You're right.

694
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
It was my fault.

695
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,480
I'll make some delicious food

696
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,590
to apologize to everyone.

697
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,080
But eating

698
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,590
will amplify the desire for food,

699
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,760
which is not good for self-cultivation.

700
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,250
In this world,

701
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,550
how can one be without desires?

702
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:28,800
Even cultivating to attain ascension

703
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,840
is a kind of desire.

704
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,440
Senior.

705
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:32,880
Don't be so formal.

706
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,640
Rather than being pretentious

707
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,480
and forcing growth,

708
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:36,970
it's better to follow one's nature

709
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,880
and guide accordingly.

710
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,670
This is the true principle

711
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,110
of our Wester Sect.

712
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,150
Yes. You're right.

713
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,360
Ranran.

714
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,330
This is

715
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,760
an invulnerable golden silk armor.

716
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,190
Thank you for the gift, Senior Zeng.

717
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,280
Thank you, Senior.

718
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,250
-Thank you, Senior.
-Thank you, Senior.

719
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,030
It's nothing.

720
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,670
Don't mention it.

721
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,360
Sit down.

722
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,550
Sit. Sit down.

723
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,510
Sit.

724
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,960
Today,

725
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,670
I finally get to meet Senior Zeng.

726
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,510
Your hands

727
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,840
are truly skillful.

728
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,710
That's all in the past.

729
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,000
Things are different now.

730
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,190
Rumour has it that

731
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,360
you hurt your hand

732
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,070
because of Founder Mu.

733
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,510
Is that true?

734
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,810
Well, it's just a rumor.

735
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,360
As rumors spread,

736
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,380
they will go unheard,

737
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,030
right?

738
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,400
The demoness is dead.

739
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,530
Wester Sect has been destroyed.

740
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,110
What are you still stubbornly holding onto?

741
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,000
Why not join our Qingcheng Sect instead?

742
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,590
At least you'll have some protection.

743
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,320
That sounds nice,

744
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,230
but aren't you just trying to kidnap me

745
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,230
to help you make spiritual weapons?

746
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,490
I will never betray Wester Sect.

747
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
I won't betray my master.

748
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,190
Fine.

749
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,360
Since you refuse to

750
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,440
serve us with your hands,

751
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,440
we won't let other Heavenly Sects benefit from them either.

752
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,550
Later on,

753
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,930
thankfully, your master

754
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,110
arrived in time to save me.

755
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,700
It's all in the past.

756
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,960
Hurry. The food is getting cold.

757
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,360
Eat quickly.

758
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,510
Eat.

759
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,000
Alright.

760
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,030
Let's try Ranran's cooking.

761
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,230
-Senior.
-Senior.

762
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,630
Guardian specifically sent me down the mountain

763
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,400
to buy some wine.

764
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,400
He was afraid that you wouldn't have enough to drink,

765
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
so he asked me to bring it to you.

766
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,630
Yu Tong, you've come at the right time.

767
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,480
Come on, sit down with us

768
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,670
and try Ranran's cooking.

769
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,590
Come on.

770
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,510
Sit down. Let's eat together.

771
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,690
Sit. Senior.

772
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,800
Let's eat together.

773
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,550
It smells so good.

774
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,070
It's been too long

775
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,400
since I smelled such delicious food here.

776
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,550
Why don't we call Senior Yu Chen

777
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,280
to join us?

778
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,110
No need.

779
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,040
My brother has always looked up to Guardian

780
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:51,670
as a role model.

781
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,710
Guardian abstains from food,

782
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,900
so he won't eat either.

783
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,320
Look.

784
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,380
Poor Yu Chen.

785
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,280
Of all people to imitate,

786
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,320
he had to choose Su, that cold fish.

787
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,230
It's a pity that

788
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,510
he can't try Ranran's good cooking,

789
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,440
right?

790
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,400
Just leave them alone.

791
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,120
Let's drink.

792
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,550
Okay.

793
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,840
Everyone, please try my cooking.

794
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,670
Alright.

795
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,280
Here! Xi'er.

796
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,550
It's delicious.

797
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,000
I thought

798
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,340
when you came back to life,

799
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,560
you would immediately reclaim everything

800
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,670
and all grudges would be settled.

801
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,360
I never expected

802
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,000
we would have a chance to be together like this.

803
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,230
When you know the truth,

804
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,570
will you do

805
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,760
as you said,

806
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,960
for all lifetimes,

807
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,320
you and I shall never meet again?

808
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,070
I have another specialty dish.

809
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,640
Wait for me.

810
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,150
Just a moment.

811
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,440
Enough.

812
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,280
Master

813
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,500
looks so lonely.
