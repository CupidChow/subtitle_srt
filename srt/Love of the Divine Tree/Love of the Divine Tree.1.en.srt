00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,970
her ordinary sister was also

193
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,030
by her side.

194
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,670
That unlucky girl must've been

195
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:21,970
dragged into

196
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
this Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Curse

197
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,390
and then reborn

198
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,270
through Su Yishui's help

199
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,550
by some stroke of luck.

200
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,720
Is Mu Qingge

201
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,300
the one that fell off

202
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,470
or the one on the Tree?

203
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,360
It fell before it was ripe,

204
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,560
[Tu Jiuyuan, Elder of Scarlet Sect]

205
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,200
so it must be someone inept.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,390
Mu Qingge is extraordinarily gifted,

207
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,150
so she must be the one on the Tree.

208
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,410
Not necessarily.

209
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,630
[Su Yishui, Sovereign of Wester Sect]

210
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,430
Su Yishui.

211
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,240
You sealed your five senses

212
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,320
and cultivated the Unfeeling Mantra for 18 years.

213
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,750
It's near completion.

214
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,840
You used half of the Ice Lotus to rebuild your Golden Core

215
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,630
and just entered the Transcendence Realm.

216
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,600
You'll be stable in about a month.

217
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,140
Why did you forcefully stop it now?

218
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,350
-Congrats on your completion, Guardian.
-Congrats on your completion, Guardian.

219
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,670
Rise.

220
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,090
[Yu Tong] [Yu Chen]

221
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,090
[Trusted servants of Su Yishui]

222
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,910
-Yes.
-Yes.

223
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,030
Mount Absolute's in trouble.

224
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,880
No matter who's the one that fell,

225
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,660
find her.

226
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,520
How could a Reincarnation Fruit fall prematurely?

227
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,560
That demoness is impossibly evil.

228
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,080
She didn't even spare her own sister

229
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,360
and squeezed her down the Tree?

230
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,000
If Wei Jiu catches her...

231
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,440
It's not her.

232
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,480
Ranran!

233
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,790
Ranran, you know what?

234
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,120
The customer at Table A

235
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,630
is really hard to serve.

236
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,000
But he's full of praise

237
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,230
for your cooking.

238
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,440
What's wrong?

239
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,030
Still worrying about Ling Xiao?

240
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,100
Have you saved up enough money

241
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,080
and plan on bringing

242
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Ling Xiao to see a doctor?

243
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,550
None of the villagers

244
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,440
have ever seen any Heavenly Ones.

245
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,550
I bet

246
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,630
there's someone

247
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,300
who has the answer I want.

248
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,910
Someone?

249
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,240
Don't you mean Young Master Yu?

250
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,410
Let's see...

251
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,510
It’s about time

252
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,440
he arrives for some wine.

253
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,320
Every time he comes,

254
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,510
he'd just order this wine.

255
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,550
He said it tastes similar

256
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,880
to a wine his old friend likes.

257
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,510
But every batch I made

258
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,910
missed the mark just a bit.

259
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,720
I've tweaked the recipe endlessly this year.

260
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,870
I hope he'll like it.

261
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,720
Young Master Yu.

262
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,600
Every time you're here,

263
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,000
you look at the mountain far away.

264
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,960
What is on that mountain?

265
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,390
Someone who doesn't return.

266
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,000
Is it the friend

267
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,510
you mentioned who likes drinking?

268
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,680
[Su Yu, Crown Prince]

269
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,000
By the way,

270
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,110
in this year's batch of wine,

271
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,100
I added some bamboo leaves and smoked plums.

272
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,000
See if it

273
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,930
tastes like

274
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,270
the Mistaken Divine your friend loves.

275
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,380
There are eight villages and three towns down Mount Absolute.

276
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,710
This is the last village.

277
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,640
Keep it down.

278
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,560
Don't alarm the Heavenly Ones nearby.

279
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,400
He was born in the Year of Qinggeng.

280
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,150
Seize him.

281
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,650
Young Master!

282
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,030
Demons?

283
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,510
Someone was caught by demons!

284
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:11,910
Demons!

285
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,810
Someone was caught by demons!

286
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,480
Someone was caught by demons!

287
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,310
Someone was caught by demons!

288
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,720
Cui!

289
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:30,870
Cui!

290
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,670
Ling Xiao.

291
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,150
Is this a demon

292
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,390
the storyteller talks about?

293
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,030
Cui!

294
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,440
Cui!

295
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,550
Cui!

296
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,040
Could it be...

297
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,930
You don't need power

298
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,120
to use these talismans that Feng

299
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,290
infused with power.

300
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,630
In danger,

301
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,150
they might help you.

302
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,910
This should be the Tracking Talisman.

303
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,030
Track this wine's smell

304
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,750
and find Cui.

305
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,160
Track this wine's smell—

306
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,720
One of you

307
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,890
can

308
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,690
help our sovereign cultivate.

309
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,349
If we can't find her,

310
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,589
you'll all become

311
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,030
the ashes of the Scarlet Sect!

312
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,400
None of them are?

313
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,550
I'm confused.

314
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,160
Every one born in the Year of Qinggeng

315
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,560
in the village chief's records

316
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,310
are here.

317
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,440
Who's the village chief?

318
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,240
It... It's me.

319
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,640
Where are the other Year-of-Qinggeng births?

320
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,310
T-There's no one else.

321
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,310
That's all?

322
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,160
Do you know how many steps it takes for a demon

323
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,070
to cultivate a Mortal Core?

324
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,720
You'll be tempered in fire,

325
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,310
marinated in demonic herbs,

326
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,550
frozen when plump,

327
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,940
and then have your Spirit Roots removed.

328
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,920
Finally,

329
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,750
you'll be thrown into the furnace

330
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,070
and tempered into a Tonic Core.

331
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,400
I know!

332
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,000
There's one more.

333
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,680
I know who

334
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,620
you're looking for.

335
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,070
Who?

336
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,030
She's an orphan.

337
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,460
She even has

338
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,880
a moving vine.

339
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,620
You must be looking for her.

340
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,880
I can take you to her.

341
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,100
L-Let me go.

342
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,440
Are you teaching me what to do?

343
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,200
No.

344
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,890
I've to go to town

345
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,350
to find Mr. Yu’s immortal master

346
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,030
to save them.

347
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,750
Who's there?

348
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,550
Leave! Leave!

349
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,440
I'm afraid premature Fruits

350
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,340
are neither fully in the Yin or Yang Realms

351
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,230
and have unstable souls.

352
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,790
I won’t let you escape.

353
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,070
What's going on?

354
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,750
Go.

355
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,880
Get her back here.

356
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,880
Yes.

357
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,000
Shoo, evil spirit!

358
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,990
Are you afraid of me?

359
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,930
Oh no.

360
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,760
This evil spirit is so powerful.

361
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,350
Every injustice has its perpetrator.

362
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,070
Go look for the one who made you die

363
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,020
beyond recognition.

364
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,510
It's not my fault.

365
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,680
You don't remember anything?

366
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,170
Su Yishui of Wester Sect?

367
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,070
You treacherous loser.

368
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,070
How dare you

369
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,350
steal for someone with us

370
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,210
with a face full of shameful marks?

371
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,240
Since you recognized me,

372
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,830
-you must die.
-Scarlet Sect?

373
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,000
Su Yishui?

374
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,930
Is he the heartless one

375
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,470
in the storyteller's story

376
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,790
who even killed

377
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,310
his own master?

378
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,400
Isn't that scarier than evil spirits?

379
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,640
Well...

380
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,110
Sorry for offending you.

381
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,830
I need to find an immortal master to save the people.

382
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,270
Goodbye.

383
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,940
The demonic energy invaded her bones?

384
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,030
Ling Xiao, come back!

385
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,920
It hurts...

386
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,310
What are you doing?

387
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,070
It hurts...

388
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,270
She actually has a broken heart.

389
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,160
Guardian, she's lucky you disguised her appearance

390
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,040
[Ranran's home, Xue Village]

391
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,750
so the Scarlet Sect didn't get her.

392
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,830
I thought you

393
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,030
sacrificing half of your Golden Core

394
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,200
to revive that demoness

395
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,070
would lift

396
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,270
the curses on you and Wester Sect.

397
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,400
I never imagined

398
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,440
that she'd be reborn

399
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,400
with an Incomplete Spirit Root

400
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,760
who can't even withstand

401
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,110
this little demonic energy from a secondary beast.

402
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,400
She fell off the Tree

403
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,510
before being fully

404
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,680
nourished,

405
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,200
so her heart's broken.

406
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,920
It's a sign of premature aging.

407
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,480
She is lucky that she's lived

408
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,310
until now.

409
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,240
If she dies,

410
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,310
who can lift your curse?

411
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,180
How about infusing her with power?

412
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,160
I tried.

413
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,160
I can't access her heart.

414
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,400
Could it be that

415
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,180
since she was your master in her previous life

416
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,400
and your master-disciple pact

417
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,720
was carried on to her next life,

418
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,790
so you're not allowed access

419
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,790
into her heart?

420
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,150
The master-disciple pact is a blood pact.

421
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,110
It can only be suppressed with another

422
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,680
blood pact.

423
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,920
Of the six pacts, the master-disciple pact is superior

424
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,300
and never to be broken.

425
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,790
In this world,

426
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,760
what other blood pact

427
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,030
could override it?

428
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,110
There's one.

429
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,000
Another master-disciple pact.

430
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,440
Wait.

431
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,880
You want to...

432
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,030
Take her as my disciple

433
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,680
to nullify the original pact.

434
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:38,960
Guardian.

435
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,750
Becoming the master of your master?

436
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,830
It's such a bold

437
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,880
and creative...

438
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,230
and deviant method.

439
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,030
Guardian.

440
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,590
Why don't you reconsider it?

441
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,280
There hasn't been such a precedent

442
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,070
in the cultivation world.

443
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,310
You've to endure the pressure of the laws of nature.

444
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,720
I doubt you'd even be

445
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,790
able to defy her.

446
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,030
Besides,

447
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,310
a lot goes into

448
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,530
being a master.

449
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,960
You've never been a master.

450
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,110
Can you do it?

451
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:12,920
Is it that hard?

452
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,270
Since you've decided,

453
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,580
let's return to Mount Wester

454
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,550
and make it happen.

455
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,550
Not yet.

456
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,160
Her Fruit fell prematurely.

457
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,350
She'll die instantly

458
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,610
when she's too far from the Tree.

459
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,920
She has never left Mount Absolute.

460
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,000
Go to Mount Absolute

461
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,200
and break off a branch from the Tree.

462
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,160
One more thing.

463
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,490
I can't confront Wei Jiu directly.

464
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,200
Inform the Four Sects.

465
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,350
Got it.

466
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,310
Xue Ranran's Spirit Root is incomplete,

467
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,920
but it's actually formless.

468
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,070
She's like

469
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,070
an Immortal Fruit.

470
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,640
We mustn't let the Scarlet Sect get her.

471
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,730
Formless Spirit Root?

472
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,310
Immortal Fruit?

473
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,790
She must stay in Mount Wester.

474
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:46,960
Go on.

475
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,420
Yes.

476
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,680
So he didn't save me by accident.

477
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,750
He's been targeting me.

478
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,880
Just like the demonic cultivators,

479
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,240
the Westers want to eat me!

480
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:04,960
You're awake.

481
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,320
Why are his face tattoos

482
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,200
gone?

483
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,680
What's wrong?

484
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,680
Do I look very scary?

485
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,090
No, no.

486
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,790
Your profile is

487
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,590
so gorgeous that I can't take my eyes off you.

488
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,790
It's far from being scary.

489
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:25,880
Really?

490
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,330
It's rare that someone's not afraid

491
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,680
of my true face.

492
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,200
It must be fate.

493
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
I'll take you as my disciple.

494
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:33,920
No, no.

495
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,840
I have something urgent to attend to.

496
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,520
You must've got the wrong person.

497
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,270
It's definitely you.

498
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,540
Born on September 9 in the Year of Qinggeng.

499
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,550
You had a plum blossom mole on your face,

500
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,850
which disappeared when you were five.

501
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,830
You're destined with the Wester Sect.

502
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,880
You're great at reading fortunes, huh?

503
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,790
But the immortal path is too elusive.

504
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,190
It's not the life I want.

505
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,550
If you don't go up the mountain with me,

506
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,240
you'll die of heart failure soon.

507
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,160
Trying to scare me, huh?

508
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,350
That's my fate then.

509
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,960
You don't have to worry about it.

510
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,240
Your life is mine.

511
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,750
If I don't let you die,

512
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,780
you can't die.

513
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,680
Why are you forcing me?

514
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,830
It's a Wester tradition to force apprenticeship.

515
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,030
Back in the days,

516
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,960
my master did the same.

517
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,590
Is it that odd?

518
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,160
Aren't you a righteous sect?

519
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,550
Who said Mount Wester is a righteous sect?

520
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,750
The Westers only follow their own way.

521
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,350
Whether it's righteous or evil,

522
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,350
we do as we will.

523
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,720
This is the jade tablet of Wester disciples.

524
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,030
You have to drop your blood into it

525
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,740
and perform

526
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,240
an apprenticeship ceremony.

527
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,030
No thanks...

528
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,160
The fortune teller

529
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
said I'm born a jinx to my family

530
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,880
and teachers.

531
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,310
It's for your own good.

532
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,440
Kneel and take me as your master.

533
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,880
What's wrong with you?

534
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,270
How can you get others to kneel?

535
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,550
Will you kneel if I ask you to?

536
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,660
Sov... Sovereign Su.

537
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,750
Why are you really on your knees?

538
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,230
I wasn't serious.

539
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,480
The jade tablet is the Westers' sacred object.

540
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,550
Are there still

541
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,750
remnants of Mu Qingge's authority?

542
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,270
Go out!

543
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,000
My Lord!

544
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,920
We have help.

545
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Okay.

546
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,480
Let's see how long you can hide.

547
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Her authority is really hard to overcome.

548
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,040
The jade tablet

549
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,240
is really something.

550
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,200
It's like it can control Su Yishui.

551
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:50,920
Right!

552
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,100
Maybe it could

553
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,510
command him to save the people.

554
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:55,960
Su Yishui.

555
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,640
Go and save the people—

556
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,510
You can leave.

557
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
But I guess

558
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,510
that within 15 minutes,

559
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,080
Wei Jiu will turn your friends

560
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,160
into a pillar of smoke.

561
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,590
Immortal Master.

562
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,190
Please save them.

563
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,640
Then first,

564
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,000
take me as your master.

565
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,070
Immortal Master.

566
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,070
You look like a righteous man.

567
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,440
You won't just let them die.

568
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,650
Come to think of it,

569
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,480
the Wester Sect is better than Scarlet Sect.

570
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,240
As long as

571
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
you save my friends,

572
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,550
I could become your disciple.

573
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,030
Right, Master?

574
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,640
You have no parents

575
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,890
and no one to rely on,

576
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,200
yet you bother to stand up for them?

577
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,880
I'm indebted

578
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,240
to every family here.

579
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,070
I can't ignore them.

580
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,920
It's a deal.

581
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,350
It's a promise:

582
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:54,570
I'll be your disciple,

583
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,550
and you'll save them.

584
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,200
Master.

585
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,270
Put your hand on it

586
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,480
and make a soul oath.

587
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
As long as you

588
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,480
personally save my friends,

589
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,200
I'll be willing to be your disciple.

590
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,340
If I break my promise,

591
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,270
my mortal body

592
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,160
will disintegrate.

593
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,110
Pour me some tea

594
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,410
and then get registered at Mount Wester,

595
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,350
and we'll be done.

596
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,590
Help!

597
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,680
Thank goodness for

598
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,700
the talisman from Mr. Yu.

599
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,720
Trying to trick me?

600
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,590
Since you want to be a coward,

601
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,550
I'll provoke you to battle.

602
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,350
Using your brainpower

603
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,110
on such trifling tricks?

604
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,070
A talisman from the Imperial Exotic Pavilion?

605
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,030
Su Yu must also be nearby.

606
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,960
Why would he…

607
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,860
Chase him!

608
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,160
Wei Jiu,

609
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,790
trespassing the Crown Prince's bedchamber?

610
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,400
You've got some nerve.

611
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,920
Are you intent

612
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,320
[Feng, immortal master]

613
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,550
on going against Exotic Pavilion?

614
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,790
Exotic Pavilion?

615
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,120
I have zero regard

616
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,140
for it.

617
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,790
However,

618
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,480
someone lured disaster to the east.

619
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,680
I don’t want to be made a fool.

620
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,440
My Lord, bad news.

621
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,240
The sovereigns of the Four Sects are here.

622
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,110
These old foxes

623
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,830
sure are easily alerted.

624
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,350
Retreat.

625
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,240
Ling Xiao!

626
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,750
Ling Xiao!

627
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,960
Ling Xiao!

628
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,920
Ling Xiao!

629
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,640
Ling Xiao!

630
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,270
S-Sovereign Su.

631
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,270
You're so fast.

632
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,640
I didn't want to

633
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,760
miss out on the tea

634
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,650
from my dear disciple.

635
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,480
Am I right?

636
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,720
Although you distracted the demons away...

637
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,200
you didn't save the people personally.

638
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,880
Is that so?

639
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,790
You left in a hurry

640
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,590
and forgot about this.

641
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,880
Ling Xiao.

642
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,680
Give it back!

643
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,200
Move aside!

644
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
The Blood Chalcedony

645
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,540
[Blood Chalcedony drawing]

646
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,640
is great for nourishing the soul.

647
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,970
That Blood Chalcedony can save Ling Xiao.

648
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,640
If I save it,

649
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:05,610
does it count as

650
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,680
me personally saving your friend?

651
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,920
Yes.

652
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,030
Don't hurt it.

653
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,030
To save Ling Xiao,

654
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,040
even if

655
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,320
Mount Wester is perilous,

656
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,590
I've to give it a try.

657
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,360
You are so powerful.

658
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,070
I won't run away.

659
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,000
I'll be your disciple.

660
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:30,510
[Mount Wester]

661
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:49,270
[Mu Qingge, founder of Wester Sect]

662
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,360
This is my Mount Wester.

663
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,000
Remember the route.

664
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,190
Once I get it,

665
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,230
I'll flee.

666
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,480
What's on your mind?

667
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,810
Master, you told me

668
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,960
Mount Wester is beautiful

669
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,820
with a pleasant climate.

670
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,180
Since I can cultivate here,

671
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,120
I feel carefree, jubilant,

672
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,150
truly blessed,

673
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,070
and content.

674
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,250
Your blood is in the jade tablet.

675
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,960
No matter where you go, I'll be able to find you.

676
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,590
Don't think about fleeing.

677
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,150
You'll die if you leave Mount Wester.

678
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,030
Threatening me, huh?

679
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,110
Guardian.

680
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,950
Yu Chen told me in a letter

681
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,280
that you personally took in a disciple.

682
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,000
This is that

683
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,000
Xue Ranran?

684
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,230
Settle her in.

685
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,680
[Grand Hall]

686
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,360
This spirit stone can identify your Spirit Roots.

687
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,820
Your elemental Roots determine your cultivation gift.

688
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,130
The more you have,

689
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,660
the more gifted you are.

690
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,110
Test it out.

691
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,830
I'll go prepare the apprenticeship ceremony.

692
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,510
I'm Bai Baishan

693
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,360
from a family of immortal cultivators.

694
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,010
[Bai Baishan]

695
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,070
I've already been tested.

696
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,560
Gold and Water;

697
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,360
two Spirit Roots.

698
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,380
I'm Gao Cang

699
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,210
[Gao Cang]

700
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,240
with an Earth Root.

701
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,480
My family's acquainted with Master,

702
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,070
so despite my low qualifications,

703
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,800
he still took me in.

704
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,530
[Qiu Xi'er]

705
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,250
I have a Fire Spirit Root.

706
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,000
I'm Qiu Xi'er.

707
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,400
You must be Ranran.

708
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,590
I heard about another lady

709
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,230
joining

710
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,960
upon entering.

711
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,190
Were you all

712
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,400
taken here by force too?

713
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:42,550
What?

714
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,320
By force?

715
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,480
It's the first time Master is taking disciples.

716
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,730
Everyone was

717
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,320
busy vying for a spot.

718
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,350
What?

719
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,950
Could it be...

720
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,440
you are extraordinary

721
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,090
and have all Five Spirit Roots,

722
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,770
so Master was desperate for you?

723
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,920
Incomplete Spirit Root?

724
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,800
Not even one?

725
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,440
A loser who's born incompetent

726
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,180
and won't amount to much even with hard work.

727
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,440
How in the world

728
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,510
did you get

729
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,110
Master to take you in?

730
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,760
Are you curious?

731
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,070
Why don't you ask Master yourself?

732
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,430
It's time for the apprenticeship ceremony.

733
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,400
Let's go. Come on.

734
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,070
Yeah, come on.

735
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,280
Look.

736
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,230
The rules are here.

737
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,920
You should always dress up

738
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,010
and look good...

739
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,990
to please...

740
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,480
the Master?

741
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,630
Don't be promiscuous,

742
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
but more importantly,

743
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,710
don't be indifferent?

744
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,840
You should study more about playing.

745
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,220
Don't stay in the cave—

746
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,880
Don't stay in the cave cultivating?

747
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,740
I've only heard the Heavenly Sects advocate

748
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,720
detachment.

749
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,510
These rules are quite interesting.

750
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,150
Can you do it?

751
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,480
Such rules

752
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,450
made my eyes light up

753
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,360
and spoke to my heart.

754
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,510
I'll try my best to adhere to them.

755
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,840
How about

756
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,590
I wear a beautiful dress tomorrow

757
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,190
to look good to please you?

758
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,750
Every rule is illogical and absurd.

759
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,060
Can't you tell?

760
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:42,880
These rules

761
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,760
were left by Mu Qingge in the past.

762
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,550
Don't abide by any of them.

763
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,480
Drop your blood into the jade tablet,

764
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,400
serve Master tea,

765
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,480
and get registered in the sect's records.

766
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,800
Then it'll be official.

767
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,960
Let's start with the most powerful,

768
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,320
according to

769
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,280
your Spirit Roots.

770
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,280
Greet your master and serve tea.

771
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,330
Master.

772
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,800
The ceremony is completed.

773
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,000
Xue Ranran.

774
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,150
It's your turn to serve tea.

775
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,030
Greet your master

776
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,920
and serve tea.

777
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,150
I...

778
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,410
I think my legs are numb.

779
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,320
I can't kneel down.

780
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,400
Su Yishui.

781
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,630
You're plotting to use me to cultivate your Core.

782
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,960
Even the heavens can't stand it.

783
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,590
Guardian.

784
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,110
Why don't you reconsider it?

785
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,190
You've to endure the pressure of the laws of nature.

786
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,320
I doubt you'd even be

787
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
able to defy her.

788
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,280
Serve the tea.

789
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,940
Sor... Sorry, Master.

790
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,150
As they say, spilled water can't be gathered up.

791
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,400
Could it be that the heavens

792
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,680
are hinting that

793
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,590
we shouldn't be master and disciple?

794
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,760
Spilled water

795
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,840
can't be gathered up?

796
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,030
I don't believe in that logic.

797
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,070
I must drink the tea you serve.

798
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,360
The ceremony is completed.

799
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,320
You're now a Wester disciple

800
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,590
and my disciple.

801
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,590
Now that I'm your disciple,

802
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,510
you'll have more control over me.

803
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,490
[Westerly Valley, Mount Wester]

804
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,880
Master, this is...

805
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,840
You've lived in the mortal world for 18 years.

806
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,150
You're full of mortal dust.

807
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,230
Get thoroughly refined here

808
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,480
to cleanse your meridians

809
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,270
before all else.

810
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,070
I thought we'll get to

811
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,630
settle the score when we meet again

812
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,590
and I'll get closure from you.

813
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,480
It's been 18 years.

814
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,840
I'm still waiting for your answer.

815
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,320
But you forgot everything.

816
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,070
I'll wait for you to remember that day.

817
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,110
A grudge can't be left unresolved.
