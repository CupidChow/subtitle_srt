[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,000
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,120
It's all in the past.

4
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,310
Since he has changed,

5
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,400
I should let go

6
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,530
and live my own life.

7
00:01:59,039 --> 00:01:59,789
Feihua,

8
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,510
keep these talismans

9
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,760
for emergencies.

10
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,070
If you encounter anything you can't handle,

11
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,560
come to Mount Wester anytime to find me.

12
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,240
Take care.

13
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,740
Take care.

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,430
You were right.

15
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,280
Guardian and Ranran actually...

16
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,710
You're so slow.

17
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
It took you so long

18
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,710
to finally notice

19
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,310
Guardian's affection and love for her.

20
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,590
Seeing them like this now,

21
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,030
I'm not surprised at all.

22
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,430
Then

23
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,430
you knew Guardian was under the Silencing Curse

24
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,870
as well?

25
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,910
I only thought

26
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,840
he loved Mu Qingge despite knowing

27
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,030
she was the Demon's child.

28
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,710
I never imagined

29
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,770
the truth was this.

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,000
So she had been protecting Guardian all along.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,590
We misunderstood her for so many years.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
So Master

33
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,180
was under the Silencing Curse.

34
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,000
That's why he couldn't say anything.

35
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,080
No wonder I kept feeling

36
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,150
Ranran looked familiar.

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,440
It turns out she looks like Grandmaster

38
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,520
in a portrait I once saw.

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,470
She has a similar aura,

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,400
but her face has changed.

41
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,590
Those Heavenly sovereigns

42
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,710
didn't recognize her either.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,800
After all,

44
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,030
she's been reborn.

45
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,520
What?

46
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,630
Are you guys going to be all formal with me?

47
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,870
No.

48
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,950
We just pieced

49
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,940
everything together.

50
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,700
Our heads are still buzzing.

51
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,430
We haven't figured out

52
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,190
whether we should call you Ranran

53
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,800
or Grandmaster.

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,520
Come on, I'm so young.

55
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,840
Of course I'm Xue Ranran,

56
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,840
your junior sister.

57
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,150
Senior Bai.

58
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't think this means

59
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,930
you don't need to pay me back

60
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,950
those three taels of silver.

61
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,680
Xi'er,

62
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,329
from now on, you're not allowed

63
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,470
to only share secrets with Senior Gao

64
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,150
and ignore me.

65
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,590
I'll get jealous.

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,490
Master just said

67
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,280
that after sacrificing

68
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,520
your Formless Spirit Root to save him,

69
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,000
you're weak and often feel cold.

70
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,210
He asked us to protect you

71
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,120
with our spiritual power.

72
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,280
How are you feeling?

73
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,520
Feeling warmer?

74
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,750
Thank you.

75
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,590
It's not as serious as Master said.

76
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,190
Also, I have to ask you,

77
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,840
do you all really understand

78
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,630
how dangerous the current situation is?

79
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Master is the Demon's child,

80
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,190
and the Spirit Spring is within him.

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,360
Following him

82
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,920
will inevitably make you the target of everyone.

83
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,920
And where we're going is the netherworld,

84
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,400
a place swarming with devils.

85
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,360
There's no telling what awaits us.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,630
Master sent me

87
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,480
to ask where you guys stand.

88
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,110
The safest option

89
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,920
for you all

90
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,600
is to publicly cut ties

91
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,480
with Wester Sect.

92
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:36,950
No way!

93
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,430
I didn't break any sect rules.

94
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,690
Master can't kick me out.

95
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,720
And I would never betray my sect.

96
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,310
That would be a disgrace to any cultivator.

97
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,950
I've just returned recently.

98
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,800
I won't leave again.

99
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,070
Besides,

100
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,360
we're fellow disciples.

101
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,570
How could we only share joy

102
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,630
but not hardship?

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,830
Your Spirit Root is destroyed,

104
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,950
yet you still want to go?

105
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:56,920
I

106
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,720
won't be outdone by you.

107
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,630
That's right.

108
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,950
What you and Master are going to do is righteous.

109
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,190
As cultivators,

110
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,390
how can we just stand by and do nothing?

111
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,270
Even if we're misunderstood for now,

112
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,570
the truth will come to light

113
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,190
one day.

114
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,040
This is a good opportunity.

115
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,430
I want to be like you,

116
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,950
to accomplish something incredible

117
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,390
that will leave people stunned.

118
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,120
Right.

119
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,070
Let's seal the Spirit Spring

120
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,900
back into the netherworld together

121
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,160
to maintain peace in the universe!

122
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,190
Alright.

123
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,360
Let's accomplish

124
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,390
this remarkable feat together.

125
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,360
Alright!

126
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,560
The way to enter the netherworld...

127
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Blood Moon.

128
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,480
The Blood Moon, born in the netherworld,

129
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,159
shines only on the mortal land where there is

130
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,190
the most bloodshed.

131
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
It absorbs malicious energy

132
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,870
to nourish the netherworld.

133
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,720
And it only lasts for 15 minutes.

134
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,220
At midnight, when the Blood Moon appears,

135
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,360
the Demon's child can use his blood

136
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,390
to access the netherworld.

137
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,900
This book only says

138
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,650
the Blood Moon appears in the mortal world

139
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,070
where there's the most bloodshed,

140
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,040
but it doesn't specify where exactly.

141
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,230
The place with the most bloodshed...

142
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,750
Could it be a battlefield?

143
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,270
There have been constant clashes between Great Qi

144
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,040
and its neighboring country at the border.

145
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,390
Things have escalated in recent months.

146
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,250
Battles have become more frequent.

147
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,240
The most brutal one was the recent

148
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,270
Battle of Fanyao.

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,480
If the Blood Moon is to appear in the mortal world,

150
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,750
the Fanyao battlefield is the most likely location.

151
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,310
The cracks on the Heavenly Bottle

152
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,270
are spreading.

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,470
We must return the Spirit Spring to the netherworld as soon as possible.

154
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,680
We'll depart immediately.

155
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,150
I'll go notify Yu Tong and the others.

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I was too impatient.

157
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,830
I forgot you just lost your spiritual power

158
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,040
and can't be overworked or catch a cold.

159
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,720
We'll rest for a night

160
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,750
and set out tomorrow.

161
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,040
I'm fine.

162
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,160
But actually,

163
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,030
I do want to leave a little later.

164
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,360
I still have some preparations

165
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,000
to make.

166
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,480
What preparations?

167
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,500
Now that I can't draw talismans with spiritual power,

168
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,720
I have to draw them by hand.

169
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,650
The netherworld is full of yin energy,

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,890
crawling with evil spirits.

171
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,750
It's very dangerous.

172
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,510
We need as many talismans as possible for protection,

173
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,120
but I haven't finished drawing them yet.

174
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,630
The spiritual power of the talisman drawer

175
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,360
will enhance

176
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,600
the power of the talismans.

177
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,240
Now that you've just lost your spiritual power,

178
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,270
the talismans will also be weakened.

179
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,390
I know.

180
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,160
That just means I'll make more.

181
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,960
If one isn't enough, I'll use two.

182
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,040
Hard work makes up for shortcomings.

183
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,390
No need to go to that trouble.

184
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,870
Just use a different type of talisman paper.

185
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,630
Draw on golden talisman paper.

186
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,480
Talismans on it

187
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,640
are ten times stronger than those on normal paper.

188
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,830
Golden talisman paper is very expensive.

189
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,120
You actually have so much of it?

190
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,560
I'm of royal blood, after all.

191
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,950
Wester Sect's wealth

192
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,750
isn't any less than

193
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,830
that of any major Heavenly Sect.

194
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,430
Swift movement talisman.

195
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,470
Blinding talisman.

196
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,240
Spirit shield talisman.

197
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,600
You've drawn them all?

198
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,720
With your spiritual power

199
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,250
and this special talisman paper,

200
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,430
these are practically

201
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,430
top-grade talismans.

202
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,870
The netherworld is drained of energy.

203
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,570
Your "One wisp of qi to break the galaxy" technique

204
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,720
may not have anything to draw power from.

205
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,750
Normal talismans might not be enough.

206
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,020
By the way,

207
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,800
since you can borrow power from heaven and earth,

208
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,480
can you borrow power from me?

209
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,680
Humans are born from heaven and earth,

210
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,680
so they can naturally resonate with them to draw power.

211
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,750
But the spiritual powers between individuals

212
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,600
don't connect.

213
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,240
To draw power from someone else,

214
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,690
one needs to use the Soul-Devouring Lock

215
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,450
or a similar artifact

216
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,630
to channel their powers first.

217
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,440
That's true for most people.

218
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,870
But don't forget,

219
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,240
I saved you using half

220
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:37,750
of my Golden Core.

221
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,330
You naturally resonate

222
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,270
with the power of my Golden Core.

223
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,440
Even without an artifact, we can still be connected.

224
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,080
I've opened up

225
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,720
all my spiritual power to you.

226
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,000
Try drawing it.

227
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,130
It worked!

228
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,720
I can draw power from you now.

229
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:03,960
In that case,

230
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
from now on, no matter where we go,

231
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,750
stay by my side.

232
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,440
You can use my power whenever you need it.

233
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,000
As the saying goes,

234
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,870
"If you borrow and return, borrowing again is easy."

235
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,670
Since our spiritual powers are connected,

236
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,690
I'll teach you

237
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,200
the second part of the 'One wisp of qi to break the galaxy' technique.

238
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,570
If one day

239
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,790
I get a lot of power,

240
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,840
you can also draw power

241
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,080
from me in case of emergency.

242
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,150
Alright.

243
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,920
I'll let you be my master for a day.

244
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,600
[Wang Suizhi's Residence]

245
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,320
Su Yu,

246
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,840
Xue Ranran,

247
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
just you wait.

248
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,790
I won't let you off easy.

249
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,410
It seems since I took

250
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,360
Su Yishui's antidote

251
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,420
to neutralize the Resentment Liquid,

252
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,870
my spiritual power has stopped growing.

253
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,550
What did he do to me?

254
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,370
You can't go on like this.

255
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,120
What?

256
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,600
Seeing me in such a miserable state,

257
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,360
you don't even call me Master anymore.

258
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,600
Or have you believed some rumors

259
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,550
to be so disrespectful to me?

260
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,550
I've made some lingzhi mushroom soup.

261
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,630
Focus on your recovery first.

262
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,430
This residence in the mountains

263
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,670
is hidden and quiet,

264
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,360
perfect for your recovery.

265
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,120
What use

266
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,480
is this lingzhi mushroom?

267
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,870
Starting tomorrow,

268
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,440
I want you to bring me ten of them every day.

269
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,550
I want thousand-year-old lingzhi mushrooms.

270
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,260
Thousand-year-old lingzhi mushrooms

271
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,120
are reserved for the imperial family.

272
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,670
How can ordinary people obtain them?

273
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,600
Where's Lin Yeting?

274
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,120
Ask him to get them.

275
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,840
Those high-born disciples

276
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,030
you recruited once

277
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,480
openly cut ties with the sect

278
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,320
the day you left the capital.

279
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,180
Who's left then?

280
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,030
Wester Sect's former disciples

281
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,720
all followed us here.

282
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,150
I haven't told them anything

283
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,910
about what happened in the palace.

284
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,200
You're in a difficult situation now.

285
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,270
When things settle down,

286
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,030
you can tell them yourself.

287
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,200
Wu.

288
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,480
My injuries are severe,

289
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,720
and my power is constrained.

290
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,840
Without more spiritual treasures,

291
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,000
I won't be able to recover.

292
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,960
I'll find a way.

293
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,550
Thank you so much,

294
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,870
Suizhi.

295
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,550
The world ruined me and destroyed my reputation,

296
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,080
but I, Mu Qingge,

297
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,200
have a clear conscience.

298
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,870
We'll find a way to help you, Master.

299
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,840
We'll go right away.

300
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,520
Let's go!

301
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:27,910
Let's go!

302
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,720
You promised me

303
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,090
that you would personally

304
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,960
reveal your identity to them.

305
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,270
But why did you…

306
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,440
When did I ever promise that?

307
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,000
Su Yu…

308
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,120
The Crown Princess…

309
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,360
Madam Battle…

310
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,390
I used to have

311
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,720
the best of everything.

312
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
But in the blink of an eye,

313
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,840
it's all gone.

314
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,390
There's no turning back for me.

315
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,510
At worst,

316
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,190
I'll die here

317
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,720
to avoid endless

318
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,840
humiliation and despair in the future.

319
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,870
Why do you have to do this,

320
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,720
Wu?

321
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,270
Alright,

322
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,200
I won't say anything.

323
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,080
Why?

324
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,190
Because you like me?

325
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,240
Seeing me in such a miserable state,

326
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,720
you think I should

327
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,410
♫Who is that alone under the tree?♫

328
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,840
be grateful for your affection

329
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,880
and throw myself

330
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,080
into your arms?

331
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:07,680
♫Stained with a light and clear glow♫

332
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,000
No.

333
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
Do you remember that

334
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:12,550
♫Repeatedly awakened from dreams by the shattered shadow of the moon♫

335
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,080
25 years ago,

336
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,090
you saved me at the foot of Mount Wester?

337
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,800
♫Outside the mountain, longing reflected in the limpid eyes♫

338
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,440
I was not a talented cultivator

339
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,110
and was bullied by my senior brothers.

340
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,790
You stood up for me.

341
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,300
♫With a gentle nudge of the night breeze, the lantern is empty♫

342
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,270
I thought you were a disciple of Wester Sect,

343
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,140
♫Time passed can never be brought back♫

344
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,670
so I joined Wester Sect.

345
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,790
I was very grateful to you.

346
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,670
Every time you came to Mount Wester,

347
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,930
♫On sleepless nights, I toast to the world and drown my sorrows♫

348
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,720
I was so happy

349
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,750
to see you.

350
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:41,420
♫My lovesickness comprises only of you♫

351
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,080
I always hoped

352
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,960
that you could live a happier life.

353
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,500
♫If the long night is too dark, I'll keep you company all the way♫

354
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,630
It's the same now.

355
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,630
♫To face all the love and hatred, the rights and wrongs♫

356
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,030
I hope you can stop

357
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,150
and think about what you really want

358
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,150
and where you should go.

359
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,880
♫Our tortuous fate alternating endlessly between partings and reunions, joy and sorrow♫

360
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,120
I need spiritual treasures.

361
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,180
♫Only after experiencing death and rebirth do you realize its preciousness♫

362
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,790
I need to advance in cultivation.

363
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,030
I need to take back everything that was mine!

364
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,940
♫A destiny full of twists and turns, a love fraught with hardship♫

365
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,960
You have luck on your side.

366
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,840
Wealth and power come to you effortlessly,

367
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,250
♫But I remain fearless with no regrets♫

368
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,720
yet you refuse to give me more

369
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,200
and better spiritual treasures to help me!

370
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,480
Instead, you're saying those sarcastic words

371
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,390
to brush me off!

372
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:21,450
♫Waiting for the fallen flowers to dance and silhouettes to pair up♫

373
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,840
I just can spot

374
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,320
financial opportunities

375
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,240
before others do.

376
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,700
♫Eventually nestling in each other's arms again♫

377
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,600
It's not like I can conjure wealth from thin air.

378
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,600
Master always taught me

379
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:32,580
♫If the long night is too dark, I'll keep you company all the way♫

380
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,360
to be upright and honest

381
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,910
and to have solid abilities

382
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,910
before grasping at opportunities.

383
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,710
♫To face all the love and hatred, the rights and wrongs♫

384
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,390
It's the same with almost everything.

385
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
Master, Master, Master!

386
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,550
Your master is always right!

387
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,960
♫Our tortuous fate alternating endlessly between partings and reunions, joy and sorrow♫

388
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,790
She's always been lucky

389
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,720
and always gets whatever she wants

390
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:49,260
♫Only after experiencing death and rebirth do you realize its preciousness♫

391
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,910
without even trying.

392
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,720
And me?

393
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:55,020
♫A destiny full of twists and turns, a love fraught with hardship♫

394
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
I've never had much to begin with.

395
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,890
And wanting more is a crime?

396
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,330
♫But I remain fearless with no regrets♫

397
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,030
You say you like me.

398
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,530
♫Waiting for the fallen flowers to dance and silhouettes to pair up♫

399
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,000
But I think

400
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:13,160
♫Eventually nestling in each other's arms again♫

401
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,720
you just enjoy watching me suffer.

402
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,000
Colluding with enemies, manipulating devils,

403
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,440
and plotting against the Crown Prince.

404
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:30,720
These vicious people

405
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,270
should be put in prison!

406
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,390
Exactly.

407
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,000
You wouldn't

408
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,360
be able to tell just by their looks.

409
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,450
They should be arrested.

410
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:37,960
They…

411
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,030
These people…

412
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,940
Criminals.

413
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,360
They…

414
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,910
Criminals!

415
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,630
Arrest them!

416
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:43,860
Watch out!

417
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,390
They're over there!

418
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,240
After them!

419
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,480
The Crown Prince actually stooped so low as to slander us

420
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
and tarnish Wester Sect's reputation.

421
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,550
That's not all.

422
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,870
I bet he's also spread the word

423
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,960
about Master being the Demon's child

424
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,320
to all major Heavenly Sects

425
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,390
in order to use them

426
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,080
to deal with us.

427
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,950
If the Heavenly Ones get involved,

428
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,480
I'm afraid we'll be outnumbered.

429
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,680
We need to be careful

430
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,640
on this journey.

431
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,310
There are checkpoints all along the way.

432
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,310
We have to use forbidden techniques

433
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,030
to disguise ourselves,

434
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,329
but that won't fool the Heavenly Ones.

435
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,750
We must not miss the chance

436
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,440
to seal the Spirit Spring.

437
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,440
If we encounter any Heavenly Ones,

438
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,200
avoid them if possible.

439
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,170
The less trouble, the better.

440
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,310
Yes.

441
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,400
Yes.

442
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:18,920
Not enough!

443
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,599
I want something better.

444
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,280
But this is already

445
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,310
the finest spiritual medicine.

446
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,589
Then the problem must be the alchemy furnace.

447
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,040
Go find me

448
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,200
a better alchemy furnace.

449
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,070
I put you on the spot?

450
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,830
Then you can leave.

451
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,240
I never forced you to stay.

452
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,210
I know you still need time

453
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,000
to come around.

454
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,030
I can wait.

455
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,680
Don't worry.

456
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,880
I won't leave you.

457
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,990
There's always a way out.

458
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,310
You got here so fast.

459
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,310
So,

460
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,110
has Su Yu made up his mind

461
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,510
to hunt me down and kill me?

462
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,510
You misunderstand.

463
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,750
I'm not here to harm you.

464
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,680
Instead, on behalf of the Crown Prince,

465
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,070
I've come to seek cooperation.

466
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,350
Cooperation?

467
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,200
Impossible.

468
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,330
He ordered my death.

469
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,110
I heard it myself.

470
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,540
His Highness is now in grave danger.

471
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,450
He urgently needs someone powerful

472
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,240
to extend his life.

473
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,550
Immortal Master,

474
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,400
if you're willing to help,

475
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,150
you can still be

476
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,880
Madam Battle.

477
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,840
All the wealth and power you once had

478
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,000
will be given back to you.

479
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,440
Besides,

480
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,960
that powerful person

481
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,350
can help you

482
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,720
obtain unparalleled spiritual power.

483
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,550
Everything you desire

484
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,240
will be yours again.

485
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,510
Then who is this powerful person he's looking for?

486
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,640
Him?

487
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,370
But he's been missing for so long.

488
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,590
How do you know his whereabouts?

489
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,720
He suddenly disappeared back then

490
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,030
because Mu Qingge

491
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,430
sealed him in the netherworld.

492
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,750
Su Yishui is heading there now.

493
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,640
You just need to sneak into the netherworld during the chaos.

494
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,960
Then you'll find him.

495
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,720
With his help,

496
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,640
I'll surely regain my spiritual power

497
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,430
and trample her underfoot.

498
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,590
But with my current power,

499
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,160
how can I sneak into the netherworld

500
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,160
without Su Yishui noticing?

501
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,680
Don't worry,

502
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,920
His Highness has already

503
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,790
revealed Su Yishui's identity as the Demon's child

504
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,240
to all Heavenly Sects.

505
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,350
You just need to add fuel to the fire,

506
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,400
and those Heavenly Ones

507
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,270
will handle the rest for you.

508
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,520
When I arrived at the East Sea

509
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,590
with my disciples,

510
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,840
Su Yishui

511
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,300
had already fled.

512
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,310
He didn't return to Mount Wester either.

513
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,270
Where on earth

514
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,310
has he fled to?

515
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,270
I know where he is!

516
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,200
Mu Qingge,

517
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,680
why did you pretend to be the Demon's child back then?

518
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,970
We were all

519
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,030
fooled by you.

520
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,110
Immortal Masters, please calm down.

521
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,470
Back then, Su Yishui

522
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,830
threatened me with my younger sister

523
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,510
Wu's life,

524
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,480
forcing me to publicly admit that I was the Demon's child.

525
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,400
That way, he could secretly control the Spirit Spring

526
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,550
and seize power over the universe.

527
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,160
But for some unknown reason,

528
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,680
the Spirit Spring wasn't under his control.

529
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,110
To cover his tracks,

530
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,480
he revived me

531
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,960
to divert everyone's attention.

532
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,880
It was only after I was reborn

533
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,830
that I realized he had deceived me.

534
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,400
Wu had been killed by him.

535
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,310
Afterward, he forced me to make a soul oath.

536
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,880
If I say the truth

537
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
that Su Yishui is…

538
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,680
It's indeed a soul oath.

539
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,790
Right now, he's taking the Spirit Spring

540
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,960
to the netherworld.

541
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,210
Immortal Masters,

542
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,270
please stop him.

543
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,960
Don't let him wreak more havoc.

544
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,510
Immortal Masters, please stay calm.

545
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,120
Even if she made a soul oath,

546
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,000
it doesn't mean

547
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,110
everything she says is true.

548
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,320
Nor does it erase

549
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,070
all her past crimes.

550
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,310
I know I've wronged Immortal Kaiyuan

551
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,070
and those who perished at Heavenly Meridian Mountain,

552
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,120
but he forced me to do those things!

553
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,960
The Resentment Liquid in me

554
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,200
was his doing.

555
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,830
I only said what I did at Heavenly Meridian Mountain

556
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,880
because I had no choice.

557
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,680
Now that I've finally rid myself of Resentment Liquid,

558
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,310
I refuse to aid his evil any longer.

559
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,000
I won't be a pawn in his schemes

560
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,270
to wreak havoc on the world.

561
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,680
Someone so vicious

562
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,790
is unforgivable!

563
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,510
Where is the Demon's child now?

564
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,360
He's heading to Fanyao

565
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,640
with his disciples.

566
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,000
Eternals, attention!

567
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,830
I haven't

568
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,590
fully recovered yet.

569
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,440
Liangyu,

570
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,720
you will take charge.

571
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,750
Gather all Eternals and set out

572
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,000
to capture the Demon's child, Su Yishui!

573
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,550
Yes.

574
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,310
Follow me to capture the Demon's child

575
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,720
and take the Spirit Spring.

576
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,110
Yes!

577
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,750
Scuds, come with me.

578
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,510
We'll hunt the Demon's child down!

579
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,480
Yes!

580
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,110
We Hollows

581
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,310
will join this fight too.

582
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,830
[The battlefield at Fanyao]

583
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,720
Along the way,

584
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,200
we ran into quite a few Heavenly Ones.

585
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,880
It seems the Heavenly Sects are really

586
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,720
taking action against us.

587
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,830
It looks like

588
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,160
a great battle

589
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
took place here before.

590
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,960
A lot of malicious energy

591
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,750
is gathering in the air.

592
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,930
The Spirit Spring seems to have

593
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,750
a special reaction to this place.

594
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,680
It looks like the entrance to the netherworld

595
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,830
is right here.

596
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,110
I've put a talisman here.

597
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,400
When the Blood Moon appears,

598
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,750
the Yin Eye Stone will react.

599
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
For the next few hours,

600
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,370
you go to the nearby town

601
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,000
and get something to eat.

602
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,880
But at a time like this,

603
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,310
I can't eat anything.

604
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,070
Relax.

605
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,620
The greater the danger ahead,

606
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,550
the more we should eat, drink, and enjoy ourselves.

607
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,910
We need to keep our energy up

608
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,400
to win the fight later.

609
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,620
Stay low-key in life,

610
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,790
but eat like a king, right?

611
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,830
You're right, Ranran.

612
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,110
The Heavenly Ones are still looking for us.

613
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,070
To avoid drawing attention,

614
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,720
we should split up for now.

615
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,270
When the Blood Moon appears,

616
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
we'll regroup here.

617
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,300
[Wuma Town]

618
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,030
It's my first time in Wuma Town,

619
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,790
but it somehow feels familiar.

620
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,200
That's because you came here in your past life.

621
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,760
No wonder.

622
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,270
Chen's Pan-fried Bun Shop from the Collection of Entertainment.

623
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,440
They have a shop here too.

624
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,960
You only read about them in the Collection of Entertainment before.

625
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,350
You finally get to try them now.

626
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,920
Let's go try them.

627
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,480
Sure.

628
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,440
Master,

629
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,440
you don't seem nervous at all.

630
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,240
After everything

631
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:42,830
we've been through,

632
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,920
I believe

633
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,400
we can make it through this time too.

634
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,960
Besides, didn't you say

635
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,720
we should eat and enjoy ourselves even more before a big fight?

636
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:49,830
This place is lively.

637
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,350
I'll take you around later.

638
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,160
Okay.

639
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,440
Try the dipping sauce in the Collection of Entertainment.

640
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,680
How is it?

641
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,670
After we return the Spirit Spring to the netherworld,

642
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,400
let's travel across the world together

643
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,400
and try everything delicious.

644
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,160
Alright.

645
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,510
Eat up.

646
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,160
Master, skewers!

647
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,160
Freshly grilled lamb skewers.

648
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,000
Sir, how many would you like?

649
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,270
Here,

650
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,880
I'll take five.

651
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,510
Alright!

652
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,830
Here you go.

653
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,550
Thank you.

654
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,200
You're welcome.

655
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,510
Take care.

656
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,510
They smell so good!

657
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,960
Lamb skewers! Beef skewers!

658
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,640
Great, great!

659
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,510
Great, great!

660
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,170
Congratulations to this young lady

661
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,350
for winning the top prize!

662
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,400
Great!

663
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,070
Amazing!

664
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
It's the top prize.

665
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,750
She's amazing.

666
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,680
This is the top prize?

667
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,110
Miss,

668
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,000
don't underestimate this mirror.

669
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,920
It's called the Mirror of Fated Love.

670
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,850
It's said that

671
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,270
a Mirror Immortal resides within.

672
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,110
If you sincerely knock on the mirror three times,

673
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,310
you'll see the love of your past life.

674
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,450
That sounds amazing.

675
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,480
Are you serious?

676
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,440
Miss, look.

677
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,060
Honesty is our principle;

678
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,440
no deception for the young or old!

679
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,800
Come on, next one!

680
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,550
Next, next!

681
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,510
Come on, come on!

682
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,640
Come on!

683
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:42,880
Master,

684
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,440
have I been tricked?

685
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,160
This mirror doesn't work at all.

686
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,480
How could it not work?

687
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,000
Close your eyes and try again.

688
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,430
Open your eyes now.

689
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,200
Look.

690
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,720
The love of your previous life and this life

691
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,640
is right here.

692
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:24,920
Take care.

693
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,160
This pattern is really beautiful.

694
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:26,790
Look!

695
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,030
The one you picked

696
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,640
is really nice.

697
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,200
Yes, look.

698
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,400
Sir,

699
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,000
why are these lanterns

700
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,960
selling so well?

701
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,680
Miss, you might not know,

702
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:36,890
in a few days, it will be

703
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,480
the local Lantern Festival.

704
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,170
At the festival,

705
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,690
single men and women will exchange lanterns

706
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,440
to express their feelings.

707
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,040
So everyone is rushing to buy

708
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,550
their favorite lantern in advance.

709
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,790
Sir, sir.

710
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,270
Lantern Festival?

711
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,510
I heard that in a few days,

712
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,160
in Wuma Town near the border,

713
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,110
there will be a Lantern Festival.

714
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,030
Master,

715
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,960
these lanterns are so beautiful!

716
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,070
These lanterns are beautiful?

717
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,690
Does that mean

718
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,350
the one I made isn't?

719
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,200
The one you made...

720
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,590
Someone

721
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,480
was jealous of herself

722
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,950
and dragged innocent people into it.

723
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,160
I acted on impulse, okay?

724
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,550
How about

725
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,550
I make one to make it up to you?

726
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,510
What do you think?

727
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,030
For real?

728
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,740
I've done my research.

729
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
The mountain bamboo here

730
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,160
is perfect for making lanterns.

731
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,240
Master,

732
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,310
lend me some spiritual power.

733
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,670
There's a power fluctuation over there.

734
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,670
It's my primal power.

735
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
Did I hide something

736
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,960
in that cave?

737
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,480
Let's go take a look.

738
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,750
The Eternal Flame…

739
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,480
I actually used the precious Eternal Flame

740
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,590
to light these lanterns.

741
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,480
Let's go to the Lantern Festival together.

742
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,790
By then,

743
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,720
I'll show you something amazing.

744
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,350
Are these lanterns…

745
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,030
I just remembered something.

746
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,480
It seems

747
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,330
you used to love lanterns.

748
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,210
So I made these for you

749
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,960
as a gift.

750
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
But I can't recall

751
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,790
why you liked lanterns.

752
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,920
I lived in poverty when I was young.

753
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,720
Every festival,

754
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,750
I'd watch other children

755
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,350
walking through the streets with lanterns

756
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,680
and envy them.

757
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,310
Every time that happened,

758
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,550
I'd comfort myself by thinking

759
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,110
next year I'd surely have money to buy one.

760
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,000
Later, my father took me back,

761
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,160
and I never thought of that wish again.

762
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,680
Until one day,

763
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,680
someone lit up all the lanterns for me,

764
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,830
illuminating my way back home.

765
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,960
But I never

766
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,200
told anyone about this.

767
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,720
I don't know how you

768
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,680
noticed that back then.

769
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,920
Although the memories are gone,

770
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,960
some feelings still remain.

771
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,960
When you care about someone,

772
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,750
you don't need words—

773
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,790
you just know how they feel.

774
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,200
So back then, you…

775
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:16,140
♫Fallen leaves swirling and covering the empty garden♫

776
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:23,270
♫Clouds and dust rolling in the distant sky♫

777
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,440
Consecrating the sword with vital blood

778
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,720
reduces your lifespan.

779
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,110
Is…

780
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,310
is it worth it?

781
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,160
Is Mu Qingge that important to you?

782
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,670
♫Generations of dreams fold into one♫

783
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,920
Do you have a death wish?

784
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,920
You hurt her, so I'll take your life!

785
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,670
♫Solitary branches hidden in clothing♫

786
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,640
Reckless boy,

787
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:37,920
♫Extend fate to call you back; How lucky to meet by chance♫

788
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,720
don't risk your life so carelessly again.

789
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,840
♫I've shed thousands of tears, but my feelings haven't run dry♫

790

♫Hatred adds grayness to my hair♫

791
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,560
You just missed

792
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,790
the only chance to kill me

793
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:50,890
and gain your freedom.

794
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,070
♫Which side does destiny choose?♫

795
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,200
Don't you regret it?

796

♫Demon or immortal?♫

797
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,350
I, Su Yishui, never take advantage of others' weaknesses.

798
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,640
Moreover,

799
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:04,530
♫With you by my side, I'm fearless in the face of life's hardships♫

800
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,240
I'll defeat you fair and square

801
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,790
and sever our master-disciple bond.

802
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,400
Alright,

803
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,550
I'll be waiting for that day.

804
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,000
♫If love wants me to die♫

805
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,600
♫I won't give up because of you♫

But until then,

807
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,960
take good care of yourself.

♫Reincarnation and fate can't be denied♫

811
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
just tell me what needs to be done,

812
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,790
and I'll handle it for you.

♫The moment between us is worth 10,000 years♫

821
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,360
I heard that in a few days,

822
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,680
in Wuma Town near the border,

823
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,440
there will be a Lantern Festival.

824
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,030
Let's go together.

825
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,400
By then,

826
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,310
I'll show you something amazing.

827
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,620
At this moment,

828
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
I can remember

829
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,070
the feeling

830
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,590
behind every lantern I made here.

831
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,200
You once said

832
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,310
you didn't know if my actions in my past life

833
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,280
were for love

834
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:19,990
♫I've shed thousands of tears, but my feelings haven't run dry♫

835

or for righteousness.

836
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,400
In Wuma Town,

837
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,830
there's a tradition of gifting lanterns

838
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,240
to express one's feelings.

839
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,880
♫Hatred adds grayness to my hair♫

is my answer.

842
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,550
I think

843
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,220
♫Which side does destiny choose?♫

The netherworld has appeared.

869
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,670

870
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,510
The Blood Moon.

Once it fully emerges,

872
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,920
the entrance to the netherworld will appear.

873

Demon's child!

874
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,000
Hand over the Spirit Spring!

875
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,800
Su Yishui,

876
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,630
you framed your own Master,

877
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,550
deceived everyone,

878
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,440
and want to do more evil

879
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,110
by becoming a devil with the Spirit Spring.

880
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,590
We Heavenly Ones

881
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,320
won't allow you to bring disaster upon the world!

882
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,060
I advise you to repent now

883
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,440
so you might get a lighter punishment!

884
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:24,670
Shui,

885
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,430
it's not too late to stop now.

886
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,080
Don't repeat the same mistake

887
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
and cause more bloodshed.

888
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,440
Although my master is the Demon's child,

889
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,670
he doesn't intend to use the Spirit Spring for evil.

890
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:37,710
We came here

891
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,070
to seal the Spirit Spring,

892
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,920
not to use it to make a devil.

893
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,070
That's right.

894
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,110
Foolish!

895
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,250
The Demon's child is full of lies!

896
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,640
Since you've chosen to side

897
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,590
with the Demon's child

898
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,630
and aid his wicked cause,

899
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,000
don't blame us for showing no mercy!

900
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,550
We only have 15 minutes.

901
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,590
We need to hurry.

902
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,110
The entrance to the netherworld.

903
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,090
The Demon's child is about to open the netherworld.

904
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,150
Stop him!

905
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,510
Xi'er!

906
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,410
What's wrong with you?

907
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,430
Be careful of the demonic energy!

908
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,590
Hold your breath and stay focused!

909
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,510
I just…

910
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,800
lost my sanity.

911
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,560
My mind was filled with hatred and killing intent.

912
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,400
It must be because of the demonic energy.

913
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,230
What do we do?

914
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,590
The Blood Moon's demonic energy

915
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,400
can make people lose their sanity.

916
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,070
Take the Sanity Pills.

917
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,580
They can dispel inner devils

918
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,590
and bring sanity back.

919
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,360
You're with the Demon's child.

920
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,190
Who knows what your true intentions are?

921
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,460
I trust her.

922
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,360
Su Yishui, hand over the Spirit Spring!

923
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,760
Not a chance, you demon!

924
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,590
Ranran!

925
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:04,820

926
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,550

927
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:23,940
Hongshan!

928
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,640
Master!

929
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,280
Guardian!

930
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,170
Vermilion Bird!

931
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,970
Seniors,

932
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,810
please take care of everyone.

933
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,520
After Master and I seal the Spirit Spring,

934
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,320
we'll return immediately.

935
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,280
This…

936
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:16,670
This...

937
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,760
Is everything you said true?

938
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,150
Is Su Yishui really going to seal the Spirit Spring?

939
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,580
If Master wanted to become a devil,

940
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,800
why would he have bothered to save you all?

941
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,110
Wait.

942
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,030
Where's Mu Ranwu?

943
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,030
Are you alright?

944
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,320
Heaven and earth are inverted in the netherworld.

945
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,030
You'll need time to adjust to using talismans here.

946
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,630
So,

947
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,230
this is the netherworld?

948
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,510
The entrance has closed.

949
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,550
How do we get out?

950
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,070
Every time the netherworld opens an entrance,

951
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,320
an exit is created.

952
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,190
But it's a one-way exit

953
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,890
and only exists for six hours.

954
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,450
The tricky part is that

955
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,880
its location in the mortal world is unpredictable.

956
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,000
So this time...

957
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,000
We got lucky.

958
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,190
The exit is in the mountains near Wuma Town.

959
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,480
Look.

960
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:42,920
It's on top of that peak.

961
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,570
We have six hours

962
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,410
to find the ancient sealing formation

963
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,070
for the Spirit Spring.

964
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,440
Then we can leave.

965
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,710
Where are the others?

966
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:53,710
Watch out!

967
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,150
Su Yishui,

968
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,630
you're quite clever.

969
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,440
Xue Ranran,

970
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,880
no wonder I found you

971
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,070
interesting from the start.

972
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,840
So you're the real Mu Qingge.

973
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,510
No need to rush.

974
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,190
I'll take down Su Yishui first.

975
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,280
Then we can settle the score

976
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,400
from our past life.
