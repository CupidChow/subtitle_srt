00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,480
Is this what you meant by "alright"?

4
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,550
Just a bit of cold poison left.

5
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,190
No worries.

6
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,220
I'll be fine by tomorrow.

7
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,080
You've fully recovered?

8
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,960
I'm fine now.

9
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,840
Did you

10
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:18,870
guard me all night?

11
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,280
You got hurt because of me.

12
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,500
If I left,

13
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,710
and you got chronically ill,

14
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,910
I'd be the one to blame, right?

15
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,810
Shui, you're indeed

16
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,870
a nice person with a conscience.

17
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,340
Since everything is done,

18

let's hurry back now.

19
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,540
No rush.

20
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,120
Today is kind of special.

21
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,360
What?

22
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,120
Don't you remember what day it is?

23
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,430
It's your birthday!

24
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,850
I should celebrate it for you.

25
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:55,870
Don't bother.

26
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,870
I'm not interested

27
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,240
in boring things like this.

28
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,910
How about I let you out for a day off?

29
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:04,970
I don't want that either.

30
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,800
I'll release you from the jade tablet,

31
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,070
and you can have fun today!

32
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,150

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,040
the disciple you said you were going to take in

37
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,040
is Su Yishui?

38
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah.

39
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,270
That boy's really talented.

40
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,130
I thought it'd take him five years to form a core,

41
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,000
but he nailed it in just three years.

42
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,030
Qingge,

43
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,659
he is the son of Prince Ping.

44
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,240
You don't allow

45
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,600
our Heavenly Sect to get involved in imperial affairs,

46
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:40,800
but why

47
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,070
did you take in Su Yishui as your disciple?

48
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,000
As my disciple,

49
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,040
he will no longer be related to the imperial family.

50
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,720
That's not true.

51
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,480
His Majesty hasn't named an heir yet,

52
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,920
while his condition has deteriorated.

53
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,840
My father and Prince Ping

54
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,310
will inevitably fight each other one day.

55
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,690
At that time, Su Yishui

56
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,950
will surely side with Prince Ping.

57
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,240
Someone who has struggled to survive like him

58
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,410
can't be easily controlled.

59
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,300

62
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,410
my father heard he found

63
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,110
his lost son and brought his son back to the mansion.

64
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,750
As fellow members of the imperial family,

65
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,930
my father chose a day

66
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,390

Unexpectedly, Prince Ping

70
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,070
said his son who just returned home

71
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,070
was feeling under the weather

72
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,390
and bedridden for recovery.

73
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,630
So he couldn't meet us.

74
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,360
Then my father

75
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,040
just had tea and chatted with Prince Ping.

[Little Su Yu]

77
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,830
I was too young and restless to sit still,

78
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,409
so I snuck out to wander around Prince Ping's residence.

79
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,120
Then I accidentally stumbled into the back garden

80
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,159

Later I found out

85
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,370
that boy was Su Yishui.

86
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,750
Didn't expect Shui

87
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,620
to be such a poor little thing.

88
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,720
Having gone through all this,

89
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,530
no matter what kind of person he was,

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,160
he's definitely been ruined by Prince Ping.

His Highness is right.

96
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,870
You should be cautious.

97
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,310
Prince Ping treated him this way

98
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,430
just in order to forge him

99
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,570
into a deadly blade.

But now,

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,600
since he is in Mount Wester,

102
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,120
I will sheathe this blade

103
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,390

Give me that!

Give it to me!

Come on.

209
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,850
Here, put this on.

210
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,390
It's chilling cold.

211
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,600
Come on, hang in there.

212
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,760
We're almost home.

213
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,630
Almost there.

Mom!

216
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,600
Welcome back!

217
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,320
I'm back.

218
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,440
What's this?

219
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,150
Take a look.

220
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,810
Dried longan?

221
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,530
It's a pity they were pickled after going bad.

222
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,690
But the taste is still not bad.

223
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,510
Try some.

224
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,480
Thank you, Mom!

225
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,870
Mom has abandoned me.

226
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,380
I don't have a home anymore.

00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,170
I told you not to close the door.

234
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,390
We should leave it open for Shui.

235
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,930
It's windy and pouring rain.

236
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,510

Do you like it?

269
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,350
It's just a tree.

270
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:18,920
Shui,

271
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,640
you're wrong about that.

272
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,590
Trees are more valuable than you think.

273
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,230
In spring, it grows green leaves.

274
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,030
In summer, it's a shelter from wind and rain.

275
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,000
In autumn, it bears fruits for us to pick.

276
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,290
In winter, it provides branches for firewood.

277
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,300
In the morning, birds chirp on top.

278
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,400
At noon, it provides shade from the heat.

At night,

280
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,160
we listen to the wind rustling through the leaves,

281

it's not just a house

but

285
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,070
a home.

286
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,480

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,160

301
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,070
is to the past.

302
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,110
May we not be stuck in the past

303
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
with each day a brand-new beginning.

304
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,800
Freshly picked sweet fruit.

305
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,300
From now on,

306
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,940
we'll only taste sweetness, not bitterness.

307
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,750
I don't need sweetness.

308
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,350
Sweetness makes people forget,

309
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,410
yet bitterness has things engraved in your mind.

310
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
I only need bitterness.

311
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,350
It reminds me to never forget.

312
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,480
It's not worthwhile.

313
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,000
Everyone's got their limits.

314
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,880
In the past, you had no choice.

315
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,470
It was filled with bitterness. You can't change it.

316
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,450
Now you can choose on your own.

317
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,720
Why make things difficult for yourself?

318
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,030
How about this?

319
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,400
Next time when something gets you down,

320
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,240
let's just open a jar of good wine

321
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,510
and call our fellows

322
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,510
to get rid of all the unhappiness.

323
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,880
We can call them now.

324
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,240
Mu Qingge!

325
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,510
You know nothing about my past,

326
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,590
and neither do you know

327
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,550
what kind of person I really am.

328
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,800
I don't need

329
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,790
anyone to help me.

330
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,160
Stop being kind to me.

331
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,960
Then tell me

332
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,190
what kind of person you were?

333
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,800
And what kind of person

334
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,440
do you want to become in the future?

335
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,070
I want to become

336
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,160
the most powerful being in the world.

337
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,720
I want those who once despised me

338
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,720
to kneel before me one by one,

339
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,420
begging me to spare their lives.

340
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,760
If you were really

341
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,030
as ruthless as you say,

342
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,040
you wouldn't have let

343
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,240
Prince Zong's second son survive.

344
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,590
I didn't kill him

345
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,000
because I wanted to defy my father's manipulation.

346
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,590
I have my own plans.

347
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,000
So are you planning to scheme against Prince Ping?

348
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,360
You have to be more ruthless and callous than others

349
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,720
to stay on top.

350
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,690
In this world,

351
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,830
if you don't want to be manipulated,

352
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,510
this is the only way to go.

353
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,200
No other choice.

354
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,960
Actually, when I was young,

355
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,440
I almost went astray too.

356
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,540
In that year of the famine,

357
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
some bandits wanted me

358
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,070
to put poison into the well of a rich household in the village.

359
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,620
They promised to give me food if I did it.

360
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,480
I didn't want to do it,

361
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,440
but my little sister had already

362
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,570
been starving for days.

363
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,350
It snowed heavily that night.

364
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,440
I pondered over it all night.

365
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,030
If I put the arsenic,

366
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,110
innocent people would die.

367
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,880
If I didn't,

368
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,270
my sister and I would die.

369
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,830
So you put the poison into the well?

370
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,070
I carried my sister on my back

371
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,860
and fled away on that snowy night.

372
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,000
I thought we would die,

373
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,160
but unexpectedly, after we left,

374
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,510
we survived.

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,200
sometimes people

377
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,410
are like

378
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,880
bugs trapped in a box.

379
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,350
They think they're trapped in dead ends,

380
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,590
but once they break out,

381
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,760
they'll realize how vast the world is.

382
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,310
There are always choices.

383
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,970
You've already left Prince Ping's residence.

384
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,880
I will definitely help you

385
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,020
find another path.

386
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,920
I've asked around.

387
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,070
In the Wester Sect, except for me,

388
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,110
no one else was brought here by force.

389
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,070
You care about me so much.

390
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,500
Is it because of Su Yu?

391
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,550
You two used to be so close.

392
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,350
As I told you before,

393
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,200
it's because you have Five Spirit Roots.

394
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,520
I want you to teach disciples

395
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,830
and build up a reputation for me.

396
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,720
This way, I can just

397
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,240
lead a carefree life,

398
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,640
lying down and enjoying offerings.

399
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,400
You're indispensable

400
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,860
to make my dream come true.

401
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,240
You are indeed so boring.

402
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,410
Have a drink.

403
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,400
No wonder he doesn't drink.

404
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,030
He's such a lightweight!

405
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,070
Junior Su's playing a gentle and soothing melody today.

406
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,580
He's almost like a different person!

407
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,740
Those rabbits and chicks in the cub zoo

408
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,830
are getting along very well with Junior Su.

409
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,480
Really?

410
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,200
Focus on meditation.

411
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,750
Why so talkative?

412
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,830
Weird,

413
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,750
you're about to form your core,

414
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,410
but something's obstructing

415
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,000
the flow of spiritual power in your heart.

416
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,960
Have you ever been seriously injured

417
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,000
or

418
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,680
been hit by any weird spells?

419
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,440
I'm planting this drop of Spirit Spring

420
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,240
into your heart.

421
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,310
No.

422
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,560
Perhaps there's

423
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,240
a trace of innate impurity in your body

424
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,290
that's affecting your cultivation.

425
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,450
The Westerly Valley in the west

426
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,110
can stabilize spiritual power.

427
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,110
Go there

428
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,170
and wait for me.

429
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,630
Take this pill

430
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,590
and focus on meditation.

431
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,650
This pill I just made is extremely bitter.

432
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,830
Take it with the dried longan.

433
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,510
I've added some licorice to it.

434
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,230
Stabilize your spiritual power.

435
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,140
I'll help you form your Golden Core.

436
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,920
It's done!

437
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,000
The Golden Core!

438
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,890
Shui has finally formed a Golden Core

439
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,700
instead of a Demonic Core.

440
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,400
Shui,

441
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,750
you're now a Golden Core cultivator.

442
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,720
Helping me form my core depleted your core energy.

443
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,830
It's nothing.

444
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,250
What happened to your hands?

445
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,470
Just got hurt while picking the immortal herb for that pill.

446
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,340
The Nine-ganoderma Immortal Herb is quite difficult to pick.

447
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,640
Thank you.

448
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,830
Well, well, wonders never cease.

449
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,940
Shui actually said thank you.

450
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,260
Honestly,

451
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,690
what I want to hear now

452
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,550
is not "thank you."

453
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Then what is it?

454
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,830
After so many years here,

455
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,310
isn't it about time

456
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,510
for you to call me master?

457
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,000
Despite my injured hands

458
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,400
and drastic power decline,

459
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,210
-I still can't get you to call me master.
-Master.

460
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,640
Yes,

461
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,350
good boy.

462
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,530
Junior Su,

463
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,010
you advanced to the Golden Core realm just a few days ago.

464
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,480
Yet instead of consolidating your cultivation,

465
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,560
you've been grinding medicine here

466
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,930
and making this scar-removing ointment.

467
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,710
What's the use of that?

468
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,280
I...

469
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,640
I injured my hands.

470
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,830
Is it serious? Let me see.

471
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:48,960
Nope.

472
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,070
Shui,

473
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:03,830
what's the matter?

474
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,430
It's medicine for your hand injury.

475
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,140
[Prince Zong's Residence]

476
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,920
Su Yishui?

477
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,110
Yes.

478
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,960
Can't believe someone like Su Yishui

479
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,050
would personally make an ointment for Qingge

480
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,790
and lose composure at her doorstep.

481
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,110
He must have feelings for Qingge.

482
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,070
No wonder Qingge

483
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,650
was willing to offend the Eternal Sect

484
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,790
just to take him in as her disciple.

485
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,630
And she even allows him to do whatever he wants

486
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,580
on Mount Wester.

487
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,000
Treating him like this

488
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,260
would make him fall in love, of course.

489
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,010
However,

490
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,350
what's most concerning is...

491
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,680
What?

492
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,890
Qingge is nice to all her disciples.

493
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,560
But her exceptional care for Su Yishui

494
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,640
is indeed uncommon.

495
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,650
Could it be that

496
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,190
Qingge also has feelings for Su Yishui?

497
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,920
With Qingge's free-spirited nature,

498
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,840
how could she be bound by feelings?

499
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,630
Otherwise, I would have

500
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,230
proposed to her already.

501
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,360
I've always kept the position

502
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,400
of the legitimate son's wife for her.

503
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,230
One can never get love by force.

504
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,030
As the saying goes,

505
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,150
the person by your side

506
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,000
is the one most worthy of cherishing.

507
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,510
Guards!

508
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,710
Yes, Your Highness.

509
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,030
Give my order.

510
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,110
Starting today,

511
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,280
recruit skilled craftsmen to Mount Wester.

512
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,880
It's time to build

513
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,070
a proper palace for Qingge.

514
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,800
It shall be called

515
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,590
Consonance Palace.

516
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:01,550
Understood.

517
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,140
Being close is good,

518
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,680
but having consonance is even better.

519
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,840
Mu Qingge...

520
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,410
[Wester Sect]

521
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,280
What is this all about?

522
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,550
Prince Zong's legitimate son, Su Yu,

523
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,520
is going to build

524
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,360
the Consonance Palace for our Wester Sect.

525
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,800
Unsolicited favors

526
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,320
are always suspicious.

527
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,440
Yu has already spent the money.

528
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,020
It would be improper to reject his goodwill.

529
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,810
During this time,

530
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,070
Zeng Yi, you stay here and watch over the place.

531
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,110
You

532
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,190
go down the mountain with me.

533
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,280
Go down the mountain?

534
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,440
We're going to the capital

535
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,180
to handle an emergency.

536
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,190
[Fair, Capital]

537
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,360
Snacks from Dewei Restaurant.

538
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,440
Have some while they're hot.

539
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,170
So this is your "emergency"?

540
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,940
Isn't eating, drinking, and having fun important?

541
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,230
This is really tasty.

542
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,480
Yu said

543
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,960
it's even better than what the imperial chefs make.

544
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,880
Why should I eat

545
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
things recommended by others?

546
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,800
Well,

547
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,000
what about a recommendation from your master?

548
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,150
This collection of entertainment

549
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,790
contains the essence

550
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,290
of your master's lifelong research.

551
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,920
Let me take you to try them one by one.

552
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,670
For cuisines and having fun,

553
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,960
you even wrote a book?

554
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,550
Cuisines are worthy of delving into!

555
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,740
Only by tasting all the flavors in the world

556
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,830
can you comprehend the essence of the great way.

557
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,190
Come on,

558
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,360
after finishing all these,

Come and take a look!

569
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,280
Try it.

570
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,510
Bravo!

571
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,070
Waist drums, waist drums for sale!

572
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,780
Waist drums for sale, waist drums for sale!

573
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,480
Young lady,

574
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,350
come take a look at the waist drums.

575
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,800
This is the best-selling one in my shop.

576
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,070
[Enrollment Dept. of Wester Sect]

577
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,400
Turn around and let me see.

578
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,280
Is this also what you called an emergency?

579
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,490
After the Consonance Palace is built,

580
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,580
Mount Wester will expand greatly.

581
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,410
Won't it be too empty with just us there?

582
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,780
So we need to enroll a few disciples with various talents,

583
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,140
and good looks.

584
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,460
The point is being good-looking, right?

585
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,890
How about that one just now?

586
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,670
He has good potential

587
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,690
as well as

588
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,030
good looks.

589
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:48,960
I don't know.

590
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,330
Where are you going?

591
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,090
To buy some fruit.

592
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,290
Why are you suddenly going to buy fruit?

593
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,670
I am Wei Jiu.

594
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,710
I have

595
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,140
admired you for a long time, Master Mu.

596
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,750
In what way do you admire me?

597
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,840
Master Mu, you've reached

598
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,870
the Transcendence Realm at such a young age.

599
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,980
I heard that your new disciple, Su Yishui,

600
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,920
formed a Golden Core within just three years.

601
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,310
There must be a shortcut to advancement.

602
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,440
I'm willing to give up

603
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,570
the position of the Scarlet Sect's young lord

604
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,880
to join the Wester Sect instead.

605
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,470
Sorry,

606
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,540
our Shui is exceptionally talented.

607
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,230
There's no shortcut to advancement.

608
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,770
Your aptitude

609
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,010
seems just so-so.

610
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,650
Joining our Wester Sect wouldn't help you much.

611
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,510
Forget about it.

612
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,730
Master Mu, I've heard that

613
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,040
you prefer handsome disciples.

614
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,480
I'm not bragging,

615
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,480
but I think I'm quite a handsome man.

616
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,010
Besides, I've learned many special tricks.

617
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,070
If you take me in,

618
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,240
the Wester Sect will

619
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,320
surely stun the world in the future.

620
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,450
Wei Jiu, right?

621
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,110
Let's put aside everything else.

622
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,710
Just in terms of beauty,

623
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,280
you are nowhere as handsome

624
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,000
as my disciple Su Yishui.

625
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,540
Stun the world? Seriously?

626
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,000
Master Mu,

627
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,300
my beauty is well-known to all.

628
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,140
How could Su Yishui possibly beat me in that?

629
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,740
Are you intentionally embarrassing me, Master Mu?

630
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:02,590
Shui,

631
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,480
come over here.

632
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,360
Guys,

633
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,070
please tell me.

634
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,510
How does this man look?

635
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,190
Quite good.

636
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,390
Not bad...

637
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,070
Yeah, not bad.

638
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,710
Decent enough.

639
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,440
And how about this one?

640
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,480
Really handsome!

641
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,070
Look at his jaw-dropping beauty!

642
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,330
Well, then compare this person

643
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,590
with decent looks

644
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,230
to this one with jaw-dropping beauty.

645
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,280
Which one do you think

646
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,560
looks better?

647
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,550
The latter one, undoubtedly!

648
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,610
That's right!

649
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,000
Just leave!

650
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,150
Get down!

651
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,510
Go home!

652
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,760
See?

653
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,340
Comparison of goods isn't scary,

654
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,480
But comparison between people is frightening.

655
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,000
You can go home now.

656
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,780
Mu Qingge,

657
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,070
you'll surely regret this one day.

658
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,360
Just you wait!

659
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,400
Shui,

660
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,030
I'm so proud of you!

661
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:15,920
This is for you.

662
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,280
What's this?

663
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,850
The most important thing during this trip down the mountain

664
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,670
is this.

665
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,030
Take it.

666
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,700
It's a gift for your Golden Core formation.

667
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,440
Shui,

668
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,140
did you have fun in the past few days

669
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,150
in the capital?

670
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,320
Yes.

671
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,030
There is

672
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,420
much more fun

673
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,370
everywhere in this world.

674
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,730
In the future,

675
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,130
I will take you to explore and enjoy them

676
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,700
one by one.

677
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,250
Take this sword

678
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,360
and protect

679
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,240
this interesting mortal world together with me.
