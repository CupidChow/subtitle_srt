[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,890
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,120
Now, tell me,

4
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,759
what exactly happened to Mu Qingge?

5
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,789
Otherwise,

6
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,509
you two wouldn't need to stay here.

7
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,759
We dare not hide the truth.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,510
Mu Qingge indeed died once.

9
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,400
However,

10
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,840
you had her reincarnated and revived,

11
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,040
and you placed a restriction on her appearance,

12
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,510
making her unrecognizable to everyone.

13
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,310
What?

14
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,520
Guardian, please let me explain everything.

15
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,190
Out of consideration for my bond with that demoness—

16
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,030
master and disciple—

17
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,280
I used a half of my Golden Core to revive her?

18
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,960
Going to the netherworld to seal the Spirit Spring

19
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
was also something she entrusted me with?

20
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,960
Are you kidding me?

21
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,590
Every word I said was true.

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,310
Then what about Xue Ranran?

23
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,870
What does she have to do

24
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,680
with me reviving Mu Qingge?

25
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,520
Why does she carry

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,430
the energy of my Golden Core?

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,030
Actually...

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,360
there were two fruits

29
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,560
on the Reincarnation Tree.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,240
Besides Mu Qingge,

31
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,840
the other one was Mu Ranwu.

32
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,190
Xue Ranran...

33
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,470
Though her appearance is different from her past life,

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,870
she is Mu Ranwu.

35
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,360
Yes!

36
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,470
Xue Ranran is Mu Ranwu.

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,280
She accidentally

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,190
perished with Mu Qingge

39
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,400
back then.

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,280
When you activated the Reincarnation Tree,

41
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,680
you saved her as well.

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,360
Your Golden Core just so

43
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,960
happened to enter her body.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,360
Mu Ranwu?

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,840
Alright.

46
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,120
Since she's that

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,280
two-faced woman,

48
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,030
I don't need to hold back anymore.

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,190
Just kill her.

50
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,840
G-Guardian, you can't do that!

51
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,710
Why not?

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,630
You... you...

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,400
Since her...

54
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,710
reincarnation,

55
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,120
you've fallen in love with her.

56
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,000
Are you out of your minds?

57
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,870
Everything I say is true.

58
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,560
I can make a soul oath

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,520
that you really like Xue Ranran.

60
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,560
You personally brought her to Mount Wester

61
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,670
and treated her with great care.

62
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,970
You even risked your own life

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,710
to protect her.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,430
Everyone on Mount Wester knows it,

65
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,280
and many in the Heavenly Sects have seen it.

66
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,470
Guardian, you can ask around.

67
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,400
Even if it was true in the past,

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,360
it has nothing to do with the present me.

69
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,400
I would never make

70
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,750
the weak mistake of falling in love,

71
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,240
especially not with Mu Ranwu.

72
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,190
I suppose the reason

73
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,490
I haven't ascended in the past 20 years

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,430
might be because of her.

75
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,710
Alright.

76
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,630
I'm going to kill her now

77
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,000
and take out the Golden Core,

78
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,710
so that she won't disturb my cultivation.

79
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,560
Guardian!

80
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,470
Step aside.

81
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,190
Wu,

82
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,310
why are you here?

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,240
Please forgive me, Sir.

84
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,000
Since we were in the netherworld,

85
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,830
I've wanted to speak with you,

86
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,240
but never had the chance.

87
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,390
That's why...

88
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,159
Why have you started calling me "Sir"?

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,390
Uncle Ye Xin.

90
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,240
That's more like it.

91
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,510
If there's anything you want to ask me,

92
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,670
feel free to ask.

93
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,360
In my past life, someone gave me a Soul-Devouring Lock.

94
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,360
That was me.

95
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,720
So, from the moment

96
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
you took us in,

97
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,920
you had already planned for what would come next?

98
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,120
Wu,

99
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,560
as you know,

100
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,480
I really cared for you

101
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,750
and your sister.

102
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,680
It's just a pity

103
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,470
that your sister's talent was too high—

104
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,830
so high

105
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,070
that it became a hindrance.

106
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,720
So I used you

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,070
to eliminate her.

108
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,630
You're not happy about it?

109
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,720
No.

110
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,120
I'm not.

111
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:21,950
Of course not.

112
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,090
That was also your desire.

113
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,040
You took your sister's

114
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,310
spiritual power and Spirit Root,

115
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,310
but your cultivation declined instead of rising.

116
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,390
You're indeed not suited for the Heavenly Sects.

117
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,510
However,

118
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,010
considering that you helped me

119
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,480
escape the netherworld,

120
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,560
I should repay your kindness.

121
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,570
I'll help you remove the scar

122
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,300
that you care about the most.

123
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,120
Also,

124
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,720
do you still want to

125
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,120
be above your sister?

126
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,630
Uncle Ye Xin, can you help me?

127
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,870
I'll teach you some

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,800
special cultivation methods.

129
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,630
As long as you obediently

130
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,640
do what I told you to do,

131
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,100
I promise you'll get what you want.

132
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:36,830
Master,

133
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,600
I made some elixirs

134
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
and was about to bring them to you.

135
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,390
You still have some injuries.

136
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,270
These elixirs should be very effective.

137
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,159
So you're Mu Ranwu.

138
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,480
Yu Tong and Yu Chen told me

139
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,190
that I've fallen in love with you.

140
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,480
That's absolute nonsense.

141
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,310
It seems that my two uncle masters

142
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,920
are helping me cover up my identity.

143
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,870
The most boring thing in the world

144
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,070
is those lovesick men and women

145
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,920
clinging to each other through life and death.

146
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,480
How could I be one of those

147
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,510
who indulge in love and romance?

148
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,430
Tell me.

149
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,750
What is your true intention

150
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,120
in being by my side?

151
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,630
What intention could I have?

152
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,040
My only intention

153
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,360
is you, Master.

154
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,390
It's just that you've forgotten.

155
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,240
We've long made an oath

156
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,430
to never part

157
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,120
and have confessed our true feelings to each other.

158
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,920
To save me

159
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,680
and protect me,

160
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,120
you brought me to Mount Wester.

161
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,680
Look,

162
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,040
this tree.

163
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,190
We planted it together

164
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,600
shortly after I came to Mount Wester.

165
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,070
You said that

166
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,720
with a tree,

167
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,920
we had roots,

168
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,680
and with roots, we had a home.

169
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,390
Along the way,

170
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,720
you almost lost your life

171
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,120
just to protect me.

172
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,630
But you

173
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,800
have forgotten all of this.

174
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,310
You don't need to put on

175
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,510
this pitiful face

176
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,310
to deceive me.

177
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,000
You're the younger sister

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,920
of that demoness Mu Qingge.

179
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,450
I remember seeing you once or twice

180
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,310
in the Wester Sect.

181
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,190
Even if I did fall in love with someone,

182
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,510
what about you

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
would make me fall for you?

184
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,750
What about me?

185
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,530
Since you don't remember,

186
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,450
I'll help you.

187
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,030
Do you remember now?

188
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,030
How dare you do this to me?

189
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,480
Do you believe

190
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,200
I will kill you right now

191
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,120
and take back my Golden Core?

192
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,360
The Golden Core inside me is indeed yours.

193
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,600
If you remembered everything

194
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
and wanted me to return the Golden Core,

195
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,030
I wouldn't say a word.

196
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,550
But what is this now?

197
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,820
Are you really going to kill me?

198
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,240
Shui.

199
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,240
Master.

200
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,970
Master.

201
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,080
Su Yishui.

202
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,030
Master!

203
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:48,690
Get away!

204
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:49,910
Stay away from me!

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,600
Su Yishui,

206
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
have these past 10 years been for nothing

207
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,080
to you?

208
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,630
You've turned back into that brat,

209
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,030
haven't you?

210
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,390
Let me tell you,

211
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,520
if you dare

212
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,550
lay even a finger on Ranran,

213
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,000
I will gather all our brothers

214
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,950
to fight you to the death!

215
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,080
Oh no.

216
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,840
Ranran's spiritual power is almost depleted.

217
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,600
With the Soul-Devouring Lock devouring her,

218
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,270
I'm afraid her primal power might dry up.

219
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,600
Are you alright?

220
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,120
The one casting the spell is working for Mu Qingge.

221
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,910
She's trying to steal your spiritual power?

222
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,150
Yes.

223
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,870
I've stabilized the spiritual power inside you.

224
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,630
You won't be in danger for now.

225
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,030
Thank you, Master.

226
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,480
I just don't want

227
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,600
your spiritual power to be drained,

228
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,720
damaging my Golden Core.

229
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,390
And for some reason,

230
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,320
whenever I try to take your Golden Core,

231
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,630
my head starts buzzing.

232
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,870
Anyway, you can't escape my grasp.

233
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,910
I won't kill you for now.

234
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,670
Take her away

235
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,270
and watch her closely.

236
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
Don't let her appear before me again

237
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,360
before I sort out these matters.

238
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,270
Also, drive my three stupid disciples

239
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:41,960
off the mountain.

240
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,200
Yes.

241
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,320
Su Yishui?

242
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,950
He now actually

243
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,910
has the ability to break my spell.

244
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,030
Now, Mu Qingge only has

245
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,840
a little spiritual power left.

246
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,750
She used her Formless Spirit Root as a sacrifice

247
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,970
and returned Su Yishui's spiritual soul

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
to him.

249
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,670
As expected of something Mu Qingge would do.

250
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,800
However,

251
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,880
your spiritual power is enough now.

252
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,600
Continue cultivating with the method

253
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,360
I taught you.

254
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,200
When I need you,

255
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,670
I will come to call you.

256
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,870
This is the Fanyao battlefield?

257
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,030
Yu Chen said I entered the netherworld

258
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,720
and sealed the Spirit Spring from here.

259
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,440
The Supreme Blood Moon

260
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,550
appears with the blood.

261
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,240
The malicious energy on this battlefield

262
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,270
has already been exhausted.

263
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,130
The Blood Moon

264
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,000
will not appear for now.

265
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,120
I can only wait for the right time

266
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,650
and enter the netherworld with the secret key.

267
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,360
They said that

268
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,240
it was someone named Ye Xin who made me lose my memory.

269
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,680
Who exactly is this person,

270
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
and what is their purpose?

271
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,960
Yu Chen discovered

272
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,840
that he had appeared in the capital city.

273
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,430
So,

274
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,790
you really are Mu.

275
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,750
Great.

276
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,750
Liang used to always tell me

277
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,200
you resembled Mu,

278
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,320
but I never believed it.

279
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,250
Good, good.

280
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,350
This is wonderful.

281
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,240
I can finally get to drink

282
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,870
Mu's Mistaken Divine again.

283
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,480
Alright.

284
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,950
You finally saw Qingge again,

285
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,240
and all you can think about is drinking?

286
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,860
Thank you, guys.

287
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,630
Although I only have

288
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,870
a faint memory of the past,

289
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,720
whether it's before

290
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,600
or now,

291
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,480
you're always my best friends.

292
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm glad to see you

293
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,030
like this now.

294
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,950
I'm really happy.

295
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,120
Happy?

296
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,910
That brat Su Yishui

297
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,000
is out of control now.

298
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,350
He's even deceiving us

299
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,150
and being the master

300
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,390
of his own master.

301
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,510
What a twisted fate.

302
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,360
You two really have a twisted fate.

303
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,360
Mu,

304
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,480
how should I persuade you?

305
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,750
There's no such thing as twisted fate or good fate

306
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,580
in this world.

307
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,870
All fates

308
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,550
are created by ourselves,

309
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,440
right?

310
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,550
No matter what the current situation is,

311
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,790
I should find a way

312
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,900
to break through it, right?

313
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,420
Have you found any clues

314
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,640
about the talisman made by the Falling Water

315
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,790
I asked you to investigate?

316
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,910
The talisman that was cast

317
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,560
on Su Yishui should be a Soul-Cleansing Charm.

318
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,750
This talisman washes away

319
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,810
all memories after a person

320
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,720
has experienced love,

321
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,220
causing them to return to how they were before.

322
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,240
No wonder he only remembers

323
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,550
when he first arrived at Mount Wester and hated his master the most,

324
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,970
turning back into that brat

325
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,320
who didn't understand love.

326
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,370
So, how can we undo

327
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,750
this Soul-Cleansing Charm?

328
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,210
Even you,

329
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,590
one of the best talismanic cultivators in the universe,

330
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,870
can't do anything about it?

331
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,320
The Soul-Cleansing Charm

332
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,960
cast on Su Yishui was made from Falling Water

333
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,540
from the netherworld.

334
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,910
Though I'm skilled in talismans,

335
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,980
I am just a mortal after all.

336
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,740
I am powerless against things

337
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,260
from the netherworld.

338
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,100
If it can't truly be undone,

339
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,150
does that mean he really will never remember me

340
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,270
for the rest of his life?

341
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,490
This Soul-Cleansing Charm was cast by Ye Xin.

342
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,870
Since he has the ability

343
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,120
to mobilize the Falling Water from the netherworld,

344
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,600
does he also have the power to undo

345
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,720
this Soul-Cleansing Charm?

346
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,630
We've been wondering about the background

347
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,800
of this person

348
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,440
who has such profound skills,

349
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,350
yet we found no leads at all.

350
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,770
I don't understand

351
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,080
what Uncle Ye Xin intends to do either.

352
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,510
Back then, he adopted me

353
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,840
and my sister Mu Ranwu.

354
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,550
From the bits of memories

355
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,740
I can recall,

356
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,270
he truly treated us well.

357
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,400
But I also remember

358
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,670
that when I tried to seal the Spirit Spring

359
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,600
back into the netherworld,

360
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,440
he stopped me

361
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,550
and severely injured me.

362
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,120
That was why I used

363
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,820
the talisman that Alcohol Immortal gave me

364
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,150
to seal him with all my strength.

365
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,880
But why did he want to seize the Spirit Spring?

366
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,630
And now, what are his intentions

367
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,270
in placing this Soul-Cleansing Charm?

368
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,150
Aside from sealing him,

369
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,480
how much of the past

370
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,840
do you remember?

371
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,600
We can only wait and see

372
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,360
what his next move will be.

373
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,320
I'll send a letter to Elder Wen

374
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,670
and see if he can find any leads

375
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,720
on Uncle Ye Xin.

376
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,440
If not,

377
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,610
at least he can remind all the sects to be on guard.

378
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,630
Okay.

379
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,320
After Liang and I return to Mount Cuiwei,

380
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,270
we'll try to come up with a plan.

381
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,240
Thank you.

382
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,270
Don't mention it.

383
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,920
Didn't we agree

384
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,550
to travel the Nine Lands together

385
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,500
and taste all the delicacies of the world?

386
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,750
Why do these things

387
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,160
feel like they happened just yesterday,

388
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,839
but in the blink of an eye,

389
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,880
everything has turned out like this?

390
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,790
Can't sleep?

391
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,640
Come on.

392
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,200
I'll drink with you for a while.

393
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,720
To be honest,

394
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,240
the year you perished,

395
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,310
I hated Su Yishui deeply.

396
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,640
Even though later I learned

397
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,590
he was deceived,

398
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,350
and he was more devastated and regretful

399
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,160
than anyone else,

400
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,790
I still resented him.

401
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,160
All these years,

402
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,550
I've never shown him a kind face.

403
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,750
However,

404
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,310
come to think of it,

405
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,790
I also saw with my own eyes

406
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,510
how that brat looked that year—

407
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,720
withered,

408
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,410
frantically searching for a way

409
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,200
to revive you.

410
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,350
Though I resented him,

411
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,690
I knew how much

412
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,070
he had sacrificed.

413
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,240
No one expected that when you were revived,

414
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,590
you'd lose your previous memories.

415
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,240
Now,

416
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,230
he's forgotten everything.

417
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,960
It's as if everything—the past, the grudges, the affections—

418
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,200
has been settled.

419
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,550
The Spirit Spring has returned to its place,

420
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,610
and both the human realm and netherworld

421
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,550
have returned to peace.

422
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,070
It's as if everything

423
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,030
has gone back to the starting point.

424
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,020
So, I suggest

425
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,080
that the two of you might as well

426
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,310
take this opportunity

427
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,310
to end everything,

428
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,200
part ways,

429
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,240
and live your separate lives in peace.

430
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,220
Oh, Master,

431
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,550
my villa on Tea Inscription Mountain

432
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,760
was originally prepared for you.

433
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,510
You should go there.

434
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,880
You can do whatever you want,

435
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,440
without dwelling on the past,

436
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,440
and live a happy life.

437
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,640
If I don't dwell on the past,

438
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,110
does that mean it's not there anymore?

439
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,000
Liang Wumeng once said that

440
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,440
this was the fate between him and me.

441
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,750
But I don't believe in fate.

442
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,720
I don't believe that all that happened

443
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,550
over the past twenty-odd years,

444
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,240
from Mu Qingge to Xue Ranran,

445
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,480
hasn't left any traces

446
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,590
in his heart.

447
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,070
I don't believe he is still just the same young man

448
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,240
full of malicious energy from back then.

449
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:56,920
Ranran,

450
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,510
you...

451
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,510
I won't give up on him.

452
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,350
I will definitely help him remember everything.

453
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,400
Well,

454
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,680
I understand your personality.

455
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,400
No matter how much I try to persuade you, you won't change your mind.

456
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,440
But I've thought about it.

457
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,130
It's useless to just wait like this

458
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,070
and do nothing.

459
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,920
Ye Xin cast a Soul-Cleansing Charm on Master.

460
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,750
Since he's taken such a measure,

461
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,240
it means that Master, who has lost his memory,

462
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,400
is of use to him.

463
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:38,930
Last time,

464
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,160
in Uncle Ye Xin's cabin,

465
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,000
I found quite a few old books and notes.

466
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,090
Anyway, there's nowhere else to start looking.

467
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,400
Maybe there will be

468
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,000
some clues and answers in them.

469
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,260
[Prince Ping's residence]

470
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,960
After Prince Zong ascended to the throne,

471
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,450
it seems that due to some agreement

472
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
with Mu Qingge,

473
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,990
the family of Prince Ping was spared

474
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,400
from purging or execution.

475
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,350
They only got exiled to the border

476
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,200
and forbidden to return to the capital.

477
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,070
But Prince Ping's family

478
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,440
has been scattered.

479
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,640
The most unfortunate thing is that

480
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,200
Miss Su Xiaoxiao

481
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,450
had already been sent on a mission

482
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,440
by the prince before this.

483
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,200
She met with an accident

484
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,510
and lost her life.

485
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,750
[Be Righteous]

486
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,000
Su Yishui, you traitor,

487
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,970
you actually dared to come

488
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,830
to the capital again?

489
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,070
Madam Battle

490
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,070
will definitely deal with you…

491
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
you devil!

492
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,710
You mean Mu Qingge?

493
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,830
If she doesn't come to me,

494
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,550
I'll go to her.

495
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,790
You mere commoners.

496
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,450
I can't be bothered to talk to you.

497
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,030
Go back and tell Mu Qingge

498
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,230
that I'll settle the bill

499
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,680
between her and me in a few days.

500
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,200
Tell her to be well prepared.

501
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,260
[Wester Sect]

502
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,110
Guardian.

503
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,720
G-Guardian,

504
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,820
you're finally back.

505
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,510
Why so flustered?

506
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,670
We...

507
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,510
thought you went to the imperial palace.

508
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,480
Yes.

509
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,840
I wish I could have.

510
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,870
But I took a quick glance.

511
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,110
The imperial palace

512
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,030
was shielded

513
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:46,730
by a powerful formation.

514
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,340
The person who set up this formation

515
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,890
has cultivation far beyond the Transcendence Realm.

516
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,070
There is no one in the Heavenly Sects with this kind of ability.

517
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The Reborn Mu Qingge

518
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,310
couldn't possibly have gained such power

519
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,160
in such a short time.

520
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,110
So,

521
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,550
it must be Ye Xin

522
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,960
who cast the Soul-Cleansing Charm on me.

523
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,240
Ye Xin really is working with them?

524
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,640
I'd like to see

525
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,130
what the three of them

526
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,240
are up to together.

527
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:09,210
Go.

528
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,750
Keep a close eye on the capital.

529
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,440
Yes.

530
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,440
Wait.

531
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,830
Where's Xue Ranran?

532
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,110
Why can't I sense the energy of my other half

533
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,310
of the Golden Core in Mount Wester?

534
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,350
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on her?

535
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,110
Where is she?

536
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,310
We've failed in our duties.

537
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,350
Please punish us, Guardian.

538
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,030
Was it that you couldn't keep an eye on her,

539
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,590
or that you didn't want to?

540
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,240
Forget it.

541
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,410
If it weren't for knowing

542
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,680
that you've been loyal all these years,

543
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,790
I wouldn't let you off so easily.

544
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,920
Anyway, Xue Ranran

545
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,960
carries the energy of my Golden Core.

546
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,400
No matter where she runs,

547
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,510
I can pull her back.

548
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,750
Let her enjoy her freedom for a few days.

549
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:53,930
After I take care of

550
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,640
the more important thing,

551
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,460
I'll deal with her.

552
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,680
Wasn't this room

553
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,350
rearranged?

554
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,640
Why are these things still here?

555
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,680
Some of these

556
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,070
are things you use regularly,

557
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:33,930
and some are things

558
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
you specially kept.

559
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,030
We didn't dare to handle them carelessly.

560
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,720
What is this?

561
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,480
These

562
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,160
are the cultivation methods you had your disciples copy

563
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,550
as punishment when teaching them in the past.

564
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,260
These years have truly been extremely dull.

565
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,310
Guardian,

566
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,680
actually,

567
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,340
you really were a good master.

568
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,470
You've been dedicated to your disciples.

the reason I stayed here

isn't that I really intend

Yes.

758
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,890
I didn't sleep all night, and it still turned out like this.

759
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,310
I really am not cut out for this.

760
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,510
If you want to kill me, just tell me.

761
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,440
No need to be so vicious.

762
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,920
Guardian, even if you think

763
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,110
my cooking skills are not as good as Ranran's,

764
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,840
there's no need to say such hurtful things.

765
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,070
Yu Chen and I have always been poor cooks.

766
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,190
You know that.

767
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,960
Besides,

768
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,230
since Ranran came here,

769
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,030
you've only eaten the meals she made.

770
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,150
In the past, I only ate the meals she made?

771
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,000
This Xue Ranran

772
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,160
must have secretly

773
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,000
cast some kind of spell on me.

774
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,360
Even the meal you liked yesterday

775
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,400
was made by Ranran

776
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,450
before she left.

777
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,000
She was worried that after she left,

778
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,630
you wouldn't be used

779
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,530
to the meals we made,

780
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,800
so she had us learn to cook like she does.

781
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,400
But we've already done our best to replicate it.

782
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,150
We didn't expect that cooking

783
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,440
is even harder than cultivating.

784
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
If I had known it was made by her,

785
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,110
I wouldn't have touched that dish at all.

786
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,640
In this life, Mu Ranwu

787
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,550
is actually like Mu Qingge—

788
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,460
fond of cooking.

789
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,590
How much of my time

790
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,000
have these two sisters wasted?

791
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,630
Oh, Guardian,

792
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:16,970
there's news

793
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,230
about Mu Qingge, whom you ordered us

794
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,030
to keep an eye on before.

795
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,630
Strange.

796
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,800
Why doesn't the energy of my Golden Core

797
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,590
feel strong inside Mu Qingge?

798
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,230
Could it be that this half of my Golden Core

799
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,590
has all been absorbed

800
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,670
by that fruit, Xue Ranran?

801
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,150
Sovereign,

802
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,000
it's said that she established a sect last month.

803
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,280
In just over a month,

804
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,440
she has already gathered many followers,

805
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,000
including some experts

806
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,230
who have already had their cores formed.

807
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,360
You're being quite high-profile here.

808
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,840
All her disciples say that

809
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,800
cultivating under her guidance

810
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,790
leads to rapid advancement,

811
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,150
with tremendous progress every day.

812
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,110
The spiritual power of the light formation in front of her is extremely strong.

813
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,880
It's from the same powerful cultivator who created

814
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,190
the formation protecting the imperial city.

815
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,440
I'm afraid it's that Ye Xin again.

816
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,670
This person is unfathomable.

817
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,230
His strength is far beyond mine.

818
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,800
We must not act recklessly.

819
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,800
Keep a close watch on Mu Qingge.

820
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,550
She must be scheming something

821
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,590
by recruiting disciples widely.

822
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,710
Once I break the formation of that expert,

823
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,190
I'll deal with her.

824
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,470
-Yes.
-Yes.

825
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,110
She did remind me of one thing though.

826
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,070
To get revenge,

827
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,280
the Wester Sect

828
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,550
indeed needs some manpower.

829
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,150
Yu Tong, Yu Chen,

830
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,230
pass on my orders.

831
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,920
-Yes.
-Yes.

832
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,510
Master is actually

833
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,320
taking in disciples again.

834
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,070
Does this mean we have a chance

835
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,150
to return to the Wester Sect?

836
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,840
No, that's not right.

837
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,330
When Master drove us down the mountain,

838
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,000
he said he had no intention of taking in disciples in this life.

839
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,920
He even said taking us in was a mistake.

840
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,710
It's only been a few days.

841
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,070
Why has he started taking in disciples again?

842
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,930
Perhaps these past few days,

843
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,880
he's been bored,

844
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,890
realizing that

845
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,880
he's lonely without us.

846
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,190
Let's go.

847
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,110
When are we going up the mountain?

848
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,000
To be honest,

849
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,510
this time, the Guardian's requirements

850
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,630
for disciples' spiritual power and cultivation

851
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,710
are much higher than before.

852
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,030
Given the current qualifications of the three of you,

853
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,630
I'm afraid…

854
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,630
But spiritual power isn't the only factor

855
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,440
the Guardian considers.

856
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,360
He reserved one spot

857
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,320
for special consideration.

858
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,550
What spot? Just tell us.

859
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,510
It's for people who can make food that suits the Guardian's taste.

860
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,110
We're doomed.

861
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,710
Now we have no chance at all.

862
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,840
Looks like we'll never be able to

863
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,440
return to the Wester Sect in this lifetime.

864
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,000
Get out!

865
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,480
You actually dare to call yourselves master chefs?

866
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,400
None of you can cook!

867
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,550
Keep looking!

868
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,150
-Yes.
-Yes.

869
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,840
Soul-Cleansing Charm?

870
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,930
Maybe I can find it

871
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,710
in the Omnipotent Talismans Manual.

872
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,400
It's in the talisman section, third row.

873
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,400
Why is this Xue Ranran

874
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,070
everywhere?

875
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,440
It's like being hunted.

876
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,110
Why is there no record

877
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,150
of the Soul-Cleansing Charm anywhere?

878
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,920
This Ye Xin.

879
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,710
Collection of Entertainment?

880
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,360
The book written by Mu Qingge?

881
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,910
I heard she's an expert in enjoying life.

882
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,670
I'd like to see what she wrote.

883
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,510
Boring.

884
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,360
Chapter of Fierce Beasts?

885
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,590
This Mu Qingge

886
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,920
actually dared to write about me this way?

887
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,440
In comparison, Xue Ranran seems

888
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,380
more reliable.

889
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,710
Pig's blood?

890
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,030
When have I ever eaten such filth?

891
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,630
Anti-aging and anti-decline?

892
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,030
Ridiculous.

893
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,440
Why would I need that?

894
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,320
This one is not bad though.

895
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,500
[Puxin Village]

896
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,410
Wish you all the best.

897
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,630
Great.

898
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,670
After the Nine-Headed Kui'ao was eliminated,

899
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,840
the village has finally regained its vitality.

900
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,400
Master mentioned before

901
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,880
that Uncle Ye Xin looked familiar.

902
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,070
Could they have met

903
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,190
a long time ago?

904
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,400
Is it me and Mu Ranwu from back then?

905
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,030
They don't look like us.

906
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,920
So who could they be?

907
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,320
There are too many mysteries surrounding Uncle Ye Xin.

908
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,960
Who is he really?

909
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,070
And why did he adopt us?

910
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,710
The answer is probably in this portrait.

911
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,510
Found it.

912
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,480
So, the Soul-Cleansing Charm

913
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,710
is unbreakable.

914
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,280
But if the person who was cast with it

915
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,480
falls in love again

916
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,440
with their forgotten lover,

917
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,150
they will naturally remember everything.
