00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,920
[Episode 11]

3
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,870
Ranran.

4
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,090
As soon as I got here, I smelled

5
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,840
a strong and heavy odor,

6
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,280
like a pot about to burn through.

7
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,680
Is there something troubling you?

8
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,079
Can I help?

9
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,079
If I tell you,

10
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,120
don't be shocked.

11
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,870
You are a spirit fruit of the Reincarnation Tree?

12
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,120
Don't worry,

13
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:37,810
I'll help you

14
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,800
keep this secret.

15
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,560
But when I touch you,

16
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,590
you don't feel any different

17
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,630
from our mortal bodies.

18
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,470
Are you upset

19
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,710
because Master

20
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,520
won't tell you about your origins

21
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,470
and you can't figure out your past?

22
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
In the end,

23
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,590
without Master,

24
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,150
there wouldn't be the Xue Ranran of today.

25
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,680
Master has shown me great kindness.

26
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,340
How can I

27
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,710
resent Master?

28
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,000
However,

29
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,190
I just feel a bit empty inside.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Master must have his reasons

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
for doing this.

32
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,910
And he hasn't stopped me

33
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,750
from seeking answers.

34
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,360
I need to rely on myself

35
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,870
to send Ling Xiao

36
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,350
back safely.

37
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,970
Someone must truly cherish you,

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,750
care for you deeply,

39
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,190
to be willing to split their soul

40
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,960
to protect, accompany, and support you.

41
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,730
Cultivate hard

42
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,310
to help your Ling Xiao nourish its soul power

43
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,800
and awaken its memories with the soul owner

44
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,540
and connection.

45
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
I will find the answer!

46
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,550
[Eternal Sect]

47
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,330
The disciple watching Wei Jiu

48
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,190
saw it clearly.

49
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,240
After Wei Jiu obtained the key,

50
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,710
he didn't get the Spirit Spring.

51
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,120
Frustrated and angry,

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,000
he ambushed Su Yishui

53
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,000
but was still defeated by Su Yishui.

54
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,780
If that's the case,

55
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,400
this Spirit Spring

56
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,430
truly hasn't returned to the netherworld.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,270
Now even Mu Qingge

58
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,510
doesn't know the whereabouts of the Spirit Spring.

59
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,920
This is troublesome.

60
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,260
This demoness is cunning and deceitful.

61
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,730
We can't trust her easily.

62
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,830
We still need to

63
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,630
get a clear answer.

64
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,370
[Exorcising Tower, Eternal Sect]

65
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,790
You've locked me in the tower

66
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,920
since I came to Mount Eternal.

67
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,830
I stood on the side of the righteous

68
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,800
Heavenly Sects on Mount Absolute.

69
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,000
Do you still not trust me?

70
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,630
If you revealed the whereabouts of the Spirit Spring,

71
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,620
completely resolving the concerns of the Heavenly Sects,

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,760
you wouldn't

73
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,560
need to suffer here.

74
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,830
When my body perished and soul scattered,

75
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,620
the Spirit Spring departed on its own.

76
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,830
I truly don't know.

77
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,200
I have long been useless to the Spirit Spring

78
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,650
and I can't even sense

79
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,720
where it is.

80
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,900
If you really don't know,

81
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,480
then you'll have to stay here

82
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,680
for some more time.

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,360
When your demonic bones

84
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,310
are thoroughly cleansed

85
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,630
and the Spirit Spring has nothing to attach to,

86
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,700
then we'll discuss the future.

87
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Back then,

88
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,240
you stagnated in the early Nascent Soul stage

89
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,830
with no further progress due to unresolvable karma from killing.

90
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,750
Counting the days,

91
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,000
your heavenly tribulation must be approaching, right?

92
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,580
I am willing to resolve your worries.

93
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,160
The Spirit Spring still shows no response.

94
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,160
Why don't we try to find a way now

95
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,510
to retrieve the key to the netherworld,

96
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,070
so we don't have to run back and forth later?

97
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,800
You...

98
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,830
When did you...

99
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,160
When I was using the demonic vine to absorb Wei Jiu's spiritual power,

100
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,510
he hid the key in his void.

101
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,790
I took it back while I was at it.

102
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,360
Then,

103
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,360
about the soul oath...

104
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,760
He broke the oath first,

105
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,040
so naturally, I'm no longer bound by it.

106
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,180
I also took the opportunity to place

107
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,230
a Spirit-Detecting Curse in his void.

108
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,390
He was so preoccupied with

109
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,390
the spiritual power I absorbed from him

110
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,310
that he didn't notice at all.

111
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,750
A Spirit-Detecting Curse?

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,720
Then doesn't that mean you can

113
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,190
monitor his spiritual power fluctuations at any time?

114
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,290
The Spirit Spring originates from

115
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,760
the founder of the Celestial Sect,

116
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,800
the Mortal-Demon Lord.

117
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,830
Wei Jiu is a descendant of the Celestial Sect.

118
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,720
He's been single-mindedly seeking the Spirit Spring.

119
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,800
If one plan fails,

120
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,600
he might have ways as a demonic cultivator

121
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,950
to find the whereabouts of the Spirit Spring.

122
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,350
We can't go wrong to keep an eye on him.

123
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,950
No wonder Wei Jiu said

124
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,770
you're cunning and treacherous.

125
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,750
No matter how urgent the Spirit Spring matter is, we have to wait.

126
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,240
Right now,

127
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,750
we still need to resolve the trouble

128
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,360
with the Soul-Devouring Lock.

129
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,250
But Ranran's spiritual power is insufficient

130
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,190
and can't find a solution.

131
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,800
Fortunately, you've absorbed

132
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,920
Wei Jiu's Golden Core power,

133
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,040
allowing you to manipulate the Resentment Liquid

134
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,270
to suppress Mu Ranwu's spiritual power.

135
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,500
She's also held up in the Eternal Sect,

136
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,560
so  she doesn't pose

137
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,360
a threat to Ranran for now.

138
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,240
Variables are hard to control.

139
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,450
We must stay vigilant.

140
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,840
Master used demonic vines

141
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,830
against Wei Jiu.

142
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,680
That's something the righteous sect

143
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,920
explicitly forbids as demonic magic.

144
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,120
Senior, don't shout so loudly.

145
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,240
Master using demonic magic

146
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,909
isn't something that can be resolved by my silence.

147
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,070
If Wei Jiu

148
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,560
spreads the news about Master

149
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,370
using demonic magic,

150
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:37,950
then...

151
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,920
Then what should we do?

152
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,070
Wei Jiu would be more afraid of this matter

153
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,040
being spread around.

154
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,600
Senior,

155
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,270
given the circumstances at that time,

156
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,600
if Master hadn't used that unexpected move,

157
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:48,890
all of us

158
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,580
would have certainly died at Wei Jiu's hands.

159
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,070
Of course I know that.

160
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,680
But...

161
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,650
But it's still demonic magic after all.

162
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,920
And...

163
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,420
And I never thought

164
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,910
that our Master, who usually appears so immortal-like,

165
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,800
would be like this.

166
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,090
Whether one is righteous or demonic

167
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,290
depends on what one does.

168
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,720
Master used that vine

169
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,120
to fight against demonic cultivators and protect us.

170
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,590
How does eliminating evil

171
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,690
and saving people not follow

172
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,920
the Heavenly righteous sects' principles?

173
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,520
Master is truly remarkable.

174
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,630
Master.

175
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,890
All things grow

176
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,680
in their own way.

177
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,010
Whether one is demonic or immortal

178
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,870
is determined by the heart.

179
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,320
How can that which can save a life

180
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,080
be considered demonic?

181
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,080
However,

182
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,840
such powerful demonic magic

183
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,080
can be cultivated by me

184
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,150
but not you all.

185
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,510
Understand?

186
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,960
Understood, Master.

187
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,480
You've been practicing basic pill formulas

188
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,200
for some time now.

189
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,270
Today, do you dare to challenge advanced pill formulas?

190
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,390
Scarlet wood fruit,

191
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,230
imperial wood,

192
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,910
glory seeds,

193
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,330
celestial crystal, jade essence...

194
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,390
These are all top rare spiritual treasures.

195
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,350
You're willing to let us practice with them?

196
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,670
Think carefully

197
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,540
about how to use these spiritual treasures.

198
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,670
Relying solely on cultivation

199
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,440
makes it difficult to quickly replenish spiritual power.

200
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,600
What about alchemy?

201
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,960
Mu Qingge's talent for alchemy

202
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,360
was unmatched in the world.

203
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,670
If Ranran can refine the Spirit-Nourishing Pill...

204
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,240
Master and the current Ranran

205
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,030
can't be compared.

206
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,910
She's just started learning the art of alchemy.

207
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,570
I think you've gone mad.

208
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,480
I'm certain

209
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,080
that those things fused into her spirit

210
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,030
that belong to her

211
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,580
cannot be taken away by anyone.

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Master.

213
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,670
I have a question to ask.

214
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,200
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

215
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
May we be allowed to go down the mountain

216
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,600
to visit our families for a few days?

217
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,760
I allow you to go down the mountain for three days

218
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,670
to reunite with your families.

219
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,050
Don't forget your studies.

220
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,390
Thank you, Master.

221
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,030
Everyone has family to reunite with.

222
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,150
I have no home to return to.

223
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,240
Only you are left to keep me company,

224
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:28,960
Ling Xiao.

225
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,630
Who said you don't have a home?

226
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,720
Master.

227
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,200
Plant this.

228
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,910
Someone once told me

229
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,270
that planting a tree somewhere

230
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,320
means you have a home there.

231
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,390
Mount Wester will be your home from now on.

232
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,000
You are no longer

233
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,030
homeless.

234
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,270
I

235
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,200
will have a home from now on.

236
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
It will also protect you

237
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,670
and bring you good fortune in all things.

238
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,270
What's that?

239
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,420
It smells nice

240
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,630
with a hint of a burnt odor.

241
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:00,820
Is this

242
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,550
a mooncake?

243
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,270
It's fitting for the Mid-Autumn Festival.

244
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,390
I just casually baked some.

245
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,670
If you don't want to eat them, that's fine.

246
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,390
You made these for me yourself.

247
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,320
I want to eat them.

248
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,360
Thank you, Master.

249
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,080
Master,

250
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,320
this mooncake is exceptionally crispy.

251
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,120
I've never had anything like it before.

252
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,150
So?

253
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,750
In return,

254
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,690
I know a place that also makes

255
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,550
really delicious mooncakes.

256
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,830
Let me take you there to try them.

257
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,910
Let's go, Master.

258
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,270
If we hesitate any longer, we won't be able to get in line.

259
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,320
Master, hurry and try them.

260
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,000
Their mooncakes are really delicious.

261
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,810
Having you accompany me

262
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,930
makes me so happy.

263
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,910
Master,

264
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,480
can we spend every Mid-Autumn Festival together

265
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,510
from now on?

266
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,270
Every year?

267
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,790
Is there anything else you want to do now?

268
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,470
Since we've finally come down from the mountain,

269
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,520
there is one place

270
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,740
I'd really like to visit.

271
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,040
Let's go.

272
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,740
[Xue Village]

273
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,840
Ranran,

274
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,170
during these days you were missing,

275
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,600
I was so worried about you.

276
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,630
But now that I see you're safe,

277
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,870
I'm relieved.

278
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,600
It's so unexpected.

279
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,080
You went up the mountain to become an immortal.

280
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,360
I didn't expect it myself.

281
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,200
To think that I,

282
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,600
Xue Ranran, who's so enamored with the mortal world,

283
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,120
would have a destined connection with immortality.

284
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,270
Are you comfortable living on the mountain?

285
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,670
I saw your Master.

286
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,790
He looks quite cold.

287
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,320
Don't worry.

288
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,670
Master was afraid I'd be lonely

289
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,550
by myself on the mountain,

290
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,150
so he specially accompanied me down for the holiday.

291
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,080
He bought all these delicious treats.

292
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,820
Really?

293
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,200
He also took me

294
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,470
to plant a tree on Mount Wester.

295
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,790
From now on, I'll have a home on Mount Wester.

296
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,080
If that's the case, then I can rest assured.

297
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,120
Ranran,

298
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,870
remember to come visit me often in the future.

299
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,790
I might not

300
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,170
have walked this path ten thousand times before,

301
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,390
but I've certainly walked it thousands of times.

302
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,200
But today,

303
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,270
it feels especially different.

304
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,790
Today,

305
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,200
Master is accompanying me

306
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,480
and even lighting the way for me.

307
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,630
It's wonderful.

308
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,530
Are you ready to go back now?

309
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,000
No.

310
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,540
I just realized

311
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,790
there's still one thing I forgot.

312
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,720
If you forgot something, let's go buy it quickly.

313
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,030
No,

314
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,120
we can't buy it.

315
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,390
We have to steal it.

316
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,030
Steal?

317
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,960
In my hometown, there's a custom.

318
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,320
As long as an unmarried woman

319
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,440
steals a good green onion

320
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,360
from another person's garden

321
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,240
on the Mid-Autumn Festival,

322
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,170
she will marry a good husband in the future.

323
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,200
So,

324
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,670
if I don't manage to steal any green onions,

325
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,550
this Mid-Autumn Festival won't be complete.

326
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,510
Stealing green onions?

327
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,480
How improper.

328
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,440
Ranran?

329
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,030
Ranran?

330
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,200
Hurry up.

331
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,870
Are you done yet?

332
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,550
No,

333
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,070
it seems this house doesn't have any green onions.

334
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,320
This house doesn't have any either?

335
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,910
Have you been searching properly?

336
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,510
What's this?

337
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,630
You found it!

338
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,270
Master,

339
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,360
my ideal husband!

340
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,240
Who's there?

341
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,910
Master,

342
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,910
my ideal husband!

343
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,360
Ling Xiao,

344
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,450
why do you think Master went straight to his room

345
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,720
with a cold face after we came back?

346
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,360
Was it because I was too excited earlier

347
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,360
and shouted carelessly,

348
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,270
offending Master

349
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,270
and making him angry?

350
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Everything was fine before.

351
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,920
Master even smiled at me.

352
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,170
Master's smile is so gentle.

353
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,589
It's a pity I don't know how to talk properly.

354
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,880
I can't even make Master smile more.

355
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,880
I've come in again?

356
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,480
Why is your consciousness getting colder?

357
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,590
Are you alright?

358
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,110
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

359
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,160
I wonder how you celebrated it.

360
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,790
Did anyone accompany you?

361
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,270
I'm so grateful to meet Master

362
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,180
and stay at Mount Wester.

363
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,790
When I

364
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,350
lived alone before,

365
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,070
I felt indifferent about everything.

366
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,720
but it turns out having someone

367
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,070
to eat, drink, and have fun with

368
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,720
is indeed different.

369
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,960
He even stole a green onion with me.

370
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,750
I found it.

371
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,480
Master,

372
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,440
my ideal husband!

373
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,270
And also,

374
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,250
did you know—

375
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,350
Cut off thoughts.

376
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,450
Why is the Guardian meditating

377
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,550
on the Ice Lotus Pool so early?

378
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,920
He sat

379
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,830
in this pool all night.

380
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,830
Something's not right.

381
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,890
[Jade Pool, Eternal Sect]

382
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,100
Mu Qingge,

383
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,400
are you willingly

384
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,310
giving your Golden Core to me?

385
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,920
Yes,

386
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,160
I am willing to help you

387
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,270
successfully overcome the heavenly tribulation.

388
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,790
I only hope that you

389
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,110
can see my determination to repent.

390
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,310
If you are truly sincere in your repentance,

391
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,830
after this,

392
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,280
I will certainly inform all Heavenly Sects

393
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,510
to search for the Spirit Spring's whereabouts.

394
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,370
You will no longer be seen as a threat

395
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,200
or be confined here.

396
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,110
Thank you, Immortal, for giving me this chance.

397
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,790
Indeed.

398
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:07,960
Master taught me

399
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,550
the formula for the Spirit-Nourishing Pill to reconnect Spirit Roots.

400
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,550
There's no precedent for the Formless Spirit Root,

401
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,790
but by drawing analogies,

402
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,830
it's nothing more than

403
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,480
gathering materials that harmonize the Five Elements

404
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,960
to refine the Five Elements Spirit-Nourishing Pill.

405
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,200
This pill might be able to reconnect

406
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,100
my Formless Spirit Root.

407
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,160
Mu Qingge,

408
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,360
how could you advance at this moment?

409
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,130
How is this possible?

410
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,790
I'm sorry, Immortal.

411
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,370
My advancement lightning tribulation is coming too!

412
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,610
Why is there suddenly

413
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,760
an overflow of spiritual power?

414
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,790
Just a little more.

415
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,430
Ranran,

416
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,310
stop cultivating and protect your heart!

417
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,030
Your Golden Core has shattered.

418
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,100
I forgot to tell you

419
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,640
that although I was born with Five Spirit Roots,

420
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,330
each root was incomplete.

421
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,370
The Eternal Sect's Jade Pool

422
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,290
helped me rush straight to the Nascent Soul realm.

423
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,710
It's just a pity for you.

424
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,640
On top of the heavenly tribulation,

425
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,630
you also suffered

426
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,340
the attack of my advancement lightning tribulation.

427
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:45,880
You...

428
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,160
Master!

429
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,480
Master!

430
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,880
You demoness,

431
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,030
what have you done?

432
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,610
It was Immortal Kaiyuan

433
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,310
who wanted to take my Golden Core to pass the heavenly tribulation.

434
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,510
Who knew it would backfire and hurt himself?

435
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,440
It has nothing to do with me.

436
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,190
Stop talking nonsense!

437
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,070
How dare you claim my Master to be

438
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,310
someone who would casually steal others' Golden Cores?

439
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,140
How dare you ruin

440
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,540
the reputation of the Eternal Sect's sovereign?

441
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,160
But your sovereign

442
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,790
is exactly that kind of person.

443
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,060
Mu Qingge,

444
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,790
I see you have no intention of repenting.

445
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,040
Seize her!

446
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,200
Who dares to touch her?

447
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,440
Who dares to intrude on our Mount Eternal?

448
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,790
The Eastern Palace's Exotic Pavilion

449
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,570
accompanies the Crown Prince

450
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,110
to pay respects to Immortal Kaiyuan.

451
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,780
Welcome, Crown Prince.

452
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,070
Yu.

453
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,590
I knew you would come.

454
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,510
I endured this suffering under her identity

455
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,830
just to wait for you.

456
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,350
Yu.

457
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,880
Is the bottle of Mistaken Divine

458
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,260
that I buried in your courtyard

459
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,720
still there?

460
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,680
It is.

461
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,150
I really want to take a sip now.

462
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,720
I've been waiting for you to come back

463
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,510
to drink with me again.

464
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,590
Your Highness.

465
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,790
This demoness

466
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,160
hurt my Master.

467
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,790
Immortal Master, mind your words.

468
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,000
Madam Battle was personally appointed by His Majesty.

469
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,870
How dare you defame her?

470
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,830
Her old grudges with the Heavenly Sect

471
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,680
were already settled

472
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,460
18 years ago.

473
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:47,790
I will

474
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,590
bring her back.

475
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,640
If anyone wants to claim her,

476
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,880
come to the Eastern Palace.

477
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,350
Your Highness—

478
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:08,770
You're full of cold energy.

479
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,600
Don't freeze Master.

480
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,880
Is she really alright?

481
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,080
Surprisingly, the Soul-Devouring Lock didn't

482
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,300
drain all her spiritual power.

483
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,550
It's the Spirit-Nourishing Pill that Ranran refined.

484
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,450
What the Soul-Devouring Lock absorbed was

485
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,440
the power of the Spirit-Nourishing Pill.

486
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,410
In terms of alchemy talent,

487
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,590
Master is still the best.

488
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,510
No one can match her.

489
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,400
As long as the Soul-Devouring Lock isn't removed,

490
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
the danger will remain.

491
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,350
We need to quickly restore the Spirit Root

492
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,400
and form the Golden Core.

493
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,880
Mu Ranwu

494
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,010
will have to pay back this debt sooner or later.

495
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,340
[Eastern Palace, Imperial Capital]

496
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,870
[Madam Battle Hall, Eastern Palace]

497
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,510
This hall was built especially for you.

498
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,030
The palace buildings

499
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,200
all have restrictions on magic,

500
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,720
but this place

501
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,100
can bypass those restrictions,

502
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
allowing you to practice without hindrance.

503
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,440
Do you like it?

504
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,830
You still prefer

505
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,480
my original appearance.

506
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,640
But all the past experiences

507
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,640
are like a dream now.

508
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,640
Only upon waking did I realize

509
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,420
I shouldn't live like I used to.

510
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,680
I want to live this life

511
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,270
with a brand new appearance.

512
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,750
Qingge,

513
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,060
no matter what you look like,

514
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,750
as long as it's you,

515
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,280
it's good.

516
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:38,890
Come here!

517
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,580
Here.

518
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,000
Take down the paintings.

519
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,990
Put them all away.

520
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,000
Yes.

521
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,680
You have grown up.

522
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,400
But you look

523
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,270
the same as when we parted.

524
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,270
Have you practiced

525
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,620
the art of preserving youth and beauty?

526
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,480
I was afraid that if I aged

527
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,030
and became ugly,

528
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,520
you, Master Mu,

529
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,480
wouldn't want to see me anymore.

530
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,070
Very good.

531
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,510
It pleases me greatly.

532
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,270
Then, are you willing to stay?

533
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,280
In this lifetime,

534
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,930
I won't let you

535
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,070
suffer any grievances

536
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,720
or be hurt anymore.

537
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,160
You don't have to agree right away.

538
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,590
You must be tired today.

539
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,760
After you've rested,

540
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,670
I also have a lot more...

541
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,570
to say to you.

542
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,300
All of you, leave now.

543
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,960
Yes,

544
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,880
Madam Battle.

545
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,510
What a pity.

546
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,510
Now, your spiritual power,

547
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,480
your life,

548
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:08,920
and that Su Yu,

549
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,710
who is obsessed with you,

550
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,950
all belong to me now.

551
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,070
What remains

552
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,480
of you is nothing but

553
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,870
a mere title.

554
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,320
But I refuse to use your face

555
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,400
to continue this life.

556
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,440
Gradually,

557
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,750
Su Yu will forget the old you.

558
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,310
The one by his side

559
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:34,830
will be me

560
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,270
and only me.

561
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,240
You

562
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,640
hate Qingge.

563
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,750
I just want her to disappear.

564
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,240
With her around,

565
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,440
I will never be seen.

566
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,110
This Soul-Devouring Lock

567
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,790
will easily give you

568
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,410
everything she possessed.

569
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,310
During the ascension,

570
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,510
the Soul-Devouring Lock

571
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,830
didn't sense her spiritual power.

572
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,830
Does the fruit

573
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,200
that I squeezed out 18 years ago

574
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,240
still exist?

575
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,200
Would Su Yishui

576
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,020
really disregard Qingge?

577
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,000
Doesn't the Collection of Entertainment say

578
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,790
that Master doesn't like to play the qin?

579
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,830
When Grandmaster asked him to play a tune,

580
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,320
he got so annoyed

581
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,750
that he had a big fight with Grandmaster.

582
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,310
You're awake?

583
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,080
Thank you, Master,

584
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,790
for saving me when I had a qi deviation while refining pills.

585
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,240
I thought that day

586
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,520
I recklessly offended you,

587
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,550
angering you,

588
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,790
and you didn't want to talk to me anymore.

589
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,960
I just had to bring that up.

590
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,640
The "Drunk Breeze" you played

591
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,490
was truly beautiful.

592
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,240
How did you know it was Drunk Breeze?

593
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,300
Besides me,

594
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,790
only one other person knows this tune.

595
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,750
Is that other person Grandmaster?

596
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,110
This was originally composed by Grandmaster.

597
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,110
I saw the score in the Collection of Entertainment.

598
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,810
Who knew

599
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,270
that this was a little secret

600
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,480
known only to you two?

601
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,350
Master,

602
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,320
I found the Collection of Entertainment

603
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,560
accidentally while looking for pill formulas.

604
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,480
I was attracted by

605
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,920
the notes on cooking and brewing wine in it,

606
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,770
so I kept it.

607
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,370
I won't dare

608
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,920
to keep Grandmaster's things secretly anymore.

609
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,510
Although Grandmaster wrote the Beast chapter,

610
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,590
I don't think there was any malice in it.

611
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,920
It was just recording trivial matters,

612
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,600
wanting to understand you better, Master.

613
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,450
You've read it all?

614
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,250
I also want to know about you.

615
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,510
What did the Beast chapter

616
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,400
talk about?

617
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,550
Recite it.

618
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,480
Actually, I didn't read it that carefully.

619
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,240
Recite it.

620
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,530
This beast is fierce

621
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,960
and doesn't like green onions and garlic.

622
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,330
It's vengeful.

623
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,940
You must be careful when teasing it.

624
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,070
If you praise its appearance,

625
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,880
it will be the most murderous.

626
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,720
It must be teased gradually.

627
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,280
However, if appeased with

628
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,400
dried longan preserved in sea salt,

629
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,000
its anger can be reduced by 30%.

630
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,720
Master, do you really like

631
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,550
eating dried longan that much?

632
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,750
I can try to make some.

633
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,510
Stop reading these useless things.

634
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,790
There are some

635
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,880
excerpts on pill-making techniques here.

636
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,200
You might as well read more of those.

637
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:38,610
I haven't punished you yet

638
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,750
for ignoring the signs of spiritual power overflow,

639
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,440
disobeying my orders, and recklessly showing off.

640
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,030
You have no discipline at all.

641
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,240
Early tomorrow morning,

642
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,550
go to the spirit stream behind the mountain to fetch water

643
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,270
and water all the flowers and plants

644
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,070
behind the mountain.

645
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,550
Don't miss a single one.

646
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,510
This will help temper

647
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,400
your reckless nature.

648
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,720
Yes,

649
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,790
Master.

650
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,030
Qingge!

651
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,790
What's the matter?

652
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,720
Your Highness,

653
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,750
Madam Battle was posoined with

654
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,720
the Resentment Liquid

655
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,550
from the Scarlet Sect.

656
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,920
Wei Jiu?

657
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,030
Didn't he and Su Yishui

658
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,920
make a soul oath

659
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,200
not to harm Qingge in any way?

660
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,400
Wei Jiu poisoned me by using

661
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,680
the Resentment Liquid to water the Reincarnation Tree.

662
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,440
This was before the soul oath was made.

663
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,480
Even if I die because of this,

664
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,280
it wouldn't be considered a breach of the oath.

665
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,860
This is outrageous!

666
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,640
Your Highness, please calm down.

667
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,510
I've already sent people to the Scarlet Sect

668
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,830
to test the waters first.

669
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,530
The news has arrived.

670
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,370
Mu Qingge,

671
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,030
since our parting at Mount Absolute,

672
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,370
I imagine you've been

673
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,510
thinking of me constantly.

674
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,880
Come to the Scarlet Sect,

675
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,680
offer all your spiritual power,

676
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,010
and spend a lovely night with me.

677
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,900
I will naturally help you neutralize the Resentment Liquid.

678
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,480
Don't take too long.

679
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,960
Once this Resentment Liquid reaches your heart,

680
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,070
even the greatest immortals

681
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,720
won't be able to save you.

682
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,640
That bastard!

683
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,960
Qingge, don't worry.

684
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,030
I'll draft a Crown Prince's edict right away

685
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,880
to widely recruit Heavenly experts.

686
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,800
I don't believe Wei Jiu

687
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,710
is the only one who can neutralize this Resentment Liquid.

688
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,800
You're pushing the Resentment Liquid so urgently.

689
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,170
Mu Ranwu can't hold on much longer.

690
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:31,760
Right now,

691
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,550
Wei Jiu can't neutralize her Resentment Liquid.

692
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,280
You're the only one she can turn to now.

693
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,540
You punished Ranran to the back mountain.

694
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,850
Are you afraid

695
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,360
that Mu Ranwu might come looking and run into her?

696
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,840
Mu Ranwu will certainly

697
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,070
secretly investigate her sister's whereabouts.

698
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,130
Ranran has the Black Dragon blood protecting her,

699
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,000
so she won't be able to find out much,

700
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,400
but it's better to be safe than sorry.

701
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,110
That's right.

702
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,449
Let's carefully

703
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,590
set up the formation for Mu Ranwu

704
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,760
and wait for her to come.

705
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,340
[Mount Wester]

706
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,230
The Guardian said

707
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,730
it's fine for you to retrieve your former

708
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,230
magical artifacts and mount,

709
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,440
but taking inventory of the old items

710
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,340
will take some time.

711
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,590
Master Mu, please come and rest for a while.

712
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,230
Why is Mu Qingge here?

713
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,550
Could it be

714
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,710
she's here to reclaim

715
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,810
the position of Mount Wester's sovereign?

716
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
She once wanted to drag

717
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,670
the entire Mount Wester down with her.

718
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,360
If it weren't for Master's efforts to turn the tide,

719
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,180
what face does she have to come and fight for Mount Wester?

720
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,920
I don't think she even cares about it.

721
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,480
She assisted

722
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,680
the current emperor in ascending to the throne,

723
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,550
making great contributions.

724
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,110
It's a major cultivation taboo,

725
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,410
but now,

726
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,920
she's one of the most important

727
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,050
nobles in the imperial palace.

728
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,670
With such a powerful backer...

729
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,800
Master Mu, please wait here for a moment.

730
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,760
Excuse me.

731
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,320
Let's practice.

732
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,920
On Mount Absolute, he left without regard for me,

733
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,440
and now he asked me to come up the mountain,

734
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,440
only to keep me waiting.

735
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,880
Su Yishui is deliberately humiliating me.

736
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,630
Perhaps my suspicions are correct.

737
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,630
He knows about

738
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,000
the existence of the other fruit

739
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,790
and used the Smokescreen to disguise

740
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,680
and hide it nearby.

741
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,930
Is this all

742
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,360
your master usually teaches you?

743
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,400
Why don't I play with you for a while?

744
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,550
Mortal flesh repels me.

745
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,280
Only the fruit grown from the same tree as me

746
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,230
can have its spiritual power merge with mine.

747
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,630
None of them are it.

748
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,930
Master didn't confiscate the Collection of Entertainment

749
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,700
and when he saw Grandmaster's Beast Chapter,

750
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,550
he didn't seem upset.

751
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,370
Master can even play

752
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,440
the Drunk Breeze composed by Grandmaster.

753
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,250
What kind of relationship

754
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,280
did Master and Grandmaster really have?

755
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,320
Caught something?

756
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:22,810
I'm sorry,

757
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,440
Master Mu.

758
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,010
I didn't realize someone was here.

759
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,750
You've actually returned to Mount Wester.

760
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,030
What is this thing?

761
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,640
It's a trap for catching pheasants.

762
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,070
I learned how to set it from the Collection of Entertainment.

763
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,200
I wanted to try making

764
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,230
sour roasted pheasant,

765
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,120
but I don't have any green plums at the moment.

766
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,360
Can I use bayberries instead?

767
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,230
What are you talking about?

768
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,970
In this lifetime and the last,

769
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,630
what I hate the most

770
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,800
are these sour things.

771
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,190
Grandmaster doesn't even remember

772
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,510
the Collection of Entertainment she wrote herself

773
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,360
and her personality is completely different too.

774
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,980
Are you also Su Yishui's disciple?

775
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,800
Does Su Yishui let you run wild like this?

776
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,370
Then I'll discipline you on his behalf.

777
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,550
Not her either.

778
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,440
Master Mu,

779
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,590
are you trying to teach my disciple for me?

780
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,760
Shui,

781
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,800
you've finally decided to come and meet me.

782
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,880
Why are you still standing here?

783
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,030
Have you finished your punishment?

784
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,220
I will do the punishment right away.

785
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:18,880
Shui,

786
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,000
I haven't been back to Mount Wester for such a long time.

787
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,230
Would you accompany me for a walk?

788
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,630
You came to Mount Wester

789
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,320
just for a walk?

790
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,070
Indeed, I need your help with something.

791
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,070
You have the Crown Prince's support.

792
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,670
You have plenty of people at your disposal.

793
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,070
Why seek help from

794
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,960
a rustic like me?

795
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,840
You're upset?

796
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,150
I'm staying by Yu's side

797
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,680
for my own reasons.

798
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,880
But in my heart,

799
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,630
how can he compare to you?

800
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,670
There's no one else here.

801
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,320
You don't need to pretend to be indifferent.

802
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,440
I know

803
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,030
you have feelings for me.

804
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,630
Feelings?

805
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,110
I never thought Master really had

806
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,760
such feelings for Grandmaster.

807
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,360
When my soul was scattered,

808
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,410
only you were willing to sacrifice everything

809
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,230
to bring me back to life.

810
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,440
Even if I don't become an immortal in this life,

811
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,440
I will never betray your intentions.

812
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,000
You've been poisoned by the Scarlet Sect's Resentment Liquid.

813
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,140
Is this why you came?

814
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,250
I know

815
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,590
you've studied demonic cultivation

816
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,150
and are skilled at detoxification.

817
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,630
I can help you detoxify.

818
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,150
Ranran.

819
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,960
Since you're slacking off,

820
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,350
come to the study

821
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,130
to brew tea, burn incense, and entertain our guest.

822
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,380
Yes,

823
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,000
Master.

824
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,550
Shui,

825
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,670
I knew you would help me.

826
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,400
No need for words.

827
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,630
I'll try to use my technique to expel the Resentment Liquid.

828
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,150
Although Master's words are harsh,

829
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,280
he's still eager to help Grandmaster detoxify.

830
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,000
It's clear he cares deeply.

831
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,510
Come out.

832
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:27,920
Let's begin.

833
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:33,840
Simultaneously stimulate

834
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,230
Ranran and Mu Ranwu's hearts.

835
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,960
Make the Spirit Roots appear,

836
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,450
so I can use this Five Elements Absorption Disc

837
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,800
to extract Mu Ranwu's Spirit Root

838
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,710
and transfer it to Ranran.

839
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,200
Keep a constant eye on

840
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,190
the condition of the Soul-Devouring Lock.

841
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,710
Mu Ranwu

842
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,630
is unconscious now,

843
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,070
but her heart will still protect itself,

844
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,510
activating the Soul-Devouring Lock.

845
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,230
If we don't stop in time,

846
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,920
both sides will be harmed.

847
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:23,670
Stop.

848
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,550
You used Ranran's pill formula

849
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,580
to refine the Spirit-Nourishing Pill?

850
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,840
That's good.

851
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,200
With the spiritual power from the Spirit-Nourishing Pill

852
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,280
filling her heart,

853
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,250
Mu Ranwu shouldn't notice

854
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,630
the missing Spirit Root for a while.

855
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,570
But if she wants to advance further in the future,

856
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,400
it'll be troublesome.

857
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,070
It's a pity

858
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,880
we could only retrieve this much for Master.

859
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,440
At least we've restored

860
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,300
the missing Spirit Root.

861
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:53,970
Her cultivation should progress faster now.

862
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,480
They're about to wake up.

863
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,070
You should leave first.

864
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,630
Stiffly Su,

865
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,670
be careful not to lose control of your Ice Lotus Technique.

866
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:13,920
Cut the crap.

867
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,000
I know.

868
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,840
How did I...

869
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,360
The Resentment Liquid has been neutralized.

870
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,400
You can leave now.

871
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:05,150
Shui,

872
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,880
how did things

873
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,110
come to this between us?

874
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,230
What are you here for?
