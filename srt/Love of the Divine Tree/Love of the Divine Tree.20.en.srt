[Episode 20]

00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,710
Zhang.

4
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,680
Zhang.

5
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,509
Zhang!

6
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,039
Zhang!

7
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,289
Don't leave me behind.

8
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,920
If I'm alone,

9
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,350
I'd rather die!

10
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,920
It's all my fault.

11
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,200
Let the Heavenly Way punish me,

12
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,870
Zhang.

13
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,750
Zhang.

14
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,590
Zhang.

15
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,440
Meng Zhang iwa willing to bear

16
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,750
all heavenly punishment for Mr. Liu,

17
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,000
but Mr. Liu's obsession runs too deep.

18
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,150
He doesn't want to live on in disgrace.

19
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,430
He has harmed so many people.

20
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,240
He deserves his punishment.

21
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,420
If the evil being hadn't influenced him,

22
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,750
things might not have turned out this way.

23
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,930
Even Grandmaster,

24
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,310
who had reached the Transcenence Realm

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,560
couldn't avoid being affected by the Spirit Spring.

26
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,870
We still need to quickly find a way

27
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,960
to help Master

28
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,840
return the Spirit Spring to the netherworld for peace of mind.

29
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,590
You all helped Meng Zhang.

30
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,000
I have no way to repay you.

31
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,410
This is my reverse scale as the Green Dragon.

32
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,360
It's used to craft the Heavenly Book.

33
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,150
Even mortals

34
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,800
can use it to glimpse

35
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,280
a fleeting vision of the future.

36
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,430
What has already happened

37
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,680
cannot be undone.

38
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,750
But if the next life can be foreseen,

39
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,960
it may help you avoid calamities and disasters.

40
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,470
You all,

41
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,870
please take care.

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,850

[Modest and Receptive]

44
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,620
Master, what did you see?

45
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,360
Ranran,

46
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,480
you haven't touched it yet, have you?

47
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,430
There's no need.

48
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,520
It doesn't matter what the Heavenly Book says.

49
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,990
One's fate belongs to oneself.

50
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,240
In the end, we must walk our own path.

51
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,600
I won't look at it.

52
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,070
Our business here is finished.

53
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,850
Once we've rested and regrouped,

54
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,190
we'll return to Mount Wester.

55
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,120
-Yes, Master.
-Yes, Master.

56
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,480
Since finding the Spirit Spring,

57
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,720
Master has been a bit off.

58
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,040
With the Heavenly Bottle temporarily sealing the Spirit Spring,

59
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,510
Master should

60
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,600
not be in any immediate danger, right?

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,560
Ranran.

62
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,720
My soldiers

63
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,920
have almost fully recovered.

64
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,240
We're preparing to set off now.

65
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,800
Mr. Yu,

66
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,920
take care then.

67
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,630
Actually, I came

68
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,190
to take you with me.

69
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,870
Don't you want to go to the capital?

70
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,450
I do want to go to the capital

71
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,310
to have a look,

72
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,680
but my body

73
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,830
and spiritual power

74
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,950
are still too weak.

75
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
I can't leave Mount Wester yet.

76
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,830
If you're unwell,

77
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,870
then you should return to the capital

78
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,660
with me even more.

79
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,040
I can find you

80
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,680
the best doctors.

81
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,680
I can ensure that you're healthy and worry-free.

82
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,600
Mr. Yu, there's no need to worry.

83
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,120
It's just that my heart is unstable.

84
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:10,950
If I cultivate well

85
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,390
and form my Golden Core, everything will be fine.

86
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,950
An unstable heart...

87
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,070
Ranran fell from

88
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,630
the Reincarnation Tree before 18 years.

89
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,510
Could this be the reason why

90
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,160
Su Yishui insisted on bringing Ranran

91
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,040
to cultivate in Mount Wester?

92
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,280
Su Yishui said that after you form your Golden Core,

93
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,040
everything will be fine?

94
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,280
After I gain more experience,

95
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,830
I should be able to build my Foundation.

96
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,560
Then the Golden Core stage won't be far off.

97
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,390
How can I let you stay by his side

98
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,159
for so long?

99
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,070
Ranran,

100
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,830
do you know that soon

101
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,890
it will be the once-every-19-years

102
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,870
Marrow-Cleansing Pool Trial?

103
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,480
Marrow-Cleansing Pool?

104
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,190
Yes.

105
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,800
Hundreds of years ago,

106
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:48,970
a great savior

107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
chanced upon a pool of spiritual power

108
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,930
on Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

109
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,920
Bathing in it could transform one's body,

110
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,800
greatly increasing spiritual power.

111
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,159
So after he attained ascension,

112
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,360
he specially opened up this place,

113
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,510
naming it the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

114
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,240
He left it as a blessed land

115
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,350
for future cultivators.

116
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,990
But this Marrow-Cleansing Pool

117
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,430
opens once every 19 years.

118
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,750
Among all Heavenly Sect disciples,

119
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,680
only those who compete

120
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,870
and take first place

121
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,800
will have the chance

122
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,070
to enter the pool and cleanse their marrow.

123
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,950
So you're saying

124
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,040
if I win the Marrow-Cleansing Pool Trial,

125
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,710
my spiritual power can advance?

126
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,310
Yes.

127
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,750
Then you'll be able to form your Golden Core, finish your training,

128
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,120
and leave Su Yishui.

129
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,460
[Natural Residence]

130
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,789
The spell formation set has been triggered.

131
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,120
Xi'er!

132
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,600
Xi'er, what's wrong? Xi'er!

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,550
Xi'er!

134
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,030
The might of heaven is awe-inspiring.

135
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,440
Empyrean Bone Sacrifice!

136
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,800
Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation?

137
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,750
My Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation

138
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,150
may not be as powerful as it was

139
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,750
when the four great Heavenly Sects' masters gathered

140
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,960
to control the power of nine sacred relics,

141
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,720
but it's still enough

142
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,080
to completely decimate you.

143
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,390
Master,

144
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,360
my body

145
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,790
feels like it's being drained!

146
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,150
The Black Dragon Jade Pendant?

147
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
It's Su Yu.

148
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,290
Why is Su Yu here?

149
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,600
The formation isn't complete yet.

150
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,120
You must stop now!

151
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,450
That's not possible.

152
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,750
I promised that today,

153
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,200
everyone here would die.

154
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,550
How can I go back on my word?

155
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,120
The formation is broken.

156
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,910
Master!

157
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,480
Master!

158
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,270
Ranran!

159
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:18,910
Ranran!

160
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,150
Ranran, are you alright?

161
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,690
It was Mr. Zeng's

162
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,870
protective armor that saved me.

163
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,150
Su Yishui, have you gone mad?

164
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,080
The formation had clearly been broken.

165
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,550
Why didn't you stop?

166
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,910
Do you realize that Ranran

167
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,320
almost died by your hand just now?

168
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,600
If anything had happened to her,

169
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,820
I would never forgive you.

170
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,750
Master,

171
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,080
I just suffered some minor injuries.

172
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,970
Were you alright earlier?

173
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,480
Master?

174
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,600
I have suffered a great loss of spiritual power.

175
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,030
It's unwise to take any more risks.

176
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,600
Every injustice has its perpetrator.

177
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,940
This was all her idea.

178
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,360
If you want to settle scores, do it with her!

179
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,960
Su Yishui,

180
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
don't be so arrogant.

181
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,670
Resentment Liquid!

182
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,440
You—

183
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,440
Yes.

184
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,670
I've been secretly controlling

185
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,320
the Resentment Liquid in your body.

186
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,010
If you had behaved yourself,

187
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,340
I wouldn't have touched the Resentment Liquid.

188
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,950
You brought this upon yourself.

189
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,240
I was wrong.

190
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,630
I was wrong, Su Yishui.

191
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,000
I won't dare to do this again.

192
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
For Qingge's sake,

193
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,150
please forgive me.

194
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,360
In your previous life, your sister

195
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,390
catered to your every whim,

196
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,240
protected, and indulged you.

197
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,840
But I'm not her.

198
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,270
I won't be soft-hearted.

199
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,880
Although I can't kill you,

200
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,000
I have countless ways

201
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,120
to make you wish you were dead.

202
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,000
Su Yishui.

203
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,120
I know

204
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
you are the real Demon's child.

205
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,870
In the previous life,

206
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,790
Qingge took the blame for you.

207
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,960
If you don't stop now,

208
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,080
I'll reveal this secret to the world.

209
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,810
You think I care

210
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,510
if others know?

211
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,720
You're not afraid of this,

212
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,410
but don't you care about Xue Ranran?

213
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,000
I already found out.

214
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,390
Your disciple, Xue Ranran,

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,120
is my sister,

216
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,750
Mu Qingge,

217
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,440
right?

218
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,480
You don't care if the Heavenly Sects find out

219
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,840
about your identity as the Demon's child and seek revenge,

220
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,750
but Xue Ranran is different.

221
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,030
She's your disciple now

222
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,160
and has little spiritual power.

223
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,390
When the time comes,

224
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,380
she will surely become the target of everyone's attacks,

225
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,900
never knowing peace in her life.

226
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,720
If at that time,

227
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,150
you're also in deep trouble,

228
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,490
will you still be able to protect her?

229
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,020
Su Yishui,

230
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,270
neutralize my Resentment Liquid immediately

231
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,090
or I'll draw my sword and end my life.

232
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,630
Qingge and I are connected by the Soul-Devouring Lock.

233
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,510
If I die,

234
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,550
she dies too.

235
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,870
With her going down with me,

236
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,480
it'll be worth it.

237
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,870
If I can make the Reincarnation Tree bear fruit once,

238
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,870
I can do it a second time.

239
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,240
But you won't have

240
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,150
another chance to come back to life.

241
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,750
Go ahead and try.

242
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,480
Making the Reincarnation Tree bear fruit once

243
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,320
requires you to use up half a Golden Core.

244
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,570
Do you still have enough Golden Cores

245
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,270
to spare?

246
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,600
What's wrong?

247
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,390
Did I guess correctly?

248
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,940
Wanting to resurrect my sister

249
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,090
isn't that easy,

250
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,630
right, Su Yishui?

251
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,320
I can neutralize the Resentment Liquid.

252
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,600
But I want you to make a soul oath.

253
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,290
You must not reveal Ranran's and my identities

254
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,030
to anyone else.

255
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
Play your role as Mu Qingge well.

256
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
If you break this oath,

257
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,840
may heavenly lightning strike you down

258
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,240
and your soul be forever destroyed.

259
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,670
How dare you make me swear such a vicious oath!

260
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,030
Before that drop of dew hits the ground,

261
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,400
you still have a chance to make the oath.

262
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,660
Otherwise, I'll kill you first.

263
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,320
At worst, I can give up the remaining half

264
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,870
of my Golden Core too!

265
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,790
I swear!

266
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,030
I will never reveal

267
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,330
Xue Ranran's and yours identities.

268
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,830
If I do, may heavenly lightning strike me down

269
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,900
and my soul be forever destroyed.

270
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,670
Su Yishui,

271
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
you madman!

272
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,630
To neutralize the Resentment Liquid,

273
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,330
follow me to Mount Wester.

274
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,680
Your Highness.

275
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,609
I've brought the wound medicine.

276
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,230
You're wounded too.

277
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,310
Let's tend to your wounds first.

278
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,400
Su Yishui almost seriously injured you,

279
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,270
and now he's disappeared

280
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,000
without an explanation.

281
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,510
The way he was just now...

282
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,480
Never mind.

283
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,800
I think you should

284
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,720
leave with me.

285
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,160
Master must have discovered something,

286
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,310
so...

287
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,480
He won't abandon us.

288
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,790
Mr. Yu.

289
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,550
Your Highness,

290
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,070
the army has urgent matters

291
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,000
that can't be delayed any longer.

292
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,830
Ranran,

293
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:20,790
since you're still unwilling

294
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,830
to come with me this time,

295
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,160
I won't force you.

296
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,110
After you form your Golden Core and complete your training,

297
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,000
we'll discuss it again.

298
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,200
I must leave today.

299
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,810
Take good care of yourself.

300
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,920
Mr. Yu.

301
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,830
Take care.

302
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,170
Your Highness.

303
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,000
Your Highness.

304
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,590
Your Highness,

305
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,200
we were delayed here

306
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,440
for too long.

307
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,970
The pills left by the Exotic Pavilion

308
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,590
have all been used up.

309
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,880
I'm afraid the poison in your body

310
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
can no longer be suppressed.

311
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,560
Don't make a fuss about it.

312
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,270
Return to the capital immediately.

313
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,720
Yes.

314
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,790
Your Highness,

315
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,750
there's one more thing.

316
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,270
The collapsed waterway here

317
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,750
has unexpectedly been cleared.

318
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,110
Excellent.

319
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,480
I can't wait anymore.

320
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's depart.

321
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:05,800
Could Master

322
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,070
be in some kind of trouble?

323
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,070
Senior,

324
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,350
take good care of Xi'er.

325
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,310
I'll go out and have a look.

326
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:12,880
Alright.

327
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,480
Master,

328
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,030
Master!

329
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,000
Are you alright?

330
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,920
Long time no see, Xue Ranran.

331
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,200
Master Mu.

332
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,480
I happened to be passing by.

333
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,510
I sensed that Shui was nearby,

334
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,830
so I came to check on him.

335
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,790
Master, you suddenly left just now.

336
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,720
Was it to look for Master Mu?

337
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,070
I have stabilized Xi'er's primordial spirit.

338
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,970
She still needs to take medication and rest for several days

339
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,720
to recover.

340
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,350
Let's return to Mount Wester first.

341
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes, Master.

342
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,400
What about Master Mu?

343
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll go with you all.

344
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,160
Mr. Yu just left.

345
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,110
Won't you go catch up with him?

346
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,240
I naturally want to spend more time

347
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,000
with Shui.

348
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,270
Master!

349
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,000
You didn't look

350
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,070
very well earlier.

351
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,160
Were you affected by the Spirit Spring?

352
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,000
Master!

353
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,920
This matter doesn't concern you.

354
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,240
I can handle it myself.

355
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,300
Don't ask any more questions.

356
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,400
You,

357
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,880
come with me.

358
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,080
Can't Grandmaster

359
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,350
fly by herself?

360
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,030
Ranran,

361
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,440
then I'll take Xi'er away first.

362
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,670
Be careful on your own.

363
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,240
Who on earth wanted to

364
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,200
set up a formation here to kill us?

365
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,110
The Alcohol Immortal is proficient in rune cultivation.

366
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,510
Perhaps he can help find out something.

367
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,070
-Master.
-Guardian.

368
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,400
Clean up the room

369
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,110
next to mine.

370
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,860
Master Mu will be staying at Mount Wester for a few days.

371
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,310
-Yes.
-Yes.

372
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,640
Bring the high-quality

373
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,640
soul-transferring pills from the alchemy hall.

374
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,160
Help Xi'er take them daily.

375
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,830
Yes, Master.

376
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,460
Follow me.

377
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,350
You were in such a hurry to pull me away earlier.

378
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,480
Were you worried that I might accidentally

379
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,880
say something wrong?

380
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,640
Keep your mouth shut.

381
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,230
I can keep my mouth shut,

382
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,540
but can you control your heart?

383
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,350
You're so guarded against me.

384
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,550
What's the use?

385
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,790
I saw everything earlier.

386
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,350
You lost control

387
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,270
and almost killed Qingge.

388
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,510
You are the Demon's child,

389
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,200
and now, you're carrying the Spirit Spring.

390
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,920
Could it be

391
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,200
that you're being influenced

392
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,270
by the evil Spirit Spring again?

393
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,550
But it's still several years

394
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,700
before the netherworld's gate opens.

395
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,590
As long as this Spirit Spring can't be returned

396
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,470
and stays with you,

397
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,400
who knows when

398
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,620
you might lose control again

399
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,960
and kill Qingge?

400
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,070
How is Xi'er doing?

401
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,350
I must catch

402
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,450
the one who set up the trap to harm us

403
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,790
and get revenge for Xi'er.

404
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,830
If it can be implanted from the outside into the heart,

405
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,480
then there must be a way to remove it.

406
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,110
Why isn't it working?

407
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,310
Why?

408
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:26,200
[Carefree Pavilion]

409
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,310
Mr. Yu Chen,

410
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,200
is Master here?

411
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,540
The Guardian is not here.

412
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:31,890
Yesterday, the Guardian instructed me

413
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,750
to tidy up the alchemy hall.

414
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,820
He said he would prepare it for Mu Ran—

415
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,110
Mu Qingge for alchemy today.

416
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,520
He probably

417
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,920
went to the alchemy hall early to start the furnace.

418
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Master actually

419
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,400
went to start the furnace himself.

420
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,880
She's about to build her Foundation.

421
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,920
If she advances,

422
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,970
won't my spiritual power

423
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,110
be drained and decrease

424
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,680
again?

425
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,270
I can't let her succeed.

426
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,550
Before advancing,

427
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,750
one's true energy is unstable.

428
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,900
It's the easiest to go astray at this time.

429
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,200
I can't attack her,

430
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,080
but if

431
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,640
her own true energy goes haywire

432
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,920
and something goes wrong,

433
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,680
then it can't be blamed on me.

434
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,110
Ranran.

435
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:51,960
Master Mu.

436
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,920
Bringing snacks to Shui?

437
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,200
There's no need.

438
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,960
His mind is all on me.

439
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,200
He'll be refining pills for me in the coming days.

440
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,270
He has no time for irrelevant people.

441
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,890
You came here early in the morning

442
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,440
just to brag about these things to me?

443
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,550
Alright.

444
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,590
I got it.

445
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,000
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

446
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,070
Did I expose

447
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,480
those unspeakable thoughts

448
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,270
of yours?

449
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,070
Let me remind you,

450
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,240
don't forget your place.

451
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,750
Don't go coveting

452
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,040
those you shouldn't.

453
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,830
In his eyes,

454
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,070
you're just a disciple he took in

455
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,070
to pass his idle time.

456
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,590
When he's happy,

457
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,880
he'll dote on you.

458
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,350
When he's bored,

459
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,510
he'll discard you.

460
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,480
Don't ever

461
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,480
take yourself too seriously.

462
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,790
Then tell me,

463
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,210
people say Mu Qingge

464
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,240
is obsessed with me.

465
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,830
Is that true?

466
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,410
Don't think I don't know

467
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,070
what you're up to.

468
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,920
If you can't let go of your delusions,

469
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,480
I'll give you a hand.

470
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,720
You saved Qingge and gave her a second life.

471
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,060
Do you want to repeat the same mistakes?

472
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,640
Master?

473
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,480
Why were you so careless?

474
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,030
You didn't even notice

475
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,830
that you're about to build your Foundation?

476
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,350
Master,

477
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,050
I...

478
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,270
Focus your mind,

479
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,920
close off your five senses,

480
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,160
eliminate distracting thoughts,

481
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,070
and channel your energy to build your heart.

482
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,020
The lightning tribulation has come.

483
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,160
I just wanted to

484
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
savor every moment

485
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,680
with you before sealing the Spirit Spring.

486
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,400
Even if the Ice Lotus Technique hurt me,

487
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,070
so what?

488
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,880
But now I realize

489
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,480
that the drop of Spirit Spring in my heart

490
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,240
wasn't completely erased.

491
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,750
I won't allow myself

492
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,480
to get close to you again.

493
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,700
I've fallen from the Nascent Soul stage.

494
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,400
Mu Qingge,

495
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,130
were you born

496
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,350
to oppose me?

497
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,750
I'll make sure you won't have it easy.

498
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,230
That was the Spirit Spring just now.

499
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,580
Ling Xiao.

500
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,680
Could you be the Demon's child?

501
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,240
You still don't remember?

502
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,710
No,

503
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,680
I need to see clearly who you really are.

504
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,510
What is this place?

505
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,200
This is me from my past life?

506
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,790
Ling Xiao.

507
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,270
Ling Xiao?

508
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:55,960
No,

509
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,880
these are my memories.

510
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,010
Could it be that I've reached the Foundation Phase

511
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,340
and my spiritual power has increased,

512
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,000
unlocking memories from my past life?

513
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,000
I've moved from Ling Xiao's memories

514
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,590
into

515
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,790
my own memories.

516
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,590
I never thought

517
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,000
you'd venture into the netherworld.

518
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,550
Ling Xiao,

519
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,510
I've also entered the netherworld.

520
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,920
What was I doing in the netherworld?

521
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,760
Could my past life be connected to the Spirit Spring?

522
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,030
What exactly is our connection?

523
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:30,920
Ling Xiao,

524
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:32,360
see if you can

525
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,110
remember anything else.

526
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,080
Why is everything so different

527
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,230
from what I imagined?

528
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,280
Who am I really?

529
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,000
And who are you?

530
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,320
This time,

531
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,230
we miscalculated a bit.

532
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,930
Su Yishui

533
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,030
found the whereabouts of the Spirit Spring,

534
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,670
but it didn't go as we planned.

535
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,800
He wasn't possessed by the Spirit Spring again.

536
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,760
However,

537
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,360
as long as he still has

538
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,230
that drop of Spirit Spring in his heart,

539
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,070
everything can be managed.

540
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,320
I have another plan.

541
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
I know

542
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,440
it's hard for you to accept it too.

543
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,070
If you really are the Demon's child,

544
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,320
yet you were deeply entangled with my past life

545
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,710
and even split your spiritual soul to protect me,

546
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,280
it's indeed quite complicated to process.

547
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,410
No wonder Master was reluctant

548
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,430
to tell me about my past life.

549
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,670
You say you won't look for your soul owner anymore

550
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,510
and you won't go back?

551
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,070
That won't do.

552
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:48,880
Ling Xiao,

553
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,600
regardless of whether your soul owner is the Demon's child

554
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,360
or whatever else,

555
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,510
you are still my friend.

556
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,800
Your kindness in protecting me all this way still stands.

557
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,960
I will send you back.

558
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,590
Besides,

559
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,890
the Demon's child is just a regular person born

560
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,280
at a special time, nothing more.

561
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,970
Right or wrong, good or evil,

562
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,880
I can discern it for myself.

563
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,070
Moreover,

564
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,610
I need to advance faster now.

565
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,630
This way,

566
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,360
I can find out

567
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,480
how I entered the netherworld before

568
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,780
and help Master return the Spirit Spring as soon as possible.

569
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,600
The fastest way to advance...

570
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,550
It opens once every 19 years.

571
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,000
Among all Heavenly Sect disciples,

572
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,920
only those who compete

573
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,030
and take first place

574
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,120
will have the chance

575
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,280
to enter the pool and cleanse their marrow.

576
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,150
Ranran.

577
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,360
Mr. Zeng.

578
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,000
Ranran,

579
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,230
congratulations on

580
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,360
successfully building your Foundation.

581
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,840
Mr. Zeng, you've come to congratulate me so quickly.

582
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,640
Since you've successfully built your Foundation,

583
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,710
you should have

584
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,590
a suitable weapon.

585
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,160
The sword you used

586
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,320
to defeat the Nine-Headed Kui'ao last time

587
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,280
was indeed a divine weapon.

588
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,320
That sword also acknowledges you.

589
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,510
That's Mu Qingge's Qingming Sword, isn't it?

590
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,320
I've already given the sword to Master for safekeeping.

591
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,390
Master must cherish it very much.

592
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,600
This sword has an owner.

593
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,440
I don't want it.

594
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,550
Alright,

595
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,590
that's fine.

596
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,190
I will custom-make

597
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,230
a better one for you.

598
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,320
Thank you, Mr. Zeng.

599
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,630
You're so kind to me.

600
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,670
However,

601
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,440
I already

602
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,710
have my own weapon.

603
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,670
I want to call it

604
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,480
Divine Tree.

605
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,760
Someone once told me

606
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,950
that planting a tree somewhere

607
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,090
means you have a home there.

608
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,320
Mount Wester will be your home from now on.

609
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,410
You are no longer

610
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,400
homeless.

611
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,800
This Reincarnation Tree shares your life force.

612
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,290
If you forge it into a weapon,

613
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,070
there won't be anything

614
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,760
more suitable for you.

615
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,030
With your Formless Spirit Root,

616
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,200
you should be able to make it transform more freely at will.

617
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,150
With my current spiritual power,

618
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,630
it's probably not possible.

619
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,670
However,

620
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,760
if I use spirit pills to supplement my power...

621
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:09,970
Brilliant!

622
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,400
Perhaps different spirit pills

623
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,010
can give it different transformations.

624
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,170
I'll try it next time.

625
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,090
[Consonance Palace]

626
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,480
Stiffly Su.

627
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,150
What's going on with you?

628
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,030
I couldn't stop you

629
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,120
from falling in love before.

630
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,360
Why the sudden change now?

631
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,550
It's nothing.

632
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,800
I think you're right.

633
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,590
Don't give me that evasive nonsense.

634
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,280
Why did you bring

635
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,960
Mu Ranwu back?

636
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,590
With all your mood swings,

637
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,710
what will Ranran think?

638
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,710
You must explain it clearly to me today.

639
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,070
Hey,

640
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,800
what can't you tell me?

641
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,190
Alright.

642
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,150
Let me guess.

643
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,840
This must've started when you rescued Ranran

644
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,320
from those bastards of the Scarlet Sect

645
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,110
at the foot of Mount Cuiwei

646
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:12,670
and couldn't suppress

647
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,670
the violent energy inside you.

648
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:14,960
I heard you lost control

649
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,480
in Puxin Village too.

650
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,510
It's related to this, right?

651
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,480
So the Spirit Spring can still affect you.

652
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,230
When I was young,

653
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,400
a drop of Spirit Spring was planted in my heart.

654
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,030
It has always been there,

655
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,710
impossible to remove or eradicate.

656
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,400
It resonates with the Spirit Spring.

657
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,190
Before long,

658
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,400
I won't be able to suppress it anymore

659
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,320
or seal off the Spirit Spring.

660
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,110
Are you saying

661
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,190
you're afraid the Spirit Spring will possess you again?

662
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,230
But

663
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,880
there are still three years

664
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,070
before the netherworld reopens.

665
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,370
Can you hold out until then?

666
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,110
I don't know,

667
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,680
but I absolutely won't

668
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,610
let myself be repossessed.

669
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,070
We must quickly find another way

670
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,150
to enter the netherworld.

671
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,880
Is there any way?

672
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,320
I haven't found one yet,

673
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,110
but when Qingge entered the netherworld back then,

674
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,710
it wasn't during the key opening time either.

675
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,630
So there must be

676
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,320
other ways.

677
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,320
So that's why you're here,

678
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,190
looking through these records.

679
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,390
Is this also the reason

680
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,710
why you pushed Ranran away?

681
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,480
She can't be

682
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,230
dragged down by me again.

683
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,510
I can't keep her by my side anymore.

684
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,110
I can't let her stay at Mount Wester.

685
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,030
She must form her Golden Core as soon as possible.

686
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:21,960
This way,

687
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,230
the Soul-Devouring Lock won't have

688
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,070
too much of an effect on her.

689
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,590
After she completes her training,

690
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,070
she'll have the ability to protect herself

691
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,920
and pursue

692
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,920
the life she wants.

693
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,110
This isn't something that can be rushed.

694
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,590
Besides, Ranran is still far from

695
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,750
forming her Golden Core.

696
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,600
It'll be possible

697
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,670
if she can enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

698
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,760
How many elite talents from various Heavenly Sects

699
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
participate in the Marrow-Cleansing Conference?

700
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,670
Only one person might be able to enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

701
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,480
They'll definitely use all sorts of tactics.

702
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,920
Even if Ranran has the ability,

703
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,150
she may not necessarily win.

704
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,780
What are you pondering now?

705
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,670
You should take it easy.

706
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,070
Being too obsessive

707
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,280
will only make your emotions unstable.

708
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,000
If your Ice Lotus Technique breaks,

709
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,360
you'll lose your Transcendence Realm power.

710
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,360
Even if you find

711
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
a way to enter the netherworld,

712
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,510
you won't be able to seal the Spirit Spring anymore.

713
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,510
Nothing can change

714
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,110
my plan.

715
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,590
Even if my Ice Lotus Technique breaks

716
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,550
and I fall from the Transcendence Realm,

717
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,440
I can still use my body to seal the Spirit Spring

718
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,710
to prevent future troubles.

719
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,890
So what you said before

720
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,840
was all true.

721
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,960
Xi'er,

722
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,990
stop sleeping.

723
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,960
Don't you like liveliness?

724
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,280
Wake up quickly.

725
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,880
I'll take you to the market.

726
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,920
I'll buy you your favorite food.

727
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,800
Please wake up, okay?

728
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,230
Senior Gao,

729
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,620
As soon as I built my Foundation,

730
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,230
I started the furnace and refined this Foundation Stabilizing Pill

731
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,360
for Xi'er to try.

732
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:49,960
Okay.

733
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:58,960
Ranran,

734
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,960
you seem quite different after you built your Foundation.

735
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,840
I feel like I've seen you somewhere before.

736
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:05,810
Senior Gao,

737
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,070
are you confused from exhaustion?

738
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,120
I don't understand

739
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,880
what you're saying.

740
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,280
It's just that the current you

741
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,010
reminds me of someone,

742
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,150
but I can't quite put my finger on whom.

743
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,610
-Xi'er.
-Xi'er.

744
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,510
You're awake?

745
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:22,710
Come,

746
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,480
take it easy.

747
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,210
Xi'er,

748
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,400
are you alright?

749
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,030
We're back at Mount Wester?

750
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,860
Here, have some water

751
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,590
to soothe your throat.

752
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,330
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

753
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,330
You want to know what happened to us,

754
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:37,780
right?

755
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,190
To be honest, we're not sure either.

756
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,120
That wave came out of nowhere.

757
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,360
Master didn't say much about it.

758
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,880
But the important thing is

759
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,630
we're all fine now.

760
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,710
There's also some good news.

761
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,020
Ranran has successfully built her Foundation.

762
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,150
Impressive.

763
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,880
We've fallen behind again.

764
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,630
Don't worry.

765
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,550
You just focus on getting better.

766
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,240
I'll practice hard with you.

767
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,920
We'll try to catch up with her.

768
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:08,920
Ranran.

769
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,320
Ranran.

770
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,000
Xi'er,

771
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,000
you're awake?

772
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,550
That's great!

773
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,250
Here's a letter from the Alcohol Immortal for you.

774
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,410
Come, have some more.

775
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,510
Ranran,

776
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
the runes you sent

777
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,550
are the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation.

778
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,190
This is the very formation that the Heavenly Sects

779
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,630
used to kill Mu back then.

780
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,510
Who would dare use this formation

781
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,760
to harm the people of Mount Wester?

782
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,890
This formation is intricate and mysterious.

783
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,550
Apart from the sovereigns of the Four Sects

784
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,590
who set it up before,

785
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,510
no one else should be able to master it precisely.
