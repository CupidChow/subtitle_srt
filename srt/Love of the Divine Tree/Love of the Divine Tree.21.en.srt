00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,970
[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,940
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Come, have some more.

4
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,229
Ranran,

5
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,759
the runes you sent

6
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,280
are the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation.

7
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,920
This is the very formation that the Heavenly Sects

8
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,350
used to kill Mu back then.

9
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,230
Who would dare use this formation

10
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,480
to harm the Mount Wester group?

11
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,640
This formation is intricate and mysterious.

12
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,400
Apart from the sovereigns of the Four Sects

13
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,310
who set up this formation back then,

14
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,240
no one else should be able to master it.

15
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,880
Everyone's technique for writing runes

16
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,750
is slightly different.

17
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
If you still have a clear memory

18
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,360
of the runes in the formation,

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,920
you might be able to compare the writing techniques

20
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,360
to deduce who's behind this.

21
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,750
There's a folk legend

22
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,910
that those with deep-seated hatred

23
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,520
and overwhelming resentment

24
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,630
have souls that can't disperse after death.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,870
They transform into ghosts

26
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,520
known as Night Fiends.

27
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,750
It's said that Night Fiends claim lives

28
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,870
by killing without a trace.

29
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,680
None of these are it.

30
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
Then who could it be

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,630
that set up the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation?

32
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,190
It's this one.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,800
[Wu]

34
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,570
Mu Ranwu.

35
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,120
She collaborated with the Heavenly Sects back then

36
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,720
to set up the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation

37
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,560
against Mu Qingge.

38
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,870
Of course she would know how to do it.

39
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,740
If Mu Qingge isn't really Mu Qingge,

40
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,280
she's likely to be...

41
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,520
Someone broke into Consonance Palace.

42
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,000
That's right.

43
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,150
The same rune-writing technique.

44
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,560
I wasn't wrong after all.

45
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,280
The one Master sacrificed himself

46
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,890
to resurrect was not Grandmaster,

47
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,580
but Mu Ranwu, who also disappeared

48
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,030
in the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation.

49
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,280
Master protected the wrong person!

50
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,520
Master,

51
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,160
I have something to tell you.

52
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,950
It's about Grandmaster's identity.

53
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,870
It's very important!

54
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,560
Master?

55
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,630
Master Mu,

56
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,159
why are you here?

57
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,950
I'm keeping your Master company, of course.

58
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,570
Su Yishui

59
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,870
always says one thing but means another.

60
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,000
He wants to be intimate with me,

61
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,800
yet he's afraid to do so.

62
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,330
Master Mu, you are

63
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,630
a free and transcendent person,

64
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,720
yet now, you move between Mr. Yu

65
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,950
and my Master.

66
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,070
It's truly surprising.

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,190
Yu and Shui

68
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,530
both wish I can

69
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,630
spend more time with them.

70
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,870
They don't mind.

71
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,920
It's not your place, youngster,

72
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,800
to gossip about this.

73
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,720
Yes.

74
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,560
If you would stay at Mount Wester,

75
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,870
Master would be overjoyed.

76
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,190
He wouldn't have to keep

77
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,640
the dried longan you made for him,

78
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,040
pining away.

79
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,360
Nor would he need to play every day

80
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,920
your favorite "Moonlit Night"

81
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,190
with no audience.

82
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,240
It's good that you know.

83
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,000
In your Master's heart,

84
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,870
there's no room for anyone else.

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,390
So, you don't

86
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,830
even know the name

87
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,000
of your favorite melody?

88
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,360
You're testing me.

89
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,040
When did you find out?

90
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,510
And how did you figure it out?

91
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,270
You've been deceiving Master all along.

92
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,120
Do you dare to admit

93
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,160
who you really are in front of Master?

94
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Who I am

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,680
doesn't matter.

96
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,030
What matters is who

97
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,830
Su Yishui believes I am.

98
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,360
Why don't you go tell Su Yishui?

99
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,680
Guess how he'll react.

100
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,720
Don't you know how obsessive

101
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,600
your Master is?

102
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,070
He's guilt-ridden

103
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,190
about Mu Qingge's death

104
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,950
and hates himself to death.

105
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,240
He disabled his core and risked his life

106
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,510
to bring back a life.

107
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,560
How precious it is!

108
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,800
He's only willing

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,920
and only wants to believe

110
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,310
that Mu Qingge has returned.

111
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,480
Master wouldn't be so blind.

112
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,630
Is that so?

113
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,390
You think your Master

114
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,110
doesn't see as clearly as you do?

115
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,040
It's just a matter of whether he wants to delve deeper

116
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,159
or if he's willing to believe it.

117
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,390
Some people live their entire lives

118
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,800
preferring to deceive themselves and others.

119
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,630
This wood is one with my heart.

120
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,750
May it always

121
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,830
accompany you.

122
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:13,950
Give it back to me!

123
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,630
Give what back to you?

124
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,870
The hairpin or your Master?

125
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,730
What right do you have to demand anything?

126
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,360
You...

127
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,160
Xue Ranran!

128
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,410
Master,

129
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,600
you've been deceived by this person.

130
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,040
She's not Mu Qingge, she's...

131
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,600
Nonsense.

132
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,750
Get out now.

133
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,280
This person before us,

134
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,390
from temperament to preferences,

135
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,750
is nothing like Grandmaster.

136
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,040
She doesn't even know

137
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,000
the origin of the dried longan

138
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,430
you have or her own

139
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,000
favorite melody.

140
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,490
Master, do you still believe her?

141
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,680
Why shouldn't I believe her?

142
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
She's the one I personally brought back

143
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,560
and watched over for 18 years.

144
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,390
No one knows her better than I do.

145
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,750
Have you finished causing a scene?

146
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,750
Get out now.

147
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,330
How dare you sneak into my room

148
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,270
and mess with my things?

149
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
I'm helping you,

150
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:10,920
Su Yishui.

151
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
You're so cruel.

152
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,720
You just went along with it

153
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,160
and used me to drive Xue Ranran away.

154
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,830
Won't you thank me?

155
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,120
It seems you've made up your mind

156
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,070
to stay away from her.

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,260
You actually activated the Resentment Liquid!

158
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,160
Aren't you afraid—

159
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,950
I know what you're up to.

160
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,000
You're desperately trying to drive a wedge between Ranran and me

161
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,150
because you want her

162
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,120
to leave the protection of Mount Wester

163
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:35,870
to your advantage.

164
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,549
But I warn you, Mu Ranwu.

165
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,360
Even if Ranran leaves Mount Wester,

166
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,600
no one will be able to harm her in the slightest.

167
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,240
Especially you.

168
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
I'll make you wish you were dead.

169
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,440
This is the antidote to the Resentment Liquid.

170
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,870
After you take it and recover,

171
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,960
get out of Mount Wester immediately.

172
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,440
Su Yishui,

173
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,910
I won't end it like this.

174
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,480
Wait, Immortal Master Mu.

175
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,320
She completed building her Foundation

176
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,200
and she's hard to counter now.

177
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,630
In this new life,

178
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,910
am I still not better than her?

179
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,960
Ranran!

180
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,870
Master, look quickly.

181
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,600
Su Yishui,

182
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,360
your rebellious disciple repeatedly provokes me.

183
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,270
Why don't you punish her properly?

184
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,840
Master, you must have seen it.

185
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,270
Her technique of drawing runes

186
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,080
is the same as the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation

187
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,240
that trapped us.

188
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,510
She's the one who harmed us.

189
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,080
She's not Mu Qingge at all.

190
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,240
She is Mu Ranwu.

191
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,200
Master,

192
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,750
I know this is hard to accept.

193
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,150
But

194
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:49,930
if you look at Mu Ranwu's

195
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,600
rune-drawing technique,

196
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,720
you'll understand everything.

197
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,390
Enough.

198
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,270
I don't need any proof.

199
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,270
Master, are you still deceiving yourself?

200
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,870
Aren't you leaving yet?

201
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,240
Why?

202
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,880
Master, why

203
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,840
won't you listen to what I'm saying?

204
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,570
Even Mr. Yu has noticed

205
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
that this Mu Qingge is off.

206
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,150
How can you not see it?

207
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,480
I am the one who truly understands

208
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,150
Mu Qingge,

209
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,360
not Su Yu.

210
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,840
You must be confused.

211
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,000
She's not just impersonating Mu Qingge.

212
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,910
She even set up the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation,

213
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,600
almost killing all of us.

214
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,320
Because of her,

215
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,840
Xi'er was unconscious for days.

216
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,200
Master, do you still want to blindly protect her?

217
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,030
I don't believe it.

218
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,440
You're not someone

219
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,720
who disregards others' lives.

220
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,960
What do you know about me?

221
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,820
I've always done as I pleased,

222
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,360
without regard for others' lives.

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,750
That's not true.

224
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,520
You clearly—

225
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,960
You think you know me well?

226
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,360
You have no idea

227
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,870
what Mu Qingge means to me.

228
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,030
You shouldn't have—

229
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,230
I shouldn't have revealed the truth.

230
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,270
You would rather live in a lie

231
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,030
and be trapped in delusions.

232
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,550
So what?

233
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,750
Who do you think you are

234
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,840
to try to influence me?

235
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,550
Xue Ranran,

236
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,910
as long as you're my disciple,

237
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,720
you must respect me as your master

238
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,550
and follow the path I've set.

239
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840
If you're unwilling,

240
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,480
you must first have the ability to finish your training.

241
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,550
Otherwise, leaving Mount Wester,

242
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,360
going to the capital,

243
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
and seeking some kind of belonging

244
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,630
are all just a dream.

245
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
Since you're unable to distinguish right from wrong,

246
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,030
then it's better for me

247
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,030
to not stay on Mount Wester.

248
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,510
Your Golden Core is not formed yet.

249
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,000
You can't even pass through Mount Wester's

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,550
Breaking Dawn Formation.

251
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,750
You're not qualified to finish your training.

252
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,440
I will participate

253
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,870
in the Marrow-Cleansing Pool Trial at Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

254
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,240
I will enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

255
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,050
I will, in the shortest time possible,

256
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,910
advance and form my core,

257
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,750
and break through the formation.

258
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,510
I will

259
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,050
leave Mount Wester.

260
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,150
Very well.

261
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,270
Elite disciples

262
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,640
from all major Heavenly Sects will participate in

263
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,390
the Trial,

264
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,840
but there's only one spot for the Marrow-Cleansing.

265
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,120
I'd like to see

266
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,000
if you have what it takes.

267
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,480
Don't just talk the talk.

268
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,510
If you can't pass the trial, you'll be a laughingstock.

269
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,030
Master, just wait and see.

270
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,630
I will definitely enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool and advance,

271
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,000
remember everything about the Spirit Spring in the netherworld,

272
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,360
and repay your kindness in my own way.

273
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,000
Then I will...

274
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,670
leave you.

275
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,390
You may leave.

276
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,440
Yes.

277
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,790
The last blockage of the Four-Way Waterways

278
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,460
is on Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

279
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,150
Yes.

280
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,270
Heavenly Meridian Mountain was originally an immortal realm.

281
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,690
Without the collective spiritual power of the Heavenly Ones,

282
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,550
it cannot be accessed.

283
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,510
The upcoming Marrow-Cleansing Conference

284
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,510
is the perfect opportunity to enter Heavenly Meridian Mountain

285
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,150
and clear the waterways.

286
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,270
The Marrow-Cleansing Conference...

287
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,720
Ranran will surely attend, won't she?

288
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,630
Your Highness, are you...

289
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,120
Don't worry.

290
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,870
I know my priorities.

291
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,410
Clearing the Four-Way Waterways

292
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,670
has always been the top priority.

293
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,150
These hands of mine

294
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,600
need to possess even more power

295
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,150
to grasp everything I desire.

296
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,610
I will no longer

297
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,840
hand over opportunities that belong to me

298
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,360
to anyone else.

299
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,120
Are you really going to use this favor

300
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,070
to save your brother?

301
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,360
He is my brother.

302
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:21,810
Nothing is more important

303
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,030
than his safety.

304
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,120
Okay.

305
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,600
I promise you.

306
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,000
I considered brotherly affection,

307
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,390
only to be repaid with a wolf

308
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,360
that wants to devour and replace me.

309
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,440
My dear second brother...

310
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,210
In order to seize the position of Crown Prince,

311
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,120
he planted a deadly poison in my body.

312
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,120
He truly wants to kill me.

313
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,630
Your Highness,

314
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,630
heaven's will surely favors you.

315
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,390
Indeed.

316
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,450
Sometimes I don't even know

317
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,960
if fate is favoring me

318
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,430
or trying to kill me.

319
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,840
The poison has no cure,

320
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,550
yet I've managed to cling to life until now.

321
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,330
Year after year, I go to the Spirit Lake of Mount Absolute

322
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,320
to suppress the poison and recuperate,

323
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,580
waiting for Qingge to return.

324
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,080
Little did I know, I had already reunited with her.

325
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,240
Now, after all this time,

326
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,630
I've finally confirmed that Ranran is her.

327
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,510
Yet you tell me

328
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,390
that I don't have much time left to live?

329
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,200
The poison

330
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,630
has already entered your heart, veins, and bones.

331
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,150
With a mortal body,

332
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,960
you naturally cannot hold on for much longer.

333
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,360
But once the Four-Way Waterways are cleared,

334
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,030
your years of planning

335
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
will surely succeed.

336
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,910
You will attain longevity.

337
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,200
Good.

338
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,670
Only then can I fulfill my lifelong wish:

339
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,080
peace throughout the universe

340
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,270
and my loved one by my side forever.

341
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,240
Then, Your Highness,

342
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,240
what

343
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,670
are your plans for Xue Ranran?

344
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,510
Ranran will return to my side.

345
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,480
I've waited for her for so long.

346
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,480
A little longer won't matter.

347
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,970
At the Marrow-Cleansing Conference,

348
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,750
Su Yishui will surely find a way

349
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,640
to ensure she enters the Marrow-Cleansing Pool smoothly.

350
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,270
Let's discuss this once everything

351
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,720
has settled.

352
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,440
Report!

353
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:41,720
Your Highness,

354
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,840
she has returned.

355
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,240
She just entered Madam Battle's Palace.

356
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,320
Your Highness says she is not Madam Battle.

357
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,630
Then who is she?

358
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,720
Who else could she be?

359
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,840
She's that

360
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,910
ungrateful wretch,

361
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,690
just like my second brother?

362
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,880
The Mu Ranwu whom Mu Qingge protected

363
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,120
yet got killed by.

364
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,670
I'll arrest her right away.

365
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,390
No need.

366
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,910
Since she dares to return,

367
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,680
I might as well

368
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,240
still treat her as Mu Qingge.

369
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,450
After all, the Heavenly Meridian Mountain can only be

370
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,440
entered by Heavenly Ones eligible for

371
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,160
the Marrow-Cleansing Conference.

372
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,240
I still need her to open

373
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,760
the last waterway.

374
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,920
I'll arrange everything

375
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,240
for you right away.

376
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,720
It's not just about arranging for her

377
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,920
to go to Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

378
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,160
Recently, my third brother

379
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,890
has been hesitant

380
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,680
to make any big moves

381
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,750
because Madam Battle has been around me

382
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,830
Given his temperament,

383
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
he won't hold back for long.

384
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,640
He will surely make a move against Madam Battle.

385
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,240
Let her be the target.

386
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,430
[Madam Battle's Palace]

387
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,070
Qingge.

388
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,400
I've just come back

389
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,140
and you're here already.

390
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,790
You're keeping such a close eye on me.

391
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I was very worried about you.

392
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,680
I never wanted you to leave the capital.

393
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,000
I know you love your freedom,

394
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,310
but now the Heavenly Sects can hardly tolerate you.

395
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,200
Wei Jiu also has his eyes on you.

396
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,510
I had no choice but to send

397
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,640
my shadow guard to follow you

398
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,030
to protect you.

399
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,640
Who knew that useless fool would lose track of you.

400
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,960
Fortunately, you returned safely.

401
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,720
I'm fine.

402
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,200
I was just wandering around.

403
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,200
I also gathered some spiritual herbs

404
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
to refine pills for His Majesty,

405
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
so you won't worry.

406
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,920
You're still the same,

407
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,780
always thinking of me in everything.

408
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,350
But I want you

409
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,350
to think more for yourself.

410
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,550
I understand you.

411
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,720
You're the kind of person who wants to

412
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,240
take control of your own life.

413
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,160
So,

414
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,720
even though I really want to

415
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,550
marry you and bring you into the Eastern Palace immediately,

416
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,790
I don't want to hold you back.

417
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,480
So you don't want to marry me anymore?

418
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
How could that be possible?

419
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,750
I'm thinking what you're thinking.

420
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,620
I know

421
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,210
the Heavenly Marrow-Cleansing Conference is about to begin.

422
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,240
To regain your former power,

423
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,450
you must certainly strive for

424
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,030
this opportunity at the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

425
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,610
Right?

426
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,200
Of course.

427
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,070
However, this

428
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,640
is not easy

429
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,350
for me now.

430
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:08,880
Qingge.

431
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,440
I've already thought of a solution for you.

432
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,080
If you need

433
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,310
top-grade spiritual and magical artifacts

434
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,680
from the Exotic Pavilion,

435
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,920
feel free to take them.

436
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,110
I'll be waiting for you

437
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,030
to fulfill your wishes

438
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
and marry me

439
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,920
without any regrets.

440
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,070
How does that sound?

441
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,630
Good.

442
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,070
Ranran.

443
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,550
I smell

444
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,400
something burning.

445
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,800
Looks like you're really anxious

446
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,680
to get to the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

447
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,590
Ranran,

448
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,480
why don't you rest a bit after your practice?

449
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,240
We just went down the mountain to shop

450
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,790
and bought you lots of delicious food.

451
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,880
We also picked up your letter at the mountain gate.

452
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,830
It's from the capital.

453
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,480
Ranran,

454
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,750
I hope you successfully enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

455
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,310
When you leave Mount Wester,

456
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,750
come to the capital as promised.

457
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,720
What does the letter say?

458
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,240
Why do you look like you're about to cry?

459
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,200
There's also a gift with the letter.

460
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,030
Master.

461
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,640
These spiritual materials and treasures

462
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,480
are all top-grade collections from the palace.

463
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,750
They can aid in your cultivation.

464
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,960
Self-righteous.

465
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,160
Why must you be like this?

466
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,270
What?

467
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,030
You can't bear to part with his gifts?

468
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,440
Yes.

469
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,880
You wield the Sword of Non-Attachment,

470
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,160
yet you remain trapped in past attachments.

471
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,400
You're becoming more and more unreasonable.

472
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Even if you resent Mr. Yu

473
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,400
because of Grandmaster,

474
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,800
you have no right to dispose of

475
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,960
the gifts my friend gave me.

476
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:51,830
Next time...

477
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,400
No.

478
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,000
Anyway, you will soon

479
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,310
have no right to interfere anymore.

480
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,510
Is Ranran rebelling?

481
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,960
You're so slow.

482
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,320
Ranran and Master

483
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,270
have been in a cold war for so long.

484
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,280
Haven't you noticed that recently when Ranran cooks,

485
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,440
there's not even a portion for Master?

486
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,350
-Why?
-Why?

487
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,550
Don't ask.

488
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,260
We can't help anyway.

489
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,750
Why do you have to suppress yourself so much?

490
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,510
This will only make you lose everything.

491
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
I said

492
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,630
I can help you.

493
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:53,970
Hey, is it necessary for you

494
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,070
to be so harsh on Ranran?

495
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,690
Didn't you say that after entering

496
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,680
the Marrow-Cleansing Pool and forming

497
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,850
the Golden Core, she can live

498
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,480
how she wants?

499
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,480
Even if she wants to go to the capital

500
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,440
and mingle with Su Yu,

501
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,310
you can't control her.

502
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,680
I, Su Yishui, am not a good person,

503
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:06,790
but Su Yu

504
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,790
is nothing good either.

505
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Is he worthy of trust?

506
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,790
The spiritual materials he arrogantly sent

507
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,400
are useless

508
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,960
and even detrimental to Ranran's cultivation.

509
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,880
Can't you just explain it nicely?

510
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,640
Why do you have to make it seem like

511
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,160
you and Ranran will never interact with each other again?

512
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:21,970
Indeed.

513
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,110
Ranran has her own life to live.

514
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,110
I have my own path to follow too.

515
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,400
We were always destined to go on

516
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:28,960
two different paths.

517
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,410
[Sovereign of Wester Sect] [Mu Qingge] [Xue Ranran]

518
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,510
Bai.

519
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,310
Thank you.

520
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,240
I'm fine now.

521
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,200
One shouldn't trap oneself.

522
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,720
We must always move forward

523
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,790
and do what needs to be done, right?

524
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,130
I'll set off tomorrow

525
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,310
to Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

526
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,270
I've made

527
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,310
enough spiritual pills for you.

528
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,960
They're with Mr. Yu Tong.

529
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,200
Remember to take them daily

530
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,480
to replenish your spiritual power.

531
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,790
Guardian, a visitor has arrived.

532
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,720
I was escorting Hollow Sect disciples to Heavenly Meridian Mountain

533
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,270
and passed by your place.

534
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,200
Have a seat.

535
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,160
Actually...

536
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,880
Actually, I'm here to see her.

537
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,390
She goes by Xue Ranran now, right?

538
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,310
I mean no harm.

539
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,270
I've known from the beginning

540
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,080
that the Mu Qingge born on Mount Absolute

541
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,790
was a fake.

542
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,270
All this time,

543
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,720
I've been watching her.

544
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,400
And it's obvious

545
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,480
who you, Su Yishui,

546
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,480
have been protecting.

547
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,480
So?

548
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:54,690
Technically,

549
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,560
I should report this

550
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,750
to the sovereigns of all sects.

551
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,640
They're eager to find out

552
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,510
the whereabouts of the Spirit Spring.

553
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,790
And the real Mu Qingge

554
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,680
is the key.

555
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,640
But don't worry,

556
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,510
I haven't told anyone.

557
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,960
The Spirit Spring has nothing to do with her.

558
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,480
The Spirit Spring is in me.

559
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,240
I will seal it back to the netherworld.

560
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,440
You're quite frank with me.

561
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,880
The Heavenly Sects still want the Spirit Spring.

562
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,440
Troubling her would be pointless.

563
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,000
You don't need to see her either.

564
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,950
She's not Mu Qingge anymore.

565
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,550
Nineteen years ago, I knew

566
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,430
your reason for reviving her

567
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,240
wasn't to break your own curse.

568
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,280
Nor was it for any

569
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,270
of the reasons you mentioned.

570
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,400
You love her.

571
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,550
That's something I've known even longer.

572
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,480
That's why I was so jealous

573
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,270
that I tried to drive a wedge between you two

574
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,720
and lied about her disfiguring me.

575
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,790
But...

576
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,160
Everyone believed it.

577
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,590
Except for you.

578
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,720
Because she would never

579
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,750
stoop so low.

580
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,310
So I thought it through.

581
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,790
What I tried to seize before,

582
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,000
what I've been waiting for all this time,

583
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,350
should've been let go long ago.

584
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,030
Regarding the Spirit Spring,

585
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,970
if you're willing to trust me,

586
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,070
-I can help you—
-No need.

587
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,550
I've heard that

588
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,480
for the key to open the netherworld,

589
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,030
one must wait

590
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,050
for a specific time.

591
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,680
Or do you

592
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,110
have another passage to reach the netherworld?

593
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,270
Oh, right.

594
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,960
Did Mu Qingge already find

595
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,350
that passage

596
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,200
back then?

597
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,160
What do you know?

598
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,200
I was young and impetuous back then.

599
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,400
I secretly followed her

600
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,050
for a while.

601
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,920
Xuantian Teachings?

602
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,350
Why is this demoness looking for a passage

603
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,000
to the netherworld?

604
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,720
But I didn't follow her for long

605
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,550
before I lost her.

606
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,350
Later, demons ran rampant.

607
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,880
It's all in the past now.

608
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,200
Xuantian Teachings?

609
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,200
Guardian,

610
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,920
my brother and I have searched through

611
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,880
the catalog and library.

612
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,610
Mount Wester originally housed

613
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,550
the Xuantian Teachings,

614
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,790
but 19 years ago, after you went into seclusion,

615
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,640
Su Yu came to claim

616
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,440
Mu Qingge's belongings.

617
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,790
He took some things with him.

618
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,200
The Xuantian Teachings

619
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,160
was among them.

620
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,240
Does the Xuantian Teachings

621
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,270
really contain information about

622
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,270
another passage to the netherworld?

623
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,400
But the Xuantian Teachings has existed for a century.

624
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,270
How come no one

625
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,310
had discovered it before?

626
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,520
We'll know once we get

627
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,200
the Xuantian Teachings.

628
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,590
It seems after the Marrow-Cleansing Conference,

629
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,480
I must go visit Su Yu.

630
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,760
We're going to

631
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,200
Heavenly Meridian Mountain for the trial today.

632
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,590
Will Master really not give us some advice?

633
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,310
Regardless of Master's intentions,

634
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,920
as disciples, we should show

635
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,480
proper respect.

636
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,960
I, Disciple Xue Ranran,

637
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,110
am setting off to Heavenly Meridian Mountain with my fellow disciples.

638
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,030
I've come to inform you, Master.

639
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,270
After I enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool

640
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,510
and form my Golden Core,

641
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,960
I'll return to perform the graduation ceremony

642
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,400
and bid farewell to Mount Wester forever.

643
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,200
Ranran, you...

644
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,400
Ranran,

645
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,240
I know you're upset,

646
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,440
but if you speak without leaving

647
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,000
any room for reconciliation because of this

648
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,960
and put yourself in danger,

649
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,640
wouldn't that

650
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,200
make people even more worried?

651
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,790
I've been reflecting these days

652
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,280
and I've realized

653
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,310
our Master is very good to us.

654
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,030
Don't say things out of anger anymore.

655
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,960
Thank you, Seniors,

656
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,880
but I've made up my mind.

657
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,180
I must enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

658
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,820
-Master.
-Master.

659
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,550
If you can enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool and form a Golden Core,

660
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,350
I wouldn't force such a capable disciple

661
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,680
to stay.

662
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,960
It's just a pity that

663
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,350
you don't have such ability.

664
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,640
Take more magical tools and talismans,

665
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,750
lest you fail to graduate

666
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,880
and become a laughingstock.

667
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,350
Thank you, Master.

668
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,230
Thank you, Master.

669
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,850
This Marrow-Cleansing Pool

670
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
is not something anyone can enter.

671
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,720
Are you so confident

672
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,680
that Master can make it through?

673
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,350
I have my own arrangements.

674
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,360
What arrangements?

675
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,240
Seclusion.

676
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,710
Seclusion?

677
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,880
Master is taking a risk and you're going into seclusion?

678
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:00,970
Are you heartless,

679
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,400
Su Yishui?

680
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,270
Su Yishui!

681
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,120
[Heavenly Meridian Mountain]

682
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,200
Heavenly Meridian Mountain is just ahead.

683
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,120
We've arrived.

684
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,480
You don't need to worry about my affairs.

685
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,960
Even if I leave Mount Wester,

686
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,610
we'll still be fellow disciples for life.

687
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:35,980
You're leaving

688
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,120
because of Master, right?

689
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,920
Whether it is or isn't doesn't matter.

690
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,240
I never intended

691
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,160
to become a Heavenly expert.

692
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,880
Isn't it better to enjoy life's pleasures?

693
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,750
Besides,

694
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,760
we haven't even seen the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

695
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,960
Isn't it ridiculous to be so gloomy about it?

696
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,160
According to the old rules,

697
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,400
the first to find

698
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,720
the Marrow-Cleansing Pool on Heavenly Meridian Mountain

699
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,720
is the winner.

700
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,410
However, the Heavenly Meridian Mountain

701
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,270
is under the restrictions of the great Dun Tian,

702
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,790
so we can't fly on swords

703
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,030
or use teleportation techniques.

704
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,030
Moreover,

705
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,960
the sovereigns and elders of each sect

706
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,440
have already entered Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

707
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,440
Therefore,

708
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,240
they can't enter again to protect their disciples.

709
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,790
I've researched the ancient texts.

710
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
This Marrow-Cleansing Pool wasn't

711
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,480
in the mortal world before.

712
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
It was in a secret area of the Immortal Realm.

713
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,320
It was discovered by

714
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,750
Dun Tian, the founder of the Eternal Sect.

715
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,640
He greatly increased his cultivation by cleansing his marrow here,

716
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,270
which later allowed him to attain ascension.

717
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,510
After his ascension, he deliberately opened this place,

718
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,240
making it accessible once every 19 years.

719
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,440
That's how the Marrow-Cleansing Pool became this blessed land.

720
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,000
Fortunately, this place

721
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,070
is controlled by the righteous Heavenly Sects.

722
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,960
Even if we don't succeed,

723
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,000
it shouldn't be too dangerous.

724
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,240
We need to be extremely careful.

725
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,240
Since it's controlled by the Heavenly sects,

726
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,880
demonic cultivators shouldn't be able to enter.

727
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,000
Isn't it a bit excessive

728
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,750
to be so cautious?

729
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,920
One can only enter Heavenly Meridian Mountain once in a lifetime.

730
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,480
And once you enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool,

731
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,510
it's equivalent to skipping half a lifetime of arduous cultivation.

732
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,750
Under such competition and temptation,

733
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,310
anything can happen.

734
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,450
Mu Qingge

735
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,310
has such high cultivation

736
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,270
and she's still competing for the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

737
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,750
She's so vicious.

738
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
After all, she's reborn.

739
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,920
She's never entered Heavenly Meridian Mountain before,

740
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,510
so

741
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,510
it's not against the rules.

742
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:37,830
Ranran.

743
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,440
Be careful!

744
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,200
Are you alright?

745
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,260
These vines suck blood.

746
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,449
We don't know how many

747
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,400
blood-sucking vines are ahead.

748
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,360
How are we going to get through?

749
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,590
Come to me!

750
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,540
Quickly.

751
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,510
Watch out for these vines!

752
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,360
Who is that person?

753
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,550
Why is he using demonic magic?

754
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,070
I heard he's the new disciple

755
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,000
of Lingdi Sect

756
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,670
named Gui Baqian.

757
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:36,810
I've never heard before that

758
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,030
there was such a figure in the Heavenly Sect.

759
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,630
The main peak is just ahead.

760
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,870
Let's put in more effort.

761
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,480
Let's go.

762
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,760
I can't go on.

763
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,190
This is a matter of life and death.

764
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,510
I can't hold on anymore.

765
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,070
The Marrow-Cleansing Pool

766
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,670
is just ahead on the main peak.

767
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,960
But right in front of us

768
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,110
is such a wide cliff.

769
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,190
My spiritual power is almost exhausted

770
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,230
and we're faced with this cliff.

771
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,410
Since we can't fly on our swords,

772
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,440
how can we get across?

773
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,960
If I use all my power to control Divine Tree,

774
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,400
I can form a bridge for us to cross.

775
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,840
Ranran,

776
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,510
do you have any strength left?

777
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,120
Let's give it a try and see.

778
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,280
It worked!

779
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,320
Now if I use spiritual power to stabilize myself,

780
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,550
I can cross.

781
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,840
Ranran!

782
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,550
Come to me!

783
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,710
You can make it!

784
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,040
Forget it, Ranran.

785
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,180
I was lucky to make it through

786
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,100
the previous checkpoints.

787
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,670
I really don't have the strength to go any further.

788
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,510
I've gained enough experience.

789
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,630
The journey wasn't in vain.

790
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,460
I'll stop here.

791
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,280
Since Xi'er is staying here,

792
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,230
I'll stay here to keep her company.

793
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,320
I'm under punishment.

794
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,400
I was never destined for the Marrow-Cleansing Pool anyway.

795
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,040
Being able to come and see Heavenly Meridian Mountain

796
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,190
is already great.

797
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,190
Ranran,

798
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,030
be careful on your journey.

799
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,000
Wait for me to come back!

800
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,280
Ranran,

801
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,480
if it's too dangerous, just forget about it.

802
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,610
You don't need to complete your training.

803
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,030
Eating and drinking on Mount Wester

804
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,950
is good enough.

805
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,760
[Main Peak Cave of Heavenly Meridian Mountain]

806
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:01,520
Senior,

807
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,280
I found this sword first!

808
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:02,880
Get out of my way!

809
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,030
If I see it, it's mine!

810
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,070
The main peak

811
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,920
has heavenly treasures everywhere.

812
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,630
The great Dun Tian left countless treasures

813
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,710
in this cave.

814
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,360
It's just a mirror.

815
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,590
Why bother fighting with your sister over it?

816
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,360
Why don't you choose another treasure instead?

817
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,510
We came to Heavenly Meridian Mountain

818
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,710
for the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

819
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,190
Why has everyone forgotten our original purpose

820
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,360
and started fighting over other things?

821
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,150
Give it to me!

822
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,710
Don't run!

823
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,550
It's mine!

824
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,590
Give it to me! It's mine!

825
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,710
Why is there

826
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,880
a little bird tied up here?

827
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,440
Its feet are all chafed.

828
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,110
Did the great Dun Tian tie you up?

829
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,880
Little bird, wait a moment.

830
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,030
I'll help stop the bleeding right away.

831
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,840
You have a good eye.

832
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,890
There are many treasures on the main peak

833
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,880
of Heavenly Meridian Mountain,

834
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,150
but this Vermilion Bird is the most precious of all.

835
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,890
It is the most powerful

836
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,550
purifying and demon-expelling divine object in the world.

837
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,480
You're indeed clever.

838
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,670
You know to fight for the most valuable thing.

839
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,070
I don't understand what you're talking about.

840
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,030
You always have this

841
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,070
lofty air,

842
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,590
but in reality,

843
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,890
you hold onto all the benefits

844
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,800
and refuse to let go.

845
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,000
It truly makes me sick.

846
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,000
You really love to talk to yourself.

847
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,480
I'd like to ask you

848
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,120
why you're so obsessed with replacing

849
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,070
Mu Qingge's identity.

850
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,550
Is this false reputation really that good?

851
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,800
Where have you hidden

852
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,670
the Grandmaster?

853
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,960
You're asking me?

854
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,440
You should ask your Master about that.

855
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,190
He loves Mu Qingge so much,

856
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,710
if anyone's hiding her, it's him.

857
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,040
Besides,

858
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,760
with his autocratic nature,

859
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,640
he wouldn't bear

860
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,880
to hide Mu Qingge too far away.

861
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,840
Perhaps

862
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,360
she's hidden right by his side.

863
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,920
Cut the nonsense.

864
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,150
Give me the Vermilion Bird.

865
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:53,720
Vermilion Bird,

866
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,390
you escape first.

867
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,840
Everything in this cave

868
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,760
arouses people's greed.

869
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,150
Now that the Vermilion Bird has flown away,

870
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,920
Master Mu, you can come to your senses.

871
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,150
I'm perfectly clear-headed.

872
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,920
When you're preaching

873
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,800
your morals, I'm even more

874
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,760
clear-headed.

875
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,960
Today is perfect timing.

876
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,710
So many people die on Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

877
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,290
Su Yishui won't know

878
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:10,920
the truth.

879
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,070
Why don't I choose today

880
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,480
to fulfill my wish?

881
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,760
Bai, how did you get here?

882
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,030
This technique is...

883
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,670
Master?

884
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,670
Bai used Master's technique.

885
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,190
Is it the Soul Control Technique?

886
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,620
Could it be that Master listened to what I said

887
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,330
and believed that Mu Qingge was fake,

888
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,270
so he possessed Bai?

889
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,070
No,

890
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,590
I need to know how Master is doing.

891
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,280
Senior,

892
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,630
please guide me

893
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,770
on how to return to

894
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,670
the main peak of Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

895
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,350
My Master is fighting with someone evil.

896
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,110
I'm worried about him.

897
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,280
You're concerned about your own Master,

898
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,920
but what about other people's herbs?

899
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,360
I'm sorry,

900
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,800
I was in a hurry.

901
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,150
How about this?

902
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
I'm skilled in wood-based magic.

903
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,600
I can help you grow a few

904
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,730
thousand-year-old herbs as an apology.

905
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,850
Please tell me

906
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,920
how I can get back.

907
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,000
As a cultivator, you should know

908
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,000
everything happens for a reason.

909
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,000
We have no predestined connection.

910
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,280
I can't help you.

911
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,440
How can we not have a connection?

912
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,220
The Alcohol Immortal from Mount Cuiwei

913
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,440
is my friend.

914
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,760
Not long ago,

915
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,320
I even helped him brew a few jars of fine wine.

916
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,630
How do you know that

917
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,360
I know Alcohol Immortal

918
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,320
and how can you be sure

919
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,590
that he and I

920
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,320
are friends, not enemies?

921
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,200
Your wine gourd

922
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,440
is identical to Alcohol Immortal's.

923
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,550
If you were enemies,

924
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,030
why would you carry your enemy's wine gourd

925
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:06,800
with you?

926
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,590
You, young lady,

927
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
are quite clever.

928
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,840
You're right.

929
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,830
Alcohol Immortal is my younger brother.

930
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,190
I am the Medicine Immortal.

931
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,130
[Medicine Immortal]

932
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,760
Since that's the case,

933
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,590
I'll put your mind at ease.

934
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,190
Every time there's a trial,

935
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,400
when they reach this Treasure Cave,

936
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,550
the participants can't resist

937
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,130
the temptation of these heavenly treasures.

938
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,070
The higher their cultivation,

939
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,920
the more they want to claim

940
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,630
the best for themselves.

941
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,630
The barrier of greed

942
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,000
is truly difficult to overcome.

943
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,710
Isn't that too harsh?

944
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,360
Failing and being sent away

945
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:49,920
is enough.

946
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,320
Why take their lives?

947
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,400
Cultivating spiritual power

948
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,670
to achieve immortality

949
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,030
is already defying the natural order.

950
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,150
If one wants to enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool

951
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,420
to gain instant benefits,

952
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,110
they must bear the corresponding risks.

953
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,510
Then, my Master...

954
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,110
This must be your Master, right?

955
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,110
Indeed, it's Master's technique.

956
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,040
Master did use the Soul Control Technique

957
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,150
to possess Bai's body.
