[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,930
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,280
-Master.
-Master.

4
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,759
Divine Tree!

5
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,900
One wisp of qi.

6
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,590
To break the galaxy!

7
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,040
One wisp of qi to break the galaxy?

8
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,870
I don't believe it.

9
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,079
Why?

10
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,840
Why are you willing to do everything for her,

11
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,680
regardless of the consequences?

12
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,910
Why?

13
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,030
If only back then,

14
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,150
I could have met someone like this too.

15
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,800
I hate it so much!

16
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,400
Rong Yao's spiritual energy is exhausted.

17
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,470
She's about to dissipate.

18
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,000
But why did she suddenly flee?

19
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,150
Where else does she want to go?

20
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,000
Rong Yao?

21
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,020
It's you,

22
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,190
Dun Tian.

23
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,960
It really is you.

24
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,690
You shouldn't look like this.

25
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,630
It's been hundreds of years.

26
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,800
it's been hundreds of years!

27
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,400
Have you ever thought about

28
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,190
what I should have looked like?

29
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,090
When you abandoned me and our daughter,

30
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,240
without any regard,

31
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,960
did you ever think about what

32
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,910
we would become?

33
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,870
Dun Tian,

34
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,590
do you have any regrets?

35
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,520
Silence!

36
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,480
Slaying the Mortal-Demon Lord

37
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,910
was exactly what I should have done.

38
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,750
It wasn't to attain ascension

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,150
and prove the Way, like what you thought.

40
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,800
I did it for justice.

41
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,520
I did it for all living beings.

42
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,840
At that time,

43
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,960
I also wanted to preserve both family and justice,

44
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,910
but I couldn't do it.

45
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,630
But now,

46
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,030
I can make amends for everything.

47
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,680
I can make everything start over!

48
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,160
Make amends for everything?

49
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,600
What you want to make amends for

50
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,950
is not me at all.

51
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,330
What you can't let go of is just

52
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,160
the happiness and joy

53
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,560
you once had.

54
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,950
Now you've lost them forever, that's all.

55
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,190
You are not Rong Yao.

56
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,600
You have no right to speak here.

57
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,240
Get out of here!

58
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,270
Chang'e must regret stealing the spiritual medicine,

59
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,430
gazing at the blue sky night after night with a heavy heart.

60
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,720
Rong Yao,

61
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,390
I can now

62
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,630
start everything over.

63
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,510
Our family

64
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,390
will surely be reunited.

65
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,430
Shui.

66
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,750
What did you call me?

67
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,430
Who let you to call me that?

68
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't copy your sister's ways.

69
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:46,830
No.

70
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,159
I should have told you the truth earlier.

71
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,680
Actually, I...

72
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,680
Mu Qingge.

73
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,120
How dare you use tricks to harm Ranran!

74
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,160
You're asking for death.

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,750
I'm not.

76
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,510
I am Mu Ranwu.

77
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,510
What did you say?

78
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,240
It's just that Mu Qingge's spiritual power

79
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,560
and Spirit Root are in my body, that's all.

80
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,950
Don't you know

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,360
who is the real Mu Qingge?

82
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,090
Didn't you see it from

83
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,270
the "one wisp of qi to break the galaxy" just now?

84
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,390
In this world,

85
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
who else can do such a move,

86
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,480
other than Mu Qingge?

87
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,120
She's been deceiving you all along.

88
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,630
What?

89
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,510
Have you finally figured it out?

90
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,159
Ever since you lost your memory,

91
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,090
she's been pretending to be me and deceiving you.

92
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,120
She's the one you should settle scores with.

93
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,680
Even now,

94
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,750
you're still like this.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,040
I never thought

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,600
that our

97
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,040
sisterly bond

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,870
would fail so miserably.

99
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,600
I don't believe her words.

100
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,510
I only want to hear from you.

101
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,160
That’s right.

102
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,390
I am Mu Qingge.

103
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,390
You...

104
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,430
How dare you deceive me!

105
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,040
You said you wanted to make me

106
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,160
fall in love with you again.

107
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,480
All of this was just

108
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,600
your tricks to achieve your goal.

109
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,950
It's truly the one I've been longing for,

110
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,600
Beauty Mu.

111
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,630
In this life,

112
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,780
or in the previous one,

113
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,860
you've always had this little disciple

114
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,240
wrapped around your finger.

115
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:34,950
Su Yishui,

116
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,630
after 20 years,

117
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,770
you haven't improved at all.

118
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,070
Isn't it thrilling

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,430
to be played like a fool?

120
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,430
It's not like that.

121
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
Then what is it like?

122
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,480
Regarding my identity,

123
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,950
I did deceive you.

124
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,720
But it wasn't intentional.

125
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,950
It's because...

126
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,390
Because you've forgotten many things.

127
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,040
I don't know...

128
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,630
Can't make up any more lies?

129
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,360
Su Yishui,

130
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,750
I know my sister the best.

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,280
If she's scheming,

132
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,680
acting humble and trying to please people,

133
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,430
that's when she's most likable.

134
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,040
How many people in the past

135
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,630
have cared for her as much as you do?

136
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,600
When she was a Master before,

137
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,510
you respected her so obediently.

138
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,360
Now that she's become a disciple,

139
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,750
she's also gained all of your affection.

140
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,870
It's truly enviable to others.

141
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,070
Whether it's Mu Qingge

142
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,180
or Xue Ranran,

143
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,600
it's up to me

144
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,750
to kill or punish her is

145
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,430
the Wester Sect's own business.

146
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,789
In this life,

147
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,750
she is my disciple.

148
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,630
How I discipline my own disciple

149
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,600
is not for outsiders like you

150
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,320
to watch with pleasurex

151
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,150
from the side.

152
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,360
Oh no,

153
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,910
Wei Jiu must have gone to find

154
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,870
the Gold Refining Fire.

155
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,480
If this item falls into the hands of this demon,

156
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,750
it will surely throw the universe into chaos.

157
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,550
Quick, chase after him!

158
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,980
We must stop him at all costs.

159
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,510
Let's go.

160
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,080
Let's go.

161
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,690
You've deceived me for so long.

162
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,910
Mu Qingge,

163
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,150
you're quite capable, aren't you?

164
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,970
Did I cheat you out of money

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,030
or did I seduce you?

166
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,150
Why do you feel so wronged?

167
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
If you remove the Soul-Cleansing Charm, you'll know

168
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,170
that you've known my true identity

169
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,150
this entire time.

170
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,750
As for me,

171
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,210
I’m your Master,

172
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,390
but you turned me into your disciple.

173
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,120
Su Yishui,

174
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,360
you're treacherous!

175
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:26,840
I...

176
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,150
You must have used some kind of trick.

177
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,870
Otherwise, why would I have kept you by my side?

178
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,790
Fine,

179
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,600
it's all my trickery.

180
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,600
I deceived you.

181
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,910
When everything is over,

182
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,670
I'll leave.

183
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,670
We don't need to distinguish

184
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,790
who's the Master and who's the disciple.

185
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,790
We can just sever

186
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,720
our relationship completely.

187
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,390
Don't you dare!

188
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,360
I... I mean,

189
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,790
the grudge between us

190
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,750
can't be resolved

191
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,510
by simply cutting ties.

192
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,630
At the very least…

193
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,360
At the very least, I must

194
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,970
imprison you on Mount Wester

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,670
and cut you into pieces.

196
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,240
Su Yishui,

197
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,920
you are completely heartless!

198
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,520
Even if I am Mu Qingge, so what?

199
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,630
Didn't I raise you

200
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,630
to be nice and clean,

201
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,910
without lacking food or clothing?

202
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,390
Anyway, now

203
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,720
I'm the only one who remembers our relationship.

204
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,480
It's really heartbreaking.

205
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,230
Since you hate me so much,

206
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,320
I'll ask the Alcohol Immortal

207
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,510
to put a Soul-Cleansing Charm on me too.

208
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,670
I'll have all the memories of you

209
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,750
washed away completely.

210
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,080
Then,

211
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,510
we'll treat each other

212
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,200
as strangers.

213
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,240
End of story.

214
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,360
If I had known yesterday,

215
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,000
I wouldn't have helped this stinky girl stabilize her spiritual power,

216
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,270
giving her so much strength to anger me.

217
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,320
Master.

218
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,550
Master, are you...

219
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,960
alright?

220
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,680
Don't call me Master.

221
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,670
Then should I call you Shui?

222
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,080
Or perhaps

223
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,600
I should call you Mr. Su?

224
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,410
Are you reminding me

225
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,480
that I'm older than you?

226
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,320
If I wanted to remind you of that,

227
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,840
I wouldn't call you Mr. Su.

228
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,320
Instead, I would directly called you

229
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,390
Uncle Su.

230
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,030
Uncle Su?

231
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,510
You...

232
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,670
You...

233
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,870
Why did I

234
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,320
risk my life

235
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,030
to revive a demoness like you?

236
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,440
Forget it.

237
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,280
I'm tired of going in circles with you here.

238
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's go find the Gold Refining Fire first.

239
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,440
Uncle Ye Xin?

240
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,910
You look too much like my daughter.

241
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,200
I can't bear to kill you.

242
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,150
But it doesn't matter.

243
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,960
All of this is temporary.

244
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,790
After I complete my grand plan,

245
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,370
I will definitely not mistreat you.

246
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,030
Grand plan?

247
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,550
What exactly do you want to do?

248
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,550
I just

249
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,150
want to get back my wife and daughter,

250
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,750
and start everything over again.

251
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,600
How can there be anything in this world

252
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,910
that can turn back time

253
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,720
and relive the past?

254
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,870
Do you know

255
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,480
about the Three Thousand Realms?

256
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,670
Three Thousand Realms?

257
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,630
Dun Tian once told me

258
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,960
there are Three Thousand Realms

259
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,200
and in each realm,

260
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,360
there exists a different version of us.

261
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,630
Dun Tian wants to go to a world

262
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,360
where he didn't choose ascension,

263
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,200
where he didn't sacrifice his wife and daughter,

264
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,320
to start anew.

265
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,930
The Three Thousand Realms Tower

266
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,670
is the passage to the Three Thousand Realms.

267
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,480
Dun Tian wants the Gold Refining Fire

268
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,960
to emulate the Mortal-Demon Lord

269
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,940
and activate the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

270
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:29,870
No, that's not right.

271
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,750
He doesn't want the Gold Refining Fire.

272
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,480
After the Mortal-Demon Lord died,

273
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,220
the Immortal Realm created the Gold Refining Fire

274
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,470
to destroy his evil bones.

275
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,550
The Mortal-Demon Lord back then

276
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,630
couldn't have used this item.

277
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,450
Dun Tian deliberately led everyone

278
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,600
to search for the Gold Refining Fire.

279
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,550
There must be a conspiracy.

280
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,750
We need to hurry and tell everyone.

281
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,450
Fortunately, the Immortal Realm's compass

282
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,030
that draws down the Gold Refining Fire

283
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,050
is still in the Celestial Sect.

284
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,270
It saved me a lot of trouble.

285
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,910
Found it.

286
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,540
[Gold Refining Fire Hall of the Celestial Sect]

287
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,960
I've finally obtained

288
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,170
the Gold Refining Fire.

289
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,600
Wei Jiu!

290
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,660
Don't you dare make a move.

291
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,270
That depends on

292
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,620
whether you have what it takes.

293
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,030
Don't harm their lives,

294
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,270
lest it triggers the soul oath.

295
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,120
-Yes.
-Yes.

296
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,820
Su Yishui.

297
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,510
Master.

298
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,360
Master.

299
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,080
If you want to steal the Gold Refining Fire,

300
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,810
you'll have to ask if my Sword of Non-Attachment

301
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,390
agrees or not.

302
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,320
Be careful!

303
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,480
Everyone, stop!

304
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,870
Ranran!

305
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The remaining bones of the Mortal-Demon Lord

306
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,410
haven't been fully refined yet.

307
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,630
The Spirit Spring is the Mortal-Demon Lord's consciousness.

308
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,550
Shui is the Demon's child.

309
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,810
Could it be that

310
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,150
Dun Tian came here because...

311
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,480
Don't!

312
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,320
Nobody touch the Gold Refining Fire.

313
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,480
It's a trap.

314
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,120
Break the barrier!

315
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,960
How did you get the sacred Pearl

316
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,910
of the Celestial Sect?

317
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,030
H-How are you?

318
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,120
Hold onto

319
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,120
the Gold Refining Fire.

320
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,750
You were willing to violate the soul oath,

321
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,720
risking the backlash,

322
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:18,970
just to help me

323
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,150
obtain the Gold Refining Fire?

324
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,530
I told you not to meddle.

325
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,750
You think those foolish acts of yours

326
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,970
will earn you more of my favor?

327
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,910
One look at you,

328
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,880
and I have to help stabilize your meridians

329
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,720
and clean up your mess.

330
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,760
I suppose you've done some good.

331
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
What reward do you want?

332
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,670
Request whatever you want.

333
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,320
Even if...

334
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,140
Even if you fantasize about me.

335
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,630
I have fulfilled my promise.

336
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,400
Please, My Lord,

337
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,960
allow me to leave.

338
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,480
You...

339
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,030
It's still not working.

340
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,640
Wei Jiu's power now

341
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,750
has become so formidable.

342
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,589
Even our combined efforts

343
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,829
can't break through his barrier.

344
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,180
Something's not right.

345
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,829
Oh no.

346
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,240
The demon bones of the Mortal-Demon Lord.

347
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,589
Wei Jiu has trapped us here.

348
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,829
He intends to use the demonic energy to kill us.

349
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,510
It's Uncle Ye Xin.

350
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,790
He's trying to eliminate me as well.

351
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,680
While its demonic energy is still weak,

352
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,240
let's try to seal it.

353
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,000
Master!

354
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,790
Demon's child!

355
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,640
Let him go!

356
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,160
Ranran! Ranran! Ranran!

357
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,750
Ranran, are you alright?

358
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,260
What's going on?

359
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Stop struggling.

360
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,000
To carry my power

361
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
is the Demon's child's fate from the start!

362
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,750
It seems the residual demonic energy of the Mortal-Demon Lord

363
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,850
wants to possess the mortal body of the Demon's child.

364
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,970
Let's work together to subdue him first.

365
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,440
Alright.

366
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,720
Everyone, join forces!

367
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,310
Su Yishui.

368
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,210
How do you dare to

369
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,350
challenge me

370
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,370
with a spiritual sense muddled after cleansing?

371
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,830
Do you think it will be effective?

372
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,700
Master.

373
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,320
[Scarlet Abyss, Celestial Sect]

374
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,200
You've drained the waters of Scarlet Abyss,

375
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,310
opening a passage to the netherworld here.

376
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,240
Su Yishui!

377
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,650
That's the Spirit Spring

378
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,510
you sealed with your own hands.

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,680
stop this at once!

381
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,640
My spirit,

382
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,720
return to me.

383
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,840
All demonic creatures, heed my command.

384
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,790
Come to the mortal world

385
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,790
and do as you please.

386
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,280
Play to your heart's content.

387
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,770
How dare you interfere again and again?

388
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,110
Now that my spirit and bones are united,

389
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,750
inhabiting this mortal body,

390
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,700
if you wish to eliminate me,

391
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,110
it would mean Su Yishui's death.

392
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,700
And you

393
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,070
don't have the ability to kill me.

394
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,750
I will kill you today

395
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,310
to eliminate future troubles.

396
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,310
Your spiritual sense

397
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,880
hasn't been devoured by the demonic nature yet.

398
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,320
You can still fight for control of your mortal body?

399
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,750
Master!

400
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,050
♫The heavens collapse but is erased with a smile♫

401
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,970
♫Even if I have to shatter my bones to forge a weapon♫

402
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,970
♫It's worth it in exchange for your life♫

403
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,160
Ranran.

404
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,310
Ranran, Ranran.

405
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:36,780
♫The universe is witness of my heart and resolve♫

406
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,160
Ranran.

407
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,440
Come.

408
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,510
Ranran.

409
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,030
Quickly.

410
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,640
Ranran.

411
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,350
Your energy is very unstable.

412
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,200
You're seriously injured.

413
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,830
Master, he

414
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,590
has truly become a demon.

415
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,830
It turns out that the Scarlett Abyss

416
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,830
is connected to the netherworld.

417
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,850
So many demonic creatures

418
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,790
have escaped.

419
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,550
Where's the Demon's child?

420
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,590
Ranran,

421
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,030
what happened?

422
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,110
He reopened the Spirit Spring's seal.

423
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,310
So,

424
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,790
the Spirit Spring has entered the body of the Demon's child's.

425
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,590
Everyone, please join forces with me

426
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,110
to borrow the power of heaven and earth

427
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,580
to seal this opening.

428
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,380
Don't let the demonic creatures from the netherworld

429
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,350
run rampant in this world.

430
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,000
This matter is of utmost importance.

431
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,260
Let's deal with this first.

432
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,270
Yu Chen.

433
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,440
Has my brother sent any news?

434
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,440
When will he come?

435
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,160
I miss him so much.

436
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:42,520
Miss Xiaoxiao,

437
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,440
stay here and rest assured.

438
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,400
The Guardian still has matters to attend to.

439
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,850
I must go to assist the Guardian now.

440
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,110
Then you should hurry and go.

441
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,000
I'll just wait for my brother here.

442
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,680
Su Yishui,

443
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,720
why do you resist me?

444
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,400
Those around you abandon you, deceive you, and hide things from you.

445
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,070
Are you only fit to be

446
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,430
their disposable pawn,

447
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,880
to be manipulated by them as they please?

448
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,440
As the Demon's child,

449
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,440
you are born to be a sovereign,

450
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,310
a powerful being.

451
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,960
You should be

452
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,480
the master of destiny in this world.

453
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,310
Guardian, what's wrong?

454
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,540
Don't come closer.

455
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,550
Immortal-binding vine.

456
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,450
I have brought all

457
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,400
the immortal-binding vine seeds.

458
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Just plant them.

459
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,440
Don't come any closer.

460
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,840
I see.

461
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,170
You want to use the demonic vine's absorbing power

462
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,880
to drain me.

463
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,480
Your spiritual power

464
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,070
will also be drained.

465
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,680
Would you rather become useless

466
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,070
and even risk your life?

467
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,200
You...

468
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,880
You are now

469
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,240
Su Yishui's only connection

470
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,880
to his past self

471
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,350
after the soul cleansing.

472
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,480
The slightest blood relation

473
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,550
and shared experiences of hardship

474
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,550
is enough to sway his thoughts.

475
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,510
The demon

476
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,640
seeps into every crevice.

477
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,960
Even the slightest fear,

478
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,790
uncertainty,

479
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,200
or unease

480
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,720
in his heart

481
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,310
will be devoured by the demon

482
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,480
and amplified,

483
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,200
leading him to demonization.

484
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,160
Why waste your effort?

485
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,030
You...

486
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,440
Yu Chen!

487
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
You're not Su Xiaoxiao.

488
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,450
Of course I'm not the Su Xiaoxiao

489
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,350
who had high hopes for you.

490
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,000
I've crawled back from hell.

491
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,680
You abandoned me.

492
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,070
I hate you.

493
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,480
You forgot the oath you made.

494
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:42,650
You said

495
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,830
everyone would only be able to

496
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,070
bow at your feet.

497
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,350
But what happened?

498
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,110
What made you give up your oath?

499
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,510
For what

500
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,200
did I...

501
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,750
Giving up everything for a woman,

502
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,400
do you believe such nonsense?

503
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,880
I don't.

504
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,590
Have you forgotten how we endured

505
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,350
all the suffering

506
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,210
and waded through blood,

507
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,440
covered in scars?

508
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,270
What exactly

509
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,310
was it for?

510
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,480
Useless people

511
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,270
are the ones who keep asking why.

512
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,720
Become me.

513
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,640
Become the supreme and ultimate,

514
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,640
and you'll be the only answer in this world.

515
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,880
Brother?

516
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,880
This mortal body is finally stable.

517
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,160
Did Dun Tian send you here?

518
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,640
Where is he now?

519
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,400
I have a big score

520
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,570
to settle with him.

521
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
This is all

522
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,510
that has happened

523
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,200
and what we've deduced.

524
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,510
What exactly is the Three Thousand Realms Tower?

525
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,160
The Mortal-Demon Lord has been annihilated for hundreds of years

526
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,130
and the records about the Three Thousand Realms Tower

527
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,110
are also very scarce.

528
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,720
People only know

529
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,560
that it is

530
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,830
a demonic tower that destroys heaven and earth,

531
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,030
but they don't know

532
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,990
it's related to the heaven-defying technique you mentioned.

533
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,680
This is the information

534
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,590
I collected about the Three Thousand Realms Tower before.

535
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,680
Actually,

536
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,960
the universe is vast.

537
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,960
It's not just

538
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,350
the world we know.

539
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,440
There are 3,000 realms in the world

540
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,000
and in each realm, there are versions of you, me,

541
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,270
and all living beings.

542
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,880
So rather than saying

543
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,110
Dun Tian wants to resurrect his wife and child,

544
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,440
it's more accurate to say

545
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,200
he wants to go to another world,

546
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,400
find the point where his wife and child still exist,

547
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,750
and start anew.

548
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,480
So,

549
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,830
the method to connect the Three Thousand Realms

550
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,640
is the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

551
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,680
This is a heaven-defying act

552
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,240
that requires enormous energy

553
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,310
and comes at a great cost.

554
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,720
For Dun Tian to open the Three Thousand Realms,

555
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,030
he must sacrifice everything in this world.

556
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,480
That's why it's said

557
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,790
the Three Thousand Realms Tower

558
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,880
can destroy everything.

559
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,750
You mean

560
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,480
Dun Tian wants to destroy

561
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,830
the realm we're in?

562
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,670
Do you all

563
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,790
believe what she says?

564
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,240
Elder Yan,

565
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,790
isn't Dun Tian

566
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,730
the founder of your Eternal Sect?

567
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,110
The great Dun Tian

568
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,000
lived hundreds of years ago.

569
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,680
How can I know his true nature?

570
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,070
But Wen, Miss Xue,

571
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,000
Sovereign Su, and I

572
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,480
have been to the netherworld.

573
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,070
We sealed the Spirit Spring and witnessed many things.

574
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,590
Therefore, I no longer doubt

575
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,640
the character of those two.

576
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,590
You all should make your own judgment.

577
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,400
Now is the time for the Heavenly Sects

578
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,510
to unite.

579
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,310
However, I'm not sure

580
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,480
how specifically we can activate

581
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,960
the Three Thousand Realms Tower

582
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,590
or what we should do

583
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,960
to stop his plan.

584
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,200
This is a world-ending technique.

585
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,640
The limited information you've gathered

586
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,000
is far from complete.

587
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,410
Dun Tian

588
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,830
must have obtained this technique from the Immortal Realm.

589
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,680
How can we, mere mortals,

590
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,880
hope to contend with

591
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,980
an ascended expert?

592
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,880
Moreover,

593
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,640
he has the Demon's child and demonic creatures

594
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,480
assisting him.

595
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,070
Why do we cultivate to become immortals?

596
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,210
To save people,

597
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,400
to bring peace to the world,

598
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,750
and to achieve the spiritual heart.

599
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,200
Now is the time

600
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,070
for us to exert our power.

601
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,100
Luring the Demon's child to demonization

602
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,480
should be one of the steps

603
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,110
in activating the Three Thousand Realms Tower,

604
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,240
and a crucial one at that.

605
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,680
But the Demon's child alone

606
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,960
is certainly not enough.

607
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,550
He must have subsequent actions planned.

608
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,920
So I ask you all

609
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,790
to carefully examine the archives of each sect again,

610
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,240
and search for

611
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,160
any remaining documents about the Three Thousand Realms Tower

612
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,880
to figure out Dun Tian's next moves.

613
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,480
That's all we can do.

614
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,810
But there's a demon surge now.

615
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,350
I'll go find Wei Jiu

616
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,370
and request the Gold Refining Fire

617
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,310
to resolve this matter.

618
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,070
However,

619
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,030
I have an unreasonable request.

620
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,200
After the demon surge is cleared,

621
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,640
please allow me

622
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,310
to keep the Gold Refining Fire.

623
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,750
You want to...

624
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,440
My Master's spiritual sense still remains.

625
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,960
The Gold Refining Fire

626
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,510
might help me bring him back.

627
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,950
Dun Tian wants to use him,

628
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,830
but I won't let him succeed.

629
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,160
What's going on with this lamp?

630
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,240
Move it closer.

631
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,680
He can't die yet.

632
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,210
I'm here to kill you.

633
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,030
Mortal-Demon Lord,

634
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,350
back then,

635
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,720
I could only suppress you

636
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,590
by gathering all the Heavenly Sects.

637
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,790
But now,

638
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,630
you're barely my match.

639
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,670
You're indeed a mere shadow of your former self,

640
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,200
no longer what you used to be.

641
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,030
Thanks to you.

642
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:40,650
Even if

643
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,880
you have the power to kill me now,

644
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,750
you can't regain your former strength.

645
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,030
So,

646
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,590
don't you want to return to your prime?

647
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,200
As if I'd believe you.

648
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,350
Your presence here today

649
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,070
is all my doing.

650
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,310
In this world,

651
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,690
nothing

652
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,110
remains unchanged forever.

653
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,440
We once had opposing stances,

654
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
but who's to say

655
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,000
we can't join forces now

656
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,550
for a common goal?

657
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,160
Why?

658
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,880
Back then,

659
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,960
you intended to open the Three Thousand Realms Tower

660
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,750
when the netherworld was just formed,

661
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,270
wanting to keep those demonic creatures

662
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,370
in the mortal world.

663
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,550
My wish, however, is much simpler.

664
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,000
I only hope

665
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,690
to return to the time

666
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,200
when I first met my wife and daughter.

667
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,260
So you also want to open the Three Thousand Realms Tower too?

668
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,680
Interesting.

669
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,470
Very interesting.

670
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,040
Stop talking.

671
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,160
Rest.

672
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,270
Sovereign Wei, you're quite calculative,

673
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,520
making others suffer for breaking their soul oath,

674
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,820
while you can

675
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,610
hold onto the Gold Refining Fire.

676
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,240
Considering you gave Tu Jiuyuan

677
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,980
some useful Foundation Stabilizing Pills,

678
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
I won't hold it against you.

679
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,290
Why haven't you left yet?

680
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:08,969
Not in a hurry

681
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,150
to find that

682
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,480
demon-possessed

683
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,510
Master of yours?

684
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,920
We need to settle the score first.

685
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:16,679
If you hadn't recklessly

686
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,880
stolen the Gold Refining Fire,

687
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,510
none of this would have happened.

688
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,540
What do you want?

689
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,320
I want

690
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,480
the Gold Refining Fire.

691
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,159
I also want your Celestial Sect

692
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,030
to cooperate with the Heavenly Sects

693
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,330
in using the power of the Gold Refining Fire

694
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,320
to eliminate the demon surge

695
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,710
and defeat Dun Tian together.

696
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,800
The Gold Refining Fire

697
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,330
was obtained at the cost

698
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,000
of my people's lives.

699
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,550
Why should I give it to you?

700
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,760
I'm not negotiating with you.

701
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,840
You don't think that in this chaos,

702
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:46,080
holding onto the Gold Refining Fire

703
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,880
and controlling a few demonic creatures

704
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,050
will keep you safe, do you?

705
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,929
Dun Tian luring all the Heavenly Sects

706
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,760
to Mount Scarlet Flame this time

707
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,360
has hurt you greatly too.

708
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,989
What he wants to destroy

709
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,960
is the world we live in.

710
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,550
Sovereign Wei,

711
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,440
are you still only concerned about your own affairs?

712
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,360
You—

713
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,740
Miss Xue is correct.

714
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,630
There was indeed an external force at work

715
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,260
when the Gold Refining Fire entered the Pearl.

716
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,510
I'm afraid it was Dun Tian's doing.

717
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,480
You should see the current situation clearly.

718
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,850
Are you feeling better?

719
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,190
You're in such a hurry to come out and teach me a lesson.

720
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,140
The Gold Refining Fire

721
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,110
was obtained at the risk of your life.

722
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,800
If you're willing to give it to her,

723
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,110
why should I stop you?

724
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,750
Miss Xue

725
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,870
saved my life.

726
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,400
Moreover,

727
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,900
what she says makes a lot of sense.

728
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,030
Thank you.

729
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,480
Sovereign Wei might as well check

730
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,440
the archives of the Celestial Sect

731
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,550
to see if there are any records of the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

732
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
It might help prevent

733
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,590
Dun Tian's next move.

734
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,710
I'll take my leave now.

735
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,550
Aren't you going back to rest?

736
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,770
I should be going too.

737
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,710
I...

738
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,030
These are all your favorites.

739
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,440
Come,

740
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,280
let's sit and eat together.

741
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,920
What's wrong?

742
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,400
Don't you want to eat?

743
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,710
Come.

744
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,400
I picked all these for you.

745
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,320
If you like them, keep them.

746
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,840
If not, throw them away.

747
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,630
These are enough for me.

748
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,480
You all, leave.

749
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,480
Yes.

750
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,850
In the past,

751
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,510
the Scarlet Sect Token

752
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,890
was given to you by the former sovereign.

753
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,110
Now,

754
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,880
the Celestial Sect token

755
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
is given to you by me.

756
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,550
Do you know what this means?

757
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,960
These are of no use to me anymore.

758
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:55,870
Tu Jiuyuan,

759
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,800
I'm willingly

760
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,150
giving you half of the leadership

761
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,260
of the Celestial Sect,

762
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,000
but you're still not appreciative.

763
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,550
What else do you want?

764
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,710
If you

765
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,550
insist that I like you,

766
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,440
then I can also—

767
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,800
I've already said I want to leave.

768
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,030
You should keep your word.

769
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,840
Don't go back on your word

770
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,150
like a child.

771
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:21,630
Hey.

772
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,030
It's clearly you who's talking nonsense

773
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,070
and causing me trouble.

774
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,680
You confidently said you liked me,

775
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,620
but it's only been a few days.

776
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,670
I haven't digested it yet,

777
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,770
and here you are,

778
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,530
suddenly acting

779
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,830
cold and heartless.

780
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,840
You...

781
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,710
Are you playing some kind of

782
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,040
hard-to-get game with me?

783
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,030
Let me tell you,

784
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,440
I won't fall for that trick.

785
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,320
Everything I said was sincere.

786
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,880
My youthful affection was sincere

787
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,190
and the feelings I've held for decades

788
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,050
were also sincere.

789
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,440
It's just that now,

790
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,420
I have no more feelings or desires

791
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
for you.

792
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,630
I only hope that you can

793
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,840
let me go, considering my decades

794
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,630
of loyal service.

795
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,800
I only wish

796
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,880
to live the rest of my life

797
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,410
on my own terms.

798
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,510
Fine.

799
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,190
If the Celestial Sect can't keep you,

800
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,960
why should I force you to stay?

801
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,440
If you want to leave, then go quickly.

802
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,320
I...

803
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,000
Master.

804
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,510
Zeng,

805
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:33,970
there's no need.

806
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,550
You've aged so much more than me.

807
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,760
All this bowing back and forth

808
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,100
might shorten my lifespan.

809
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:41,960
Then, Master, I...

810
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,460
From now on, just call me Ranran.

811
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,070
Ranran,

812
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,890
as you wish.

813
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,960
Your hand...

814
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,980
You must have suffered back then.

815
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,550
That was so long ago.

816
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,920
It doesn't affect me at all now.

817
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,250
If you want to make weapons

818
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,320
or magical artifacts,

819
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,440
just leave it to me.

820
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,760
Thanks to you all these years

821
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,920
for being with Shui

822
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,960
and taking such good care of Mount Wester.

823
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,390
Shui is used to being alone,

824
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,760
but with you around,

825
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,040
at least he has someone

826
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,070
to consult with.

827
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,150
Back then,

828
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,410
if he hadn't risked his life

829
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,070
to save you,

830
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,000
I wouldn't have

831
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,070
said another word to him.

832
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,710
He always said

833
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,110
that when you regained your memory,

834
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,440
you could punish him however you wanted.

835
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:20,710
But I knew

836
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,800
you wouldn't blame him at all.

837
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,550
How is he now?

838
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,150
Before I returned to Mount Wester,

839
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,250
Yu Chen and Yu Tong

840
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,230
sent sound transmission talismans

841
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,830
saying that Shui seemed to have completely demonized.

842
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,360
Both Yu Chen and Yu Tong

843
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,410
were also severely injured by the demonic energy,

844
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,400
damaging their Foundations.

845
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,960
I've brought them back

846
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,510
and told them to immediately go into seclusion to recover.

847
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,800
It will take several years of recuperation before they can come out.

848
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,840
During this time,

849
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,110
please take care of them as well.

850
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,230
This Dun Tian really calculated every move.

851
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,280
If Su Yishui has completely become a demon,

852
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:48,910
then...

853
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,530
I don't believe it.

854
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,250
I will definitely bring him back.

855
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,400
Bring him back.

856
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,590
Oh, Master,

857
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,230
your identity

858
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,880
is now known throughout the Heavenly Sects.

859
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,150
The fellow disciples

860
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,220
realized they mistook their Master.

861
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,890
They're all at the foot of Mount Wester now,

862
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,000
feeling too guilty to come up.

863
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,070
What do you think?

864
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,630
It wasn't their fault to begin with.

865
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,550
But there's no need for them to come back.

866
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,770
Who knows

867
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,080
what kind of bloody storm

868
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,320
Mount Wester may face now?

869
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,070
Why involve them in this?

870
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,800
Time

871
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,070
is probably really running out.

872
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,030
Master,

873
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,000
the demon Su Yishui

874
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,230
has broken into Mount Eternal.

875
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:26,960
Where is he now?

876
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,280
He went straight to the Jade Pool.

877
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,440
Master has already rushed there.

878
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,010
Use sound transmission talismans to notify Mount Wester.

879
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,360
Open the teleportation array

880
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,550
and have Xue Ranran come over quickly.

881
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,320
Yes.

882
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:55,760
Demon,

883
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,080
how dare you touch the Eternal Sect's Jade Pool?

884
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,500
So your target

885
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,890
is the Eternal Sect's spiritual channel.

886
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,070
In your dreams!

887
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,080
Activate the formation

888
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:13,710
to assist Master!

889
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:25,740
Master!

890
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,880
Immortal, leave it to me.

891
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,630
Su Yishui!

892
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,150
Su Yishui is no longer here.

893
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,000
What?

894
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,040
Are you here to take this shell?
