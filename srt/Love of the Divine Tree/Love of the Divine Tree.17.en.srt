00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,950
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
You're the girl

4
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,560
who came to visit me

5
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,990
when I was in seclusion?

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,590
Immortal Master,

7
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:56,950
do you really have a way

8
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,509
to return the spiritual soul to its soul owner?

9
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,789
What?

10
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,840
I don't look trustworthy?

11
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
I was just suppressed by you

12
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,310
because my Golden Core was damaged

13
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,290
during my seclusion;

14
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,510
I'm still low on spiritual energy.

15
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,610
I was

16
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,680
not this weak before.

17
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,840
Actually, Immortal Master, the moment you made your move,

18
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,910
I was just overwhelmed

19
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,680
by your aura.

20
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,810
As expected of the Master Healer of immortal cultivation.

21
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,650
Truly impressive.

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,800
The return of my spiritual soul friend

23
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,420
all depends on you, Immortal Master.

24
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,680
Do you know who

25
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,470
the spiritual soul's owner is?

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,360
Immortal Master,

27
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,040
I bet you have a way

28
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,650
to find out who the soul owner is, right?

29
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,910
This spiritual soul's been protecting

30
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,940
and helping me all the way.

31
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,360
I also want to know

32
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,790
who its owner really is.

33
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,020
I wonder if the lack of the spiritual soul

34
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,100
has had any effect on him.

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,680
Of course,

36
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,430
it'd have affected him.

37
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,750
Those without spiritual souls

38
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,700
can neither form Golden Cores

39
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,630
nor advance in cultivation.

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,270
Is it that serious?

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,710
Then I must return the spiritual soul as soon as possible.

42
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,090
Immortal Master Liang, you...

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,750
What a pity.

44
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,190
If you came to me

45
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:52,780
before my seclusion,

46
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,650
I could give it a try

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,840
even for such a spiritual soul

48
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,030
separated from its owner for so long,

49
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,630
What about now?

50
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,030
As I said before,

51
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,140
my Golden Core is damaged.

52
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,310
I can do nothing about it now.

53
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,430
Immortal Master Liang,

54
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,980
please help me.

55
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,750
Alright, girl,

56
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,870
don't bother begging me.

57
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,430
The key to change

58
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,680
depends on you.

59
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,000
Having taken good care of a separated spiritual soul

60
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,790
after all this time,

61
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,520
you must be someone with a Formless Spirit Root,

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,360
right?

63
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,030
Don't be nervous.

64
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,430
I just like

65
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,560
studying spiritual souls.

66
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,070
I'm not interested in others'

67
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,000
Spirit Roots or artifacts.

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,079
The ancient text says,

69
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,310
when those with Formless Spirit Roots

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,360
form Golden Cores,

71
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,030
they can just send spiritual souls back to the owners.

72
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,630
Which ancient text?

73
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,120
I can't quite remember.

74
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,150
However,

75
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,210
I remember that this method

76
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,960
comes with a price,

77
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,050
a price that diminishes

78
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,310
one's own cultivation.

79
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,840
I'm afraid you won't

80
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,120
be willing to pay it.

81
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,579
One should repay a favor.

82
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,470
I only want to be true to my conscience.

83
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,470
Girl,

84
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,520
I'm starting to grow on you.

85
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,190
Master!

86
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,430
Why did you bring this jinx here?

87
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,550
I went to get the wine cups,

88
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,660
and he followed me all the way here.

89
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,830
What is this lightweight

90
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,000
doing here at our drinking party?

91
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,840
Master, please sit here.

92
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:07,960
You can have some tea.

93
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,640
Didn't expect someone as cold and aloof as you

94
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,120
to show such an expression.

95
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,800
You don't look like yourself.

96
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,750
Ranran,

97
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,270
just a heads-up.

98
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,870
You'd better be careful with him.

99
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,750
Don't be fooled by him.

100
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,090
That's not true.

101
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,390
My master's always been so nice.

102
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,070
Immortal Master Liang,

103
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,670
you knew my master before, right?

104
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,480
We have a grudge.

105
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,040
Mistaken Divine.

106
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,950
I really miss this taste.

107
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,700
Were it not for someone,

108
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:49,920
I could be drinking with Qingge today,

109
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,830
chatting

110
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
and watching the moon together.

111
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,510
Exactly.

112
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:55,750
Well,

113
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,600
Mu is good in every way,

114
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,000
except for her poor judgment.

115
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,240
She got such a

116
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,360
heartless and ungrateful disciple

117
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,050
who got her killed.

118
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,920
My master did it for the greater good.

119
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,700
Mu Qingge...

120
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,430
Ridiculous!

121
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,750
What kind of greater good was that?

122
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,600
Eliminated the Demon's child to save the universe?

123
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
Mu Qingge's definitely not the Demon's child!

124
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,630
How could that be?

125
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,600
Then who is it?

126
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,630
Anyway, it must be someone else.

127
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
Back then, Mu

128
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,920
must have fallen for someone's scheme

129
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,000
or what,

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,190
so she was possessed by the Spirit Spring.

131
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,510
If she were the Demon's child,

132
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,190
why would she endure the pain of splitting her core?

133
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,890
She didn't hesitate to use her Golden Core

134
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,870
to envelope the Spirit Spring

135
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,600
and extract it from her body.

136
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,090
She just planned to send

137
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,800
the Spirit Spring back to the netherworld at the very beginning.

138
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,510
Then why...

139
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,360
Because only after she went to the netherworld did she learn

140
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,300
that only the Demon's child could seal the Spirit Spring.

141
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,630
Qingge had no choice but to extract the Spirit Spring

142
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,070
and seal it temporarily.

143
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,950
Did she mention

144
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,000
anything special she ran into

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,630
in the netherworld?

146
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,830
She didn't go into details.

147
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,680
But before she went to the netherworld, she sent me a letter,

148
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,240
asking me to make not only golden talismans

149
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,630
to suppress the Spirit Spring

150
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,210
but also several battle talismans

151
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,750
to fight powerful beings.

152
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,600
She said

153
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,240
there might be a formidable enemy in the netherworld.

154
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,030
At that time, she still had her Golden Core

155
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,270
with few who could match her.

156
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
Who exactly did she fight against

157
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
in the netherworld?

158
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,830
Also,

159
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,070
who exactly was her opponent?

160
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,360
You're asking me?

161
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,430
I didn't even have time to ask Mu

162
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,950
before she perished in the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation.

163
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,040
Su Yishui,

164
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,720
let's be real.

165
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,240
When you accused Mu Qingge of being the Demon's child

166
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,240
and launched an attack on her,

167
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,720
did you really have solid evidence

168
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,870
without considering any personal beef?

169
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,510
What?

170
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,190
Cat got your tongue?

171
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,730
Ranran!

172
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,720
Open your eyes!

173
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,920
This man is neither kind

174
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,560
nor honest.

175
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,000
How can he be called sovereign?

176
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,330
Instead of following this cruel

177
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,190
and ungrateful master-killer,

178
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,510
you'd be better

179
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,900
just stay here with me on Mount Cuiwei!

180
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,870
My master is not what you think.

181
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,720
I have some questions

182
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,630
about cultivation to ask my master.

183
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,600
I'll take my leave now.

184
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,190
Master.

185
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,190
Master,

186
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,190
what did the Alcohol Immortal mean?

187
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,680
Is my grandmaster really the Demon's child?

188
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,600
Of course...

189
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,520
Silencing Curse?

190
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,870
Master, what's wrong?

191
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,870
Do you also think the real Demon's child

192
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,390
deserves to die

193
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,120
the most tragic death?

194
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,160
But I don't understand.

195
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,000
Without the Spirit Spring,

196
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,160
wouldn't the Demon's child just be

197
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,070
an ordinary person?

198
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,310
He or she was just born at a special moment.

199
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,750
Just a poor little thing

200
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,960
born as a vessel

201
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,160
with no choice.

202
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,070
The real root of evil

203
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,720
has always been the Spirit Spring.

204
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,070
Perhaps my grandmaster

205
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,430
thought the same way back then.

206
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,720
That's why she willingly bore

207
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,830
the stigma of being called the Demon's child

208
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,220
and zeroed in on sealing the Spirit Spring

209
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,040
to stop the fight between people and the Demon's child.

210
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,560
Master, are you angry?

211
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,960
I shouldn't have talked about my grandmaster like that.

212
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:34,870
No,

213
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,510
what you said

214
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,030
is a real comfort.

215
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,200
Just some random thoughts.

216
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,090
What lovely thing has made you

217
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,990
grin all the way?

218
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,390
Didn't Master ask us to buy

219
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,150
herbs for the detoxifying bath?

220
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,690
I'm just happy that I can go down the mountain,

221
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,840
stroll around the fair, and enjoy good food.

222
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,930
But why do I feel like

223
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,880
you said "Master"

224
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,600
so affectionately?

225
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,870
Yet you don't admit it.

226
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,910
Whatever you say.

227
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,200
I can't hide anything from you anyway.

228
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,210
Then does Master know

229
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,470
about your feelings?

230
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,120
Well, how should I put it?

231
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,030
I don't know if Master knows or not,

232
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
but Mr. Zeng

233
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,360
secretly warned me that

234
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,490
coveting Masters

235
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,750
would bring about divine retribution.

236
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,000
Senior!

237
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,480
Here we are, the pharmacy!

238
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,990
[Herb Pharmacy]

239
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,960
Senior Bai,

240
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,120
what are you looking for?

241
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,150
Nothing.

242
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,720
You guys go inside and buy the medicine.

243
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,630
I'll go browse around up ahead.

244
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:48,980
Xi'er,

245
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,760
don't you think Senior Bai's been acting weird

246
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,630
these past few days?

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He's been sneaking down the mountain

248
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,000
for something we don't know.

249
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,870
You're right...

250
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,660
Here's the shopping list.

251
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,940
You and Senior Gao go buy the items.

252
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,150
I'll go keep an eye on Senior Bai.

253
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,910
Okay.

254
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,440
Be careful.

255
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,540
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

256
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,390
Rou'er,

257
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,030
I've missed you so much

258
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,670
since we last met two days ago.

259
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,320
I've been wanting to see you all this time.

260
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,320
Let me see

261
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,650
if your pretty face

262
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,480
is messed up from crying.

263
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,480
Bo,

264
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
I can't even sleep well

265
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
without you around.

266
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,840
I've got

267
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,190
your bath ready.

268
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,480
Go ahead.

269
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,790
You just can't wait.

270
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,150
Bo,

271
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,320
go ahead.

272
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,320
Go quickly, Bo.

273
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,200
Elder Tu,

274
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,480
can you please find a woman

275
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,960
to do the job of seducing this man?

276
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,390
This guy's always getting handsy.

277
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,510
I really want to split him in half.

278
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm the only woman among those who came out

279
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,550
with the Lord this time.

280
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,440
If you don't do it,

281
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,690
are you suggesting that

282
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,870
I should go deal with this fool?

283
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,200
No, my lady.

284
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,080
He's under the Illusion Spell.

285
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,840
Just a trigger of words,

286
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,030
and he'll see illusions

287
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,840
and hear unreal sounds.

288
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,300
I will tell the Lord about the information

289
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,830
you got from him by it.

290
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,120
And you'll get the credit for this one.

291
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,920
What's the big deal if he gropes you?

292
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,320
For the Lord,

293
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,740
I'm willing to do anything

294
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,500
at any cost!

295
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,870
The Scarlet Sect is targeting Master.

296
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,360
What exactly have they found out?

297
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,440
And what's their plan?

298
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,630
Senior Gao, Xi'er,

299
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,840
hurry and come to this talisman's location.

300
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,270
Senior Bai is here.

301
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,750
Keep a close eye, but don't act rashly.

302
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,240
Focus and Eavesdrop.

303
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,600
I just suppressed the Resentment Liquid for her.

304
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,360
She's circulating Qi to recover.

305
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,320
Just keep it down.

306
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,120
Who

307
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,750
is he?

308
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,360
Su Yishui is indeed very cautious.

309
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,480
Bai Baishan

310
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,910
has never heard him mention the Spirit Spring.

311
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,200
All we know is that

312
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,320
he's heading south the day after tomorrow.

313
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,550
I guess

314
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,440
they're heading for the Spirit Spring.

315
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,690
I've already had Bai Baishan

316
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,630
infected with the Horned Ghost Poison.

317
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,670
Just a touch, and he can make Su Yishui

318
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,470
fall victim to it

319
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,390
without even realizing it.

320
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,750
In that case,

321
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:35,970
he'll be no match for you, My Lord,

322
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,080
and will be at your mercy.

323
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,630
Well done.

324
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,360
What about the other fruit?

325
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,790
Bai Baishan doesn't know,

326
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,090
but he said

327
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,120
Su Yishui values his Junior Xue the most.

328
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,150
And that girl always has a branch

329
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,030
hanging on her, like it's her precious treasure.

330
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,130
Could she be the other fruit?

331
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,940
Little girl,

332
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,830
it's you!

333
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,390
You're the little disciple

334
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,960
Su Yishui values the most?

335
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,240
What's your name?

336
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,270
My master says, when we are out,

337
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,120
we shouldn't

338
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,360
tell strangers our names.

339
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,360
Sir, I dare not

340
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,320
disobey my master's order.

341
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,150
He's got sharp ears

342
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,940
and can hear us

343
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,830
even from outside.

344
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,600
Where is your master?

345
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,540
He's been waiting outside.

346
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,240
He asked me to invite you, Immortal Master Wei,

347
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,000
out to meet him.

348
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,380
My master said

349
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,490
if there's anything you want to know,

350
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,670
you can ask him directly.

351
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,030
Don't bother going to such lengths.

352
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,080
Go check it out.

353
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,600
Got it.

354
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,080
My Lord!

355
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,440
Go after her! Now!

356
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,090
But Su Yishui is also here.

357
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,170
You're even dumber

358
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
than a little girl!

359
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,630
If her master were really here,

360
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,480
would she have to

361
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,350
flee away so fast?

362
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,270
Go and get her!

363
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,950
She might be the other fruit.

364
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:03,750
Yes, My Lord.

365
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,550
Wei Jiu is here.

366
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,880
We can't touch Senior Bai for now.

367
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,320
Let's run.

368
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:14,970
Okay.

369
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,480
Let's go!

370
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,360
Ranran.

371
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,750
Junior Xue,

372
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,670
let's get out of here.

373
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,550
We can't...

374
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,200
My whip loves blood the most.

375
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,440
Once it smells the scent of blood,

376
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,130
I just can't hold it back.

377
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:13,840
Move!

378
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,060
Use the Exorcising Formation!

379
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,540
Okay!

380
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,150
Just a fragile formation.

381
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,960
One wisp of qi...

382
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,270
It's her!

383
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,560
To break the galaxy!

384
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,020
Mu Qingge...

385
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,240
I won't let you steal my power again!

386
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,150
Thought you really had something up your sleeve.

387
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,770
Go to hell!

388
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:11,840
Ranran!

389
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,670
Master...

390
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,240
Senior Bai is in the courtyard of Huaihua Lane.

391
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,910
Wei Jiu has poisoned him

392
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,510
to harm you.

393
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,930
You must be careful.

394
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,400
Silence.

395
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,010
Let me help you recover and ease the pain.

396
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,920
How dare you hurt my disciple?

397
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,510
Retreat!

398
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,720
You ask for it...

399
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,240
Xue Ranran is Mu Qingge?

400
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,070
Su Yishui,

401
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,720
you've been fooling me all along.

402
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,280
Both of you

403
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,200
deserve to die.

404
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,510
Feng!

405
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,720
Feng!

406
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,880
Your Highness.

407
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,310
That beast is running wild again?

408
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,320
You go back to the palace now

409
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,490
to keep an eye on it.

410
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,620
Once we restore the Four-Way Waterways,

411
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,110
everything will be fine.

412
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,830
Yes, Your Highness.

413
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,200
Your Highness,

414
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,110
among the squads sent to investigate the waterways,

415
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,690
only those heading to the Puxin Village

416
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,680
have not returned yet.

417
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,000
There's no news from them either.

418
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,830
No collapses in other areas.

419
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,550
Then the Puxin Village must have undergone a collapse,

420
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,240
blocking the waterway.

421
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,240
Can't wait any longer.

422
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,810
Tell everyone to gear up

423
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,350
and set off for the Puxin Village right away.

424
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,110
Understood!

425
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,110
Why are you not after her?

426
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,790
It's my fault, Your Highness.

427
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,160
I followed Master Mu

428
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,340
and saw her secretly meet Scarlet Sect's Wei Jiu.

429
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,060
Then I just lost track of Master Mu.

430
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,680
Qingge hates people like Wei Jiu.

431
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,160
How could she meet him in secret?

432
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,240
Something's off.

433
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,790
No matter how much people change,

434
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,060
their true nature hardly alters.

435
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,680
Qingge has always been upfront.

436
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,440
Her ditching you

437
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,720
is already the biggest red flag.

438
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,000
She can't be Qingge.

439
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:19,960
Ranran...

440
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,720
Holy moly,

441
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,680
you're finally awake.

442
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,750
You've been

443
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,060
asleep for four days, you know?

444
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,400
Everything's in chaos out there.

445
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,030
What?

446
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,000
I thought with Master here,

447
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,950
everything must be fine then.

448
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,830
Could it be

449
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,640
that Wei Jiu really injured Master?

450
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,650
Then Master...

451
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,310
That's not the case.

452
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,390
Calm down.

453
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,280
Don't let your wounds

454
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,880
split open.

455
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,440
You should have seen it.

456
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,960
Master was terrifying that day.

457
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,750
He went on a killing spree all the way.

458
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,070
Those Scarlets

459
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,680
were burned to ashes right before us.

460
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,070
Not even a trace was left.

461
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,000
Master held you like this

462
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,310
and said,

463
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,000
"How dare you hurt my disciple?

464
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,310
You ask for it."

465
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,480
He held me?

466
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,000
Did he hold me all the way and bring me back?

467
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,680
What are you secretly thinking about?

468
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,680
Oh, God. You look so lost

469
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,440
in love.

470
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,550
But don't get in too deep

471
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,200
How can I control it?

472
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,920
Master is so nice.

473
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,790
Senior Bai won't agree with you.

474
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,030
Senior Bai is about to be expelled

475
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,350
from the sect by Master, you know?

476
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,920
The Horned Ghost Poison in you has been removed,

477
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,440
but it's diminished

478
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,440
your cultivation

479
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,680
in an irreversible way.

480
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,640
Our master-disciple tie ends here.

481
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,160
You may leave now.

482
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,240
Master...

483
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,040
I-I didn't mean to do it.

484
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,560
I've always looked up to you, Master.

485
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,960
I would never dare to betray you.

486
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,960
Master,

487
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,310
I-I don't want to be a good-for-nothing.

488
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
As omnipotent as you are,

489
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,240
you must have some way to help me.

490
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,480
Your Bai family

491
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,030
once saved a veteran Wester.

492
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,680
Out of gratitude for this favor,

493
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,590
I took you as my disciple.

494
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,550
But this time, you were blinded by lust,

495
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,110
causing your fellows to face danger and get hurt.

496
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,550
You should've paid for your sins with your life.

497
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,790
Expelling you from the sect

498
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,550
is me showing mercy.

499
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,320
I've said all I need to say.

500
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,070
That's enough.

501
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,310
Master...

502
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,070
Master!

503
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,200
Master!

504
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,880
Is it that serious?

505
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,510
Both Senior Gao and I were reluctant to see that happen.

506
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,920
We wanted to plead with Master.

507
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,940
But Master only called Mr. Yu Chen

508
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,040
and Mr. Zeng Yi here

509
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,750
to take care of you.

510
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,480
Then he just went into seclusion, not seeing anyone.

511
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,160
Why did Master suddenly go into seclusion?

512
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,920
Su Yishui, look at yourself.

513
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Given the way you lost control with rage,

514
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,640
you just don't look like a sovereign.

515
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Aren't you afraid of frightening Ranran?

516
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,920
If I didn't already know the Spirit Spring

517
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,550
had been taken away,

518
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,350
I would've thought you were repeating the same mistake.

519
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
What's going on?

520
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,850
Why can't I suppress this bloodlust?

521
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,160
Only the Demon's child

522
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
can summon it.

523
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,550
And you

524
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,850
are the perfect, one-in-a-million

525
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,000
choice for the Demon's child.

526
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,920
I have put this Spirit Spring

527
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,880
into your heart

528
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,200
and sacrificed your body to the Spirit Spring.

529
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:36,680
I thought

530
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,890
it had all ended 19 years ago.

531
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,550
Could it be that...

532
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
The drop of Spirit Spring hasn't

533
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,200
been removed from my heart?

534
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,760
I got close to the Spirit Spring,

535
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,720
so it was triggered again?

536
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,070
Couldn't find it.

537
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,400
Maybe it has hidden itself?

538
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:25,920
Master,

539
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,000
you've been in seclusion for days.

540
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,680
Did you get injured?

541
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,360
The Ice Lotus Technique can suppress the Spirit Spring.

542
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,200
It's hard to detect it.

543
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,400
Once I find the Spirit Spring,

544
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,480
the drop in my heart, if still there,

545
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,480
will surely respond.

546
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,200
I will finally have an answer.

547
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,830
Master?

548
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,320
Master...

549
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:18,920
Don't move.

550
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,960
You haven't fully recovered. Why are you running around?

551
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,440
A Demon's child will always be a Demon's child.

552
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,750
He truly believes his fate has been changed?

553
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,240
He's getting

554
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,680
closer and closer to the Spirit Spring.

555
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,870
Once he finds the Spirit Spring,

556
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,000
it will repossess his body.

557
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,920
And we

558
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,260
will once again own the Demon's child.

559
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,590
Thank you, guardian.

560
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,790
The guardians have been

561
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,030
healing you for the past few days.

562
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,880
But why hasn't it worked?

563
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,240
With my damaged Spirit Root,

564
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,350
It'll take me some more time to heal completely.

565
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,830
Tu Jiuyuan.

566
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,510
My Lord.

567
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,400
You may leave now.

568
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,000
Yes, My Lord.

569
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,200
Are you dead yet?

570
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,070
My Lord.

571
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,400
How useless you are.

572
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,310
You couldn't even catch

573
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,070
a little girl.

574
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,310
And you got yourself injured like this.

575
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,240
You've truly disgraced the Scarlet Sect.

576
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,080
My bad, My Lord.

577
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:47,890
I've been a bit better

578
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,400
the past few days.

579
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,350
I will capture that girl right away.

580
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,200
Just lie there and recover.

581
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,160
Yes.

582
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,550
My Lord,

583
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,350
I have one more thing to say.

584
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,470
What you seek is the Spirit Spring.

585
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,720
Constantly confronting Su Yishui head-on

586
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,720
is unnecessary.

587
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,320
Why not keep a close watch in secret?

588
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,960
It's not too late to move after we learn

589
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
where the Spirit Spring is.

590
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,200
Tu Jiuyuan,

591
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,680
remember this clearly.

592
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,650
I am the sovereign.

593
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,450
If you dare to cross the line again,

594
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,280
I will show no mercy.

595
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:23,750
Yes, My Lord.

596
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,270
Senior, you like this?

597
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,110
Fine.

598
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,400
I'll be the Scarlet Sovereign

599
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,510
and open Mount Red Flame.

600
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,590
At that time,

601
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,880
I'll make you the Sovereign of Butterfly Valley.

602
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,850
How could I have

603
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,200
such a useless son like you?

604
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,120
You've lost to your Senior ten times in a row!

605
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,680
How can our Scarlet Sect's future

606
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,270
be entrusted to a good-for-nothing like you?

607
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,480
Fortunately,

608
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,640
I still have an excellent disciple like Jiuyuan.

609
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:38,650
Jiuyuan,

610
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,200
come here.

611
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,960
This is half of the Scarlet Sect Token.

612
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,480
From today on,

613
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,550
you are the Token-holding Elder of the Scarlet Sect.

614
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,160
When I'm away,

615
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,110
all sect matters

616
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,880
will be under your management.

617
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,600
-Greetings, Elder Tu!
-Greetings, Elder Tu!

618
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,680
Take it.

619
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,790
I

620
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,790
will not disappoint you, Sovereign.

621
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,400
Remember what I've told you.

622
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,070
Your responsibility

623
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,070
is to become his rival.

624
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,800
You must constantly challenge him,

625
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,640
train him,

626
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,480
to wear away his arrogance and recklessness.

627
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,270
You must always remind him

628
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,640
not to slack off.

629
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,480
Yes, Master.

630
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,510
The Scarlet Sect will eventually be handed over to you guys.

631
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,110
In the future,

632
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,000
with the Scarlet Sect Token,

633
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,480
you must keep a close eye on your junior

634
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,200
and guide him properly.

635
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,830
Sovereign is away.

636
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:47,970
I've already asked

637
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,070
the guards to leave.

638
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,360
Your punishment can end here.

639
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:50,990
Get up now.

640
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,640
How powerful you are, Elder Tu.

641
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,480
You've got wounds all over.

642
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,440
Apply some medicine first.

643
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,510
Stop pretending to care about me!

644
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,240
You want more than just the Scarlet Sect Token,

645
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,680
so you keep going against me

646
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,900
and fighting me for merits.

647
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,000
Just you wait.

648
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,880
You and I are drifting further apart

649
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,160
and can never go back, huh?

650
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,930
Senior Bai seems to have been kneeling all this time.

651
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,460
You want to plead for him?

652
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,350
My pleading wouldn't make a difference.

653
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,920
You've made up your mind.

654
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,600
Besides,

655
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,680
Senior Bai did make a mistake.

656
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,790
You asked us

657
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,720
to copy the Tranquility Spell for detoxification,

658
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,370
yet he slacked off

659
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,550
and let the Scarlet Sect take advantage.

660
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,480
So you don't want to teach him anymore.

661
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,350
I won't put you in a tough spot, Master.

662
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,160
You always see through things better than others.

663
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,810
No punishment for minor evils

664
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,830
will surely beget bigger ones.

665
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,310
The immortal cultivation

666
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,350
already grants people

667
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,910
abilities beyond the norm.

668
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,680
If one grows to be a villain,

669
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,270
wouldn't that cause tremendous harm?

670
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,960
However...

671
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,920
While Senior Bai is certainly at fault,

672
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,550
you're also responsible for it, Master.

673
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,270
How?

674
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,470
We disciples are still young

675
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,400
and without well-developed values.

676
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,680
Good and evil are just a matter of a single thought.

677
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,310
Yet Master,

678
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,990
you're only strict in teaching martial arts,

679
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,210
but you've never

680
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,550
really talked to us about what can be done

681
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,620
and what cannot on the path of cultivation.

682
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,160
So,

683
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,310
I haven't fulfilled my duties as a master?

684
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,030
I wouldn't dare say that.

685
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,960
You have your own reasons for doing anything.

686
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,240
I'm human too.

687
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,960
Why can't I make mistakes?

688
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,030
If one day

689
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,800
you find out that I am

690
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,790
an unforgivable villain,

691
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,200
what would you do?

692
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,680
How could you be that?

693
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,640
Even in that case,

694
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,920
you

695
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,240
must have your reasons,

696
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,400
something you can't avoid.

697
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,680
I'm willing to stay by your side,

698
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,440
sharing weal and woe, facing everything together.

699
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,400
No one wants you to do that for me!

700
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,160
Just take care of yourself.

701
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,000
This is a Qi-Nourishing Pill.

702
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,830
It's good for your recovery.

703
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,070
Just take it.

704
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,350
Help, Master.

705
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,690
The Qi-Nourishing Pill you make

706
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,640
is incredibly bitter.

707
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,920
I need to eat it

708
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,630
with the candied fruits I made myself.

709
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,409
They're in the drawer of that cabinet.

710
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,710
Now you know

711
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,760
to call out for my help?

712
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,670
Is it really that bitter?

713
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,480
Stop it.

714
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,200
Actually, I've noticed you like sweet food

715
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
since long ago,

716
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,670
and I've

717
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,360
corrected it in the "Collection of Entertainment."

718
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,550
In the future,

719
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,750
I will get to know you better

720
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,440
and update the Collection

721
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,500
bit by bit.

722
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:14,800
Master,

723
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,590
actually,

724
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,700
I don't know if you've

725
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,070
already noticed

726
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:20,920
that I...

727
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,650
I have another gift for you.

728
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,000
Okay.

729
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,550
Then I'll accept it.

730
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,590
Get some rest.

731
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,160
Master.

732
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,190
I haven't finished yet.

733
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,590
Master...

734
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,030
I realize my mistake.

735
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,070
Please don't send me away.

736
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,840
While Senior Bai is certainly at fault,

737
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,510
you're also responsible for it, Master.

738
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,480
Is it that

739
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,440
your talent is exceptional,

740
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,550
so you don't want to be bound by any restrictions?

741
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,510
You think you can control everything.

742
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,440
But you don't realize that

743
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,230
arrogance without self-restraint

744
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:19,920
is a real danger.

745
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,720
I realize my mistake, Master.

746
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,510
I will definitely make a change.

747
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
If you truly want to repent,

748
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,840
from today on,

749
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,070
bind one of your arms

750
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,250
and follow Zeng Yi

751
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,230
to learn artifact forging

752
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,320
as well as the way of self-restraint.

753
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,630
When you can assemble

754
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,630
a self-striking clock with one hand,

755
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,970
I will take back my words

756
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,280
and let you return as a Wester.

757
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,280
No

758
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,550
second chance if you can't do it.

759
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,070
I

760
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,190
will definitely nail it.

761
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,190
Stand up.

762
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,190
Thank you, Master.

763
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,760
Master used to be so kind-hearted.

764
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,560
After punishment,

765
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,580
she always forgave her disciples

766
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,440
who made mistakes.

767
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:15,970
But you, Su Yishui,

768
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,840
are never that kind of person.

769
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:17,740
How come?

770
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,670
Of course I'm not.

771
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,150
That's why I disappointed her again and again.

772
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,440
He's just like me back then.

773
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,280
These unruly disciples

774
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,570
made me realize a master's hardships.

775
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,320
Ranran was right.

776
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,920
I wasn't attentive enough when teaching disciples before,

777
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,770
causing myself

778
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,000
some inevitable trouble.

779
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,110
The Mistaken Divine brewed by Ranran.

780
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,580
Liang Wumeng gave this to me.

781
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,000
I think

782
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,880
you've been really stressed out lately

783
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,440
because of Ranran's injury.

784
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,000
Now that Ranran is awake,

785
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,110
you can relax, right?

786
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:54,840
Take it.

787
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,670
You know,

788
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,190
you keep your worries too deep inside.

789
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,550
Don't push yourself too hard.

790
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,400
You should chill occasionally.

791
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,480
Ranran! Ranran!

792
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:13,800
Ranran,

793
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,230
Master showed mercy!

794
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,840
Senior Bai has a chance to return.

795
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,840
This is unprecedented.

796
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,600
That's great!

797
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,390
What method did you use

798
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,480
to make Master change his mind?

799
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,880
I just

800
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,800
said what was on my mind.

801
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,280
What matters is that

802
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,720
Master was willing to take my advice.

803
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,750
You make it sound so easy.

804
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,710
Senior Gao and I also pleaded with Master, but it didn't work.

805
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,360
Seems like Master really

806
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,670
treats you differently.

807
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,950
Differently?

808
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,960
Do you also feel that

809
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,070
Master has...

810
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,000
Well,

811
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,710
Could it be...

812
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,320
Does he have...

813
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,890
Look at your stutter

814
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,800
and the romantic vibe.

815
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,550
I can't take it anymore.

816
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,260
You just want to ask

817
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,230
if Master has feelings for you too, right?

818
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,710
Well,

819
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,800
only Master himself knows the answer.

820
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:13,690
Oh, God.

821
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,840
I can't wait anymore.

822
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,630
I must ask for a clear answer right away.

823
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,670
You're really going to do it?

824
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,590
Have you forgotten what Mr. Zeng said?

825
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,960
Coveting one's own master

826
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,670
will bring about divine retribution.

827
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,510
Well...

828
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,480
So what?

829
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,710
I'm a fruit anyway,

830
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,900
I'm not bound by human rules.

831
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,710
Lightning

832
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,880
probably won't strike me, right?

833
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,480
We'll set off tomorrow.

834
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,150
The Spirit Spring is near.

835
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,710
And now I actually feel timid.

836
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,700
Freshly picked sweet fruit.

837
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,480
From now on,

838
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,110
we'll only taste sweetness, not bitterness.

839
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,000
Qingge,

840
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,220
If I were Grandmaster,

841
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,000
of course I would think Young Master Yu is better

842
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,220
and more likable.

843
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,030
I fear that what I seek in this life

844
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,710
is nothing but an illusion.

845
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,560
So you came after all.

846
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,230
How did you know I was coming, Master?

847
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,760
Have you been

848
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,510
waiting for me all along?

849
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,230
I've waited for you for many years.

850
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:13,620
I got you,

851
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,880
yet it feels like I didn't.

852
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,950
What do you mean, Master?

853
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,510
I'm right here.

854
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,510
Yes,

855
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,360
you are here.

856
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,150
That's good too.

857
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,060
But someday,

858
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,120
you will leave me.

859
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:37,920
No.

860
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,560
I don't want to leave you, Master.

861
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,430
I did think about

862
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,050
finishing my studies and leaving

863
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,440
for the life I wanted.

864
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,060
I wanted

865
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,740
to have a home

866
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,030
and have someone

867
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,480
to keep me company for life.

868
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,920
But after being with you for so long,

869
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,400
with your teachings

870
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,480
and protection,

871
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,920
you've

872
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,070
already been the closest person to me.

873
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,140
And you've also become

874
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,550
the one I want to be with the most.

875
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,070
This is a new branch

876
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,760
from my Reincarnation Tree

877
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,690
that grew as my cultivation improved.

878
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
You once said

879
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,760
this tree's tied to my life.

880
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,510
I've made it into a wooden hairpin

881
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,630
as a gift for you.

882
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,030
This wood is like my heart.

883
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,160
Hope it can always

884
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,960
be with you, Master.

885
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,110
So,

886
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,960
what do you think, Master?

887
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360
I have a gift for you too.

888
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,030
I made this myself.

889
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,400
It's for you.

890
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,510
You used to be into such stuff.

891
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,800
"Used to"?

892
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,800
Master, you...
