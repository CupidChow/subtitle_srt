00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,960
[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,890
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,789
This is for you, Master.

4
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,070
Look at this little angry doll.

5
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,009
Doesn't it look

6
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,039
exactly like you?

7
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,039
Next time you feel like getting mad,

8
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,350
just squeeze it hard.

9
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,759
Childish.

10
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,400
Who would want something like this?

11
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,280
Xue Ranran,

12
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,960
you'd better make me fall for you soon,

13
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,430
or your Golden Core will be in danger.

14
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,530
Just like the fierce beast recorded

15
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,000
in "The Collection of Entertainment."

16
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,230
Master, wait for me!

17
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,630
Hurry up.

18
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,750
Guardian.

19
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,870
Ranran, you're back too.

20
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,000
From now on, the daily meals at Mount Wester

21
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,430
will be handled by Xue Ranran.

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,360
That's wonderful!

23
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,560
Guardian, I knew

24
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,630
you care for Ranran the most.

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,280
Guardian,

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,280
those new disciples

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,030
you asked us to recruit

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,150
have completed their aptitude tests.

29
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,910
New disciples?

30
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,960
Master,

31
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,750
since you're willing to take on disciples now,

32
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,770
why not call back Xi'er

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,590
and the others?

34
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
They've been waiting at the foot of the mountain

35
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,870
for your instructions.

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,750
They're so foolish.

37
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,960
What use do I have for them?

38
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,560
I only want disciples

39
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,870
with exceptional talents and Spiritual Roots.

40
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,150
Well,

41
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,710
with more disciples at Mount Wester,

42
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,930
there will surely be

43
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,360
more trivial matters to handle.

44
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,590
Mount Wester is so vast.

45
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,160
Mr. Yu Chen and Ms. Yu Tong

46
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,240
can't handle everything on their own.

47
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,510
Xi'er and the others know Mount Wester well.

48
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,030
They can be of great help.

49
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,000
If you don't say anything,

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,240
I'll take it as a yes.

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,360
Thank you, Master!

52
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,680
Who are you?

53
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,030
How dare you trespass into Celestial Sect!

54
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
So you're the immortal masters

55
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,700
from Eternal Sect and Hollow Sect.

56
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,590
What brings you to Mount Scarlet

57
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,240
at this late hour?

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,410
Where's Wei Jiu?

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,680
Get him out!

60
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,190
His Lordship is in seclusion.

61
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,710
If you have anything to say,

62
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,190
you can say it to me.

63
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,470
Many demonic beasts

64
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,470
have been devilized lately.

65
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,400
Is that the doing of you demons?

66
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,000
Devilized demonic beasts?

67
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,089
We don't have time to waste

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,310
on something so pointless.

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,510
Now that Celestial Sect has been rebuilt,

70
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,630
demons have an endless source of power,

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,000
and many lost demonic techniques have resurfaced.

72
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,280
Why would we devilize

73
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,160
demonic beasts?

74
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't care how the so-called righteous sects

75
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,980
view us,

76
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,240
but demonic cultivators

77
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,600
and the Heavenly Ones

78
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,680
have just chosen

79
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,000
different cultivation methods.

80
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,840
We exist in the same world.

81
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,270
What reason do demons have

82
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,870
to cause chaos or destroy it?

83
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,480
Fine.

84
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,310
I'll believe you for now.

85
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,040
However, this wave of devilization

86
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,750
is no small matter.

87
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,830
You demons

88
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
have always known more

89
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,750
about devilized things.

90
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,720
If you truly have nothing to do with

91
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,720
the devilization,

92
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,040
do you have any way

93
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,580
to help us investigate?

94
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:03,950
Alright.

95
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
I'll send word

96
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,040
for all our demons

97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,510
to stay vigilant against the devilization.

98
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,040
If we uncover anything,

99
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,630
you'll be informed immediately.

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,720
Then consider this a temporary alliance

101
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,240
between us.

102
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,920
Greetings, My Lord.

103
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,560
My Lord.

104
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,510
Elder Tu,

105
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,310
how dare you make an agreement

106
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,240
with the Heavenly Ones

107
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,510
while I was in seclusion?

108
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,600
Since when do I

109
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,190
need to answer to those Heavenly Ones?

110
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,310
This is outrageous!

111
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,880
My apologies.

112
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,430
I overstepped

113
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,190
and acted on my own.

114
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,310
I'm willing to accept punishment.

115
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,270
Expel me from Celestial Sect.

116
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,360
You only need

117
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,750
to announce to the Heavenly Sects

118
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,760
that Celestial Sect has no one named Tu Jiuyuan,

119
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,310
and the agreement I made

120
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,040
will naturally be void.

121
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,680
You...

122
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:11,950
Everyone, leave us.

123
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,820
Yes!

124
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,390
Tu Jiuyuan,

125
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,830
what's wrong with you?

126
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,120
I merely scolded you a bit,

127
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,680
and you want to leave?

128
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,210
Actually…

129
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,159
Actually, it's not that serious.

130
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,600
I am

131
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,870
a magnanimous person.

132
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,000
Considering

133
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,750
your years of loyalty,

134
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,720
I'll let this slide.

135
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,390
You should be thanking me now.

136
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,190
I once promised the former sovereign

137
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,390
to assist you.

138
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,650
Now that you've rebuilt Celestial Sect

139
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,600
and got what you wanted,

140
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,690
my promise has been fulfilled.

141
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,510
I just want freedom now.

142
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,120
I want to leave this place that has caged me for half my life

143
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,310
and live freely as I please.

144
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,450
Stop!

145
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,240
Why hasn't

146
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,360
your wound healed?

147
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,390
It's just a minor injury.

148
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,360
Don't worry about it.

149
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,159
Your wound hasn't even healed.

150
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,190
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,310
You...

152
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,390
Don't tell me

153
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,400
you're leaving because you loved me

154
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,310
but couldn't have me

155
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,040
and your love has turned into hate.

156
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,220
Actually,

157
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,750
that day in the netherworld…

158
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,240
If I told her

159
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,690
that I went back to find her,

160
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,040
I'd be so embarrassed.

161
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,310
Never mind.

162
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:20,750
You...

163
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,430
Look at you, so badly injured.

164
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,510
After all these years,

165
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,830
you're still so weak.

166
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,220
I…

167
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,360
I'll allow you

168
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,970
to cultivate with me

169
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,750
and share my spiritual power.

170
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Happy now?

171
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,600
My Lord, you misunderstand.

172
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,750
I've long let go of love,

173
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,360
and there's no hate to hold onto either.

174
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,960
I just want to live

175
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,120
a different life.

176
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,270
My Lord,

177
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,320
take care of yourself.

178
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,120
Stop!

179
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,120
Who said

180
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
your promise to that old man

181
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,030
has been fulfilled?

182
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,360
My true goal

183
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,120
is to bring back the golden age of demonic cultivation.

184
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,240
Rebuilding Celestial Sect

185
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,630
was only the beginning.

186
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,200
If you want to leave,

187
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,530
you have to help me

188
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,910
break the Five Deadly Formations

189
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,320
at the peak of Mount Scarlet

190
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,570
so I can

191
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,100
reach its dark side

192
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,510
and obtain the legendary Gold Refining Fire.

193
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,910
Gold Refining Fire?

194
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,080
Yes.

195
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,790
Demonic creatures all fear it.

196
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,240
If I can get it,

197
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,590
I'll be able to control

198
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,630
and command those devilized beasts,

199
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,200
bending them

200
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,390
to my will.

201
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,000
By then,

202
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,720
all Heavenly Sects

203
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,510
will have to kneel before me,

204
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,740
and Celestial Sect

205
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,240
will rise above them all.

206
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,960
Only then

207
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,910
will your promise

208
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,030
be truly fulfilled.

209
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,000
Then I'll let you go.

210
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,480
But

211
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,230
if you fail to break the Five Deadly Formations

212
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,890
and get the Gold Refining Fire,

213
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,560
you'll have to stay here.

214
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,080
Ranran.

215
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,550
Ms. Yu Tong.

216
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,720
How are Xi'er and the others

217
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,550
settling in?

218
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,970
Earlier, they went

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,840
to pay their respects to Master.

220
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,000
But Master found it troublesome

221
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,510
and just responded from inside the room

222
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,750
without letting them in.

223
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,600
They're now

224
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,720
tidying up their rooms.

225
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,500
Good.

226
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,290
[Su Yishui's disciple, Shen Kuo]

227
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,290
[Su Yishui's disciple, Yue Sheng]

228
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,030
That's Xue Ranran.

229
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,360
She came first in the Marrow-Cleansing Pool

230
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,320
and gained its spiritual power.

231
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,630
Today, I'll cook

232
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,440
a good meal for everyone

233
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,390
to celebrate.

234
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:58,870
I'll be going now.

235
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,720
Usually, by this time,

236
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,510
she has already brought me tea and snacks.

237
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
What's going on today?

238
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,240
Xue Ranran.

239
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,910
Xue Ranran!

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,240
Still nowhere to be seen.

241
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,840
How could any girl

242
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
be as irresistible as she is?

243
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,600
One step forward, two steps back,

244
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,550
never truly making progress!

245
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,120
Hello, Ms. Xue.

246
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,710
I'm a new disciple, Yue Sheng.

247
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,910
I look forward to learning from you.

248
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,590
Yue Sheng, nice to meet you.

249
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:49,870
I can wash the vegetables

250
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,840
for you, Ms. Xue.

251
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,930
No need for that.

252
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,880
It's fine. I enjoy washing vegetables.

253
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,480
Ms. Xue,

254
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,270
just leave this kind of work to him.

255
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,030
Alright.

256
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,910
Thank you.

257
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,320
Okay.

258
00:11:59,510 --> 00:11:59,960
Ms. Xue,

259
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,000
let me help with something else.

260
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:01,910
No need.

261
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,670
Ms. Xue,

262
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,200
my name is Shen Kuo.

263
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,580
From now on, I'll handle

264
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,480
all the cutting.

265
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,270
Thank you then.

266
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,200
It's nothing.

267
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,870
Ms. Xue, let me help you.

268
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,510
You're quite skilled, aren't you?

269
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:26,830
I learned this

270
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,630
somewhere else

271
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,890
before coming here.

272
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,510
Honestly, I joined Wester Sect

273
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,240
because I admire you, Ms. Xue.

274
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,720
Ignore him, Ms. Xue.

275
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,600
The vegetables are washed.

276
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,730
I heard your alchemy skills are incredible.

277
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,510
Could I learn from you sometime?

278
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,240
Sure.

279
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,240
I'll teach you another day.

280
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,080
It's a deal!

281
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,840
I want to learn too.

282
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,480
Ms. Xue.

283
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,400
You can't learn!

284
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:45,910
Master.

285
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,910
-Master.
-Master.

286
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,440
Master.

287
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,910
Master.

288
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,240
So lively here, huh?

289
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,200
Since you have so much free time

290
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,130
to chat and joke around,

291
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,810
then go to Westerly Valley

292
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,790
and hold a handstand for 20 hours!

293
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,240
Yes.

294
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Yes, Master.

295
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,440
Wait.

296
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,940
From now on, none of you are allowed

297
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,850
to go near the kitchen again.

298
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
-Yes.
-Yes.

299
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,150
Master.

300
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,000
Master.

301
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,470
I brought you lunch.

302
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,150
Master?

303
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,840
Master.

304
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,550
After teaching your junior brothers alchemy

305
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,200
and having fun with them,

306
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,440
you finally remembered your master?

307
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,610
Master,

308
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,720
you're not jealous, are you?

309
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,870
Jealous?

310
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm only cooperating with you

311
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,030
to break the Soul-Cleansing Charm.

312
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,270
Why would I be jealous?

313
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,480
Then what is this about?

314
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,320
I just didn't expect

315
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,080
Mu Qingge's foolish younger sister

316
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,510
to be just like her,

317
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,150
flirting with everyone

318
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,790
and being so fickle.

319
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,390
I'm foolish?

320
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,270
And I, Mu Qingge, am fickle?

321
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,750
You insulted me twice

322
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,000
in just one sentence.

323
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,360
Yeah,

324
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,440
you're right.

325
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,630
I do like

326
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,240
handsome, debonair men.

327
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,750
However,

328
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:36,840
I already

329
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,030
have someone I love.

330
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,840
And I love him wholeheartedly

331
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,100
because no one is more handsome

332
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,550
or more worthy of love than him.

333
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,000
Xue Ranran,

334
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,720
don't just talk the talk.

335
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,200
With your little tricks,

336
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,630
how long will you need to pursue me?

337
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,790
When will you finally break the spell?

338
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,890
Since you put it that way,

339
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,270
I guess I'll have to

340
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,320
take it a step further.

341
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,630
Do you think I'll be afraid?

342
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,460
♫After parting, the black silk-like hair turned snow-white♫

343
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:20,280
♫In secret, I have so much to say to you♫

344
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,100
♫Only after I met you♫

345
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,390
You just asked

346
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,150
if I was jealous.

347
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:33,230
♫Did I realize there are heaven-like places all because of you♫

348
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,000
I thought I needed to test that.

349
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,550
So what's your conclusion?

350
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,520
♫Maybe a lifetime is too short, too fleeting♫

351
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,780
♫So we were granted a second chance♫

352
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,500
♫With endless time to write our story♫

353
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,870
♫We fulfill the vow forged through many lifetimes♫

354
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:59,520
♫From now onwards♫

355
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,630
Wait.

356
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,360
Why are you not shy at all

357
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
after kissing me?

358
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,390
Have you kissed someone

359
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,150
like this before?

360
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,030
Yeah,

361
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,120
I once kissed a pig.

362
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,360
A pig indeed.

363
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:17,960
This is outrageous!

364
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,120
I haven't gotten mad yet,

365
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,320
and she's acting all hurt!

366
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,040
Good thing I brought her back.

367
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,670
If I had left her out there,

368
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,910
she'd end up breaking the hearts

369
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,960
of many naive young men!

370
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,950
Kissed a pig...

371
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,720
Hold on.

372
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,150
A pig?

373
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,080
Could it be...

374
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,840
Elder Tu,

375
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,240
you've tried a lot of times.

376
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,080
You need to stop.

377
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,340
Elder Tu.

378
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,390
Greetings, My Lord.

379
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,160
You underestimate the Five Deadly Formations.

380
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,109
With your weak cultivation,

381
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,510
you can't even break through

382
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,000
the outermost barrier,

383
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,589
let alone get in to break them.

384
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,550
Stop wasting your energy.

385
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,310
Go back.

386
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,589
I can't break them now,

387
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,480
but since I made a promise to you,

388
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,790
I'll find a way to break them.

389
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,400
When I do,

390
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,720
I hope you can keep your word.

391
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,200
Fortunately, Tu Jiuyuan

392
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,780
can't get past the barrier.

393
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,310
If she actually managed to enter the formations,

394
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,790
it would be extremely dangerous.

395
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,920
I've tried so many times

396
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,750
but still can't break the formations inside.

397
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,880
I really need to think of

398
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,920
another way.

399
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,590
He kissed me first,

400
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,680
yet he's making me copy the disciples' rules.

401
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
He's just being stubborn.

402
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,790
Again?

403
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,320
The cultivation method Uncle Ye Xin taught me

404
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,270
is already showing results.

405
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,920
Let me see

406
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,550
if I can use this formation

407
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,550
to activate the Soul-Devouring Lock again

408
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,960
and take back Xue Ranran's

409
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,790
spiritual power.

410
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,480
Drawing power from me when I have none left?

411
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,680
This could kill me!

412
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,830
I need stronger people!

413
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:56,610
Yes.

414
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,400
Fortunately, I took the Spirit-Nourishing Pill in advance.

415
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,030
Ranran.

416
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,400
What's wrong?

417
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,350
Why do you look so pale?

418
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,960
Did Guardian…

419
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,480
That's from Master?

420
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,000
He ordered these dishes?

421
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,560
He said

422
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,270
you have to make and bring them to him yourself

423
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,160
to show you really regret your mistake.

424
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,590
Being stubborn again.

425
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,160
If he wants to see me,

426
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,810
why can't he come himself?

427
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,110
Ms. Yu Tong,

428
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,350
please tell him

429
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,840
my hands are sore

430
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,140
from copying the rules and I can't cook.

431
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,510
He'll have to make do with what's available.

432
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,880
As for me,

433
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,550
I regret nothing,

434
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,310
so I won't go and annoy him.

435
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,940
Exactly. Don't always indulge him.

436
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, Ms. Yu Tong,

437
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,000
there's something

438
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,310
I'd like Mr. Yu Chen

439
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,480
to investigate in the capital for me.

440
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:04,960
Guardian has already sent

441
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,940
Yu Chen to the capital.

442
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,520
I don't know

443
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,200
if it's for the same thing

444
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,110
you want to look into.

445
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,440
Master is also looking for Ye Xin.

446
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,030
Since that's the case,

447
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,920
if Mr. Yu Chen finds anything,

448
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,240
please let me know as well.

449
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,960
She said that?

450
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,240
Ranran looked very pale.

451
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
She didn't even eat dinner.

452
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,040
She rushed back with you

453
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,470
without proper rest.

454
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,480
Before that,

455
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,160
she had been physically and mentally drained.

456
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,970
No matter how good others are,

457
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,440
they can't compare to you.

458
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,240
You're elegant and otherworldly,

459
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,240
like fine jade.

460
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,590
Just like these Ice Lotuses.

461
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,180
They may seem cold at first glance,

462
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,190
but upon closer inspection,

463
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,450
they're refreshing to the heart and mind.

464
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,110
They actually make one feel warm and close.

465
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,680
Master,

466
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,070
it's you.

467
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,030
Who else did you think it would be?

468
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,640
This spirit pool

469
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,590
is on my way

470
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,070
from the study to my residence.

471
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:24,960
Are you perhaps

472
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,070
deliberately staying here

473
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,030
to awake my memories?

474
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,930
Your flirting tricks

475
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,270
seem a bit dull.

476
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,200
What are you expecting?

477
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,000
I just missed you.

478
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,920
Besides, have you forgotten?

479
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,070
Back then,

480
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,720
you taught me cultivation techniques here

481
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,750
in this spirit pool.

482
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,680
I was just using

483
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,070
the technique you taught me to replenish my energy.

484
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,170
Why is your pulse so unstable?

485
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,310
Did your energy go off track during cultivation?

486
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,270
You've been suffering

487
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,080
from the Soul-Devouring Lock all this time.

488
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,310
Why didn't you tell me?

489
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,000
Are you worried about me?

490
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,680
I'm just

491
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,060
worried about my Golden Core

492
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,880
and want to regain my memories as soon as possible.

493
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,520
Since your usual flirting tricks

494
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,720
aren't working,

495
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,170
perhaps you could try

496
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,070
going a bit deeper.

497
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,510
How

498
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,960
do I do that?

499
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,640
I mean,

500
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,160
you could try being a little more affectionate

501
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,750
or lean on me more.

502
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,550
What were you thinking?

503
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,200
You used to do the same,

504
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,310
telling me to ask you for help more.

505
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,930
Immortal Master Xue,

506
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,510
you're here.

507
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,970
I've prepared breakfast for you.

508
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,680
Here.

509
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,170
Why is there

510
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,310
a special serving for me?

511
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Guardian ordered it.

512
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,200
He said he'll be in seclusion

513
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,260
for the next few days,

514
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,030
so you don't need to prepare meals for him.

515
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,420
Seclusion?

516
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,500
But he...

517
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,310
It's not true.

518
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,280
That's just an excuse.

519
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,640
Guardian may not say it outright,

520
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,590
but I can tell

521
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,200
he's just worried you'll overwork yourself.

522
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,400
He even placed a barrier

523
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,200
around the spirit pool.

524
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,270
Except for you,

525
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,640
no one can approach it.

526
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,930
He wants you to go there

527
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,790
every day at noon to replenish your energy.

528
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,000
Junior Brother,

529
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,790
mind moving over a bit

530
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,550
so we can sit and eat?

531
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,550
There's no space left.

532
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,750
Why squeeze in?

533
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,830
Go eat somewhere else.

534
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:16,830
Junior Brother,

535
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,250
this table

536
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,160
was ours to begin with.

537
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,350
Is your name

538
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,920
carved on the table?

539
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,440
Did any of you see a name here?

540
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,640
Nope.

541
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,590
Nope.

542
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,830
Me neither.

543
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,400
However, Senior Sister,

544
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,680
if you want to squeeze in,

545
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,590
we wouldn't mind.

546
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,680
Forget it. Ignore him!

547
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,700
How dare you hit me?

548
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,130
Show some respect.

549
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,510
-Let go of me!
-Let go!

550
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,070
Let go!

551
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,480
Let go of me.

552
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,790
Break the spell, you little brat.

553
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,290
Who are you calling a brat?

554
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,450
In Mount Wester,

555
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,830
you're not qualified to call anyone a brat.

556
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,550
You...

557
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,310
Wester Sect's rules have never allowed

558
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,590
junior disciples

559
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,800
to bully their seniors

560
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,270
just because they're more powerful.

561
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,480
A bit of pushing and shoving is one thing,

562
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,440
but using spiritual power to attack someone is another.

563
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,150
Did you intend to kill Senior Bai?

564
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,000
If you continue like this,

565
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,590
when you grow stronger,

566
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,400
won't you end up disrespecting your master?

567
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,880
If I've done wrong,

568
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,030
Master will discipline me.

569
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Who are you to lecture me?

570
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,400
Break the spell!

571
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,440
I'm just someone stronger than you.

572
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,480
You got that line from her, didn't you?

573
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,960
What?

574
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,110
Not convinced?

575
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,640
But it's true that I'm stronger than you.

576
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,160
Master.

577
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:54,960
Master.

578
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:55,860
What line?

579
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,030
What do you mean?

580
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,600
You made a racket in the dining room.

581
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,000
No one is allowed to eat.

582
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,920
Carry 100 loads of water up the mountain before you can rest.

583
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,440
Yes, Master.

584
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,750
Wait.

585
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,270
Did you guys

586
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,100
not hear what I just said?

587
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,590
Master, you're punishing everyone

588
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,480
without even asking what happened.

589
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,830
I didn't do anything wrong.

590
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,510
Neither did my seniors.

591
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,820
Why should we be punished?

592
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,000
You did nothing wrong?

593
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,270
Then whose fault is it?

594
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,590
Discord among disciples,

595
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,790
disrespect toward seniors,

596
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,070
and fighting within the sect.

597
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,000
Clearly, it's your fault as our master.

598
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,160
Say that again!

599
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,280
Master, fate led you to take them

600
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,550
as your disciples back then.

601
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,030
You once taught them with dedication,

602
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,030
tailoring your guidance to their talents.

603
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,160
Even if you've forgotten the past,

604
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,310
they are still your disciples.

605
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,160
Did I not let them

606
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,000
stay in Mount Wester?

607
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,960
Xue Ranran,

608
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,080
don't think

609
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:02,830
just because I allow you

610
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,760
to help me recover my memories,

611
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,880
you can be disrespectful to me.

612
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,200
You see it as a mere task,

613
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,350
but I'm speaking from the heart.

614
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,530
You treat them as strangers,

615
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,590
but they're the very disciples

616
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,720
you once personally chose.

617
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,460
Your disregard for them

618
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,300
allowed the new disciples

619
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,300
to treat them

620
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,830
with such disrespect.

621
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,970
You forgot how they once

622
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,210
respected you

623
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,030
and remained loyal to the sect.

624
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,030
You forgot

625
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,270
how they risked their lives with you,

626
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,400
fighting demons without ever backing down.

627
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,650
Even when

628
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,160
the Heavenly Ones turned against you,

629
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,090
they never walked out on you.

630
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,880
Those things you've forgotten

631
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,180
truly happened.

632
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,720
This bond we shared

633
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,200
cannot be erased!

634
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,920
It was me

635
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,640
who made a fuss

636
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,550
and talked back to you today.

637
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,200
I'll take the punishment alone.

638
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,830
I'll carry

639
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,440
all 400 loads of water myself.

640
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,420
Oh, no.

641
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,110
I didn't bring the Spirit-Nourishing Pill.

642
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,070
-Ranran!
-Ranran!

643
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,060
The Soul-Devouring Lock.

644
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,440
Master.

645
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,130
Last time, you used a spirit talisman

646
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,350
to draw power from me.

647
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,110
But what happened this time?

648
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,240
Even if you have my Golden Core,

649
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,000
without me activating my power,

650
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,830
there's no way you can continuously

651
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,920
draw power from me.

652
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,790
It worked.

653
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,600
I can draw power from you now.

654
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:20,880
In that case,

655
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,240
from now on, wherever we go,

656
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,720
you need to stay close to me.

657
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,240
You can use my power whenever you need it.

658
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,390
In the past,

659
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,750
you often transferred spiritual power to me

660
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,880
when I was exhausted from cultivation

661
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,160
and when I was injured.

662
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,830
Later, you

663
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,880
directly connected your spiritual power with mine,

664
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,270
allowing me to draw your power at any time.

665
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,270
I wasn't drawing from you by force.

666
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,200
It's just a habit.

667
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,880
I must have lost my mind

668
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,680
to willingly offer you the spiritual power I got

669
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,790
through painstaking cultivation.

670
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,640
No wonder after 18 years of seclusion,

671
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,680
I barely made any progress.

672
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,690
What kind of spell

673
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,590
did you put on me?

674
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,350
Master, you taught me everything I know.

675
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,980
If I had put a spell on you,

676
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,380
you'd have noticed it.

677
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,350
You truly

678
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,480
loved and cared for me.

679
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,070
You were genuinely nice to me.

680
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,590
Sorry, Master.

681
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,830
I shouldn't have talked back to you in front of everyone.

682
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,520
I should have spoken to you properly.

683
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,480
In fact, you haven't changed at all.

684
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,830
You're still soft-hearted.

685
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,250
You'd still help me out

686
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,640
when I was in danger.

687
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,640
How surprising.

688
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,750
You actually apologized.

689
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,110
You do know

690
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,590
how to be seductive.

691
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,240
The Soul-Devouring Lock is a real pain.

692
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,160
Before I figure out a way

693
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,350
to get rid of it completely,

694
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,480
come here every day at dusk.

695
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,670
I'll help you replenish your energy.

696
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,550
As for your punishment today...

697
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,510
I'll go carry the water right away.

698
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,270
Forget it.

699
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,990
If you exhaust yourself,

700
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,160
it'll be my power that's wasted.

701
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,160
That's no different from punishing myself.

702
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,750
Instead of wasting time on that,

703
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,350
you might as well spend some time reading ancient books

704
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,890
and find out

705
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,550
what Dun Tian intended to do

706
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,350
with that heaven-defying spell.

707
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,830
You're not punishing me anymore?

708
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,570
You're right.

709
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,050
Thank you for your concern and kindness.

710
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,750
You're the best, Master.

711
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,090
[Auspicious and peaceful]

712
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,160
Master is not good with words,

713
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,480
but he's kind-hearted.

714
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,480
He often gives pills to the people at the foot of the mountain.

715
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,830
Me?

716
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,480
Kind-hearted?

717
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,680
Master excels at everything,

718
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,030
except cooking.

719
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,550
But the mooncakes he baked for me

720
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,790
were the best.

721
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,720
I baked mooncakes for her? Shouldn't it have been

722
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,680
the other way around?

723
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,900
When Master gets shy,

724
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,680
he turns his face away and ignores me.

725
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,350
If I tease him with jokes,

726
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,680
he won't look amused,

727
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,920
but his eyes turn warmer than usual.

728
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,350
Nonsense.

729
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,440
Salted dried longans

730
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,000
still aren't to Master's liking,

731
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,750
but he doesn't dislike them either.

732
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,270
He once said,

733
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,550
"The past is the past.

734
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,000
It's nothing

735
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,880
more than memories."

736
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,310
He also said,

737
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,640
"Demonic magic is neither good nor evil.

738
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,240
A technique is just a technique.

739
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,790
Whether one is a demon or an immortal

740
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,200
is determined by the heart."

741
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,550
Whether one is a demon or an immortal

742
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,400
is determined by the heart.

743
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,640
Whether one is a demon or an immortal

744
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,550
is determined by the heart.

745
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,310
Those things you've forgotten

746
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,170
truly happened.

747
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,110
In fact, you haven't changed at all.

748
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,480
The lost memories

749
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,790
might return soon.

750
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,230
Master.

751
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,960
I punished you all yesterday,

752
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,840
and you all think it was unfair.

753
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,880
Then today, you'll each pick someone

754
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,590
for a test.

755
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,760
I'll test your entry-level skill—

756
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,630
the Lightness Skill.

757
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,190
You need to stand on the grass

758
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,690
without using spiritual power.

759
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:38,800
Whoever loses

760
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,920
will have to copy the sect rules 100 times.

761
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,590
That's easy.

762
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,960
Master is clearly on our side.

763
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,190
Yue Sheng, you go.

764
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,510
Make them lose completely.

765
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,280
This is the Flame Lava

766
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,480
from Westerly Valley.

767
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,840
With your current abilities,

768
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,670
if you fall in, your body will instantly melt.

769
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,590
But don't worry.

770
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,400
Before your skin is all burned,

771
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,880
I'll fish you out.

772
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,000
You won't die.

773
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,880
Do you still have the guts to try?

774
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,640
I'm willing to try, Master.

775
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,360
I admit defeat.

776
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,840
I'm willing to accept punishment.

777
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,440
-Senior Gao!
-Gao Cang!

778
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,760
He's fine.

779
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,360
Why…

780
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,190
Why isn't the lava hot?

781
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,510
It's not touching me either.

782
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,670
I felt a familiar chill

783
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,550
just now.

784
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,000
Obviously, Master mixed

785
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,590
the extreme yin water from the spirit pool

786
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,240
with the lava in the cauldron.

787
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,320
The two neutralized each other, so it's not hot.

788
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,320
And you won't get any of it on you.

789
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,640
I knew Master wouldn't

790
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,990
be so cruel.

791
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,760
But Gao Cang didn't know.

792
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,880
He just followed Master's order

793
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,400
loyally.

794
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,550
Master,

795
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,400
you're testing

796
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,550
if what I said yesterday is true.

797
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,410
Some of you

798
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,230
have always doubted

799
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,190
whether Gao Cang

800
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,360
is worthy of being your senior brother.

801
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,470
He's so loyal to me.

802
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,760
That alone

803
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,880
surpasses any level of cultivation.

804
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,890
And there's your eldest senior brother,

805
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,550
Bai Baishan.

806
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,960
Tell us, why do you never

807
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,440
use your left hand,

808
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,960
even though it clearly works?

809
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,190
It's by Master's order.

810
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,360
You gave me a chance

811
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,350
to repent

812
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,960
and return to Mount Wester.

813
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,590
I must strictly follow your command

814
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,880
and never disobey you.

815
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,770
Compared to them,

816
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,690
you all still have a long way to go.

817
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,030
Master has even

818
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,130
looked into these matters.

819
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,760
He's willing

820
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,360
to try believing what I said after all.

821
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,200
Master,

822
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,600
I found a few ancient books

823
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,140
about heaven-defying techniques.

824
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:25,890
I also made

825
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,080
your favorite osmanthus cakes.

826
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,590
Master was reading "The Collection of Entertainment."

827
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,670
I wonder if he was mad

828
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,840
when he saw he was described

829
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,110
as a fierce beast.

830
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,460
[Roster of new recruited Westers]

831
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,920
The new disciples Master has taken in

832
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,010
are all the children of influential court officials

833
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,450
and regional commanders.

834
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,070
This can't be a coincidence.

835
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:13,900
[I'm Yue Zhiqiu. I hope this letter finds you well.]

836
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:13,900
[I once served under you and still owe you a debt of gratitude. Since you're planning something big, I'm ready to follow your orders at any time.]

837
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:13,900
[To Mr. Su]

838
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,360
Put it down.

839
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,010
These days,

840
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,960
you've been reassembling your old allies

841
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,110
and using discipleship to draw in

842
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,480
court officials and regional forces.

843
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,960
You're trying to finish what you couldn't

844
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,550
and wage war for the throne again?

845
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,090
So what if I am?

846
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,960
Have you considered the consequences?

847
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,920
Of course, I seek what I desire.

848
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,190
Xue Ranran,

849
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,030
don't think

850
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,150
you can meddle in this.

851
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,510
We've been to the border towns

852
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,070
and seen how people live there

853
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,960
after a war.

854
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,670
You said yourself

855
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,760
that peace is precious.

856
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,480
Right now, the Great Qi

857
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,630
faces threats from Gaokan at the borders,

858
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,370
while within, feudal lords and kings of foreign lineage

859
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,250
are assembling their own troops.

860
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,190
The imperial court is barely keeping the balance

861
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,880
to let the people live in peace.

862
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,710
Once the balance is broken,

863
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,420
different forces will get involved

864
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,140
in the fight for the throne.

865
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,920
Are you sure such a rushed uprising

866
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,800
can guarantee victory?

867
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,840
It'll only lead to endless wars

868
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,840
and a country torn apart.

869
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,360
Do you think I care about any of that?

870
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,960
You don't get to tell me what to do!

871
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,230
But Master, you once

872
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,510
risked your life for the peace of the world.

873
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,080
How could you not care?

874
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,550
Enough.

875
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,770
You think I'd believe I did those absurd things

876
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,880
just because you said so?

877
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,670
I, Su Yishui,

878
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,590
have only ever pursued absolute power over this universe.

879
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,440
But the truth is,

880
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,510
all these years,

881
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,750
you haven't tried to seize the throne.

882
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,250
You just sealed the Spirit Spring

883
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,240
in the netherworld.

884
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,440
I don't want you to let your youthful impulse

885
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,550
cloud your judgment and make a decision

886
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,550
you'll regret

887
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,000
because you forgot the path you once walked.

888
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,710
Guardian.

889
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,180
Guardian, bad news.

890
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:11,880
Ranran…

891
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,880
She's surrounded at the foot of the mountain.

892
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,260
What a troublemaker.

893
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,630
I want one too! I want one too!

894
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,150
There's enough for everyone.

895
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,330
I want Sovereign Su!

896
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,320
I want Sovereign Su!

897
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,670
I want Sovereign Su!

898
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,960
There's enough for everyone.

899
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,190
Alright.

900
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:30,630
Thank you, miss.

901
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,190
You're welcome.

902
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,930
Let's go and play!

903
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,800
Master.

904
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,710
You bribed Yu Tong

905
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,510
to trick me down the mountain

906
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,840
just to watch this nonsense?

907
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,290
Master, don't be angry.

908
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,320
It's all my fault.

909
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,820
It's just that today

910
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,330
is the Festival of Reverence

911
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,820
in the towns near Mount Wester.

912
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,810
So I wanted you

913
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,800
to see it.

914
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,030
What does that have to do with me?

915
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,950
Because this festival

916
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,540
is held in your honor, Master.

917
00:40:59,320 --> 00:40:59,840
Me?

918
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,310
19 years ago,

919
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,840
war reached Mount Wester,

920
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,920
bringing plague and demons.

921
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,640
Before entering seclusion,

922
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,550
you treated the sick

923
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,320
and saved the people here.

924
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,230
Out of gratitude and respect,

925
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,250
they started

926
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,670
the annual Festival of Reverence.

927
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,550
Master, look.

928
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,140
To them,

929
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,150
the immortals up above are distant and untouchable.

930
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,670
The person in the mountain

931
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,070
who sees them through hardships

932
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,510
and keeps them safe

933
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,060
is the one they truly revere.

934
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,550
Immortal Master Su,

935
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,800
Miss Ranran.

936
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,670
Since you're here,

937
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,590
come in

938
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,230
for some wontons.

939
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,600
Alright, Mr. Xu.

940
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,100
Thank you.

941
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,190
Let's go.

942
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,300
Come.

943
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,440
Here, same as always.

944
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:50,640
The condiments are here.

945
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,550
Here, Mr. Xu.

946
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,360
You're always so polite.

947
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,720
Immortal Master Su saved my life.

948
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,100
How could I charge him?

949
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,920
Back then, Mr. Xu suffered greatly from the plague.

950
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,450
You saved him,

951
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,800
giving him a second chance at life.

952
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,150
That's why he's so grateful.

953
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,630
When Westers eat here,

954
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,220
he never charges them anything.

955
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,230
Is it delicious?

956
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,670
Master, you once promised

957
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,440
to travel and try everything delicious with me.

958
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,110
But if war breaks out,

959
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,400
none of this will exist anymore.

960
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,480
Immortal Master Su,

961
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,840
Grandmother asked me to thank you.

962
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,710
Thank you.
