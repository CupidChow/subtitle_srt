00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,000
Tell me!

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,280
What's your name?

7
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,000
Who ordered you to come to

8
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,470
Mount Eternal in disguise?

9
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,750
Tell me!

10
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,420
Tell me!

11
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,220
Tell me!

12
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,710
Take him to the Exorcising Tower tomorrow.

13
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,120
Let the sovereign interrogate him!

14
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,910
Yes!

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,190
You're so tough.

16
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,030
I really wonder who you are.

Brother!

20
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,000
Alright, stop crying.

21
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,740
Thank you, Master Mu,

22
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,730
for stepping in

23
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,910
and saving my son's life.

24
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,040
You've done us a great favor.

25
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,210
I truly don't know how to repay such kindness.

26
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,870
I just returned Yu's favor.

27
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,079
It's no big deal.

28
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,470
Miss,

29
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,690
you're so good.

30
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,840
Brother,

31
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,680
you should marry

32
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,750
Miss Mu soon.

33
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,960
Master Mu, please forgive him.

34
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,220
My son's just a little boy.

35
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,630
He spoke out of turn.

36
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,520
He's just a kid.

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,960
Maids.

38
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,690
Take them both

39
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,910
inside to rest.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,030
Have a good rest.

43
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,240
to thank you.

44
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,520
Why are you leaving so soon?

45
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,650
I need to take someone important

46
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,520
as my disciple.

47
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,520
But…

48
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,600
If something comes up,

49
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,480
just go to Mount Wester to find me.

50
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,600
Qingge.

51
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,310
I want to stay in the Imperial City.

52
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,360
You've always loved lively places.

53
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,040
Mount Wester is indeed a bit boring.

54
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,070
Okay.

55
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,340
You can stay.

56
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,510
Take this jade whistle.

57
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,159
If you're in danger, blow it.

58
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
I'll come to your aid right away.

59
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,360
Then I'll take my leave.

60
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,950
Are you here to interrogate me, Sovereign?

61
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,630
You've suffered all night.

62
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,040
Have some water first.

63
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,510
Sovereign,

64
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,720
you're showing me mercy.

65
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,920
I already know everything.

66
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,870
No need for further interrogation.

67
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,000
Su Yishui,

68
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,480
how is

69
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,630
Prince Ping doing?

70
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,940
How did you…

71
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,310
You're so talented,

72
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,200
yet you've intentionally hidden your strength.

73
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,920
Every time you left the mountain for training,

74
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,600
you spent a few days in the Imperial City.

75
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,250
You're such a special disciple.

76
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,710
I just needed to pay a bit of attention

77
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,560
to uncover the truth of your identity.

78
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,870
Sovereign,

79
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,220
I did that

80
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,000
only for cultivation.

81
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,830
Heavenly Sects can't get involved in mortal affairs.

82
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,909
They don't accept nobles.

83
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,820
That's why I hid my identity.

84
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,630
At this point,

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,159
you don't need

86
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,920
to keep lying.

87
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,830
This is my token as the sovereign.

88
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,360
If you wish to go to the library,

89
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,240
just agree to one thing.

90
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,210
What is it?

91
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,100
As a Heavenly One,

92
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,600
I don't ask for much in life.

93
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,430
Aside from completing cultivation,

94
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,040
all I wish for is a worthy successor.

95
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,670
From the day you came to Mount Eternal,

96
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,980
I've had the intention

97
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,800
to take you as my direct disciple.

98
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,700
Unfortunately, you've hidden too much,

99
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,840
and I couldn't just expose you for no reason.

100
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,510
Now that we've put it on the table,

101
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,110
it's actually a good thing.

102
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,600
Yishui,

103
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,160
if you're willing to kneel down,

104
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,510
drip your blood onto the jade tablet,

105
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,880
and swear a soul oath

106
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,800
that you'll join my sect

107
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,830
and never betray it,

108
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:34,990
you can

109
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,270
take this token.

110
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,159
From now on,

111
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,860
I'll teach you

112
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,860
all the Heavenly arts I know.

113
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,830
What do you say?

114
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,000
I hereby take a soul oath.

115
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,190
From today on,

116
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,490
I'll join your sect,

117
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,110
focus on cultivation, and never betray it.

118
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,270
Good boy.

119
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,770
You've made the soul oath.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,240
Serve me a cup of tea,

121
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,690
and you'll officially be my disciple.

122
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,210
Don't give up halfway.

123
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,600
You…

124
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,510
You tricked me!

125
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:20,870
So what?

126
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,870
I'll kill you!

127
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,600
You lost the bet and tried to back out.

128
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,240
I'm just claiming my wager.

129
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,870
Alright.

130
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,700
Hurry up and offer me the tea.

131
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,669
No way!

132
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,990
You'll offer me the tea as my disciple.

133
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,750
There's no escaping it.

134
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,550
Done.

135
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:58,660
From now on,

136
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,560
you're my disciple.

137
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,260
Shui,

138
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,500
let's go back to Mount Wester.

139
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,800
Don't waste your energy.

140
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,800
Blood in the jade tablet; soul bound to the sect.

141
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,720
It's useless.

142
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,200
The demoness, Mu Qingge!

143
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,360
How dare you break into the prison?

144
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,230
Thank that old man Kaiyuan for me

145
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,080
for giving me

146
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
such a good disciple.

147
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,870
Go report to Master!

148
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,480
Yes.

149
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,750
Master, what should we do?

150
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,150
Senior Kaiyuan,

151
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,060
I knew something was wrong.

152
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,520
Su Cheng has always been upright.

153
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,630
How could he suddenly steal books?

154
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:42,410
It seems

155
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,840
he was forced by that demoness.

156
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,750
We should go to Mount Wester to rescue him right away.

157
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,270
But Su Cheng

158
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,410
has become

159
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,790
Mu Qingge's disciple.

160
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,480
Whether he was forced

161
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,600
or not,

162
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,270
since he's made his choice,

163
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,560
he's no longer an Eternal.

164
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,270
So what reason do I have

165
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,960
to go to Mount Wester and demand him back?

166
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,270
Besides,

167
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,420
he did sneak into

168
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,150
the library,

169
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,390
breaking the sect's rules.

170
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,720
His life and death

171
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,120
are no longer our concern.

172
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,190
This is my Mount Wester.

173
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,270
Master. Master. Master.

174
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,040
Master's back.

175
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,730
Master. Master. Master.

176
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,820
Master, you're finally back!

177
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,790
Why were you gone so long?

178
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,110
You're collecting pretty boys everywhere.

179
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,010
So dissolute.

180
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,750
Master,

181
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,120
who is this?

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,360
This is your new fellow disciple,

183
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,550
Su Yishui.

184
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,510
Master,

185
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,690
after being away so long,

186
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
you brought back a new disciple.

187
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,750
Come on.

188
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,390
Let us give you a tour.

189
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,920
From now on,

190
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,840
we'll train together

191
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,870
under Master.

192
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,110
Let's go.

193
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,030
Mu Qingge!

194
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,080
You want to hurt people again?

195
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,550
I'll kill whoever dares

196
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,390
to touch me!

197
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,720
I'll seal your power for now.

198
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:07,840
Zeng Yi.

199
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,480
Yes.

200
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,910
Take him to his room.

201
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,030
Junior Su,

202
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,790
I'm your 14th senior brother.

203
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,000
Come with me.

204
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,550
[Wang Suizhi, Mu Qingge's disciple]

205
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,610
Master.

206
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,670
I

207
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,910
read Junior Su's fortune.

208
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,080
It's not good.

209
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,390
He might even

210
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,240
drag you down.

211
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,030
Suizhi, I know you're good at reading fortunes,

212
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,480
but if I can

213
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,150
keep this talented little brat

214
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,480
here in Mount Wester,

215
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,550
wouldn't it make me

216
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,390
look impressive?

217
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,720
[Carefree Pavilion]

218
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,320
Well,

219
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,480
Master said

220
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,520
you've suffered internal injuries

221
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,630
which caused a lot of stagnant blood.

222
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,920
She wants you to take those medicines

223
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,080
and then take a herbal bath.

224
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,440
Get lost!

225
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,450
I've been waiting for a long time.

226
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,140
Turns out you still haven't cleaned yourself up.

227
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,260
You vicious demoness,

228
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,330
I won't give in to you!

229
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,720
So you know I'm a demoness.

230
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,280
Then why aren't you behaving?

231
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,480
Just kill me already!

232
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,720
You're so handsome.

233
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,160
It would be a shame to kill you.

234
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,550
I'd rather keep you around just to look at.

235
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,670
Good.

236
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,030
This way,

237
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,960
I can see clearly

238
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,910
and get things done.

239
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,670
I knew it.

240
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,270
The Eternals tortured you,

241
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,510
but the wounds should be external

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
instead of internal.

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,440
So it's the Bone-Eroding Fire.

244
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,510
Is it a punishment from Prince Ping?

245
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,030
Your face is so cold

246
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,440
it's practically frozen,

247
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,320
but there's still a trace of warmth inside.

248
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,150
You locked Second Young Master up and didn't kill him.

249
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,700
No wonder Prince Ping punished you.

250
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,030
Who are you?

251
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,520
Please don't kill me!

252
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,720
Sir, I beg you.

253
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,480
Don't come any closer.

254
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,520
I have longan.

255
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,080
Please, don't kill me. I beg you.

256
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,510
I'll give you all of it. Look.

257
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,950
Dried longan!

258
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,200
It's really tasty. I'll give you all of it.

259
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,600
Please don't kill me, okay?

260
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,120
Get up.

261
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:14,840
Come with me.

262
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,200
I sent you to Eternal Sect to learn immortal arts.

263
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,440
I told you to kill a kid, yet you lost him.

264
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,610
Yishui.

265
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,710
Whether what you said is true or not doesn't matter,

266
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,630
but there's one thing you need to remember:

267
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,730
if you can't carry out

268
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,060
my orders,

269
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,360
you'll wish you were dead.

270
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,720
Young Master,

271
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,790
sorry for the offense.

272
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,000
Am I right?

273
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,600
It's none of your business.

274
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,440
I helped you force the boiling blood out,

275
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,550
yet you're still so rude.

276
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,040
Take your clothes off.

277
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,040
Get changed.

278
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,330
Do you want to live here

279
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,220
covered in blood?

280
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,030
Stop looking at me like that.

281
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,870
You really think my disciples

282
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,700
are all my toy boys?

283
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,320
They're your disciples,

284
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,350
but none of them are powerful.

285
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,030
If they aren't toy boys, what are they?

286
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,480
Lyu Yuan excels in music.

287
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,320
Jiang Huaimu loves plants.

288
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,870
Wang Suizhi can read fortunes.

289
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,050
Zeng Yi loves crafting magical tools.

290
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
Each of my disciples

291
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,790
has their own unique talent,

292
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,320
but none are skilled in martial arts.

293
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,360
In other Heavenly Sects,

294
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,790
they'd be considered losers.

295
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,600
What a waste that would be.

296
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,030
I brought them to Mount Wester

297
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,360
and got a group

298
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,670
of interesting disciples.

299
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,320
Stop justifying yourself.

300
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,600
You received them

301
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,630
only because they're good-looking.

302
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,670
Once they become my disciples,

303
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,910
even if they cause a huge disaster,

304
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,390
I'll take responsibility for them.

305
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,220
So what's wrong with me

306
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,750
picking the pretty ones?

307
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,210
So everything you did before

308
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
was just to toy with me?

309
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:10,880
Shui.

310
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,550
Everything you did

311
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,640
was arranged by Prince Ping,

312
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,030
right?

313
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,200
You're so talented.

314
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,750
Why settle to be a pawn?

315
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,069
Don't you think it's a waste?

316
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,030
How do you know I'm the pawn

317
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,640
and not the mastermind?

318
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,010
Before I become

319
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,070
the strongest,

320
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,750
there's always no choice.

321
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,480
But one day,

322
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,890
I'll hold them

323
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,110
tightly in my hands.

324
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,400
The obsession with becoming the strongest

325
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,110
will only bind you with desire.

326
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,350
In the end,

327
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,200
you won't even be able to control yourself.

328
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,440
That way,

329
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,640
you'll lose yourself easily.

330
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,400
Don't lecture me

331
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,240
with pointless words.

332
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,480
Tell me.

333
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,750
Why do you insist on

334
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,580
taking me as your disciple?

335
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,200
Because for all these years,

336
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,560
you're the only one I've encountered

337
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,480
with the Five Spirit Roots.

338
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,830
You're the most suitable to be my successor.

339
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,680
Second,

340
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,700
you have too much bloodlust.

341
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,520
If I hadn't met you, you could just stay that way.

342
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,690
But since I've met you,

343
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,000
I have to teach you properly.

344
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,040
If I leave you unchecked,

345
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,720
you'll end up killing indiscriminately

346
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,640
and wreaking havoc.

347
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,640
I've made it quite clear, haven't I?

348
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,930
Then let's see how long you can trap me

349
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,830
in Mount Wester.

350
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,680
I'll kill those

351
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,000
I want to kill sooner or later.

352
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,000
I see.

353
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,590
That's easy.

354
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
I, Mu Qingge, sovereign of Wester Sect,

355
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,850
free my disciple, Su Yishui,

356
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,720
from power restraints

357
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,050
and the constraints

358
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,440
of the jade tablet.

359
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,960
He can try to take my life.

360
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,720
You want me to kill you?

361
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,060
Since you're so eager to kill,

362
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,240
then I'll bear that killing intent.

363
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,870
From now on,

364
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:06,660
you can use

365
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,830
all kinds of methods to kill me.

366
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,240
If you're not powerful enough

367
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,590
or lack skills,

368
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,920
I'll teach you.

369
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,880
As long as you kill me, your master,

370
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,640
you can break the soul oath

371
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,960
and leave Mount Wester.

372
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,830
Don't regret it!

373
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,210
Your sword moves are too direct.

374
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,220
Trying to kill me has a price.

375
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,680
Every failed attempt

376
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,240
comes with a punishment.

377
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,590
Killing me by injuring yourself?

378
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,720
Do you have a death wish?

379
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,030
I just want to kill you.

380
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,200
You brat,

381
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,810
you're cruel to others,

382
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,750
but even more so to yourself.

383
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,680
You need a different punishment.

384
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,880
What do you mean?

385
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,550
Play the qin for me.

386
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,520
What kind of punishment is this?

387
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,470
It's nothing for others,

388
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,240
but for you, it's a heavy punishment.

389
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,060
I won't play.

390
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,860
Then I'll take your sword.

391
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,750
From now on, you can only play the qin.

392
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,440
Being a qin player wouldn't be so bad.

393
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,340
This piece is called "Drunk Breeze."

394
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,650
Learn it for me.

395
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,460
It's a beautiful melody,

396
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,480
but you're playing it like a war song

397
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,840
that's full of blood and killing.

398
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,750
Your temperament needs improving.

399
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,750
Come with me.

400
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,180
Mu Qingge.

401
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,750
What exactly do you want to do?

402
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,590
Killing intent needs to be suppressed.

403
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,910
Take care of

404
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,070
these little things.

405
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,530
If they lose one hair,

406
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,730
you'll play ten more qin pieces.

407
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,940
Is Junior Su

408
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,590
really going to play the qin all night?

409
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,880
He fed the rabbits and chickens

410
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,160
and played the qin all night.

411
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,440
Don't mess with him.

412
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,960
I made some sweets just for you.

413
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,890
I saw that you had

414
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,080
sea salt dried longan in your bag,

415
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,160
so I thought you might like it.

416
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,720
I tried making some for you.

417
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,910
Since you came here,

418
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,120
you've been beaten up seven times.

419
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,030
Here,

420
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,480
seven pieces as compensation.

421
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:44,770
Go ahead.

422
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,510
Try them.

423
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,400
What?

424
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,620
They're that bad?

425
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,440
I swear, I'll kill you!

426
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,220
[Uncle Ye Xin's residence, Puxin Village]

427
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,510
Qingge.

428
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,280
You promised to come back every three months

429
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,200
to visit Uncle Ye Xin.

430
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,480
You were almost late.

431
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,000
But didn't I make it just in time?

432
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,000
Where's Uncle Ye Xin?

433
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,720
Being late doesn't matter.

434
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,830
I'm happy enough

435
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,550
that you still remember me.

436
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,140
Chestnut cakes!

437
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,960
Years ago,

438
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,580
when I found you by the roadside,

439
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,950
you were both hungry

440
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:29,820
[Ye Xin, a cultivator]

441
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,170
and crying.

442
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,590
So many years have passed.

443
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,640
I can't believe

444
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,030
you've grown up so much.

445
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,110
Qingge,

446
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,680
I heard you took on a disciple.

447
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,150
What kind of person is he?

448
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,550
The youngest son of Prince Ping,

449
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,720
a rebellious lad.

450
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,010
I heard he's tough.

451
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,790
How do you plan to train him?

452
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,550
First, I'll tame his killing intent.

453
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,720
Then, I'll teach him the true Heavenly arts

454
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,780
and help him form his Golden Core.

455
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,370
That way, the universe

456
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,000
will have another righteous immortal master.

457
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,980
Taking him as your disciple

458
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,030
will involve the royal family.

459
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,160
Do you

460
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,860
favor Prince Ping?

461
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,000
Of course not.

462
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,850
Prince Ping is ruthless

463
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,590
and quite infamous.

464
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,520
On the contrary, Yu's father,

465
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,210
Prince Zong,

466
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,110
is a kind-hearted

467
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,030
and well-respected prince.

468
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,230
But I don't care about all that.

469
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,480
I felt like taking on a disciple, so I did.

470
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,070
But this could be troublesome.

471
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,680
A few days ago, I had your fortune read.

472
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,640
The reading showed

473
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,880
a rising sun,

474
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,310
but suddenly, dark clouds covered it.

475
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,310
Qingge,

476
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,790
now that your cultivation is complete,

477
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,340
you should follow the will of heaven

478
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,590
and ascend as soon as possible.

479
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,400
Taking Su Yishui as your disciple

480
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,400
might bring you trouble.

481
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,430
Thank you for the warning.

482
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,090
But even if there is trouble,

483
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,550
I'll face it as it comes.

484
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,370
Ascension

485
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,960
sounds so lonely.

486
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,610
The immortals up there

487
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
must be so bored.

488
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,110
I prefer to live freely in the mortal world.

489
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,480
Eating, drinking, playing,

490
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,880
and having a rebellious disciple to train.

491
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,150
How interesting!

492
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,900
There are people I care about in the mortal world.

493
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,350
I can't bear to leave them.

494
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,830
Caring for others

495
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,650
sometimes becomes a burden.

496
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,710
If Su Yishui can't be changed,

497
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,440
what will you

498
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,550
do to him?

499
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,710
I'll have no choice

500
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,750
but to kill him myself.

501
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,850
I'm afraid you can't bring yourself

502
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,440
to do that.

503
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,400
You're always protective of those close to you.

504
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,350
You like

505
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,160
to take everyone under your protection.

506
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,640
But you need to understand that

507
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,920
everyone has their own fate.

508
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,030
Sometimes,

509
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,440
you can save a person

510
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,030
but can't change their fate.

511
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,310
Don't let yourself get caught up in it.

512
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,790
I won't.

513
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,160
Never mind.

514
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,160
I know,

515
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,220
sometimes

516
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,610
there's no convincing you.

517
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,480
I've been living here for so long.

518
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,630
I'm getting tired.

519
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,830
It's time to go out.

520
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,510
Where are you going?

521
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,830
Just wander around

522
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,580
and see

523
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
the interesting mortal world you mentioned.

524
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,310
Your power has greatly improved.

525
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,850
Hurry up and meditate to channel it.

526
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,280
Direct your power to the acupoints Bing Fen,

527
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,980
Xia Bai,

528
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,180
and Yao Yu.

529
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:06,980
What are you waiting for?

530
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,060
Do as I say.

531
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,150
When did you leave sword energy in my body?

532
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,640
Your sword moves are too direct.

533
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,780
Focus.

534
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,510
The qin melody is the melody of the heart.

535
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,290
Align your spiritual power

536
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,830
with the rhythm of "Drunk Breeze."

537
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,070
Concentrate your power.

538
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,030
Alright.

539
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,720
Your power has solidified.

540
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,400
You've passed the final test.

541
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,610
When it's time,

542
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,550
you can form your Golden Core.

543
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,640
So, you previously punished me to...

544
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,310
The punishment isn't over yet.

545
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,740
Have a rest.

546
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,310
There's more to come tomorrow.

547
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,250
Father.

548
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,590
It's been so long.

549
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,770
If I hadn't

550
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,920
activated the Spirit Spring in your body,

551
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,200
you probably

552
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,260
wouldn't have come down the mountain to see me.

553
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,030
I didn't know

554
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,160
about your arrival.

555
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,030
Is that so?

556
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,830
Don't forget.

557
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,970
With the Spirit Spring

558
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,410
I injected into your body,

559
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,550
I can control you.

560
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,640
This Heavenly Bottle

561
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,230
is the container of the Spirit Spring.

562
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,890
With just a slight shake,

563
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,240
I can stir the Spirit Spring inside you,

564
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,540
causing you unbearable pain.

565
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,110
So,

566
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,070
don't try to play tricks on me.

567
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,440
I wouldn't dare.

568
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,190
Do you know

569
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,300
by switching to Wester Sect,

570
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,350
you've exposed your identity?

571
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,470
The Eternals have been asking me

572
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,410
why I messed with the Heavenly Sects.

573
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:56,920
I know.

574
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,640
Then why did you go to Mount Wester?

575
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,280
Mu Qingge has a fondness for pretty boys.

576
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:00,910
Don't tell me

577
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,110
you've been charmed by her.

578
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,550
I want to kill her every day,

579
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,260
but she tricked me

580
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,010
into taking a soul oath

581
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,350
and put me under her thumb.

582
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,750
What?

583
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,800
You really took a soul oath?

584
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,990
I thought

585
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,590
you were clever and cautious,

586
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,830
but it turns out you're an idiot!

587
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,480
I should've killed you when I had the chance!

588
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,550
Father, calm down.

589
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,210
I've come up with a plan.

590
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,160
What?

591
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,130
You're about to form your core?

592
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,660
Mu Qingge entered Mount Eternal

593
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,690
as if she owned that place.

594
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,310
After I learn her skills,

595
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,440
taking the demonic magic from Eternal Sect

596
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,470
will be a piece of cake.

597
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,640
Alright.

598
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,300
But remember this:

599
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,480
even though you took a soul oath

600
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,320
for Mu Qingge,

601
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,350
your life

602
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,750
is still in my hands.

603
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,350
Why did you bring me to the town?

604
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,650
You'll find out soon.

605
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,570
Thank you, Immortal Master.

606
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,920
You're welcome.

607
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,200
Thank you, Immortal Master,

608
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,370
for saving my wife.

609
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,520
No trouble at all.

610
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,270
Thank you.

611
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,340
Thank you for finding my son.

612
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,510
Thank you.

613
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,830
You're welcome.

614
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,270
Thank you, Immortal Master.

615
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,480
Thank you

616
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,070
for fishing out my donkey from the river.

617
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,460
Thank you, Immortal Master.

618
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,720
You're welcome.

619
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,350
Mu Qingge,

620
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,310
you're actually making money off of me.

621
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,800
Calm down.

622
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,470
There's still a big deal to close.

623
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:10,040
[Dongxi Village]

624
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,220
You're not trying to make money.

625
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,630
You're helping people, right?

626
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,030
Can't fool you, huh?

627
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,420
There are countless people

628
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,030
in this universe who need help.

629
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,260
These small acts of kindness

630
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,440
are meaningless.

631
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,030
I'll just help as many people as I can.

632
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,510
It's better than doing nothing at all.

633
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,790
Besides,

634
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,740
I can make some money from it, can't I?

635
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,310
What?

636
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,110
You're helping people,

637
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,880
but why do the Heavenly Ones call you a demoness?

638
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,030
Those old fools

639
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,890
only know to cultivate with long faces.

640
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,030
They call anything

641
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,060
that's not their way evil.

642
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,360
I follow my own path.

643
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,200
Who cares about them?

644
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,010
Let's go.

645
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,000
Save them.

646
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,000
Thank you.

647
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,850
How strange.

648
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,600
We were inexplicably

649
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,670
tied to the pillars.

650
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,550
Yeah.

651
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,550
Shui,

652
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,780
there's a child over there.

653
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,510
Always finish what you start.

654
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,300
Hurry up.

655
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,480
Don't be afraid.

656
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:40,639
Do you know

657
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,630
who hung you up?

658
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,710
No.

659
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,510
This is for you two.

660
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,000
Thank you.

661
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,710
Mind your own business.

662
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,320
What's going on?

663
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,280
The boy who took the girl away

664
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,230
should be an Earth Immortal.

665
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,960
He cast the Shadow Spell on us.

666
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,710
That's why we move in unison.

667
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,700
You helped others

668
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,430
but ended up in trouble.

669
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,310
How laughable!

670
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,930
Isn't this fun?

671
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,710
Just seal that Earth Immortal back into the ground

672
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,410
and save the girl.

673
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,620
Fun, huh?

674
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,480
Alright.

675
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,850
Don't make big moves.

676
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,730
Did you say it's fun?

677
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,070
As an Earth Immortal,

678
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,710
instead of guarding your land,

679
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,630
you're here harming people.

680
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,110
You can't escape.

681
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,820
Break the Shadow Spell.

682
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,150
You two

683
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,320
[Earth Immortal]

684
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,670
are on my turf now.

685
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,840
You'd better behave!

686
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,860
[Sealed Domain]

687
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:06,970
This is...

688
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,170
The Shadow Spell no longer works.

689
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:14,600
It seems

690
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,070
we've been pulled into his Sealed Domain.

691
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,880
You know quite a bit, huh?

692
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,560
I've been trapped here for thousands of years,

693
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,400
guarding this land.

694
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,400
It's so boring.

695
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,810
I finally found a chance to sneak out

696
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,880
and look for a playmate,

697
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,590
but you two messed things up.

698
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,490
You'll just stay here forever!

699
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:34,960
You're dead!

700
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,150
Celestial Ice Thorn?

701
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,710
You really showed no mercy.

702
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,370
This is a small place.

703
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,630
You can't escape.

704
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,080
Let us out.

705
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,920
You want to get out?

706
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,000
No problem.

707
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,840
But every inch of this Sealed Domain

708
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,280
is bound by the celestial contract.

709
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,240
Now that you're here,

710
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,400
you must abide by its rules.

711
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,760
This land of mine

712
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,230
requires two guardians.

713
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,550
The Immortal Realm's negligence

714
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,320
left me here alone for thousands of years.

715
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,850
Now that you three are here,

716
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,190
only two of you can leave.

717
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,210
One must stay.

718
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,360
That's nonsense!

719
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,710
Even if you kill me,

720
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,550
two of you

721
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,620
will still have to stay here.

722
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,030
The exit is over there.

723
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,510
You decide.

724
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,110
Shui.

725
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,280
He's not lying.

726
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,520
The celestial contract here

727
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,770
does indeed restrict us.

728
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,960
But I have an idea.

729
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,990
What is it?

730
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,760
Don't be afraid.

731
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,010
Go back home.

732
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,830
Where's the young lady just now?

733
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:51,910
She...

734
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,290
She stayed inside by herself.

735
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,280
You're out.

736
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,710
How did you manage that?

737
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:45,440
I tickled

738
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,730
that Earth Immortal until he couldn't stand it.

739
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,070
Then he admitted that

740
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,310
he opened the portal

741
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,880
with 300 years of cultivation

742
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,400
and came out to mess with people.

743
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,580
So I made him

744
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,810
use another 300 years of cultivation

745
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,890
to open the portal again.

746
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,360
It's not too bad.

747
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,560
I also got a piece of the priceless

748
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,800
Blood Chalcedony as an apology gift.

749
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,880
Were you worried about me?

750
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,110
I was just curious.

751
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,440
I got out

752
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,160
but brought a bit of trouble along with me.

753
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,320
What trouble?

754
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,160
Three.

755
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,630
Two.

756
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,550
One.

757
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:25,960
The Shadow Spell!

758
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,880
This is the trouble I was talking about.

759
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,850
Once we left the Sealed Domain,

760
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,420
the Shadow Spell took effect again.

761
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,400
How do we break this damn thing?

762
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,210
We can only wait for it to break itself in four hours.

763
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,830
Let's go.

764
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,340
Send the girl back to the village first.

765
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,560
Come on. Hold his sword.

[Hexing Restaurant]

767
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,880
Respect your master.

768
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,000
Let me drink first.

769
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,510
Don't you dote on your disciples?

770
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,110
Why don't you let me eat first?

771
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,130
You won't back down?

772
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,110
Alright.

773
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,960
Let's see how long you can hold out.

774
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:36,920
They...

775
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,110
A minx and a libertine.

776
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,840
Shameless!

777
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,360
Let's go.

778
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,380
You ruined my image!

779
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,280
You started it first.

780
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,520
And you don't care about

781
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,440
others' opinions anyway.

782
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,510
Calling me a demoness is fine,

783
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,120
but calling me a minx is too much.

784
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,070
Stop it.

785
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,300
It seems

786
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,120
we're embarrassing ourselves more than each other.

Truce.

788
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,110
After we eat, we'll meditate in the inn

[Qingzhu Inn]

791
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,160
Didn't we agree on a truce?

792
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,910
Why are you doing it again?

793
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,670
Hasn't it been four hours already?

794
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,470
You got hurt earlier?

795
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,810
Didn't your defensive aura

796
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,550
block the attack?

797
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,190
Celestial Ice Thorns are pretty powerful.

has never been injured before.

801
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,480
Then this scar

802
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,670
is the first one?

803
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,960
I was just lucky.

804
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,730
When you help people and seek justice,

805
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,710
it's inevitable to get hurt.

806
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,480
It's just a scar.

807
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,280
No big deal.
