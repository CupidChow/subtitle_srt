Ranran.

4
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,680
Master.

5
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,920
You've ascended to the Transcendence Realm.

6
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,360
Your Formless Spirit Root is gone.

7
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,950
♫Fallen leaves swirling and covering the empty garden♫

8
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,750
It's not that bad.

9
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,780
I can still concoct and refine pills.

10
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:24,910
Besides,

♫Clouds and dust rolling in the distant sky♫

12
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,750
I haven't lost my skill with talismans.

13
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,400
Even though I can't cultivate with the Spirit Root anymore,

14
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,190
I can try the path of talisman cultivation.

15
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,430

♫Solitary branches hidden in clothing♫

20
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,750
You're still

21
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,190
so willful and reckless.

Are you crying?

25
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,650
♫I've shed thousands of tears, but my feelings haven't run dry♫

From now on,

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,630
I will protect you well.

♫Hatred adds grayness to my hair♫

29
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,800
Master, you were once deceived by me

30
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,960
and driven to Mount Wester.

31
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,590
You were bullied so badly,

32
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,560
yet you never cried.

34
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,310
Are you recalling things?

♫With you by my side, I'm fearless in the face of life's hardships♫

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,400
Back then, Master,

41
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,280
you weren't as gentle as you are now.

♫We'll be together again when the flowers bloom♫

46

you'll know that

47

you were originally on his side.

48

♫The moment between us is worth 10,000 years♫

49
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,460
And I only disappointed you.

50

I'm afraid you might...

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,400
Even so, I won't regret it.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,710
I don't remember much about the past,

53
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,360
and I can't

54
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,630
speak on behalf of my past self

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,430
to say things like forgiving you

56
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,400
or not blaming you,

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,800
words to comfort you.

58
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,190
But I can see my own heart clearly,

59
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,960
and I'm certain of

60
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,520
my current feelings.

61
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,079
I remember every time you protected me, Master,

62
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,750
and every time you were tough on the outside but soft on the inside.

63

♫I've shed thousands of tears, but my feelings haven't run dry♫

After all,

72
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,720

Then you can tie yourself up

82

Your Highness.

107
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,120
You said it was foolproof.

108
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,480
Am I dying?

109
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,600
Your Highness.

110
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,030
You're indeed showing a sign of depleted primordial spirit.

111
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,340
There's not enough time to find another suitable person.

112
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
This plan

113
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,270
was disrupted by the Spirit Spring and the Green Dragon.

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,270
It was truly unexpected.

115
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,930
Why?

116
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,360
Why, even after starting over,

117
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,170
did she still choose Su Yishui?

118
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,920
After all these years of careful planning,

119
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,880
nothing has changed.

120
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,580
I don't want to die.

121
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,560
No.

122
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,260
I can't die!

123
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,870
You must have another way, right?

124
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,390
Think of something quickly.

125
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,600
I can't let Su Yishui escape!

126
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,270
Get out!

127
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,040
Guards!

128
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,110
Guards, come quickly!

129
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,240
At first, the plan was going smoothly.

130
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,480
From the moment Su Yishui had the Spirit Spring with him,

131
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,480
I had already started to make arrangements

132
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,480
to have Su Yu lead Su Yishui into the palace,

133
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,830
so that I could take the opportunity

134
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,800
to let the Spirit Spring return to the Demon's child's body.

135
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,390
Now,

136
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,870
I'm not sure if the Spirit Spring

137
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,120
has already firmly attached itself

138
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,630
to Su Yishui's body.

139
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:55,920
However,

140
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,240
rest assured.

141
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,000
I will keep a close eye on Su Yishui's movements.

142
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,680
I will make sure you can return as soon as possible

143
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,190
to take control of everything.

144
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,310
Xue Ranran is actually Mu Qingge?

145
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,040
Yes.

146
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,390
Interesting.

147
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,210
I've been saying all along that Mu Qingge

148
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
was very suspicious.

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,430
That little girl Xue Ranran

150
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,190
is indeed quite to my liking.

151
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,610
So this was the truth all along.

152
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,690
Su Yishui

153
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,080
is truly the most cunning and deceitful of them all.

154
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,960
You just said

155
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,480
the dragon carried them

156
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,440
out to sea?

157
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,240
The far reaches of the East Sea

158
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,390
is the Sea of Immortality.

159
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,090
Within it lies the Divine Dragon Island,

160
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,620
which should be where the Green Dragon is returning to.

161
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,670
But the Divine Dragon Island is hard to reach.

162
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,510
I'm afraid it'll be difficult to track Su Yishui's whereabouts.

163
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,070
They will have to come ashore eventually.

164
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,390
Go immediately and guard the sea entrance.

165
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,550
As for the Spirit Spring and Mu Qingge,

166
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,270
no matter how well you hide them, Su Yishui,

167
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,860
they'll eventually fall

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
into my hands.

169
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,080
My Lord, hold on!

170
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,270
Tu Jiuyuan.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,640
You're really going to rebel, aren't you?

172
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,630
I will always be loyal to you, My Lord,

173
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,670
and will certainly help you

174
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,660
obtain the Spirit Spring

175
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,120
to cleanse the Blazing Sword

176
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,910
and fulfill your lifelong wish.

177
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,910
I just hope that you, My Lord,

178
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
will act calmly.

179
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,670
Calmly?

180
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,750
Times have changed.

181
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,490
Obsessing over Mu Qingge

182
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,070
is pointless now.

183
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,360
Tu Jiuyuan.

184
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,000
Who gave you the courage

185
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,290
to interfere with my personal affairs?

186
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,720
Su Yishui is a madman who, for Mu Qingge's sake,

187
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,450
didn't hesitate to defy the Heavenly Sect

188
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,750
and destroy his own Golden Core

189
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,940
to resurrect Mu Qingge.

190
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,080
It's better to avoid unnecessary trouble.

191
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,720
My taking the Spirit Spring

192
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,420
was always meant to be a confrontation

193
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,480
with Su Yishui to the very end.

194
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,980
What harm is there in snatching Mu Qingge as well?

195
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,320
Do you think I fear Su Yishui,

196
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,720
that black-hearted fox?

197
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,200
Could it be...

198
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,630
What are you panicking about?

199
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,320
With this expression,

200
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,720
I almost thought

201
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,750
you had fallen in love with me

202
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,630
and were getting jealous here.

203
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,080
So what

204
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,870
if I was?

205
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,240
Last time I offered you a title,

206
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,890
you didn't want it,

207
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,960
and you treated it as a joke.

208
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,510
And now, you suddenly...

209
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,480
What I want is certainly not

210
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,260
these things.

211
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,720
What do you mean by "these things"?

212
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,250
Don't you understand, My Lord?

213
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,030
What I want is just a sincere heart.

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,360
You...

215
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,310
Indeed, I

216
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,120
have had feelings for you

217
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,660
since much earlier, My Lord.

218
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,080
That moment when we

219
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,790
fought side by side,

220
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,880
that's when I fell for you.

221
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,600
Shut up.

222
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,670
What a ridiculous story.

223
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,110
You think I'd believe that?

224
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,790
I don't remember

225
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,600
any moment of us fighting together.

226
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,790
You and I are born enemies.

227
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,750
There's only ever been clear victory or defeat between us.

228
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,670
Are you joking with me,

229
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
or are you dreaming?

230
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,750
It's you who has forgotten.

231
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,030
In earlier times,

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,120
we often practiced martial arts and swordsmanship together.

233
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,670
You even said

234
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,680
that when Mount Red Flame opens,

235
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,260
you'd make me the master of Butterfly Valley.

236
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,940
What ancient history are you talking about?

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,930
Once I obtain the Spirit Spring,

238
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,120
cleanse the Blazing Sword,

239
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,080
and open Mount Red Flame,

240
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,120
I can grant you the Butterfly Valley

241
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,000
if you wish.

242
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,240
As long as

243
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,720
you stop having those

244
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,830
far-fetched dreams.

245
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,670
Put away your

246
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,690
inexplicable thoughts.

247
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Stay by my side

248
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,630
and do what you're supposed to do.

249
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,730
Elder.

250
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,750
Please sit down.

251
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,000
Elder, do you know about your physical condition?

252
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,320
Elder, you are already pregnant.

253
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,270
It was that time...

254
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,750
My Lord.

255
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,000
You're drunk.

256
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:37,820
Where do you think you are going?

257
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:49,840
You...

258
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,950
Why are you here?

259
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,000
I no longer wish to be entangled with him,

260
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,100
yet I'm burdened with this child.

261
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,600
Elder, what do you mean by that?

262
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,120
You mustn't bear this burden alone anymore.

263
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,000
You must let Sovereign know about this.

264
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,850
What's the point of letting him know?

265
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,240
I just humiliated myself

266
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,490
by confessing my feelings to him.

267
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,800
I was mocked and ridiculed.

268
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,760
How could I force him to acknowledge this child?

269
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,510
It would only bring me more shame.

270
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,200
But if you don't tell him,

271
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,480
when the baby grows bigger and your pregnancy becomes visible,

272
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,510
it can't be hidden anyway.

273
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,000
At worst,

274
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,870
after helping him obtain the Spirit Spring,

275
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,080
cleanse the Blazing Sword,

276
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,480
and open Mount Red Flame,

277
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,790
fulfilling my vow to the old sovereign,

278
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,030
I'll leave the Scarlet Sect.

279
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,750
Elder, how could you have such thoughts?

280
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,720
I've given my all to him in the Scarlet Sect,

281
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,200
but he only ignores it.

282
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,910
You said I wouldn't yield,

283
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,170
but what difference did it make when I humbled myself to him?

284
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,790
I've given him my whole heart,

285
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
but have I received even a bit of sincerity from him?

286
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,440
I'm tired.

287
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,410
But Elder, you were born

288
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,750
and raised in the Scarlet Sect.

289
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,670
Where else could your home be if you leave?

290
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,450
I still think

291
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,080
you should tell Sovereign about this, Elder.

292
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,840
He can't be that hard-hearted.

293
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,350
I believe things will take a turn for the better.

294
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,030
Cleansing swords in the Spirit Spring is a major event for the Scarlet Sect.

295
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,030
His Lordship is fully focused on this.

296
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,800
Let's talk about it after this matter is settled.

297
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,200
Since the Spirit Spring caused disturbances last time,

298
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,000
it has vanished without a trace.

299
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,670
Yesterday, an unusual phenomenon occurred in the capital,

300
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,840
and the Demon Detector has been acting up non-stop.

301
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,600
As for our Eternal Sect,

302
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,120
we've received the Crown Prince's

303
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,380
urgent letter in his own handwriting.

304
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,840
It turns out

305
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,670
all the disturbances were caused by Su Yishui.

306
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:11,960
So the Demon's child

307
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,000
is actually that scoundrel Su Yishui.

308
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,960
We've all been deceived by him.

309
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,600
We must find the Demon's child as soon as possible.

310
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,390
Otherwise,

311
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,080
the universe will be thrown into chaos again.

312
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,720
But we don't know what method he used

313
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,200
to conceal the traces of the Spirit Spring.

314
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,790
Even the Demon Detector can't capture it.

315
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,030
The information

316
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,030
that came with His Highness's letter is that

317
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,480
the last direction where the Demon's child disappeared

318
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,750
was the East Sea.

319
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,030
I hereby request all sovereigns

320
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,870
to send more disciples to search for its whereabouts.

321
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,790
Speaking of which,

322
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,480
I wonder how Su Yu is doing.

323
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,109
Will Zhou Feihua

324
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,920
be implicated?

325
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,680
That person from the Exotic Pavilion is quite capable.

326
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,640
He will certainly do his utmost

327
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,710
to rescue Su Yu.

328
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,369
But the poison is deep in his body and hard to cure,

329
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,480
and his primordial spirit has left his body.

330
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,630
He won't live long.

331
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,069
As for Zhou Feihua,

332
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,130
I've already sent messages to

333
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,000
Yu Tong and Yu Chen,

334
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,369
asking them to keep an eye out

335
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,030
and protect her.

336
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,270
Don't worry about it anymore.

337
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,590
Grab some sleep.

338
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,550
Rest and recuperate.

339
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,350
Zhao.

340
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,370
You weren't in the city a few days ago.

341
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,200
You missed the unprecedented sight.

342
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,710
The Green Dragon attained ascension,

343
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,510
and phoenixes flew up to the sky together.

344
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,360
Wasn't that an auspicious sign?

345
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,110
You're mistaken.

346
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,580
I have a cousin

347
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,510
who serves in the palace.

348
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,750
He said the Crown...

349
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,160
He said the Crown Prince

350
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,720
was keeping devils in the palace,

351
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,000
which caused Heaven's wrath to descend.

352
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,030
The Eastern Palace

353
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,270
was mostly destroyed.

354
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,610
The Crown Prince

355
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,210
has even lost years of his life.

356
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,400
Even the imperial physicians are at a loss.

357
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,270
I'm afraid...

358
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,760
Stop talking.

359
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,070
Let me tell you something.

360
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,790
His Highness is resting.

361
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,720
He said he didn't want

362
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,950
the moving shadows at the door to disturb him.

363
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,690
You all step back and keep watch from a distance.

364
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,640
Yes.

365
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,750
Let's go.

366
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,020
If you're so reluctant,

367
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,990
why bother leaving?

368
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,370
Seize her!

369
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,110
You anticipated my arrival.

370
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,920
I had people spread rumors in the capital

371
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,160
in all the inns, both large and small,

372
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,310
and near the city gates

373
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,030
about how serious my illness is.

374
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,640
I knew

375
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,240
you'd return out of concern for me.

376
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,590
You've always been soft-hearted.

377
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,590
You're right.

378
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,750
I was truly worried something might happen to you.

379
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,720
But you've been scheming against me.

380
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,750
Su Yu.

381
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,680
I thought

382
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,310
we had truly opened our hearts to each other.

383
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,440
But

384
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,750
I don't really know you at all.

385
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,140
You scold me,

386
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,160
yet you still care about me.

387
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,160
Of course I don't want to see

388
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,200
anything happen to you.

389
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,400
I wish for your well-being.

390
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,550
However,

391
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,210
I'm even more unwilling to see you

392
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,920
fall into an abyss from which you can't return.

393
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,000
But in this world, how can anything

394
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,510
be perfect in every way?

395
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,160
To gain something, one must lose something.

396
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,750
Feihua.

397
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,640
All these years by my side,

398
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,550
you've done well.

399
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,080
I also understand

400
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,880
your unspoken feelings for me.

401
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,070
I know

402
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,550
your feelings for me are genuine and deep.

403
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,400
Rest assured.

404
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
I won't make things difficult for you.

405
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,040
I don't want to hear any more of

406
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,200
your insincere words.

407
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,830
Your heart is clearly so cold,

408
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,170
risking the turmoil of public opinion

409
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,070
and political stability,

410
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,320
just to lure me into your trap.

411
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,680
Your aim is to use me as a hostage

412
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,730
to force Ranran to show herself, isn't it?

413
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,480
Yes.

414
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,090
You value emotions,

415
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,640
and she values righteousness.

416
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,270
You came for me.

417
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,720
Surely she'll come for you,

418
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,920
and Su Yishui will surely come for her!

419
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,160
I was so stupid.

420
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,480
I've been fooling myself for over a decade,

421
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,720
thinking sincerity could be exchanged for sincerity.

422
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,310
I never thought that

423
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,510
in your eyes,

424
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,640
I'm just a tool after all.

425
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,760
You're using me to force Ranran to appear.

426
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,550
But so what?

427
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,480
With you being like this,

428
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,270
do you think you can still win her favor?

429
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,070
Take her to the Cold Palace!

430
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,310
Take good care of her.

431
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,760
Don't hurt her.

432
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,480
Su Yu.

433
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,340
Ranran won't fall for your trap!

434
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,960
All that you've been planning

435
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,030
will not succeed!

436
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,000
Take her away!

437
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,750
Yes, Your Highness.

438
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,680
Look.

439
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,520
This Concubine Zhou

440
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,590
is truly audacious.

441
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,970
How dare she attempt to kill the Crown Prince?

442
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,720
Indeed.

443
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,550
She's far too bold.

444
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,640
So bold.

445
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,700
[Announcement]

446
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,270
What a pity. She's so beautiful.

447
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,200
Let's go.

448
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,600
[Compatible]

449
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,590
This is the Cold Palace of the Eastern Palace.

450
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,030
This is where Concubine Zhou is imprisoned.

451
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,350
At present,

452
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,440
the palace's defensive formation

453
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,700
hasn't been fully repaired.

454
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,070
With the use of magic,

455
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,720
I believe entering shouldn't be difficult.

456
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,750
But the Eastern Palace won't overlook this matter.

457
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,490
Those cultivators from the Exotic Pavilion

458
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,170
must have set up formations around the Cold Palace,

459
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,360
waiting for us to fall into their trap.

460
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,220
The Crown Prince is holding Concubine Zhou captive

461
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,350
simply to force Guardian and Ranran to show themselves.

462
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,510
Then we'll create a diversion.

463
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,300
Let's split into two groups.

464
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,740
We'll enter from here first.

465
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,450
Su Yishui has appeared!

466
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,640
And Xue Ranran too!

467
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:46,650
After them!

468
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,270
Yes!

469
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,030
Hurry!

470
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,920
Chase them!

471
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,480
Ranran.

472
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,850
Don't let Su Yu

473
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,720
capture you again.

474
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,690
I must say,

475
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,180
this tunneling armor Baishan rushed to make

476
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:04,960
is really handy.

477
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,210
You are...

478
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,790
I'm Yu Tong,

479
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,960
and this is my elder brother, Yu Chen.

480
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,690
The two of us

481
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,880
are here on Guardian Su Yishui's orders

482
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,750
to help you leave the capital.

483
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,480
This feels so good.

484
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,160
I had such a deep sleep.

485
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,680
You slept for three days.

486
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,200
The wounds on my body

487
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,240
don't hurt anymore.

488
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,310
They healed so quickly.

489
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,350
Master, have you not rested for the past three days,

490
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,560
using your spiritual power

491
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,590
to heal me all this time?

492
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,880
I don't sleep anyway.

493
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,640
The Spirit Spring has entered my body before,

494
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,480
so it's easier for it to reconnect with the demonic energy

495
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,310
from the Spirit Spring in my heart.

496
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,030
I need to stay alert at all times

497
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,640
to prevent the Spirit Spring from taking advantage of any weakness.

498
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,350
I can't let it hurt you again.

499
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,790
Master, you can't relax for even a moment.

500
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,680
Aren't you exhausted?

501
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,510
I have entered the Transcendence Realm.

502
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,590
Not sleeping for ten days or even half a month is no problem.

503
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,650
Moreover,

504
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,020
the essence of the Spirit Spring

505
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,790
is to infinitely expand human greed

506
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,060
and entice the devil in one's heart.

507
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,610
But the obsession of my life

508
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,240
is already by my side.

509
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,880
It's difficult for the Spirit Spring to entice me.

510
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:26,750
Then...

511
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,400
If the Spirit Spring tries to entice you,

512
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,480
Master, just hug me

513
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,070
and kiss me,

514
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,960
so that the Spirit Spring

515
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,810
will have no way to succeed.

516
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,590
You're still such a rascal.

517
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,560
If being a rascal

518
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,290
can make you smile happily, Master,

519
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,720
shouldn't I be even more of a rascal?

520
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,590
Besides,

521
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,440
our hearts are already in sync.

522
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,590
You're mine, Master.

523
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,620
I can kiss you whenever I want.

524
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,580
You're right.

525
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,680
In that case,

526
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,080
may I have

527
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,110
my token of love back?

528
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,550
Token of love?

529
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,500
Master, you mean

530
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,880
the wooden hairpin I made from the Divine Tree?

531
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:02,920
Exactly.

532
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,240
When you gave it to me,

533
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,590
I was drunk and not clear-headed.

534
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,890
I didn't know who it was from.

535
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,030
I guessed it was you,

536
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,550
but I missed the chance to ask you.

537
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,680
I had kept that hairpin in my room all along,

538
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,310
but Mu Ranwu took it.

539
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,070
It wasn't what I intended.

540
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,950
If this wooden hairpin

541
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,000
gets taken

542
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,960
by someone else again,

543
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,350
I won't care what the reason is.

544
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,350
I'll only hold you responsible.

545
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,400
It won't happen.

546
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,350
I will keep it safe and sound.

547
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:43,870
Slow down.

548
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,720
If you get hurt now,

549
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,830
it will take a long time to heal.

550
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,550
The wind is strong by the sea.

551
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,440
Hold onto me.

552
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,540
I'll channel spiritual power throughout your body.

553
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,720
It will help you resist the wind and cold.

554
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,070
Holding Master's hand,

555
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,510
how could I not be willing?

556
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,020
It's still here.

557
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,650
We've reached the far reaches of the East Sea,

558
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,430
the Sea of Immortality.

559
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,720
The Divine Dragon Island is not far ahead.

560
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,670
The Divine Dragon Island is under the jurisdiction of the Immortal Realm.

561
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,920
It's one of the passages from the Immortal Realm to the mortal world.

562
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,440
With the coverage of the barrier,

563
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,720
outsiders can't see or enter it.

564
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,200
It has divine dragon bloodline,

565
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,110
so surely it can pass through.

566
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,640
I told it to leave earlier,

567
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,790
but it was reluctant to go.

568
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,640
Why haven't you gone home yet?

569
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,440
Have you been waiting for us all this time?

570
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,400
How did you know I was hungry?

571
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,880
This should be its token of gratitude.

572
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,750
I fed it some

573
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,750
Sanity Pills you made some time ago.

574
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,310
This dragon fell into

575
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,480
the hands of ill-intentioned people from a young age.

576
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,750
They never taught it right from wrong,

577
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,640
only hastening the maturation of its spiritual power.

578
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,220
It inevitably developed some devilish nature.

579
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,880
Your Sanity Pills

580
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,920
can eliminate its devilish nature.

581
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,210
It seems

582
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,270
the effect is quite good.

583
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,070
Master, you're so considerate.

584
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,740
However,

585
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,230
you should go home now.

586
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,000
When you arrive home, you'll have many

587
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,760
companions.

588
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,750
You should spend more time with your companions

589
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,480
and learn how to be a proper dragon.

590
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,590
Don't fall into the hands of bad people again.

591
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,040
If it weren't for you, Master,

592
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,720
I'm afraid I wouldn't have been able to fulfill

593
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,230
my promise to Dragon Mother, Meng Zhang.

594
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,880
Thank you, Master.

595
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,590
What you care about

596
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,350
is what I care about.

597
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,400
From now on, don't ever say thank you to me again.

598
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,510
I'm really hungry.

599
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,160
It's time to prepare a feast.

600
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:46,880
However,

601
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,560
if you keep

602
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,400
holding my hand, Master,

603
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,270
I won't be able to prepare the ingredients.

604
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,750
You've just recovered.

605
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,920
Don't exert yourself.

606
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,160
Come on.

607
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,110
Sit here.

608
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,180
If you want to eat,

609
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,140
I'll cook for you.

610
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,310
Can you handle it, Master?

611
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,550
Why are you doubting me?

612
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,200
It's just cooking a meal.

613
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,920
Is it that difficult?

614
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:21,730
I...

615
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,620
♫Gradually gravitate toward you by love♫

616
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,480
I can use some guidance.

617
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:31,520
♫Words are too weak to tell the whole story♫

618
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:36,330
♫Only after I met you♫

619
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:44,470
♫Did I realize there are heaven-like places all because of you♫

620
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,760
♫Maybe a lifetime is too short, too fleeting♫

621
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:55,020
♫So we were granted a second chance♫

622
00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:00,530
♫With endless time to write our story♫

623
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,900
♫We fulfill the vow forged through many lifetimes♫

624
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:10,550
♫From now onwards♫

625
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,130
Master, you once asked me

626
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,920
what kind of life I wanted.

627
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,720
I think

628
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,750
the life we're living now is good enough.

629
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,820
To be with the one I love,

630
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,440
savoring three meals a day,

631
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,920
enjoying beautiful scenery,

632
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,020
no need for immortality or riches,

633
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,390
just growing old together like this. That's all I want.

634
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,830
But there's no rush.

635
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,920
Only when this world is at peace

636
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,710
can my dream come true.

637
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,930
After sealing the Spirit Spring,

638
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,000
solving

639
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,310
the big trouble that threatens

640
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,110
my peaceful future,

641
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,550
we can talk about it then.

642
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,590
Ranran.

643
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,520
I know you want to go with me

644
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,270
to the netherworld.

645
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,440
But the current condition of your Spirit Root...

646
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,200
Master.

647
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:10,880
I once said

648
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,280
that I wanted to change to the path of talisman cultivation.

649
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,790
It wasn't on a whim.

650
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,680
Do you remember, Master,

651
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,640
the technique I created by myself in the past?

652
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,590
One wisp of qi to break the galaxy?

653
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,160
The more I remember,

654
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,400
the clearer I become.

655
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,310
One wisp of qi to break the galaxy

656
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,720
includes talisman array methods.

657
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,920
Besides, to make it

658
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,110
exert its strongest power,

659
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
it doesn't require

660
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,550
the primal power of the Spirit Root.

661
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,640
The five elements of the universe,

662
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,270
wind, rain, thunder, lightning, and mist,

663
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,890
or metal, wood, water, fire, and earth,

664
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,640
are all sources of power.

665
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,590
I borrow qi from the universe.

666
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,790
The universe enters my heart.

667
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,720
One wisp of qi...

668
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,680
Break the galaxy!

669
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,880
I see.

670
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,930
It's drawing power from nature

671
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,070
to cultivate the original foundation.

672
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,510
But later on,

673
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,690
we became increasingly reliant on

674
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,550
our own innate qualities

675
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,640
and spiritual power talents,

676
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,510
losing sight of what's truly important.

677
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,800
We no longer have the energy

678
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,960
to harness the power of nature.

679
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,590
I'm just not very skilled at it.

680
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,880
If I practice more,

681
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,380
I'll definitely get better and better.

682
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,920
The power of the universe

683
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,720
is even more vast and endless

684
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,750
than the primal power.

685
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,000
Master.

686
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,270
Believe in me.

687
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,590
I can really do it.

688
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,070
Of course I believe in you.

689
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,310
So don't say things like

690
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,540
I can't go to the netherworld anymore.

691
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,830
The Heavenly Bottle has broken.

692
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,310
You've been guarding against the Spirit Spring day and night without rest.

693
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
It's really exhausting.

694
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,880
Although this small island is nice,

695
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,400
we need to go and do what's important now.

696
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,860
Yes. It's time for us to leave.

697
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:07,830
Third Prince.

698
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,000
How dare you!

699
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,830
I've come by His Majesty's verbal order,

700
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,590
specifically bringing the royal

701
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,310
physician Chen

702
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,480
to check on the Crown Prince.

703
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,520
How dare you

704
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,920
obstruct us?

705
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,930
[Jingyang Hall]

706
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,730
Third Brother, you're here.

707
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,610
Come on, invite him in.

708
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,750
A few days ago, above my Eastern Palace,

709
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,070
a dragon's shadow appeared.

710
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,800
The news spread like wildfire.

711
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,550
All sorts of rumors arose.

712
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,130
The court ministers were so concerned

713
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,030
that they frequently came to visit.

714
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,360
I indeed have been

715
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,190
somewhat exhausted from dealing with them.

716
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,160
That's why I had them stop everyone who came to visit me.

717
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,270
I didn't expect you to come today.

718
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,600
Since Father has sent

719
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,590
a royal physician for you,

720
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,000
Brother,

721
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,130
don't let

722
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,510
Father's kind intentions go to waste.

723
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,400
Royal Physician Chen.

724
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,240
Please proceed.

725
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,350
How is it?

726
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,840
His Highness's pulse is strong,

727
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,510
steady and powerful.

728
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,969
It indicates abundant qi and blood,

729
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,800
which is a sign of good health.

730
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,360
This old servant will report back to His Majesty

731
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,770
to put His Majesty's mind at ease.

732
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,190
Thank you for your trouble, Royal Physician Chen.

733
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,610
After worshiping the universe at the Imperial Ancestral Temple today,

734
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,540
I will personally enter the palace

735
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,420
to see Father.

736
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:37,070
[Jingyang Hall]

737
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,440
Reversal Pill.

738
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,230
Give me another Reversal Pill.

739
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,469
Hurry up.

740
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,150
I've already informed Your Highness that

741
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,000
the Reversal Pill

742
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,210
forcefully boosts your body's vital energy

743
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,110
at the cost of

744
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,880
rapidly depleting it.

745
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,960
Your Highness, you took the Reversal Pill

746
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,400
to deal with the Third Prince's probing

747
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,540
and pacify the people.

748
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,220
It's already the worst strategy.

749
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,220
Then what's a good strategy?

750
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,980
You failed to exchange my body.

751
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,080
As for Su Yishui and Xue Ranran,

752
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,400
you didn't bring either of them back,

753
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,440
and you even let Zhou Feihua be kidnapped.

754
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,510
Tell me, what are you capable of?

755
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,710
The disciples of Wester Sect kidnapped Zhou Feihua

756
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,280
and immediately left the capital.

757
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,280
Their direction was clear,

758
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,630
which indicates they've already made contact with

759
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Su Yishui and Xue Ranran.

760
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,500
As for the Spirit Spring,

761
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,320
it seems it hasn't possessed

762
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,460
Su Yishui's body.

763
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,800
However,

764
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,410
they'll definitely make a trip to the netherworld

765
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,860
to return the Spirit Spring.

766
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,000
That will be my opportunity,

767
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,980
and Your Highness's opportunity as well.

768
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,320
What do you mean?

769
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,060
In the netherworld,

770
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,290
there's an even more powerful master.

771
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,550
He can surely subdue Su Yishui.

772
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,880
If we can find him,

773
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,280
then, Your Highness,

774
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,600
you won't need to transform into a demon by the Seven Evil Transformation Spell,

775
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,880
nor possess anyone's body.

776
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,440
You can still achieve your wishes.

777
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,680
[Inn]

778
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,440
They should be arriving soon, right?

779
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,190
You cold?

780
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,630
No need to go through all that trouble.

781
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,510
A simple hug will do, Master.

782
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,960
Qingge.

783
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,440
Feihua.

784
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,310
Is it my ears playing tricks on me,

785
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,500
or my eyes?

786
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,880
What did Concubine Zhou just call Ranran?

787
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,740
Qing... Ge?

788
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,070
As in Qingge from the name Mu Qingge?

789
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,110
That's right.

790
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,880
Ranran is Mu Qingge.

791
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,670
Su Yishui.

792
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,400
Stay away from Qingge.

793
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,800
Are you trying to take advantage of her

794
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
loss of memories of the past

795
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,330
to deceive her again?

796
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,770
Feihua.

797
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,920
Don't be like this.

798
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,000
Master won't harm me.

799
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Besides, between me and him,

800
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,830
I was the one who fell in love first.

801
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,050
You don't remember

802
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,150
what kind of person Su Yishui is.

803
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,550
Let me remind you.

804
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,110
At that time,

805
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,850
on the battlefield of FanYao,

806
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,880
I was with my father in the military camp.

807
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,150
You came to find me, severely wounded.

808
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,000
The Spirit Spring in your body couldn't be suppressed.

809
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,520
You said some

810
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,510
unconscious ramblings to me.

811
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,760
Su Yishui is the Demon's child.

812
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,590
You only got possessed by the Spirit Spring

813
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,800
because you tried to save him.

814
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,030
You're talking nonsense!

815
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,360
Su Yishui.

816
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,920
Even the people around you

817
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,450
don't know your true identity?

818
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,510
Back then,

819
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,360
you used the pretense of

820
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,060
eliminating evil for the greater good

821
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,500
and caused Qingge's death.

822
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,090
Master didn't do that.

823
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,640
He was just mistaken

824
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,630
and failed to rescue me in time.

825
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,590
You believe what he says?

826
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,670
All these years,

827
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,110
you've allowed people to slander Qingge,

828
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,650
calling her the Demon's child who brought calamity,

829
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,690
yet you never clarified the truth.

830
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,440
What else do you have to say?

831
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,710
Qingge.

832
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,190
You still can't see the truth?

833
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,330
She's right.

834
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:09,670
I...

835
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,510
You didn't finish your sentence.

836
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,360
You're not going to deny it again, are you?

837
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,800
It's not like that.

838
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
There's a spell.

839
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,980
It's the Silencing Curse.

840
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,760
It was me who cast it on you back then

841
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,250
to prevent you from mentioning

842
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,150
the truth about the Demon's child.

843
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,970
I've always wanted to tell

844
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,030
everyone the truth.

845
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,230
I know.

846
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,550
Qingge.

847
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,190
Stop being foolish.

848
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,230
This person doesn't deserve your trust.

849
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,110
Master is the Demon's child,

850
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,660
destined from birth,

851
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,710
not by his own will.

852
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,320
It's like the little dragon we saved

853
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,710
in the capital,

854
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,460
forced into existence by evil people,

855
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,590
yet no one cared for it.

856
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,800
That's why it developed demonic nature.

857
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,250
If only someone

858
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,510
had shown him a righteous path.

859
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,160
For over a decade,

860
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,670
until now,

861
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,670
Master has been quietly making amends

862
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,550
for all the past misunderstandings and mistakes.

863
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,410
The past is already in the past.

864
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,400
Let's all move on.

865
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:34,920
Master.

866
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,440
Go back to your room first.

867
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:51,880
Feihua.

868
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,000
You better not regret it.

869
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,920
I never do things I'll regret.

870
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,960
You're still the same you after all.

871
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
Reliving your life,

872
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,550
falling in love with the same person,

873
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,000
and walking down the same path.

874
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,360
It's as if

875
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,400
everything was arranged.

876
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,110
Immortal?

877
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,470
Why is there an immortal in the netherworld?

878
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:19,670
What's wrong?

879
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,030
You said I was severely injured

880
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,030
and unable to suppress the Spirit Spring.

881
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,000
Who caused my injury?

882
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,440
I asked you

883
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,280
if it was Su Yishui who hurt you.

884
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,400
You said it wasn't him,

885
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,070
but you didn't tell me who it was.

886
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,030
Oh, right.

887
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,050
When you were babbling nonsense,

888
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,190
I remember you said something like

889
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,240
you wouldn't let the ending come true,

890
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,480
as if you had already known

891
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,150
something extraordinary

892
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,110
would happen.

893
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,110
By the way,

894
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,920
this is what you asked me

895
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,230
to get from Su Yu's study.

896
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,610
[Xuantian Teachings]

897
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:50,880
Thank you.

898
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,210
I hope this book can be of use to you

899
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,400
and help you find the entrance to the netherworld.

900
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,120
If it's truly as you say,

901
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,710
Su Yishui

902
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,630
is willing to return the Spirit Spring to the netherworld,

903
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,320
then it would be a blessing for the universe.

904
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,040
Otherwise...

905
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:04,710
He will.

906
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,680
I was captured this time,

907
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,590
and the Zhou family's property was also confiscated.

908
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,110
Fortunately, Su Yishui had planned ahead

909
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,780
and safely transferred my family

910
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,090
out of the capital.

911
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,590
For this matter,

912
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,740
I should thank him properly.

913
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,400
My father has taken my family

914
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,440
to live in seclusion back in my hometown.

915
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,860
So of course, I should go and reunite with them.

916
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,960
It's our fault that our affairs implicated you.

917
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,800
I'm sorry, Feihua.

918
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,440
It's not your fault.

919
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,110
Su Yu and I,

920
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,710
as well as the Zhou family,

921
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,840
would have faced this sooner or later anyway.

922
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,820
Su Yu's ambition is the universe.

923
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,960
Serving a ruler is like living with a tiger.

924
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,670
Moreover,

925
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,410
it's a

926
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,000
vicious tiger which has been driven to desperation.

927
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,590
Feihua...

928
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,630
But as you said,

929
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,920
it's all in the past now.

930
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,220
Since he has changed,

931
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,190
I should also let it go

932
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,400
and live my own life.

933
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,590
Feihua.

934
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,510
Keep these talismans

935
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,550
for emergencies.

936
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,770
If there's anything you can't handle,

937
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,480
come to Mount Wester to find me anytime.

938
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,030
Take care.

939
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,550
Take care.
