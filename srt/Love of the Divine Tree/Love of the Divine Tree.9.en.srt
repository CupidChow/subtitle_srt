22
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,630
Is Master

23
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,150
seriously injured?

24
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,000
It's all your fault.

25

Guardian ends up with a few more wounds.

30

31
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,020

32
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,420

33

34

I really failed as your disciple.

35
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,380
Master,

36
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,130
this is Red-flame Centipede's blood,

37

39
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,450
It'll taste fishy if it cools down.

40
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,820
Just some minor wounds.

41
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,329

42

43
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,490
No way those are just minor wounds!

I'm an orphan.

45
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,300
I've seen the cold and warm sides of human nature since young.

46
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,650
Even if someone gives me a bowl of porridge,

47
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,170
it's just out of sympathy.

48
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,820
No one has ever

49

to stand up and protect me.

53
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,210
I wasn't willing to become

54

55

But from now on,

56
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,290
I will strictly follow your teachings

57
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,620

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,810
Even the same pill's function

192
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,090
may vary greatly

193
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,860
depending on the maker.

194
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,340
Your Grandmaster

195
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,860
used to be a genius in alchemy.

196
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,340
The pills she made

197
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,860
not only boasted

198
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,050
maximum medicinal functions

199
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,570
but also had

200
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,690
some unexpected properties.

201
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:34,860
Ranran,

202
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,290
your spiritual energy has finally stabilized.

203
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,100
Not bad.

204
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,500
Continue.

205
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,220
According to the book,

206
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,620
the Sanity Pill should be golden.

207
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,620
How did you make red ones?

208
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,030
Did I make any mistakes?

209
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,650
Smells so good!

210
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,290
There's a savory aroma.

211
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,980
It tastes like buns stuffed with soup!

212
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,160
It's Ranran's first try.

213
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,020
I must give it a shot.

214
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,170
Xi...

215
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,530
It's delicious, Ranran!

216
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,570
Enjoy them yourselves.

217
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,640
I'm sitting this one out.

218
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,140
Master!

219
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,980
Master!

220
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,020
Master,

221
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,890
bad news!

222
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,460
Something's wrong!

223
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:02,980
Xi'er!

224
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,340
Stop eating! You'll get sick from it!

225
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,340
Stop eating, both of you.

226
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,140
Master!

227
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:10,890
Are you alright?

228
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,650
I'm fine.

229
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,380
Please save Senior Baishan and Xi'er.

230
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,290
Don't eat it!

231
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,050
That's raw meat.

232
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,250
You'll get a stomachache.

233
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,500
Xi'er!

234
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,420
Don't eat it!

235
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,340
Stop!

236
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,220
What's going on here?

237
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,850
I don't know either.

238
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:32,890
They ate

239
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,340
the Sanity Pills I made

240
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,890
and then ended up like this.

241
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,170
What were you thinking

242
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:47,970
while making the pills?

243
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,260
Your thoughts

244
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,500
even affected the function of the Sanity Pills.

245
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,260
You were really so into it.

246
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,930
Although I don't force you to restrain yourself,

247
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,690
you are still a cultivator after all.

248
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,500
It's improper to be obsessed with food and drink

249
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,260
all day long,

250
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,740
How are you doing?

251
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,570
Are you feeling any better?

252
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,340
It's okay, Ranran.

253
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,810
Master said we

254
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,110
just had an eating disorder.

255
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,500
We'll be fine after taking the medicine.

256
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,170
Ranran,

257
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,980
the Sanity Pills you put so much effort into

258
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,650
had a really strong aftereffect.

259
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,620
Seems like you do have

260
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,260
some talent for alchemy

261
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,530
despite

262
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,380
the unexpected functions.

263
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,860
Talent for alchemy?

264
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,650
I'd say it's more like a talent for causing trouble.

265
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,740
I'm sorry for frightening everyone this time.

266
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,260
I've made a jar

267
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,690
of grape and coix seed wine to help digestion

268
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,100
and make up for you.

269
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,410
-It smells so good, Ranran.
-It smells so good, Ranran.

270
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,050
When it comes to culinary pleasures,

271
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,570
you truly carry out our Grandmaster's

272
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,530
sect motto,

273
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,050
"Delicacies are worthy of delving into!"

274
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,770
Do you think that's a compliment?

275
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,650
Even good wine can't stop you from talking nonsense.

276
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,570
Just shut up.

277
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,770
Come on...

278
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,089
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

279
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,140
I worked so hard to prepare the food,

280
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,310
yet you haven't even taken a bite!

281
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,420
And there's so much wine left!

282
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,260
Guys...

283
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,829
I'll send some to Mr. Zeng

284
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:27,500
and the others.

285
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,089
-Okay.
-Okay.

286
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,380
Master?

287
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,850
What's inside?

288
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,960
It's the food and wine

289
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,900
for Mr. Zeng

290
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,740
and Ms. Yu Tong,

291
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:56,980
Leave it here.

292
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,810
No way.

293
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,100
The pills I made

294
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,660
even caused Master to break his fast?

295
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,360
Didn't expect my Sanity Pills

296
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,260
to cause that trouble.

297
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,530
I'm so sorry.

298
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:08,740
It's alright.

299
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:10,610
Breaking a fast

300
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,460
is not really

301
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,290
a big deal.

302
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:15,660
You can tell a lot about

303
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,610
a pill's maker from the way it works.

304
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,090
You were never really

305
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,180
a person detached from desires.

306
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,630
You've always loved the worldly pleasures.

307
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,130
Come to think of it, it's not surprising.

308
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,460
Don't just stand there.

309
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,590
Sit down and eat with me.

310
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,130
Okay!

311
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:30,660
Master,

312
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,250
these butterfly shrimp are the best.

313
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,570
Why aren't you drinking?

314
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,750
Actually, I already

315
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,050
had a few sips.

316
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,090
Master.

317
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,130
Let me tell you a secret.

318
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,220
Every time I drink too much,

319
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,050
the plants I touch

320
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,420
grow wildly all of a sudden

321
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,570
to be even taller than houses.

322
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,260
When I was

323
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,260
back in the village,

324
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,350
I scared my friends with it.

325
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:20,980
Since then,

326
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,530
no matter how good the wine is,

327
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,420
I don't dare to drink too much

328
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,530
as I want to avoid similar weird incidents.

329
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,050
Fill it up.

330
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,610
I'm here with you.

331
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:47,810
There's no weird incident

332
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,770
that I can't handle.

333
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:52,940
Just drink as you please.

334
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,420
It's so good!

335
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,180
Would you like to try some, Master?

336
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,940
I may not be good at other stuff,

337
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,500
but I'm quite confident

338
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,850
in my wine-making skills.

339
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,260
No, thanks.

340
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,410
It just occurred to me that

341
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,180
you can't hold your liquor.

342
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,880
In that case,

343
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,900
it's all mine now.

344
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,850
No one's fighting you for it.

345
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:45,980
Master,

346
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,090
I'm not scared.

347
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,740
Even if you're turned

348
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,530
into a monster by the curse,

349
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,260
I wouldn't be scared.

350
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,770
Because I know,

351
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,810
Master,

352
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,980
you are still you.

353
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,740
Master, you once asked me

354
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,700
what I was thinking

355
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,770
while making the pills.

356
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,130
I was thinking

357
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,460
if only I could remove

358
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,940
the curse on your face.

359
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,340
I know I'm not that capable now.

360
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:28,930
But one day

361
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,660
when I have enough spiritual power,

362
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,200
I will definitely make a pill

363
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,700
that can break the curse on your face.

364
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,020
Master,

365
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,020
I've always had a question.

366
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,740
I'm cultivating for Ling Xiao.

367
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,260
But

368
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,330
given your

369
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,290
overwhelming power,

370
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,030
you still practice diligently every day.

371
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,570
What is it for?

372
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,330
Because of a person.

373
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,740
I made some mistakes in the past.

374
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,770
I want to make amends for these wrongdoings.

375
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,250
Then do you

376
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,930
hate that person who made you

377
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,570
do the wrong things?

378
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,830
Without my permission,

379
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,860
she took the fall for me on her own.

380
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:42,940
Of course,

381
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,330
I hate her.

382
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,760
But why

383
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,340
do I see a trace of sorrow

384
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,650
in your eyes?

385
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,420
Nonsense.

386
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,740
Xi'er said

387
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,370
you always have

388
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,920
a certain tension

389
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,570
like a tightly strung string.

390
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,050
People who are too tense

391
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,940
can get exhausted easily.

392
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,200
Why don't you try a bite

393
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,370
of the sweet and sour yam I made

394
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,290
for some sweetness

395
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,330
and smile a little?

396
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,570
From now on,

397
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,220
we'll only taste sweetness, not bitterness.

398
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,700
Shui,

399
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
stay with me at Mount Wester from now on

400
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,770
and enjoy a lifetime of happiness.

401
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,470
Master...

402
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,900
Your face...

403
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,700
The curse on you is dissipating.

404
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,770
Ranran helped me break the curse?

405
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,050
Little junior!

406
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,610
Ranran!

407
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,400
My little junior!

408
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,230
Xue Ranran!

409
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,220
Where is she?

410
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:52,740
Where are you?

411
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,700
Xue Ranran!

412
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,700
Ranran!

413
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,050
Ran...

414
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:58,810
How did the flowers on the tree

415
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,810
grow all the way there?

416
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,460
Never mind.

417
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,370
Let's find Ranran first,

418
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,810
lest she causes trouble again

419
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,770
and drags us into it.

420
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,020
Xue Ranran!

421
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,610
Ranran!

422
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,980
-Ranran!
-Ranran!

423
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,050
Master,

424
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,090
I think they've left.

425
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,530
Did you

426
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:25,890
♫After parting, the black silk-like hair turned snow-white♫

427
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,420
recall anything?

428
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,850
Recall what?

429
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,660
♫In secret, I've been missing you, dreaming about you for years♫

430
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,500
I've always said Master has the features of beauty,

431
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,820
♫Awaiting the destined love, a déjà vu so real♫

432
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,940
and would surely be exceptionally handsome.

433
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:44,100
♫I'd trade three lifetimes of grandeur for your one fleeting bliss♫

434
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,940
I just didn't expect

435
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,700
you to be so stunningly gorgeous.

436
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,530
You're drunk.

437
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,960
♫Gradually gravitate toward you by love♫

438
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,740
Master, look!

439
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:55,850
♫Words are too weak to tell the whole story♫

440
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:55,810
Oh, no.

441
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,670
♫Only after I met you♫

442
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,500
Master,

443
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,430
I think I'm losing control.

444
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:08,800
♫Did I realize there are heaven-like places all because of you♫

445
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,850
I think I'm really drunk.

446
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,660
♫Just because I'm destined to reunite with you again♫

447
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,330
Master...

448
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:18,940
♫Intertwined fates throughout reincarnation♫

449
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,720
You're so nice.

450
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:24,690
♫With endless time to write our story♫

451
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,460
You're wrong

452
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,930
♫We fulfill the vow forged through many lifetimes♫

453
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,820
I'm not a good person

454
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:34,420
♫From now onwards♫

455
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,700
Once you recall everything,

456
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,260
you won't forgive me.

457
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,670
[Su Yishui's Consciousness]

458
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,770
Where am I?

459
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,290
How did I end up here?

460
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,050
Who's there?

461
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,370
Ranran?

462
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,260
Why is she in my consciousness?

463
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,550
Oh, so he's your soul owner.

464
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,020
And I'm in his consciousness.

465
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,850
Could it be that my cultivation worked,

466
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,800
and I opened up the connection between you?

467
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,900
Who is he?

468
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,940
Do I know him?

469
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,330
You don't remember?

470
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,570
Why is he trapped in this icy prison

471
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,460
as if he's encaging himself?

472
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,420
Can you hear me?

473
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,370
Your spiritual soul is here!

474
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,050
Look!

475
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:51,980
I'm not sure

476
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,610
if you can hear me speaking.

477
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,570
But I still want to say thank you.

478
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,670
Thank you for sending your spiritual soul to protect me.

479
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,940
I will definitely protect Ling Xiao well.

480
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:00,980
One day,

481
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,770
I will surely

482
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,940
return it to you safe and intact.

483
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,330
At that time,

484
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,090
I'll thank you properly in person.

485
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,600
Why

486
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,800
does he look as lonely as Master?

487
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,660
Although it's our first meeting,

488
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,610
I feel quite familiar with you.

489
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,460
We must have some sort of fate.

490
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,460
Are you

491
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,810
my dad?

492
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:36,610
Fine.

493
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,720
I don't know why

494
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,330
you're trapping yourself

495
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,750
in this icy wilderness.

496
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,260
You must be very bored.

497
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,500
How about I stick around and talk with you for a bit?

498
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,370
I have a secret

499
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,980
that I can't keep to myself anymore.

500
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,740
I must tell someone.

501
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,130
I'll share it with you secretly.

502
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,700
My master is so handsome.

503
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,880
He's the most

504
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,180
handsome man in the world.

505
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,090
But I wouldn't dare

506
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,810
say these words to him.

507
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,220
I can only tell you.

508
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,420
My master's eyes are so bright

509
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,610
like stars in the highest sky.

510
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,570
Master's nose is high and straight,

511
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,260
like a steep mountain peak,

512
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,020
majestic and towering,

513
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,090
making his profile look fabulous.

514
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,740
As good-looking

515
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,980
as he is, I wonder what kind of woman

516
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,200
in the world

517
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,260
could be a match for him.

518
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,020
Ling Xiao, Ling Xiao.

519
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,660
Did I really enter

520
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,020
your consciousness just now?

521
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,500
I was not dreaming?

522
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,800
Master said cultivation could nourish Ling Xiao.

523
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,850
Could it be that my spiritual power

524
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,090
has improved a bit recently,

525
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,530
awakening your spiritual consciousness?

526
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,290
Master didn't lie to me!

527
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,660
Master?

528
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,050
Oh, no!

529
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,130
I actually got blotto

530
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:20,860
in front of Master

531
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,310
and even conjured vines

532
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,370
to trap him!

533
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,610
What now?

534
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,660
Su Yishui!

535
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,960
It's not what you think.

536
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,130
No more excuses.

537
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,850
You said you kept Master

538
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,420
at Mount Wester to cure her.

539
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,740
I think you're clearly up to something else!

540
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,620
You just want to take advantage of her amnesia

541
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,090
to make her rely on you.

542
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,610
So when Master recalls everything,

543
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,810
she won't hold a grudge against you anymore, right?

544
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,740
Do you think I have no idea

545
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,050
about your feelings for Master in the past?

546
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,290
You're simply

547
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,530
taking advantage of her not knowing anything.

548
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:58,940
You're overthinking it.

549
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,900
I've already picked up the Unfeeling Mantra.

550
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,410
I cannot fall in love,

551
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,530
and nor will I.

552
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,940
I don't believe you.

553
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,410
You're just a maniac.

554
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,360
You even dared to split your own core.

555
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,180
Perhaps you'd rather endure

556
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,420
the pain of the Ice Lotus Technique's backlash

557
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,710
to get what you want.

558
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,770
Even if the Ice Lotus's backlash can't stop me,

559
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,290
do you think I would ignore

560
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,040
Master's last wish?

561
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,390
You mean

562
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,610
sealing the Spirit Spring?

563
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,770
This is what I owe her.

564
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,020
I must pull it off.

565
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,960
Sealing the Spirit Spring

566
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,050
requires power at the Transcendence Realm.

567
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,700
Indulging in love would cause the power to dissipate.

568
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,570
So what you're worried about

569
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,460
will never happen.

570
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,090
Instead of keeping an eye on me,

571
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,330
you'd better think more about

572
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,350
how to break the Soul-Devouring Lock.

573
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,130
Fine!

574
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,900
I'll trust you one more time.

575
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,940
But you must keep your word.

576
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,770
And I'll be always watching you.

577
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,980
Hope Master will forgive me

578
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,850
for the sake

579
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:17,940
of the delicious food

580
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,340
Ranran.

581
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,980
Where are you going with that food box?

582
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,690
I'm going to deliver food to Master.

583
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,460
Delivering food to Master?

584
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,350
Ranran,

585
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,420
are you still drunk?

586
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,580
No, I'm not!

587
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,770
Sink or swim, it all depends on this attempt.

588
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,660
Ranran, you're amazing.

589
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,330
You even made Master break her fast.

590
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,630
I did more than that, actually.

591
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,410
I even broke the curse on Master.

592
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,180
The merits and faults balance out.

593
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,090
Seems like

594
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,570
Master not only won't punish me

595
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,570
but might even reward me.

596
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,260
Xue Ranran,

597
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,810
the Guardian wants you to go to the Ice Lotus Pool.

598
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,570
Mu Ranwu is about to be born.

599
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,850
Must crack the Soul-Devouring Lock as soon as we can.

600
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,490
The good thing is that Ranran's been working hard these days

601
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,850
to stabilize her heart.

602
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,020
No time to waste.

603
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,020
Let's remove it right now.

604
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,660
Okay.

605
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,370
Oh, no!

606
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,460
How could this happen?

607
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,480
Her heart hasn't been fully fixed yet.

608
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,130
We underestimated its power.

609
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,480
This Soul-Devouring Lock is like a bottomless pit.

610
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,860
No stable heart,

611
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,340
no way to crack the Soul-Devouring Lock.

612
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,730
If the Lock's not removed,

613
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:19,980
the heart can't be stabilized.

614
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,940
It's a dead end either way.

615
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:22,570
Well...

616
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:23,820
What should we do?

617
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,690
We don't necessarily have to crack

618
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,570
the Lock through Ranran.

619
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,730
You mean

620
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:34,780
we can find a solution through Mu Ranwu?

621
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,570
Mu Ranwu is about to be born.

622
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,409
Let's go to Mount Absolute together.

623
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:39,940
Besides removing the Soul-Devouring Lock,

624
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:40,900
I have also

625
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,860
prepared a surprise for her.

626
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:42,980
A surprise?

627
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,730
18 years ago,

628
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,170
she had already planned

629
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,460
to steal Mu Qingge's spiritual power.

630
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,460
On the Reincarnation Tree,

631
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,780
she didn't leave Mu Qingge any chance to survive.

632
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,760
You still

633
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,860
can't see through her ambition?

634
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,340
She wants to become Mu Qingge.

635
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,050
Why don't we fulfill her wish

636
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,570
and let her have this identity?

637
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,020
Does she think being Mu Qingge

638
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,940
is really that easy?

639
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,280
Hope she doesn't regret it too quickly.

640
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,020
Speaking of which,

641
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,250
before Master passed away,

642
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,820
her biggest worry was the Spirit Spring.

643
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,050
So she asked you

644
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,170
to seal it back in the netherworld.

645
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,050
Although before your seclusion,

646
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,610
you set up

647
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,690
many talismans in the mortal world

648
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,500
to monitor the Spirit Spring,

649
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:17,730
the Yin Eye Stone

650
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,020
still hasn't shown any response.

651
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,570
The whereabouts of the Spirit Spring

652
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,530
still remain unknown.

653
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,130
Since we have

654
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,130
no clues,

655
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,050
maybe we should get help from others.

656
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:27,940
I've got other plans

657
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,340
for this trip up the mountain.

658
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:41,340
Go.

659
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,210
-Yet.
-Yes.

660
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,530
Elder Tu,

661
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,780
what are you doing?

662
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,040
My Lord,

663
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:54,980
I'm sending them to sneak into

664
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,860
the Heavenly Sects to investigate

665
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,860
and ease your concerns.

666
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,250
Elder Tu,

667
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,210
you do have half of the Scarlet Sect Token,

668
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,610
but that doesn't mean

669
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,610
you can call the shots

670
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,820
without my permission.

671
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:05,570
Remember,

672
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,050
I am the sovereign.

673
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,130
Don't abuse your power

674
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,820
or meddle in things beyond your responsibilities.

675
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,650
I just wanted to make proper arrangements

676
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,940
before reporting to you, My Lord.

677
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,690
Don't bother.

678
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,610
Another fruit is about to fall.

679
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,610
That is our main target.

680
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,460
I've already got a plan.

681
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,380
As for you,

682
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,860
you just need to follow my orders.

683
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,780
Yes, My Lord.

684
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,090
When the time comes,

685
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,860
I'll go up the mountain to try them first.

686
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,630
You lead our men and wait at the foot of the mountain,

687
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,210
awaiting my signal.

688
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:39,650
Yes, My Lord.

689
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,860
The Reincarnation Fruit is about to come into being.

690
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:45,980
Your Highness,

691
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,300
you'll get what you wish for soon enough.

692
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,980
It's a pity that Ranran's missing.

693
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,150
Otherwise, I could bring Qingge's

694
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,050
favorite wine

695
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:57,570
to meet her.

696
00:36:59,500 --> 00:36:59,980
Your Highness,

697
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,980
this is an urgent letter from the capital.

698
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,480
[His Majesty's condition has worsened. The Third Prince contacted the major ministers to impeach the Crown Prince. Dark clouds are gathering over the capital.]

699
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,480
[Your Highness]

700
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,430
Your Highness,

701
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,900
did anything happen in the palace?

702
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,250
It's about my third brother and his men again.

703
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,150
Do they think teaming up with the imperial court's elders

704
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:17,860
can make a difference?

705
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,530
You've governed the state well.

706
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,190
The Third Prince's allies, like Minister Li

707
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:21,780
and Vice Minister Huang,

708
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,880
put in so much effort

709
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,460
and played the tricks

710
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,530
all for nothing.

711
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,630
Do they still have

712
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,780
other schemes or plots?

713
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,900
Father's old illness has worsened.

714
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,230
I couldn't serve him medicine

715
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,130
by his side.

716
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,860
They're using this to make a fuss.

717
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,980
According to the reports from the palace,

718
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,340
His Majesty's condition this time

719
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,250
is indeed quite serious.

720
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,760
If...

721
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,500
If things go wrong...

722
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,420
Your Highness, you'd better return to the capital immediately.

723
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,880
Of all times, why now?

724
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,130
State affairs are the top priority.

725
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,880
Your Highness, you should return to the capital as soon as possible.

726
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:03,900
There's no time to waste.

727
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,940
Not sure

728
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,570
if that Wei Jiu from the Scarlet Sect

729
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,090
was sent by the Third Prince.

730
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,500
Please let us

731
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,570
escort you back.

732
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,690
That'd be safe.

733
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,020
Never mind.

734
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,460
I'll go to pick her up once I wrap up things

735
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,530
in the palace.

736
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,050
The Guardian has gone down the mountain on business.

737
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,780
Today, you will train on your own.

738
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,050
If you have any questions,

739
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:35,860
come to ask me.

740
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,860
Yes, Madam.

741
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:42,980
Heed my command.

742
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:46,690
Take cover from the rain.

743
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,170
Master has gone down the mountain.

744
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,210
Could it be that Grandmaster's really going to be reborn?

745
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,590
What Grandmaster?

746
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,900
Nowadays, the Heavenly Sects

747
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,340
as well as the demonic cultivators of the Scarlet Sect

748
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,460
are all searching for the Spirit Spring.

749
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,250
We Westers

750
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,610
[Work Hard]

751
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,900
better stay away

752
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,730
from Mu Qingge,

753
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,300
that demoness.

754
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,860
They all say that Grandmaster...

755
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,140
Mu Qingge.

756
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,250
She summoned the Spirit Spring

757
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,190
and almost caused devastation to all living beings in the world.

758
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,650
But what exactly is this Spirit Spring?

759
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,360
Why does it have such destructive power?

760
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,050
You don't even know that?

761
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,530
The Spirit Spring

762
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,610
is the spiritual sense and power

763
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,570
of the primordial Mortal-Demon Lord.

764
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,580
[Celestial Sect, Mount Red Flame]

765
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:55,940
Hundreds of years ago,

766
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,090
the Immortal Realm launched an all-out attack on the Mortal-Demon Lord.

767
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,420
The Mortal-Demon Lord fled with severe injuries

768
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,780
and hid in the mortal world.

769
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,050
At Mount Red Flame,

770
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,540
he established the Celestial Sect,

771
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,380
Greetings, Sovereign.

772
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,170
leading to the chaos and war clouds caused by a large number of

773
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,520
[Mortal-Demon Lord]

774
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,730
frenetic demonic cultivators,

775
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,090
Fortunately,

776
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,940
a once-in-a-century talent

777
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,130
for immortal cultivation, Dun Tian, showed up

778
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:17,940
in our mortal realm,

779
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,860
who also

780
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,690
founded the Eternal Sect.

781
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,570
Dun Tian led the Heavenly cultivators

782
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,050
to ambush at Mount Red Flame,

783
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,730
destroy the Celestial Sect,

784
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,090
and slay the Mortal-Demon Lord.

785
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,340
That's also how he attained ascension.

786
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,880
But the Mortal-Demon Lord's spiritual sense and power

787
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,210
could not be busted.

788
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,250
The immortals could only join forces

789
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,460
to seal it in the netherworld.

790
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:36,780
And this

791
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,130
is the Spirit Spring.

792
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,690
Only Mu Qingge

793
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,890
could summon

794
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,090
the Spirit Spring as the Demon's child

795
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,900
and maximize

796
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,500
its demonic power.

797
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,960
No wonder the Four Heavenly Sects

798
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,820
are so wary of her.

799
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:57,530
That's right.

800
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,110
If Mu Qingge is reborn,

801
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,020
she will definitely seek revenge on Master.

802
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,590
Will she then extend her hatred

803
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,380
to us as well?

804
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,820
Look at your timidity!

805
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,090
As the saying goes,

806
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,980
evil can never triumph over good.

807
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,110
How could the Heavenly Sects just stand by and see

808
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,500
that demoness, Mu Qingge,

809
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:18,940
kill the innocent at will?

810
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,530
If you're scared,

811
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,460
it's still not too late

812
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,790
for you to leave the mountain and be a coward.

813
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,980
Is that Mu Qingge

814
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,130
really such a terrifying demoness?

816
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,210
So many ancient texts abound.

817
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,210
How long will it take to go through them all?

Spiritual Soul Separation.

819
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,300
Found it.

820
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,820
After being separated, a spiritual soul

821
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,020
still retains fragmented memories of the soul owner.

822
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,570
During the separation,

823
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,050
the memories will gradually fade away.

824
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,680
The shorter the separation, the clearer the memories.

825
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,090
When the separated soul's power is strong enough,

826
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,810
those whose consciousness is connected to it

827
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,300
can glimpse the memories.

Only then will I have a chance to uncover

some memories related to

833
