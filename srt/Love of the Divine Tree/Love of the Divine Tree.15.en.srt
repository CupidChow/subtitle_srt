[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,990
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,840
Let me ask you.

4
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,200
In the past few days,

5
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,950
have you eaten Madam Wu's buns?

6
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,200
I have.

7
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,710
What connection do you have  who

8
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,970
with those Elite Armored Guard

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,759
who have gone missing in the past few days?

10
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,710
Five years ago,

11
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,560
we all served on

12
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,430
a border defence unit

13
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,350
for half a month.

14
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,920
In this unit,

15
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,870
besides you,

16
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,070
how many more are still alive?

17
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,360
There's one more,

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,710
Captain Qin.

19
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,190
Alright.

20
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,000
Join them in death!

21
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,280
Activate the formation.

22
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,120
Yes.

23
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,120
Master,

24
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,470
leave it to me.

25
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,920
What's on her is resentment.

26
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,310
Formations against demons wouldn't work.

27
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,630
Switch to one that works on humans.

28
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,910
From Earth and Thunder to Heaven and Fire!

29
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,310
Obliterate all evil,

30
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,630
four Qi condense!

31
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,960
Coal.

32
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,800
Coal.

33
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,630
Coal.

34
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,829
Coal is indeed a demon.

35
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Everything it did

36
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,830
was to save you.

37
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,000
It discovered early on that the fish demon was harming people.

38
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,800
Damaging the compass

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,040
was also to lure the Immortal Master

40
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,830
to come and save people.

41
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,070
No matter what,

42
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,430
it protected

43
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,120
the person it wanted to protect the most.

44
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,630
Coal

45
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,070
was like family to me.

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,240
Yesterday, when I made you reveal your demon form,

47
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,510
I was really afraid.

48
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,430
I feared you might actually harm people.

49
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,800
But I never thought

50
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
you'd be so foolish.

51
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,070
How could you

52
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,360
risk your life for me?

53
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,270
It's a pity

54
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,720
that we're still short two people.

55
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,270
So it is indeed Madam Wu.

56
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,240
Godmother?

57
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,480
Why is it you?

58
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,390
Don't call me godmother anymore.

59
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,160
Did you really think I opened this inn

60
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,160
to look at you all

61
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,190
reminiscing my son?

62
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,040
Let me tell you.

63
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,390
Every time I see

64
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,420
people from your camp,

65
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,750
I have only one thought.

66
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,830
And that is revenge.

67
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,240
I want to avenge

68
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,720
my son!

69
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,480
Godmother,

70
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,750
Brother Wu's death was an accident!

71
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,190
Back then in the Death Zone,

72
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,390
that giant python was too powerful.

73
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,560
Brother Wu died

74
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,040
because he...

75
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,740
Nonsense!

76
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,430
These are all lies made up by

77
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,270
those people

78
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,270
who harmed my son.

79
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,560
How could it be?

80
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,950
They confessed the truth after drinking,

81
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,450
and I heard it with my own ears.

82
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,560
How could it be fake?

83
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,240
My poor son,

84
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,950
he was only fifteen.

85
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,830
Seeing how hard I worked every day,

86
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,530
washing and cooking,

87
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
he lied about his age

88
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,430
to join the army at Wangxiang Pass,

89
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
just to earn some money

90
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,160
so I wouldn't have to work so hard.

91
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,480
He was still so young.

92
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,040
The armor didn't even fit him properly.

93
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,800
He was so happy when he came back.

94
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,850
He told me

95
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,800
everyone in the camp was kind to him,

96
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,240
and he even gained a few good brothers.

97
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,600
But it was these very brothers

98
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,920
who in the Death Realm

99
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,780
pushed him out to feed the giant python,

100
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,570
stepping on his corpse

101
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,870
to saved their own lives.

102
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,260
Qin Xuanjiu,

103
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,750
although you weren't there that day,

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,390
as an officer,

105
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,480
you let my son meet such an unfortunate end.

106
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,950
You deserve to die too!

107
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,920
Don't think that

108
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,090
showing concern for me every day

109
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,240
and calling me godmother

110
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,920
can compensate for my son's life.

111
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,360
My son's remains

112
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,670
are still left alone in the Death Realm.

113
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,450
If you truly see me as your mother,

114
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,680
why don't you bring him back to me?

115
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,720
I've tried,

116
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,430
but that giant python in the Death Realm...

117
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,830
These are all excuses.

118
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,560
None of you

119
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,390
will help me.

120
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,750
Only immortals will lend me their power.

121
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,030
Immortals?

122
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,270
Yes.

123
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,750
They are

124
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,430
real immortals!

125
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,790
All of you

126
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,150
will eventually be killed by the immortals.

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,670
Godmother!

128
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,120
Where did this rune come from?

129
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,960
If I can't see my son's remains,

130
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,060
no matter what you ask,

131
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,480
I will not

132
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,120
utter

133
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,750
another word.

134
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,490
Could it be that Spirit Spring used this rune

135
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,870
to transfer resentment onto Madam Wu?

136
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,030
The rune truly is Spirit Spring's tactic.

137
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,790
It's almost dawn.

138
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,750
Let's bring her back to the camp first.

139
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,510
Yes, Master.

140
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Su Yishui indeed didn't disappoint me.

141
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,480
The clue to Spirit Spring

142
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,790
is right before our eyes.

143
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,150
What will happen to Madam Wu next?

144
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,840
After all, lives were lost.

145
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,720
The imperial court

146
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,080
will surely send someone to investigate.

147
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,240
Mr. Qin,

148
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,970
Madam Wu's son

149
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,150
was indeed murdered.

150
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,030
Her desire to revenge made her ill-minded,

151
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,270
and caused her to be possessed by an evil spirit.

152
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,910
We need to investigate further

153
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,440
to find out what kind of evil spirit it is

154
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,600
that could amplify a person's resentment

155
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,670
to such an extent.

156
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,840
I know Madam Wu's personality well.

157
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,320
If we couldn't find Brother Wu's remains,

158
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,720
Madam Wu wouldn't reveal.

159
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,240
But the Death Realm

160
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,190
isn't a place we can simply go as we like.

161
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,600
Break!

162
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,390
What's that?

163
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,080
Just a passing spirit creature.

164
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,390
Master,

165
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,750
is it Wei Jiu?

166
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,840
You seem to recognize him.

167
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,520
The incident at Wangxiang Pass

168
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,940
is related to the root of all evil,

169
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,010
the Spirit Spring.

170
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,030
How do you know this?

171
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,510
Since that time at Mount Absolute,

172
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,980
Wei Jiu has been searching for the Spirit Spring.

173
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,510
His sudden appearance here

174
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,120
must also be for the Spirit Spring.

175
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,870
Master,

176
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,120
as your direct disciple,

177
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,270
I'm willing to carry out your will.

178
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,670
I only allow you to investigate

179
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,480
the case at Wangxiang Pass.

180
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,060
The rest is none of your business.

181
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,440
Master, you see,

182
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,310
Wei Jiu has just seen me.

183
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,690
There's no guarantee he won't target me

184
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,440
to threaten you.

185
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,410
Hence,

186
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:16,810
it's better for me to stay by your side

187
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
and investigate the Spirit Spring together.

188
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,670
That way, I'll be safe.

189
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,870
It's actually simple to prevent Wei Jiu from acting.

190
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,150
You just have to return to Mount Wester

191
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,240
once the case is solved.

192
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,270
Su Yishui,

193
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,600
I must collect

194
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,910
the debt you owe.

195
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,600
The Crown Prince has arrived.

196
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,030
Qin Xuanjiu, guard of Wangxiang Pass,

197
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,630
greets Your Highness.

198
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,840
No need for formalities.

199
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,440
Sovereign Su, why brings you here

200
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,840
to Wangxiang Pass?

201
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,030
Young Master Yu,

202
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,220
we descended the mountain for training

203
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,210
and happened to encounter a demon harming people

204
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,410
at Wangxiang Pass,

205
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,030
so we came over.

206
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:56,870
That's perfect.

207
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,600
Our last meeting was brief.

208
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,510
Since you're here for training this time,

209
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,790
you might as well accompany me.

210
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,120
My disciple's training

211
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,080
is naturally with me.

212
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,030
It has nothing to do with Your Highness.

213
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,320
Master,

214
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,360
did you just allow me to accompany you?

215
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,480
Captain Qin,

216
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,280
keep the humans under close watch.

217
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,250
Demons are the ones harming humans,

218
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,360
yet you want to keep the humans under watch?

219
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,200
Feng.

220
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,270
Disciple

221
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,670
pays respects to Master.

222
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,870
Captain Qin is Qingge's disciple?

223
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,840
Yes.

224
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,150
You are...

225
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,840
My name is Qin Xuanjiu.

226
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Twenty years ago,

227
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,600
Master saved my life

228
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,440
on the battlefield.

229
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,750
That's how I became your disciple.

230
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,760
After Master's reincarnation,

231
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,910
I have gone to the palace to look for you.

232
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,670
So you’re the one who only memorized the names of immortal arts

233
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
but never actually learned them?

234
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,510
Yes.

235
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,720
I had too many disciples in my past life.

236
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,600
I can't remember them all.

237
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,410
Since you haven't learned any immortal arts,

238
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,840
you're not considered my disciple.

239
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,440
He's indeed a half-human, half-demon.

240
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,700
He's the person we're looking for.

241
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,750
Since soldiers in the army are killed,

242
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,360
it is a matter for the imperial court.

243
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,440
Guards!

244
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,840
Take the prisoner back to the capital.

245
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,960
Yes.

246
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,790
Wait.

247
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,030
What is your purpose, Sovereign Su?

248
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,800
Evil spirits causing troubles

249
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,960
have always been handled by the Heavenly Gate.

250
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,080
Such a strange case of a half-human, half-demon

251
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,390
furthermore shouldn't be taken lightly.

252
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,390
Crown Prince, you've overstepped your bounds.

253
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,720
Sovereign Su, you may be domineering on Mount Wester,

254
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,340
but in the military camp,

255
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,370
do you have to be so overbearing too?

256
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,760
The Crown Prince says one word

257
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,600
and the person is being taken away.

258
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,960
Who's more overbearing?

259
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,200
Master,

260
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,000
Young Master Yu,

261
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,200
I have a suggestion.

262
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,080
Madam Wu wasn't originally a demon,

263
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,150
but suddenly became

264
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,320
half-human, half-demon.

265
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,570
The urgent matter at hand

266
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,000
is to find out why this happened.

267
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,180
Since Young Master Yu wants to investigate,

268
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,080
and Master wants to investigate too,

269
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,000
why don't we do it here at Wangxiang Pass?

270
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,790
If we could make this clear,

271
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,510
there's no need to distinguish between

272
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,480
the Heavenly Gate and the imperial court.

273
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:13,870
Alright.

274
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,270
We'll do as Ranran suggests.

275
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,960
I hope that within a few days,

276
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,670
there can be some progress.

277
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,430
Don't worry, Yu.

278
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,830
With the Exotic Pavilion here,

279
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,480
with Shui here,

280
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,720
and with me here as well,

281
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,750
we'll surely find a way to make her speak.

282
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,200
Master Mu wants to

283
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,130
force a confession?

284
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,870
What's wrong with that?

285
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,550
Didn't she cause deaths?

286
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,580
I beg for Master's mercy.

287
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,480
Madam Wu was possessed by an evil spirit.

288
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,750
It wasn't her intention.

289
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,120
Madam Wu is physically weak.

290
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,030
She can't endure severe torture.

291
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,910
I told you, I'm not your master.

292
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,870
You're pleading for a demon.

293
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,630
Do you want to be charged with harboring a criminal?

294
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,320
Prepare to interrogate the prisoner.

295
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,080
Yes.

296
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,510
She refuses to say anything.

297
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,240
Yu,

298
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,020
you've had a tiring journey today.

299
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,440
Why don't you go back and rest first?

300
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,150
She can't escape anyway.

301
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,310
No one has helped me except the immortals.

302
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,510
If I can't find my child,

303
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,390
I won't say a single word.

304
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,630
Where's Ranran?

305
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,740
She said if you want to know

306
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,550
the origin of the runes,

307
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,000
you need to find

308
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,150
the corpse of Madam Wu's son.

309
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,910
She also asked me to tell you

310
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,780
not to worry.

311
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,030
"I'm very powerful now.

312
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:06,940
I definitely won't

313
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,130
lose to a snake."

314
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,840
Fifty li southwest from here

315
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,960
is the Death Realm!

316
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,090
[Death Realm]

317
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,960
The armored skeletons

318
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,840
is in this direction.

319
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,200
[Wu Dayou]

320
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,780
On behalf of your mother,

321
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,630
I'm bringing you home.

322
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,440
Watch me shatter your demon core!

323
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,450
Ranran.

324
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,440
Xue Ranran.

325
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,480
Ranran.

326
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,510
Master.

327
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,510
Master.

328
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,070
Master,

329
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,400
that demon just now was quite formidable.

330
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,790
It almost swallowed me whole.

331
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:27,920
But I thought,

332
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,210
since it was a skeletal python

333
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,920
and had no flesh,

334
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,500
what could it do even if it swallowed me?

335
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,150
So,

336
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,750
I simply crawled into its belly,

337
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,930
trailed its bone crevices,

338
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,070
and pierced its demon core.

339
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,030
Master,

340
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,880
I have made a mistake.

341
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,750
You're quick to admit your mistake,

342
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,200
but you never learn.

343
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,310
I know that

344
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,510
Master doesn't allow me to act like this.

345
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,110
But if I could choose again,

346
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
I would do the same thing.

347
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,340
What?

348
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,760
A immortal cultivator draws their essence

349
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,640
from the universe

350
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,920
and should be returned it in kind.

351
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,970
Upholding justice and rescuing the weak i

352
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,970
is the cycle of the Heavenly Way.

353
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,510
Although Madam Wu has harmed people,

354
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,480
her child is the most innocent.

355
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,370
If he saw his mother

356
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,960
in this state,

357
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,880
he would surely be heartbroken.

358
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,550
So I brought back his remains,

359
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,110
firstly to find clues,

360
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,160
and secondly,

361
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,200
to fulfill this unfulfilled wish.

362
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,270
There are countless people

363
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,810
in this universe who need help.

364
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,250
These small acts of kindness

365
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,310
are meaningless.

366
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,830
I'll just help as many people as I can.

367
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,240
It's better than doing nothing at all.

368
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,470
If we calculate gains and losses like this,

369
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,650
then what's the point

370
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,480
of immortal cultivation training?

371
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,350
Am I right?

372
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,110
Yes.

373
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,500
Um,

374
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,480
Master,

375
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,370
I just

376
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,440
thought of some principles

377
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,780
and wanted to discuss them with you.

378
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,400
This Spirit Dispelling Formation didn't work either.

379
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,400
Master, why are you being so polite?

380
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,590
Next time when you discuss principles with me,

381
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,200
your tone mustn't be disrespectful.

382
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:01,910
Yes.

383
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,620
Let me ask you one last thing.

384
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,510
In the future, if you encounter such

385
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,070
situations where you have to save people from danger,

386
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,770
but it's extremely perilous,

387
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,160
what should you do?

388
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,610
Call Xi'er and the others to help.

389
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,070
Wrong.

390
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,830
Is it so hard to call for your master's help?

391
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,880
I get it now, Master.

392
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,720
I still couldn't get any information

393
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,510
about the origin of that rune.

394
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,920
That demonic lady

395
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,240
still refuses to talk.

396
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,680
But don't worry, Your Highness.

397
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,440
The information you want to know,

398
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,440
I

399
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,270
will definitely find a way to get it for you.

400
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,070
So Yu really wants to know

401
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,550
about that rune.

402
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,750
Whatever punishment you have,

403
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,480
just use it all.

404
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,720
Best if you could just kill me,

405
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,550
so I can meet see my son.

406
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,640
There's no rush.

407
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,830
I haven't heard what I want to hear yet.

408
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,110
How could I let you die so easily?

409
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,160
What is this?

410
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,000
Why can't I

411
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,030
control my body anymore?

412
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,050
This is called

413
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,150
a Marrow-Eating Roach.

414
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,960
It loves to burrow into and devour fish brains.

415
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,160
I heard you're half-human

416
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
and half-fish.

417
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,440
You're indeed afraid of it.

418
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,200
Take it away!

419
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,890
Take it away quickly!

420
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,550
Sure.

421
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,240
Tell me about the origin

422
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,240
of the rune on you,

423
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,590
and I'll take it away.

424
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,070
Just kill me.

425
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,070
Seems like you're still not scared enough.

426
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,480
Then let's have a taste of it

427
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,400
before we talk.

428
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,300
When you can't bear it anymore,

429
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,170
remember to call for me.

430
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,910
Still not talking?

431
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,080
You filthy thing。

432
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,680
You're asking for death!

433
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,270
Qingge, what are you doing?

434
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,340
Yu,

435
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,880
I just wanted to help you

436
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
to question this demon.

437
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,030
Who knew

438
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,000
she would suddenly go berserk

439
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and try to kill me?

440
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,000
You're hurt.

441
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,310
It's just a minor injury.

442
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,920
Then we need to treat it quickly.

443
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,550
Something's not right.

444
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,960
Why are we still going in circles after so long?

445
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,030
Try using your spiritual power.

446
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,860
I can't use my spiritual power.

447
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,830
Why is this happening?

448
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,240
The Death Realm

449
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,350
has changed.

450
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,480
What's going on?

451
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,510
Countless beings have perished

452
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,920
in the Death Realm over the centuries.

453
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,680
It was the

454
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,830
giant Bone Python

455
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,790
who kept things in balanced.

456
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,460
But now that the Bone Python is dead,

457
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,160
all the death energy has been released,

458
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,200
saturating the air,

459
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,270
and obstructing spiritual power.

460
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,510
What should we do then?

461
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,310
How about

462
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,460
one of us will take in the new,

463
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,360
while the other expels the impurities.

464
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,860
If we alternate like this,

465
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,030
we'll be able to use our spiritual power

466
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,790
to leave this place.

467
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,310
So we need to...

468
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,680
Hold onto this.

469
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,830
Seems like Master also thinks

470
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,860
I'm doing the right thing.

471
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,700
Otherwise, why would you let me hold your hand?

472
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,790
I'm asking you to...

473
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,200
Forget it.

474
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,460
Master,

475
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,030
you're blushing.

476
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,200
Focus.

477
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,830
Master.

478
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,240
What's wrong?

479
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,110
Madam Wu is missing.

480
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,000
Ranran,

481
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,510
Madam Wu has died.

482
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,750
How could this be?

483
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,580
Master interrogated her personally.

484
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,640
I'm not sure why.

485
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,480
It was Madam Wu who went mad suddenly.

486
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,620
Qingge killed her

487
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,160
under self-defence.

488
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,440
Madam Wu was determined to die

489
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,080
but was firmly locked up.

490
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,070
How could she have

491
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,260
suddenly gone berserk?

492
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,680
Young Master Yu,

493
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,720
where is Master Mu?

494
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,830
I need to get to the bottom of this.

495
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,090
Qingge was injured by her

496
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,350
and is now recovering.

497
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,110
Let's not disturb her.

498
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,690
We went through great trouble

499
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
to retrieve her son's remains;

500
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,750
we need answers from her.

501
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,400
Besides,

502
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,720
even if Madam Wu was guilty and deserved punishment,

503
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,750
it should be done through either a public trial,

504
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,920
or the Heavenly order.

505
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,790
How could Master Mu just kill her without due process?

506
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,110
Ranran,

507
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,240
It’s come to this,

508
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,550
there’s nothing more that can be done.

509
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,890
Besides, when the Heavenly Sects

510
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,240
typically encounters a demon like Madam Wu,

511
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,880
they would have killed her long ago,

512
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,480
wouldn't they?

513
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,810
It was a case where

514
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
pleas for karma went unanswered,

515
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,380
that's why Madam Wu sought help from evil spirits,

516
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,880
leading to this disaster.

517
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,920
Now,

518
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,200
it's still the same.

519
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,510
Ranran,

520
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,160
I'll allocate a piece of land with good feng shui

521
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,030
for the mother and son to be buried together.

522
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,030
This should put your mind at ease.

523
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,720
Is that alright?

524
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

525
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,270
Acted in self-defence?

526
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,750
All packed up?

527
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,440
Let's leave.

528
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,750
Don't stay here anymore.

529
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,480
Let's get out.

530
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,990
I heard the owner of this inn

531
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,790
killed someone

532
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,750
and was sentenced to death.

533
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,680
It's very unlucky.

534
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:28,510
Let's leave.

535
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:28,960
Go.

536
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,640
Go, go, go.

537
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,350
Hurry.

538
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,590
Years of operation

539
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,060
can fall into ruin in an instant.

540
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,200
Where will we stay for the next few days?

541
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,690
There simply is no one here to manage.

542
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,640
For us,

543
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,750
it makes no difference.

544
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,160
What Master means is

545
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,840
that we've all eaten poisoned buns

546
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,750
and couldn't fly on our swords,

547
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,640
so we should rest here for a few days

548
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,380
before we can set out.

549
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,350
Let's go.

550
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,830
Master.

551
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,160
You have accumulated merits

552
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,160
and your cultivation has reached the stage of Qi Refinement.

553
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
You will soon be ready to build Foundation.

554
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,440
What's wrong?

555
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,070
I

556
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,550
think I know

557
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,790
what the runes on Madam Wu are.

558
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,510
How did you find out?

559
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,400
I saw through Vine again

560
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,560
and had a glimpse of fragments of my past life.

561
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
I saw a book

562
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,440
and the runes on it

563
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,070
were identical to those on Madam Wu's body.

564
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,550
It's called the Seven Evil Transformation Spell.

565
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,480
Can't believe I have forgotten

566
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,640
these information from back then.

567
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,950
Seven Evil Transformation Spell.

568
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,640
Celestial Sect.

569
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,750
I see.

570
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,440
What exactly is going on,

571
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,480
Master?

572
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,270
I've heard that Seven Evil Transformation Spell

573
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,350
is powered by resentment

574
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,070
to integrate humans and beasts into demons.

575
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,510
And the resentment generated

576
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,480
by these demons

577
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,860
can be absorbed back by the spell,

578
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,070
creating an endless cycle.

579
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,720
The Mortal-Demon Lord back then

580
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,870
relied on this evil spell

581
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,640
to accumulate resentment and become a devil,

582
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,200
eventually becoming the leader of all devils.

583
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,450
The Spirit Spring is the Mortal-Demon Lord's

584
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,400
spiritual power transformed.

585
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,640
So,

586
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,790
this is a repeat of the old trick.

587
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,030
Correct.

588
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,070
The Spirit Spring intended to do the same as before,

589
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,250
accumulating resentment

590
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,310
to break the seal.

591
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
What should we do then?

592
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,720
Since it's still harming people,

593
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,200
it means the seal hasn't been broken yet.

594
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,560
We still stand a chance.

595
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,640
I know someone

596
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,200
who should be able to use the spell

597
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,400
to locate the Spirit Spring.

598
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,240
Alright,

599
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,960
none of this matters right now.

600
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,160
You've just advanced.

601
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,540
Quickly focus and stabilize your spiritual power.

602
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,590
I'll help you.

603
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,830
Why have these ice walls melted?

604
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,070
My cultivation has advanced.

605
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,070
I can come to see you again.

606
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,200
How have you been lately?

607
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,670
It seems that

608
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,050
it has become much warmer here.

609
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,550
Has it become easier to endure now?

610
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,000
You don't know,

611
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,900
so many things have happened recently.

612
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,570
I like Master

613
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,400
and It seems he found out.

614
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,790
I thought he wouldn't talk to me anymore,

615
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,920
but guess what,

616
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,440
he is still be so kind to me.

617
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,600
Yesterday,

618
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Master played the flute to help me out of a difficult situation.

619
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,640
He protected me, afraid I might get hurt.

620
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,030
When I went to the Death Realm,

621
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,130
he got very angry

622
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,070
and was very worried about me.

623
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,960
Do you think

624
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,520
Master might

625
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,720
have feelings for me too?

626
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,830
If that's the case,

627
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,040
if I invite Master again

628
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,510
to see the Paired Wings Auspicious Clouds,

629
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,290
he would agree, right?

630
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,440
When we left the Death Realm today,

631
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,480
Master asked me to hold his hand.

632
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,110
Master's hand was really soft.

633
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,350
Oh, right!

634
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,550
Master's hand

635
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,790
is on my back right now,

636
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,610
helping me cultivate.

637
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,070
I never dared to imagine this!

638
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,350
if only I could be under

639
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,170
the Peach Blossom Intoxication again.

640
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,400
The duration last time was too short,

641
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,030
there wasn't enough time to do many things.

642
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,200
I wanted to pinch Master's cheeks,

643
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
but there wasn't time for that.

644
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,750
Would  Master's cheek

645
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,350
be as soft as his hand?

646
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,830
Where is Master?

647
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,060
Why did he suddenly leave?

648
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,680
You are...

649
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,150
May I ask, young lady,

650
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,240
was the person with you earlier

651
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,890
really the sovereign of Mount Wester,

652
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,910
Su Yishui?

653
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:16,880
Yes.

654
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,110
Are you looking for Master?

655
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,780
I indeed have some business

656
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,060
and need to see Sovereign Su.

657
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:23,960
Please wait a moment.

658
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,220
Master.

659
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,140
I'm not around.

660
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,000
Um,

661
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,710
someone is here to see you.

662
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,190
Come in.

663
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,480
We don't seem to know each other.

664
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,440
Although Sovereign Su doesn't recognize me,

665
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,960
for the past ten years,

666
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,550
I've been to Mount Wester many times.

667
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,150
Unfortunately,

668
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,890
the gates were always closed

669
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,030
and I never had the chance to meet you.

670
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,270
Today,

671
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,720
running into Sovereign Su at Wangxiang Pass

672
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,070
must be heaven's will.

673
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,160
I've been entrusted by an old friend

674
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,070
to bring something to Sovereign Su.

675
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,920
I've long since cut ties with the mortal world

676
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,470
and I don't accept things from others.

677
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,550
This old friend of mine is not a stranger.

678
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,000
Her surname is Jiang,

679
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,680
and she's Sovereign Su's

680
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,030
inseparable blood relative.

681
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,480
Many years ago,

682
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,810
I once held you

683
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,430
at the Rouge Chamber

684
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,680
This old friend of mine is

685
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,350
your mother.

686
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,100
Sister Jiang

687
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,260
died of illness at Wangxiang Pass.

688
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,000
Before she passed away,

689
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,110
she mustered all her strength

690
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,830
to ask me to pass you this key.

691
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,890
She said you have to

692
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,350
visit her final accommodation.

693
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,830
There's no need.

694
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,110
Ranran, see the guest out.

695
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,350
Yishui,

696
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,000
I know her personality well.

697
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,760
What happened to you back then

698
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,110
doesn't seem like something she would do.

699
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,350
After she passed away,

700
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,640
I often came to pay my respects.

701
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,590
Yesterday

702
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,310
happened to be the anniversary of her death.

703
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,880
I'm not forcing you

704
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,420
to acknowledge this family tie again,

705
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:12,969
Yishui.

706
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,000
At least

707
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,320
take this key and pay a visit

708
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,460
to fulfill her last wish.

709
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,030
Ranran,

710
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,600
see the guest out.

711
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,150
Madam.

712
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,909
I once heard Madam Wu

713
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,650
mumbling when drunk,

714
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,400
if she could start over,

715
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,590
she wouldn't let her son join the army.

716
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,320
The world is full of accidents and misfortunes.

717
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
If you're not careful,

718
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,000
you might regret it for life.

719
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,110
This key,

720
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,400
I'll leave it here.

721
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,110
As for

722
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,030
whether you go

723
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,880
or not...

724
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,000
Master!

725
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,670
Master actually does care a lot, doesn't he?

726
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,440
I better piece the key back together

727
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,180
and ask about the location of the grave.

728
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,810
If someday

729
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,880
Master changes his mind,

730
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,760
at least he'll know where to find it.

731
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,840
[Madam Wu's Inn]

732
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,480
Show it to me.

733
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,550
You're becoming more and more disobedient.

734
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,230
You spent the entire night

735
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:08,680
searching for these fragments

736
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,510
piece by piece

737
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,480
in the river?

738
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,510
Yes.

739
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,960
Your cultivation is still unstable,

740
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,450
yet you waste your energy

741
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,070
on these trivial matters.

742
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
Throw them away immediately and go back to meditate.

743
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,070
No.

744
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,400
You want to be punished?

745
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,670
Even if I'm punished,

746
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,920
I can't throw away this key.

747
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,110
The lady said

748
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,910
the world is full of accidents and misfortunes.

749
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,030
I'm afraid she might be right.

750
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,800
You're getting bolder and bolder.

751
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:34,920
You dare to start meddling

752
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,800
in my personal affairs?

753
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,230
I wouldn't dare, Master.

754
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,870
I'm just afraid to see you upset.

755
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,230
Today, when Master

756
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,440
threw away the key,

757
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,510
you were actually quite upset, weren't you?

758
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,590
Do you really know

759
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,190
if I’m upset?

760
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,230
Everything about you, Master,

761
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,000
I care deeply about.

762
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,600
I don't know what happened in the past,

763
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,070
I'm just concerned

764
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,880
that If there are any regrets,

765
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,030
there should be a chance to clarify things.

766
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,000
Regrets are regrets.

767
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,590
We didn’t meet while alive,

768
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,800
so why should there be any ties after death?"

769
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:16,630
Forget it.

770
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,310
Since you've found it,

771
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,150
just return the key to the house.

772
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,440
Master, are you really not going?

773
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,140
Are you thinking of forcing me with the spirit Dispelling Formation again?

774
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,960
This is your personal matter, Master.

775
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:27,570
I

776
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,070
wouldn't dare to.

777
00:37:59,150 --> 00:37:59,880
Madam Jiang.

778
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,810
I'm returning the key

779
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,590
on behalf of Master.

780
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,960
Why does it feel so cold

781
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,480
whenever I get close to this box?

782
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,440
Madam Jiang died of illness.

783
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,800
Judging from the handwriting,

784
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,550
she must have used

785
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,840
her last ounce of strength to write.

786
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,960
She begged someone to bring the key to Master,

787
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,460
[To Shui]

788
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,070
but not

789
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,280
the letter and box directly.

790
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,630
There must be a hidden story.

791
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,440
No.

792
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,670
I still need to ask Master

793
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,400
to come and see for himself.

794
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,880
But forcing Master

795
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,000
is really inappropriate.

796
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,480
I've got it.

797
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,590
Master, save me!

798
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,330
I told you to shout "Master, save me!"

799
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,030
for your own protection.

800
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,320
How dare you use it to trick me.

801
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,110
I know it's not right.

802
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,440
Take a look at this box.

803
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,360
Master,

804
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,240
this porcelain bottle is bone-chillingly cold.

805
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,770
Madam Jiang has no immortal powers.

806
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,030
Carrying this thing

807
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,480
would surely cause her to be plagued by severe illness.

808
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,550
Perhaps this is why

809
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,190
she called you here to take a look.

810
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:41,560
She must have

811
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,630
left some important words.

812
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,280
Shui,

813
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,640
as I write this first sentence,

814
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,590
I'm already thinking

815
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,830
that you probably

816
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,840
will never see this letter.

817
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,320
But I have no choice.

818
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,440
I can only take a gamble,

819
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,710
betting that I can use my life

820
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,370
to free my dear Shui

821
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,780
from the torment of evil magic.

822
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,160
Because this is the sin

823
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,320
I committed out of presumption.

824
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,000
Before Prince Ping took you away,

825
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,840
he came to me.

826
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,150
He said he'd give me a sum of money

827
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,840
to let you be a young master in his mansion.

828
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,110
Of course I wanted the money,

829
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,840
but I also wanted you to live a life better than mine.

830
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,280
He feared you wouldn't comply,

831
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,190
so he wanted me to cut off your hopes.

832
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,030
That is why, from that time on,

833
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,480
I became cold towards you

834
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,280
and harsh on you.

835
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,090
I listened to your father's words

836
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,800
and must never recognize you.

837
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,480
Until his military defeat,

838
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,020
I was very worried about you,

839
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,590
but I overheard his conversation with his subordinates.

840
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,440
Three provinces have been lost in succession.

841
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,800
What are Your Highness's

842
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,920
next plans?

843
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,890
What plans?

844
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920
You're all a bunch of useless fools.

845
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:10,920
Get out!

846
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,760
Yes.

847
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,230
Su Yishui,

848
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,150
if you little brat still refuse to summon the Spirit Spring

849
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,230
and insist on saving some Mu Qingge...

850
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,480
Fine,

851
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,190
it doesn't matter.

852
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,590
As long as I have this in hand,

853
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,930
I can certainly make you

854
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,070
be my killing blade again.

855
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,410
Only then did I realize

856
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,320
that he took you away

857
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,190
solely to make you his killing puppet.

858
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,230
Only then did I know how much suffering

859
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,710
you've endured all these years.

860
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,150
Fire! Fire!

861
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:02,900
There's a fire!

862
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,440
Quick, put out the fire!

863
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:04,960
Hurry!

864
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,000
Quick, put out the fire!

865
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,710
There's a fire!

866
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:08,920
Fire!

867
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,230
Fire!

868
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:09,710
Come!

869
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,710
There's a fire!

870
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,710
Quick, put out the fire!

871
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,400
Hurry up!

872
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,440
That night,

873
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
I stole the porcelain bottle

874
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,280
and escaped to Wangxiang Pass.

875
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,730
My only thought was

876
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,030
that if I gave you this bottle,

877
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,710
you would no longer be at anyone's mercy.

878
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,880
But who would have known,

879
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,190
I fell ill and never recovered?

880
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,760
When you were just born,

881
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,890
I always felt that we, mother and son,

882
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,960
would have a whole lifetime together.

883
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,330
Who knew that the good days of one's life

884
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,320
are limited?

885
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,360
In the blink of an eye,

886
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,680
only scattered memories

887
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,630
are left to savour.

888
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,440
I'm sorry for failing you in this lifetime, my child.

889
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,760
If there's a next life,

890
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,630
Mom will make it up to you properly.
