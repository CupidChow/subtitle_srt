[Episode 39]

3
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,640
A secret passage has to be hidden, of course.

4
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,479
Am I

5
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,430
supposed to install

6
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,350
a big red-painted door here?

7
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,000
Alright.

8
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,590
Getting in smoothly is what matters most.

9
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,560
This doghole really does

10
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,790
lead directly to the main hall entrance,

11
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,259
avoiding those shadow people outside.

12
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,520
That imposter must be

13
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,500
in the main hall right now.

14
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,030
You guys handle

15
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,800
the scum outside for me,

16
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,870
and I go and kill that imposter. Be careful.

17
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,560
Everyone, be careful.

18
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,079
Don't get the blood on you.

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,680
Yes.

20
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,680
Be careful.

21
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,190
Let's go.

22
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,910
You actually want to kill me?

23
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,190
If that's the case,

24
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,190
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

25
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,150
You impostor,

26
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,560
I'm here today

27
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,950
to settle the score with you!

28
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:27,880
This Sun-Radiant Pearls

29
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,910
Zeng Yi gave me

30
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,880
are really useful.

31
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,120
They contain

32
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,260
the sunlight of midday.

33
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,970
You impostors

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,190
don't have shadows under the sunlight.

35
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,560
That's because

36
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,800
this extreme yang light

37
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,240
weakens your spiritual power, right?

38
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,630
Go to hell!

39
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,150
If you dare make another move,

40
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,120
I'll kill Tu Jiuyuan.

41
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,360
If I die, she dies too.

42
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,030
How do I know if she's real or fake?

43
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,470
If she's fake,

44
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,190
I'd be at a big loss.

45
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,360
It's more worthwhile to kill you.

46
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,720
Sure enough,

47
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,350
once the source has been eliminated,

48
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,510
the shadow people dissipated.

49
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,120
You didn't die.

50
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:45,920
You're still alive

51
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,310
and weren't replaced.

52
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,310
Elder Tu,

53
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:50,950
are you alright?

54
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,600
The fetus is stable.

55
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,720
There's no major issue.

56
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,160
It seems that

57
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,070
when the Two-headed Deceptive Python tried to replicate you,

58
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,120
it had no effect on the fetus in your womb.

59
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,040
So, from beginning to end,

60
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,510
it was unable to replicate you.

61
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,510
Tu Jiuyuan,

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,190
who allowed you to act on your own

63
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,430
and stay by that impostor's side?

64
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,720
You were all lovey-dovey with that impostor,

65
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,510
and...

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,270
And...

67
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,040
about the child in your belly...

68
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,360
This is my private matter.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,870
It's none of your business.

70
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,600
None of my business?

71
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,950
Then whose business is it?

72
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,920
You've got some nerve, Tu Jiuyuan.

73
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,920
Tell me,

74
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,190
who has the guts?

75
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,070
Wei Jiu,

76
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,720
what nonsense are you talking about?

77
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,270
The number one shadow person has been eliminated.

78
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,630
The others who were controlling

79
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,360
the various sects of the Heavenly Sects

80
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,680
should have dissipated by now.

81
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,630
The disciples of each sect

82
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,570
have received the news

83
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,909
and should have returned to their sects.

84
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,560
But why haven't

85
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,310
the spiritual channels of these major sects

86
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,150
been closed yet?

87
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,190
It's Wen Hongshan.

88
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,800
What's wrong?

89
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,750
The entrances of the Four Heavenly Sects

90
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,480
have not opened.

91
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,000
People from all sects are being blocked

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,920
outside the barrier set by Dun Tian

93
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,680
and cannot enter to close the spiritual channels.

94
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,800
Do you think

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,120
this is the end?

96
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,670
No one can stop me.

97
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,070
Three Thousand Realms Tower, rise!

98
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,720
How could this be?

99
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:33,950
The core of the formation

100
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,040
that Dun Tian wanted to use to build the tower

101
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,510
has already been destroyed.

102
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,600
The Three Children are no longer in his hands.

103
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,270
Even the shadow people

104
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,360
he manipulated and used are gone.

105
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,390
What else can he do?

106
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,920
Why hasn't he stopped yet?

107
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,430
Could it be that Dun Tian still has a backup plan

108
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,900
we don't know about?

109
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,310
Now,

110
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,750
after all this effort,

111
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,630
we still haven't reclaimed the spiritual channels.

112
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,430
Does this mean

113
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,190
that this fate is truly unstoppable?

114
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,750
I don't believe in fate.

115
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,440
Everything Shui and I have experienced in two lifetimes

116
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,480
has long made me understand one thing:

117
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,120
Every single prophecy

118
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,000
recorded in the Heavenly Book

119
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,430
can actually change.

120
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,000
In other words,

121
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,390
everything

122
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,630
that everyone does

123
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,870
leads to a corresponding result.

124
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,720
I produced the effect because I created the cause.

125
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,270
The path

126
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,920
is something we forge ourselves.

127
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,160
We still have plenty of time

128
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,190
to change everything.

129
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,120
It's too early to admit defeat.

130
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,830
The priority now is to find out

131
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,270
where Dun Tian is currently building the tower

132
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,190
and stop him.

133
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,040
This reminds me of something.

134
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,159
Hundreds of years ago,

135
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,360
the Mortal-Demon Lord tried

136
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,430
to build the tower at Mount Scarlet Flame.

137
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:46,950
There are still marks left

138
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,360
from the spiritual power burning at that time.

139
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,480
Perhaps we can

140
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,430
find some other clues there.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,280
[Mount Scarlet Flame]

142
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,480
When the Mortal-Demon Lord

143
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,240
built the tower's core here,

144
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,390
he must have also needed

145
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,390
to find several spiritual channels

146
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,650
to supply energy to it.

147
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,310
I've looked around

148
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,270
and there are indeed

149
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,570
traces of mountain veins

150
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,830
passing through the ground.

151
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,830
Not every place

152
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,450
can withstand the power

153
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,360
gathered from the spiritual channels.

154
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,090
This is an ancient scroll

155
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
we found in the secret cave where the Mortal-Demon Lord

156
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,810
cultivated in the past.

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,510
Look.

158
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,800
In this picture, there is a figure beneath the tower.

159
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,830
What does this mean?

160
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,950
And this one?

161
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,360
These are the places the Mortal-Demon Lord found

162
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,090
that could withstand

163
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,600
the convergence of the spiritual channels.

164
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,720
So that means

165
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,750
if Dun Tian wants to build the Three Thousand Realms Tower,

166
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,670
the the tower's core can only be in these few locations.

167
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,270
If we split up and investigate now,

168
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,360
do we still have time?

169
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,000
The Mortal-Demon Lord

170
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,630
chose Mount Scarlet Flame back then.

171
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,600
And Dun Tian originally

172
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,600
chose Puxin Village.

173
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,030
Aside from

174
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,320
their abundant spiritual energy,

175
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,960
what do these two places have in common?

176
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,000
The south of Scarlet River

177
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,360
and the east of Mount Ying.

178
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,550
Ancient texts record

179
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,510
that the First God created nine voids,

180
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,960
and among the nine voids,

181
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,480
there are Scarlet River and Mount Ying.

182
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,560
Mount Scarlet Flame and Puxin Village

183
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,030
happen to be located precisely

184
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,870
on the southeast positions of Scarlet River and Mount Ying.

185
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,640
There's only one place

186
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,150
that can withstand the convergence

187
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,210
of the spiritual channels

188
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,550
and is located in the southeast position

189
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,870
of one of the voids—

190
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,150
Mount Wester.

191
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,690
Dun Tian plans to build the Three Thousand Realms Tower

192
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
on our Mount Wester?

193
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,360
So it's not for the spiritual channel.

194
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,150
It's to use it as the foundation for the tower's core.

195
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,390
Ranran,

196
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,960
Qing Luo has disappeared.

197
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,510
Last time, you warned me

198
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,710
that Dun Tian might try to seize the Dragon's child,

199
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,600
and I immediately went to summon him.

200
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,630
But he had slipped out of Dragon Island.

201
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,630
I searched for a long time

202
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,270
and found that his Dragon Breath

203
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,050
had vanished at the edge

204
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,750
of the Sea of Immortality.

205
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,240
I've searched everywhere,

206
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,320
but there's no trace of him.

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,440
Zeng Yi,

208
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,450
take the disciples back

209
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,000
to the vicinity of Mount Wester to check the situation.

210
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,270
Find more people to help.

211
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,600
Don't act rashly for now.

212
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,750
Ranran and I will go to

213
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,960
the edge of the Sea of Immortality to investigate.

214
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,960
Once we find Qing Luo,

215
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,960
we will meet you at Mount Wester.

216
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,600
Okay.

217
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,750
I'll go to Mount Wester with you.

218
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,080
You're pregnant.

219
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,080
Why are you going there?

220
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,160
There are no dry decks when the ship is sinking.

221
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,570
If the whole world

222
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,270
were to be overturned,

223
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,690
what would be the use of me staying here

224
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,480
on Mount Scarlet Flame, doing nothing?

225
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,510
Alright.

226
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's split up.

227
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,160
[Sea of Immortality]

228
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,870
By the Sea of Immortality,

229
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
this is the only strange place.

230
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,510
Could that blood mist be…

231
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,200
The blood mist formed from the flood dragon pearls

232
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,240
is the most coveted delicacy of the Dragon Clan.

233
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,960
Qing Luo is here.

234
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,030
It's you.

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,550
Since you've found your way here,

236
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,830
why are you sneaking around?

237
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,360
You want to ruin my big plan?

238
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,510
Wu,

239
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,270
look at yourself.

240
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,240
The demonic energy that Dun Tian lent you before

241
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,320
has already invaded your flesh and blood.

242
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,970
You'll definitely fall into demonic ways.

243
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,150
Stop now.

244
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,200
Wang Suizhi!

245
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,030
Today is the deadline.

246
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,600
If I don't send the little Green Dragon away,

247
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,870
I'll die!

248
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,870
Yet you're still here talking nonsense!

249
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,910
No.

250
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,370
You'll be fine.

251
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,000
I told you

252
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,550
I could help you break the Life-Death Spell.

253
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,150
How did the Life-Death Spell that was cast on me

254
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,550
transfer to you?

255
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,670
You...

256
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,800
How did you manage to do that?

257
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,750
As an unqualified cultivator,

258
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,750
the only skill I'm good at

259
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,080
is manipulating fate.

260
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,750
Wu,

261
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,750
I know these years

262
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,600
have been difficult for you.

263
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,560
Let me bear the pain

264
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,360
of the Life-Death Spell for you.

265
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,670
You shortened your lifespan

266
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,150
to swap your fate with mine.

267
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,360
When the Life-Death Spell strikes,

268
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,150
you will...

269
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,320
You don't need to borrow demonic energy anymore,

270
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,910
and you don't need to be controlled by Dun Tian from now on.

271
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,320
Wu,

272
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,720
release the Green Dragon.

273
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,870
The world is vast.

274
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,480
There are so many interesting places

275
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,320
worth seeing.

276
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,150
Wu!

277
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,150
Who gave you the permission to make the decision on your own?

278
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,270
Release the Green Dragon

279
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,440
and let you die in my place?

280
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,940
And then what?

281
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,360
Wang Suizhi,

282
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,790
and then,

283
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,000
are you going to leave me alone?

284
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,550
I won't accept it!

285
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,670
If you continue like this,

286
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,120
you'll be corrupted by demonic energy

287
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,840
and lose yourself forever.

288
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,240
So what?

289
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,600
All these years,

290
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,440
you're the only one who has always stayed

291
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,150
by my side.

292
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,080
All the way

293
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,550
till now,

294
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,150
I only have you left.

295
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,170
I will never

296
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,360
let the Life-Death Spell strike.

297
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,120
I will send the Green Dragon to Dun Tian,

298
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,750
and then let you

299
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,030
live on with me!

300
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,840
Wu!

301
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,150
Wu.

302
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,550
She's about to fall into demonic ways.

303
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,750
Master,

304
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,360
Wu has absorbed too much demonic energy.

305
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,360
Please save her!

306
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,840
Qingge,

307
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,910
you came after all.

308
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,030
What now?

309
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,640
are you going to put on airs again

310
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,270
and lecture me from your high horse?

311
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,270
Wu,

312
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,200
I heard about Suizhi

313
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,150
and the Life-Death Spell.

314
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,770
Stop the formation for now,

315
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,150
and let's think of a way together.

316
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,550
There must be a solution.

317
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,240
I don't need your solutions!

318
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,960
From the past until now,

319
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,910
whenever you look at me,

320
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,720
it always feels like you're giving me charity.

321
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,200
I don't want your charity!

322
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,430
This time,

323
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,120
I will save Suizhi myself.

324
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,200
The Three Thousand Realms.

325
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,840
I'm going to

326
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,390
the Three Thousand Realms with him,

327
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,510
becoming the master of the Heavenly Sects

328
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,840
and trampling you underfoot.

329
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,790
Oh no.

330
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,200
The little Green Dragon has been sent away.

331
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,870
Wu!

332
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,670
She has completely fallen into demonic ways.

333
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
There's only killing intent left in her heart.

334
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,320
With this blood-colored totem,

335
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,240
she will self-destruct,

336
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,550
killing all living beings here,

337
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,960
including herself.

338
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,840
Wu,

339
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,910
I can't let you hurt yourself,

340
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,600
nor can I let you hurt Master.

341
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,630
This is the last thing

342
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,790
I can do for you.

343
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,600
Suizhi,

344
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,840
are you going to scatter your heart?

345
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,630
Master,

346
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,240
Wu...

347
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,360
will definitely turn back!

348
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,080
Suizhi?

349
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,440
Suizhi!

350
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,000
Suizhi!

351
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,440
Wu,

352
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,790
you're alright.

353
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,870
That's great.

354
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,030
Why are you so foolish?

355
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:24,910
Why did you

356
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,480
sacrifice your life for me?

357
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,670
I observe fate.

358
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,790
All my life, I've sought profit and avoided harm.

359
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,630
But when I met you,

360
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,030
I realized that

361
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,510
when we meet the ones we love,

362
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,630
even a brief moment of closeness

363
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,120
is enough to cherish for a lifetime.

364
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:49,790
No.

365
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,390
I will save you.

366
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
I will save you!

367
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,480
Why?

368
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,600
Dun Tian,

369
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,480
lend me your demonic energy!

370
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,440
Dun Tian!

371
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,550
No.

372
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,750
Suizhi,

373
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,130
I'll go and beg Dun Tian again.

374
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,270
I will think of a way!

375
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,349
I will find a way!

376
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,720
I will think of a way!

377
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,069
Wu,

378
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,670
don't waste energy for me,

379
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,550
and don't go to Dun Tian.

380
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
All I wish

381
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,960
is that you can stay away from all of this

382
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,680
and live a peaceful life.

383
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,590
Master,

384
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,880
I'm an unfilial disciple

385
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,750
and have disappointed you.

386
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,790
But I beg you,

387
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,590
please forgive Wu.

388
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,350
She has lost all her spiritual power

389
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,030
and can't do anything anymore.

390
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,310
Just let her

391
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,030
live the rest of her life

392
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,030
as an ordinary person.

393
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,110
If there is a next life,

394
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,880
I will serve you

395
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,480
to repay your kindness.

396
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
Even if you hadn't said it,

397
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,350
she was, after all, my sister in a past life.

398
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:13,720
You...

399
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,680
don't need to worry.

400
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,350
Wu,

401
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,790
let me

402
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,890
read your fortune one last time.

403
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,830
The rest of your life

404
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,350
will be peaceful

405
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,880
and happy.

406
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,920
Very good.

407
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,680
Very good.

408
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:09,460
♫Who knows the loneliness of mountains and seas?♫

409
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,720
Suizhi!

410

♫The sharp wind cuts at my heart♫

Wang Suizhi! Wang Suizhi!

414
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,040
♫Hold a drop of blood♫

415
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,480
Suizhi!

416
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,960
Suizhi!

417
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,200
♫Tattered flowers and tears♫

418
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,830
Suizhi!

♫Reincarnating but to no avail♫

420

Wang Suizhi! Wang Suizhi!

Wang Suizhi!

422
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:37,510
♫Devoting one's life despite knowing it can't be♫

423
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,070
Do you remember that

424
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,880
25 years ago,

425
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,790
you saved me at the foot of Mount Wester?

426
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:44,100
♫Coming to the abyss despite knowing retreat is possible♫

427
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,550
I was not a talented cultivator

428
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,480
and was bullied by my senior brothers.

429
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,000
You stood up for me.

430
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,390
♫Who says the world is full of wrongs?♫

431
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,170
♫I seize the Way and choose heaven♫

432
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,720
So what if you're not talented?

433
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,030
If your hands are so idle,

434
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll chop them all off for you.

435
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:59,850
♫It won't be a waste of my life to burn until I wither♫

436
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,960
I thought you were a disciple of the Wester Sect,

437
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,480
so I joined the Wester Sect.

438
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,290
♫There's no need to discuss right or wrong♫

439
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,160

♫I haven't said anything yet, my heart is clear♫

446
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,680
I was so happy

447

to see you.

448
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,500
♫I still don't regret it; I'll pay for it all my life♫

449
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,030

♫You know my heart, won't go against my wishes♫

451
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,590

♫Don't speak of redressing injustices♫

453
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,160
Master,

454
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,070
do you have any clues about Wu's whereabouts?

455
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,150
♫Don't let others pity me♫

456
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,070

♫Try your best to forget me♫

458
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,640

459
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,640
♫I'll go through hardships and never break down♫

460
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,680

♫I vow to fight against darkness♫

♫Love punishes me a thousand times, yet a merciful heart pardons me♫

00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,440
you have always been the best.

466
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,610
♫No pain, no resentment♫

467
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,120
Suizhi.

468
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,200
Immortals?

469
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,440
Immortals?

470
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,790
So many immortals.

471
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,720
Immortals.

472
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,720
I'll find immortals to save Suizhi.

473
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,960
Immortals.

474
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,200
So many immortals.

475
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,900
Immortals.

476
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,590
Wu...

477
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,880
has lost her sanity.

478
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,830
With the demonic energy entering her body,

479
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,400
she was supposed to become

480
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,680
a bloodthirsty and murderous Mortal-Demon.

481
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,350
But now that she has lost her sanity,

482
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,960
she's immune to being controlled.

483
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,240
It's a blessing in disguise.

484
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,350
The demonic clouds are gathering in the sky.

485
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,000
The anomaly is...

486
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,160
The Three Thousand Realms Tower is about to form.

487
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,070
How could this be?

488
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,680
Ranran.

489
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,030
Su Yishui.

490
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,160
Ranran.

491
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,310
I followed the compass

492
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,510
you left behind

493
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,830
and finally found you.

494
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,070
Su Yu

495
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,240
was taken away by Dun Tian.

496
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,080
The surroundings of Qiongqi Village

497
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,160
are covered by a hidden barrier.

498
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,880
How did Dun Tian find him?

499
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,560
It was His Highness

500
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,440
who walked out of the barrier on his own.

501
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,790
Come, look.

502
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,920
These vegetables have grown so well.

503
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,350
Thank you, Auntie.

504
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,510
What a bountiful harvest!

505
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,240
It's too much.

506
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,310
We can't finish them in the next few days.

507
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,170
Are you going to the market?

508
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Yes, we're going to the market

509
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,510
to take a look around.

510
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,440
We're off then.

511
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:12,880
Alright.

512
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,480
It's absolutely true.

513
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,030
I saw the notice with my own eyes.

514
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,480
Minister Zhou was arrested

515
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,780
and charged with

516
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,480
the serious crime of kidnapping the Crown Prince.

517
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,510
And he'll be executed soon.

518
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,310
This minister has always been a loyal official.

519
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,000
How could he kidnap the Crown Prince?

520
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,590
I think

521
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,830
it's a setup.

522
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,510
Speaking of which,

523
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,110
it's all because the Crown Prince is missing

524
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,130
that the capital

525
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,270
is in such chaos.

526
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,110
Your Highness,

527
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,110
so you're here.

528
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,240
I was planning to return with you anyway.

529
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,890
There's no need to make things difficult for Minister Zhou.

530
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,920
Let him go.

531
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,720
Your Highness, I've been searching for you for days.

532
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
I know

533
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,750
we're on the same page.

534
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,960
Now,

535
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,240
Su Yi and Qing Luo

536
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,590
have both fallen into his hands.

537
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,340
But what about the Demon's child?

538
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,380
The Demon's child no longer exists.

539
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,000
The Child of the Human Emperor,

540
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,960
the Child of the Divine Dragon,

541
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,070
and the Child of the True Devil.

542
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
The Three Children are all here.

543
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,310
The strange phenomenon of the Three Thousand Realms Tower

544
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,310
is the proof.

545
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,550
Feihua,

546
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,880
may I ask you for a favor?

547
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,720
Wu has lost all her cultivation

548
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,070
and her sanity.

549
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,550
Please take her to Qiongqi Village.

550
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:23,880
Alright.

551
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:25,960
So,

552
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,200
where are you going?

553
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,750
Back to Mount Wester.

554
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,030
We need to save Mount Wester

555
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,440
before the Three Thousand Realms Tower

556
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,550
is fully formed,

557
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,110
and save this world as well.

558
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,270
Master, Ranran.

559
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,920
This strange phenomenon of the Three Thousand Realms Tower in the sky…

560
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,200
It seems

561
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,900
your trip to rescue the little Green Dragon

562
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,110
was in vain.

563
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,640
What happened?

564
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,200
Ranran, Master,

565
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,480
the entrance to the Wester Sect

566
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,110
is sealed by Dun Tian with a barrier.

567
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,320
It's the same kind of barrier as the ones that

568
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,440
seal the spiritual channels of the Four Heavenly Sects.

569
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,270
We can't break through it.

570
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,400
If we delay any longer,

571
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,400
the Three Thousand Realms Tower

572
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,200
will be fully formed.

573
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,510
This barrier

574
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,740
was set by the power from the Immortal Realm.

575
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,590
Once you step in, heavenly thunder will strike.

576
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,360
We can't even take a step in.

577
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,200
To break through an Immortal Realm barrier,

578
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,700
we need the power from the Immortal Realm.

579
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,400
The power of the Immortal Realm?

580
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,550
But we are all mortals.

581
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,030
Where can we get the power from the Immortal Realm?

582
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,480
We have it.

583
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,830
Where did you get the power from the Immortal Realm?

584
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,710
This Heavenly Book

585
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,920
is originally a treasure from the Immortal Realm.

586
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,510
This fragment of the Heavenly Book

587
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,960
still retains some residual immortal power.

588
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,280
We can use this

589
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,640
to pass through Dun Tian's barrier.

590
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,950
You actually have the Heavenly Book?

591
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,680
Even just a small piece of this thing

592
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,160
is a priceless treasure.

593
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,720
If you destroy it,

594
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,790
won't that be a terrible waste?

595
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,350
It's a critical moment.

596
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,120
Should we keep the Heavenly Book

597
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,600
and die with it?

598
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
Wait for my news.

599
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
You want to face death

600
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,030
alone again?

601
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,480
What about me?

602
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,240
But the remaining power of the Heavenly Book isn't enough.

603
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,640
It's safer

604
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,720
if one person does it.

605
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,720
Then why don't you let me go alone?

606
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,880
You won't have a second chance

607
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,680
to leave me behind

608
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,430
and face danger on your own.

609
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,830
If we're going, we go together.

610
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,400
But two people

611
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,920
will consume more power.

612
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,860
Once the Heavenly Book's power is exhausted…

613
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,400
Do you remember the Death Realm at Wangxiang Pass?

614
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,790
Back then, the two of us—

615
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,160
one expelled the impurities, the other brought in the new.

616
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,550
Our spiritual power circulated as if we were one.

617
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,400
This time, we'll use the same method.

618
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,410
♫For you, I dare to face a thousand arrows♫

619
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,410
♫My spiritual sense returning to nothingness, and my Spirit Root scattering♫

620
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,390
♫Even if I must die, I will use the last piece♫

621
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,710
♫Of my broken body to protect you♫

622
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,750
Oh no.

623
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,110
That's the Three Thousand Realms Tower!

624
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,980
The Three Thousand Realms Tower has formed?

625
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,310
-Master!
-Master!

626
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,550
Shui,

627
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,440
we're about to pass through the barrier.

628
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,720
Tu Jiuyuan, what are you doing?

629
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,650
You're pregnant.

630
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,550
Why are you getting involved in this mess?

631
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,270
If no one can stop Dun Tian,

632
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,920
how much longer can we survive?

633
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,790
I didn't expect the overflowing Space-Time Power

634
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,000
of the Three Thousand Realms Tower

635
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,070
to be so powerful.

636
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,510
If this continues,

637
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,610
before Dun Tian sacrifices the world,

638
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,790
the entire earth will collapse.

639
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,920
Master and Ranran are fighting desperately inside.

640
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,550
As a disciple of the Wester Sect,

641
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
I must also

642
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,830
contribute my strength!

643
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,240
Before Master and Ranran

644
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,230
stop Dun Tian,

645
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,480
let's protect the mortal world!

646
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,270
Uncle Master?

647
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,510
All the Heavenly Ones

648
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,710
who could come are here.

649
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,160
This evil, monstrous thing

650
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,510
is delaying my drinking!

651
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:38,800
Let's handle the important thing first.

652
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,070
You need to survive

653
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,930
to drink your wine.

654
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,350
Use your magical weapons

655
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,720
to resist the overflowing power

656
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,800
of the Three Thousand Realms Tower!

657
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,550
Fellow cultivators,

658
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,570
the demons are wreaking havoc, and the world is in chaos.

659
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,670
As cultivators,

660
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
what should we do?

661
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,030
Hold our swords and protect the world! Even if we die, we'll have no regrets!

662
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,640
Hold our swords and protect the world! Even if we die, we'll have no regrets!

663
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,400
The space-time turbulence

664
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,510
caused me to take so long to land.

665
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,880
Are you alright?

666
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:19,750
I'm fine.

667
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:21,880
Are you alright?

668
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,160
I'm fine.

669
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,270
How did Mount Wester

670
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,240
become like this?

671
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,270
This is a new space created by the Three Thousand Realms Tower,

672
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,430
attached to Mount Wester.

673
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,270
I'm afraid Mount Wester

674
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,280
has already been destroyed beyond recognition

675
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,270
by the space-time turbulence.

676
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,960
Withered trees can sprout again,

677
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,510
and broken houses can be rebuilt.

678
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,270
As long as we're all here,

679
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,930
everything can be started anew.

680
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,200
We somehow

681
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,440
ended up in this hellish place.

682
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,400
How do we get back?

683
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,590
We're here to stop Dun Tian.

684
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,070
Why should we go back?

685
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,640
Stop joking.

686
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,270
The Three Thousand Realms Tower

687
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,960
is an evil being that even immortals can't deal with.

688
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,920
When the tower hadn't formed, there might have been a way.

689
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,480
Now that the tower has formed,

690
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,510
what can we do?

691
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,720
That's right.

692
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,350
Now that things have come to this point,

693
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,550
how can we give up?

694
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,350
It's just one last fight.

695
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,450
Sovereign Wei,

696
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,510
thank you for your help earlier.

697
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,720
Please stay here

698
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and wait for our news.

699
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,590
It created four identical worlds.

700
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,640
It's the infancy of the Three Thousand Realms.

701
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,510
If it's left to grow,

702
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,160
more and more such worlds will appear,

703
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,880
eventually breaking through this space

704
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,240
and extending to the outside world.

705
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,270
The road to the Three Thousand Realms Tower

706
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,550
must be within these four worlds.

707
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,590
We'll find it faster if we split up.

708
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,350
Anyway,

709
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,200
I can't escape from here.

710
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,880
Count me in.

711
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,370
Each of us will carry a golden talisman

712
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,270
and enter one of these four worlds.

713
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,920
Once you find Dun Tian

714
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,750
and the Three Thousand Realms Tower,

715
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,830
light the talisman to signal.

716
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,210
Since this is just the infancy

717
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,270
of the new world,

718
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,560
we should be able

719
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,680
to break through the space and reunite.

720
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,750
If anyone

721
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,790
encounters danger,

722
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,020
we must not act on our own.

723
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,310
Always report first, then plan afterward.

724
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,070
You must be careful,

725
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,240
Ranran!

726
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,790
Why are you...

727
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,680
here?

728
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,960
Dun Tian is in my world.

729
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,710
The others have all fallen into his hands.

730
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,830
Come with me now.

731
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,850
Ranran, why are you doing this?

732
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,720
Shui and I agreed

733
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,960
to report first when anything happens.

734
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,920
But you suddenly barged in here.

735
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,510
Clearly, you're an imposter.

736
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,280
Looks like Dun Tian and the Three Thousand Realms Tower

737
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,190
are within my world.

738
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,710
As expected of Mu Qingge.

739
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,190
Clever indeed.

740
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:16,840
But unfortunately,

741
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,800
you're still going to die here.

742
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,510
Demon's child?

743
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,400
How could he endure the Spirit Spring

744
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,710
while impersonating Shui?

745
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,880
You are...

746
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,280
a shadow person?

747
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,630
That's right.

748
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,190
How could this be?

749
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,280
The shadow people have disappeared.

750
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,840
Why are you...

751
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,020
Since the Two-headed Deceptive Python has two heads,

752
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,330
the first shadow people it created

753
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,110
were two.

754
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,000
One was Wei Jiu,

755
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,480
and the other was me.

756
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,630
As long as we both exist,

757
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,560
the shadow people after us

758
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,840
can be infinitely replicated.

759
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,280
You thought you won

760
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,360
by killing the fake Wei Jiu.

761
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:56,960
How laughable.

762
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,320
I see.

763
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,960
So those shadow people dissipated

764
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,800
to conceal your existence.

765
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,960
I've replicated everything from Su Yishui,

766
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,030
including the body of the Demon's child.

767
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,950
So naturally, I can absorb the Spirit Spring

768
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,910
and use it for my master.

769
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,400
Mu Qingge,

770
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,840
now you should understand.

771
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,390
It's not impossible

772
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
for the Demon Child to kill you!

773
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,550
Shadow people?

774
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,670
When I fell into demonic ways,

775
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,550
Dun Tian led me to summon the Two-headed Deceptive Python.

776
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,660
So that was his plan for me all along.

777
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,670
He was prepared from the start,

778
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,760
intending to trap us.

779
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,880
The Tainted Demonic Serpent Formation has formed.

780
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
It can't be broken in a short time.

781
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,110
Stay here obediently

782
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,400
and wait for the opening of the Three Thousand Realms.

783
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,030
Tu Jiuyuan,

784
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:05,880
are you alright?

785
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,880
You bullied my people?

786
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,140
You're seeking death!

787
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,000
Wei Jiu!

788
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,030
Wei Jiu!

789
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,320
You're nothing.

790
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,190
I won't die.

791
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,000
I will...

792
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,320
get you out of here soon.

793
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,070
Back then,

794
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,550
I used the Blood-bound Net

795
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,480
to trap you two.

796
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,390
I can sacrifice my own blood

797
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,960
and try it again!

798
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,800
It will only last for a moment.

799
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,320
Don't...

800
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
miss it.

801
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,070
Wei Jiu!

802
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,190
The Demon's child is so precious.

803
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,000
How could I bear to release him

804
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,000
and let you kill him?

805
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,070
He is just a shadow

806
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,210
projected by a space

807
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,040
I created.

808
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,480
Since you're here,

809
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,960
then come out and meet me.

810
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,670
This damn Dun Tian.

811
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,920
He made me, a dignified demon lord,

812
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,190
sacrifice myself for others.

813
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,440
How...

814
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,880
How embarrassing.

815
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,510
Wei Jiu is severely injured.

816
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,070
I need to sustain his energy

817
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,840
to heal him.

818
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,510
You must stop Dun Tian.

819
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,800
Alright.

820
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,230
Long time no see.

821
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,830
You don't need to look at me like that.

822
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,590
Su Yishui,

823
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,020
I've been planning this for years.

824
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,380
Among all my pawns,

825
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,190
you are the most disobedient one.

826
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,160
I painstakingly built

827
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,320
countless steps,

828
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,190
and yet you refuse to step on them.

829
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,280
You're so annoying.

830
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,230
Very well.

831
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,440
My whole life

832
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,960
has been burdened by your schemes.

833
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,190
But at least I didn't give you what you want.

834
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,840
If I can cause you some trouble,

835
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,480
that's good enough.

836
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,230
This is your nature.

837
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,840
I've figured it out.

838
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:36,840
It's impossible

839
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,510
to make you change.

840
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,000
The only way

841
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,460
is to create a new version of you.

842
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,710
Finally,

843
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,500
I have your shadow person.

844
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,550
When you destroyed your Golden Core

845
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,710
and separated from the Spirit Spring for Ranran,

846
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,150
I knew

847
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,510
I had succeeded.

848
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,360
I know that Uncle Ye Xin

849
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,440
is just your false form.

850
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,070
But even so,

851
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:07,770
I've always remembered

852
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,760
the favor of your upbringing.

853
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,510
You were born in this world,

854
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,710
grew up in this world,

855
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,360
and the memories you're longing for

856
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,710
also originated from this world.

857
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,630
I'll advise you one last time.

858
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,400
Please stop.

859
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:21,800
Advise me?

860
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,400
Mu Qingge,

861
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,760
if it weren't for you,

862
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,840
I would have reunited with my wife

863
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,150
and children over a decade ago.

864
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,190
If it weren't for you,

865
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,190
Su Yishui wouldn't have

866
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,320
become such a problem.

867
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,590
Yet

868
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,480
you've always wanted to repay the favor

869
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,670
of my upbringing.

870
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,600
But I regret it

871
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,550
every moment.

872
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:39,890
I regret that at that time

873
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,840
I had a whim

874
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,630
and decided to raise you.

875
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,000
But it's all over now.

876
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,230
It will be over soon.

877
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,670
The Three Thousand Realms Tower is about to form.

878
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,190
By then,

879
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,630
I will go and seek my fulfillment.

880
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:55,960
And you

881
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,280
will face your demise!

882
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:10,920
Be careful!

883
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:11,880
Here it comes again!

884
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,080
I will protect you!

885
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,430
One wisp of qi to break the galaxy!

886
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,260
One wisp of qi to break the galaxy!

887
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:45,880
How did this happen?

888
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,000
With our combined attack,

889
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,290
even an immortal

890
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,670
couldn't

891
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,710
heal immediately after being injured.

892
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,070
Unless...

893
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,710
this isn't his true form!

894
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,580
In this painting,

895
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,130
there's a figure under the tower.

896
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,430
The painting we saw in the Celestial Sect.

897
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,030
Forming the tower with a mortal body?

898
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:07,930
Dun Tian is using his own mortal body

899
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,960
to form the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

900
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,900
No wonder, even though we destroyed the tower's core,

901
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,160
he was easily able

902
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,320
to move it to Mount Wester.

903
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,760
That's right.

904
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,320
All of this

905
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,590
is thanks to you.

906
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,470
I am the tower,

907
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,960
and the tower is me.

908
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,990
What do you have to defeat me?
