[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,920
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,350
How did I...

4
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,870
The Resentment Liquid has been neutralized.

5
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:52,990
You can leave now.

6
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,680
Shui,

7
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,310
actually, you and I

8
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,630
shouldn't have come to this.

9
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,800
What are you doing here?

10
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,230
You really dare to act

11
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,450
as if you're the Guardian of this place.

12
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,240
Qingge,

13
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:23,960
how are you feeling?

14
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:26,960
Yu,

15
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,190
Shui has already helped me neutralize the Resentment Liquid.

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,590
You should have told me

17
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,500
you were coming here.

18
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,720
Mount Wester has been occupied

19
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,680
by this man for over a decade.

20
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,000
It's no longer the same as when you were here.

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,630
How can this man

22
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,360
be trusted?

23
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,470
Yu,

24
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,590
times have changed.

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,079
Why do you always

26
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,829
have to be so confrontational with Shui?

27
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
The matter is settled.

28
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,120
Just get out of here.

29
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,120
Young Master Yu.

30
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,030
Why are you here?

31
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,520
Ranran?

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,710
Ranran?

33
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,030
Ranran?

34
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,560
Ranran.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
You know His Highness?

36
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,260
What?

37
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,470
Are you saying

38
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,360
Young Master Yu is the Crown Prince?

39
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,390
So his annual visits to the foot of Mount Absolute

40
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,210
were all to wait for Master Mu?

41
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,560
I knew it.

42
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,090
Clearly, His Highness

43
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,960
is here

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,360
for Master Mu.

45
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,090
This is exactly

46
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,280
like the rumor

47
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,470
I heard before.

48
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,360
What rumor?

49
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,430
Stop being so mysterious.

50
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,590
It's said

51
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,800
that Master had feelings

52
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,560
for the immortal master.

53
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,310
But Master Mu

54
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,770
only cared about the Prince Zong's legitimate son,

55
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,790
now the Crown Prince.

56
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,240
They were the ones truly in love.

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,430
That's why Master

58
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,170
turned love into hatred.

59
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,520
In the end,

60
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,240
he killed his master.

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,400
Master is not the kind of person

62
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,910
who would destroy something just because he couldn't have it.

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,190
Stop spreading

64
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,040
these ridiculous rumors.

65
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,190
Exactly.

66
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,230
Believe it or not.

67
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,750
I'm leaving. Off to practice.

68
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,630
Ranran,

69
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,670
I saw how happy and admiring you were

70
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,000
when you talked about Young Master Yu before.

71
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,750
I was worried

72
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,800
that you might be upset,

73
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,560
since he's so close with Grandmaster.

74
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,970
But you seem fine now.

75
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,870
I'm relieved.

76
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm off to practice.

77
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,070
Yeah.

78
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,870
Weird.

79
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,190
Why is it that now when I see him,

80
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,940
I don't feel as happy as before?

81
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,270
It's...

82
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,110
My wishful thinking.

83
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,360
But I am

84
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,120
in love with Young Master Yu.

85
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,720
Young...

86
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,190
Your Highness, Master Mu,

87
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,070
please have some tea.

88
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,310
I apologize

89
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,750
for concealing my identity earlier

90
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,680
for convenience when I was out.

91
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,190
From now on,

92
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,000
you can still call me Young Master Yu.

93
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,310
No need to be formal.

94
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,720
How do you two know each other?

95
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,510
Because of her winemaking skill.

96
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,190
You must try the wine she made.

97
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,980
Mount Wester doesn't entertain guests with wine.

98
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,360
Ranran,

99
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,530
look, someone

100
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,550
has a habit of showing up uninvited.

101
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,870
I'm catching up with you.

102
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,950
What business is it of his?

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,950
But how did you end up at Mount Wester?

104
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,480
Some changes occurred.

105
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,480
Luckily, Master saved me.

106
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,120
You're inexperienced.

107
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,390
Don't let yourself be deceived.

108
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,620
If you're bullied,

109
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,120
feel free to tell me.

110
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,720
When did the affairs of Mount Wester

111
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,270
become your place to gossip?

112
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,600
Mount Wester, to me,

113
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,630
is nothing more than Qingge's old residence.

114
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,830
Back then, she liked staying here,

115
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,480
so I built the palace

116
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,530
to make her comfortable.

117
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,730
Now the Eastern Palace is her residence.

118
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,270
I couldn't care less

119
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,600
if it's Mount Easter or Mount Wester.

120
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,159
I'm merely

121
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,390
reminding this young girl

122
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,870
to be careful in dealing with others.

123
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,460
Thank you for your kind intentions, Young Master Yu,

124
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,159
but Master is very nice.

125
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,040
Am I?

126
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Master

127
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,720
wants me to praise him

128
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,430
in front of Grandmaster?

129
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,390
Master is not good with words

130
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,950
and may appear cold on the surface.

131
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,700
But, in fact,

132
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,920
he is very responsible

133
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,800
and is willing to help the weak.

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
He's kind-hearted and gentle.

135
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,270
Especially when it comes to those

136
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,240
who are most important to him,

137
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,930
he always gives his all

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,070
and silently dedicates himself.

139
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,630
Ranran,

140
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,800
you've only known him for a few days.

141
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,270
He

142
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,130
is the most heartless.

143
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,750
He turns on people without mercy.

144
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,800
Do you think

145
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,040
someone

146
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,270
who even killed his own master

147
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,730
has any conscience left?

148
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:50,680
Yu,

149
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,070
it's all in the past.

150
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,480
Why bring up old matters?

151
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,750
Qingge,

152
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,600
you're magnanimous,

153
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,750
but what happened can't be changed.

154
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,480
He will forever

155
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,240
let you down.

156
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,750
He doesn't deserve your forgiveness.

157
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,840
You've had your tea. No need to see you out.

158
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,430
Why?

159
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,000
Trying to drive us away because the truth hurts?

160
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,950
Ranran,

161
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,270
you must see his true colors.

162
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,460
If you ask me,

163
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,200
you should leave this evil master immediately.

164
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,910
Come down the mountain with us.

165
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,560
It would be better to cultivate with Qingge.

166
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,680
You're asking for death!

167
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,330
Su Yishui, have you lost your mind?

168
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,400
Master, please calm your anger!

169
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,870
Su Yishui!

170
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,030
You dare to do it but not admit it?

171
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,320
Your hands are stained with Mu Qingge's blood.

172
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,480
Do you still expect her

173
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
to treat you as before?

174
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,360
Young Master Yu was just joking.

175
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,030
He's not a cultivator.

176
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,400
You'll hurt him if you continue like this.

177
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,550
You and I

178
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,390
shall never meet again,

179
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,230
for eternity.

180
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,870
Get out!

181
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,950
Are you all right?

182
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,870
I'm fine.

183
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:25,960
Your Highness,

184
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,520
Master Mu's magical artifacts

185
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,240
are all here.

186
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,090
Please check if anything is missing.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,150
What about the Ironclad White Tiger?

188
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,510
Bai doesn't want to come out.

189
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,240
All of us

190
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,390
couldn't budge it no matter how hard we tried.

191
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Since its spiritual power has been damaged,

192
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,750
it's now the size of a tiny kitten.

193
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,880
Master Mu,

194
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,080
I guess you won't need it anymore, right?

195
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,390
That beast,

196
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,770
once so affectionate towards you,

197
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,120
has now turned its back on you.

198
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,060
Never mind, let's not force it.

199
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,200
Yu, let's go.

200
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,600
Why, compared to Young Master Yu,

201
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,600
do I care more about

202
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,720
whether Master is happy or not?

203
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,790
Master is so upset because of Grandmaster,

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,240
and I feel sad too.

205
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,790
Where are you going?

206
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,270
Still thinking of seeing Su Yu off?

207
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,390
No.

208
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,910
They've left.

209
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,480
I saw that you

210
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,630
were very angry today,

211
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,870
so I wanted

212
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,910
to prepare some cooling tea for you.

213
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,840
You'd better be.

214
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,000
Yes.

215
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,270
Don't be fond of Su Yu.

216
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,600
He's not good enough.

217
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,720
How jealous is Master

218
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,480
because of Grandmaster?

219
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,200
Master's really confused by anger.

220
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,080
Why didn't you say this to Grandmaster?

221
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,000
What?

222
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,750
I think

223
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,720
you clearly have something on your mind,

224
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,390
yet you keep your heart closed,

225
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,360
making it impossible for others to see through you.

226
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,200
If I were Grandmaster,

227
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,030
I would naturally think Young Master Yu is better too

228
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,960
and more likable.

229
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,550
Shut up!

230
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,840
No, Master,

231
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,630
I just think

232
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,000
you could tell Grandmaster your...

233
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,480
What's wrong?

234
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:40,960
Stiffly Su,

235
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,000
can't you calm down?

236
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,120
What's triggered you this time?

237
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,130
Is it because of that Su Yu?

238
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,000
Listen.

239
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,080
Given your condition,

240
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,270
I'm afraid you won't be able

241
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,440
to suppress the backfire of the Ice Lotus Technique,

242
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,960
you know?

243
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,840
She's Ranran now,

244
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,880
and all those past events

245
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,600
between you two

246
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,990
have nothing to do with her anymore.

247
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,240
She has her own life now.

248
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,290
Whether it's Su Yu

249
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,200
or anyone else,

250
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,530
it's not something you can control.

251
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,320
Do you understand?

252
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,390
I'm telling you,

253
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,970
you'd better bury those little thoughts of yours

254
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,150
deep down.

255
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,270
If the backfire hits

256
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,910
and shatters your Ice Lotus core,

257
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,550
causing you to lose your Transcendence Realm power,

258
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,200
how will you seal the Spirit Spring?

259
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,000
Master.

260
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,600
Stay still.

261
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,960
This stubborn blockhead.

262
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,360
Ranran,

263
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,180
you've come to bring food for your master?

264
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,270
The weather suddenly changed.

265
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,500
Some hot soup would be comforting.

266
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,670
He can't eat anything.

267
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,480
Don't worry about him.

268
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,200
It's so cold out.

269
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,600
You should go back and rest.

270
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
But I said something wrong

271
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,910
and upset Master.

272
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,320
I should apologize and accept punishment.

273
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,750
I'm worried about Master.

274
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,670
What do you have to apologize for?

275
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,750
Since it's his own problem,

276
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,480
he should deal with it himself.

277
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,600
Do you know why I didn't reunite with Master

278
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,270
when she returned to Mount Wester?

279
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,790
Master has finally gotten a chance

280
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,870
to live again.

281
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,210
We, as her disciples,

282
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,510
shouldn't become her burden.

283
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:07,910
Right?

284
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,810
All right, all right.

285
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,600
Look, the weather has changed.

286
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,600
Hurry back, hurry back.

287
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,630
Mr. Zeng.

288
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,690
Let's go. Let's go.

289
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,440
Yu.

290
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,320
I went to find Shui.

291
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,870
Are you not happy about that?

292
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,320
I'm afraid the ungrateful man

293
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,200
would hurt you again.

294
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,030
Qingge,

295
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,170
you used to protect me in the past.

296
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,150
But now,

297
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,510
I am the Crown Prince regent.

298
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,840
I've also recruited talented individuals

299
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,800
and established the Exotic Pavilion.

300
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,170
With me here,

301
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,320
you don't need to rely on anyone else.

302
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
I've already died once.

303
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,240
In this life,

304
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,200
I understand

305
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,840
who truly cares for me.

306
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,320
Qingge.

307
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,360
You've finally understood my feelings for you.

308
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,870
This time,

309
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,910
I can't miss the opportunity again.

310
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,320
I intended to propose back then,

311
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,910
but I was a step too late.

312
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,320
I hope

313
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,390
that popping the question now

314
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,750
is not too late.

315
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,000
Qingge,

316
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,090
would you be willing

317
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,160
to become my Crown Princess?

318
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,510
I've waited for this moment

319
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,840
for 18 years.

320
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,910
This famine has swept through this place.

321
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,440
Along the Jiangnan region,

322
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,550
who knows how many refugees have died.

323
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,090
Give it to me! This is mine!

324
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,350
Don't hit my sister!

325
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,790
Don't hit my sister!

326
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,120
Give it to me!

327
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:07,960
Stop it!

328
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,960
Qingge, are you all right?

329
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:16,510
Yes.

330
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,120
Here.

331
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
This is from the lord.

332
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,030
Your sister is still hungry.

333
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,670
Shouldn't you save some for her?

334
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,120
It's okay.

335
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,630
I don't need it.

336
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,870
This girl is generous.

337
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,480
Why don't we take her back to the mansion

338
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,440
to do some work?

339
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,200
Would you like that, Miss?

340
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,270
I'd rather be free

341
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,630
than be a slave to wealth.

342
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,480
I will carve out a path for myself.

343
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,380
For your kindness of a meal,

344
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,010
[Young Mu Qingge]

345
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,670
I will surely repay you in the future.

346
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,360
Fine, I'll wait for you.

347
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,910
Qingge,

348
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,690
[Young Mu Ranwu]

349
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,240
why don't we go?

350
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,960
Wu,

351
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,150
relying on others is not a long-term solution.

352
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,000
Besides, we've got arms and legs.

353
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,650
We can completely rely on ourselves.

354
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,000
Don't worry.

355
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,120
With me here,

356
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,120
I'll make sure you survive.

357
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,430
'Rely on ourselves.' Well said.

358
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,910
Interesting.

359
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,380
I just saw that you

360
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,910
seem to have some potential.

361
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,240
Would you like to learn some real skills?

362
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,120
Qingge,

363
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,760
you truly deserve the Five Spirit Roots.

364
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,030
You have already mastered

365
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,000
all of my techniques.

366
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,670
Today, you can graduate.

367
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,670
I suppose,

368
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,670
your name

369
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,720
will soon be known in the martial world.

370
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,150
In the future,

371
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,630
you will surely become a legend.

372
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,440
There is still a long way to go.

373
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,480
Wu will also make progress,

374
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,480
right?

375
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,390
Wu,

376
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,650
you must know

377
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,349
that being ordinary is a blessing.

378
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,270
Wu.

379
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,960
Back then, when we were at our wits' end,

380
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,410
if you had used that packet of arsenic,

381
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,640
I would have been saved early on.

382
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,280
We wouldn't have had to,

383
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,240
in the freezing snow,

384
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,630
walk for half a month.

385
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
My Spirit Root was permanently damaged by the cold,

386
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,950
which makes it hard for me to improve my cultivation.

387
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,000
Why?

388
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,080
Why do you always prioritize others' lives

389
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,210
over mine?

390
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,240
Wu,

391
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,030
there are many other paths in this world.

392
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,720
It's okay not to pursue cultivation.

393
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,640
How can it be okay?

394
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,720
You who pursue cultivation can live for thousands of years

395
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,890
and never age.

396
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,750
But what about me?

397
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,440
I am a mortal.

398
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,620
I will eventually grow old

399
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,360
and die.

400
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,130
You let me watch with open eyes

401
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,400
the endless wonders of the immortal world,

402
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,200
yet I get nothing.

403
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,310
When I grow old,

404
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,830
what will I do?

405
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,510
Don't worry.

406
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,550
When the time comes,

407
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,750
I will refine the best elixir

408
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,860
for you.

409
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,410
You taught me

410
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,960
that relying on others is not a long-term solution.

411
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,510
I will not always be beneath you.

412
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,830
I'm Mu Qingge and she's Mu Ranwu.

413
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,880
We're here to repay a debt of gratitude.

414
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,000
Repay a debt of gratitude?

415
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,550
Eight years ago,

416
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,030
you gave us

417
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,920
the kindness of a meal.

418
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,240
It's you.

419
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,160
You've actually remembered until now.

420
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,230
Since you're here,

421
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,830
let's go to Prince Zong's residence and have a seat.

422
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,250
-Sure.
-I have...

423
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,540
Then let Wu go in my place.

424
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,180
All right.

425
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,260
[Prince Zong's Residence]

426
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,680
Do you like it here?

427
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,720
Yes, I do.

428
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,160
I have refined my Golden Core.

429
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,690
I can help Yu now.

430
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,880
Why do I...

431
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,480
Why is this happening?

432
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,070
Wu,

433
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,400
tell Yu

434
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,290
I want to help him.

435
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,710
What you can give him

436
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,510
is something I can never give.

437
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,640
How could he not want it?

438
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,000
Compared to her,

439
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,270
you lack far more than just magical power.

440
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,310
You'll never compare to her.

441
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,110
We are sisters!

442
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,610
Yet how come all the good things in the universe

443
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,480
are taken by you?

444
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,750
You have your natural talent.

445
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,030
I only resent that I'm not granted.

446
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,030
Now,

447
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,240
you're even taking away

448
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,750
the only person I love.

449
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,440
The worldly riches and honors

450
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,350
are all being handed to you.

451
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,200
Why?

452
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,400
I don't believe in fate.

453
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,200
I, Mu Ranwu,

454
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,310
will definitely take everything of yours

455
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,960
into my own hands.

456
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,160
Qingge, will you marry me?

457
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,670
Am I... Am I not dreaming?

458
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,070
Living this life again

459
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,640
has given me a chance

460
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,270
to think through many things.

461
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,310
I

462
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,520
have let the past grievances all go.

463
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,070
In this life,

464
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,070
I only want to stay

465
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,350
by the side of the most important person

466
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,590
without wasting this life.

467
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,920
I, Su Yu,

468
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,700
will never let you down in this life.

469
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,240
Once Father's health improves slightly,

470
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,620
I will request permission to hold our grand wedding.

471
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,680
The position of Crown Princess

472
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,750
will finally be mine.

473
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,030
M-Master.

474
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,680
Why are you practicing at this time?

475
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,380
No.

476
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,210
I just wanted to dig up some Ice Lotus seeds

477
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,480
to make lotus seed soup for you.

478
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,000
Since you're idle,

479
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,580
why don't you familiarize yourself with the techniques?

480
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,500
With a heart as clear as ice,

481
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,960
I'm fearless even if the sky collapses.

482
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,480
Mind and spirit as one.

483
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,720
What's so good about him anyway?

484
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,730
Him?

485
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,440
Young Master Yu?

486
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,570
Master is indeed still concerned.

487
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,160
It's understandable.

488
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,160
Grandmaster left with Young Master Yu.

489
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,710
Master must be very heartbroken.

490
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,160
And I said such things.

491
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,760
I should praise Master generously instead

492
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,510
to make him feel better.

493
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,770
No matter how good others are,

494
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,280
they can't compare to you.

495
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,550
You're elegant and otherworldly,

496
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,510
like fine jade.

497
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,550
You're lofty and above it all...

498
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,720
No, that's not right.

499
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,830
You aim high with far-reaching ambitions.

500
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,200
Just like these Ice Lotus.

501
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,920
They may seem cold at first glance,

502
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,000
but upon closer inspection,

503
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,320
they're refreshing to the heart and mind.

504
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,190
They actually make one feel warm and close.

505
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,640
Do you really think so?

506
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:35,780
Of...

507
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,070
The altar is a place of utmost purity.

508
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,350
Only with a clear mind and spirit can one stand there.

509
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,020
You will be thrown off if you lie.

510
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,690
But I didn't lie.

511
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,660
I just exaggerated a little bit.

512
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,640
So,

513
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,720
what's so good

514
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,400
about Su Yu after all?

515
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,320
Actually, you and Young Master Yu

516
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,200
are different.

517
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,750
He is a little gentler.

518
00:23:59,010 --> 00:23:59,840
When he smiles,

519
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,230
it's like a warm spring breeze.

520
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,130
But...

521
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,960
There's still a 'but,' Master!

522
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,520
But you may seem cold on the surface,

523
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,900
yet you have a warm heart.

524
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,030
I can't even repay Master's kindness,

525
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,400
yet I angered him

526
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
hundreds of times every day.

527
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,520
Xue Ranran, look what you've done!

528
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,640
Come out.

529
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,790
Your Highness.

530
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,760
From now on, you'll be responsible for protecting Qingge.

531
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,140
However, given her personality,

532
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,720
she won't accept it.

533
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,510
Don't let her find out.

534
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,400
Yes,

535
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,750
I understand.

536
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,640
Loser!

537
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,000
You can only improve

538
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,440
[Young Wei Jiu]

539
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,920
to this level?

540
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,140
[Old Sovereign of the Scarlet Sect]

541
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,240
Too slow!

542
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,590
My Lord.

543
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,550
Who allowed you to enter?

544
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,920
Get out!

545
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,830
My Lord, you mustn't be too hasty.

546
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,720
There's a risk of cultivation deviation.

547
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,960
I

548
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,510
happened to obtain a Spirit-Molding Pill.

549
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,310
It can help you quickly restore your magical power.

550
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,590
Such a useful item,

551
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,350
and you don't use it yourself, Elder Tu?

552
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,510
Tu Jiuyuan!

553
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,160
You...

554
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,030
How dare you...

555
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,480
I am doing this for your own good, My Lord.

556
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,690
Please rest assured and focus on your recovery, My Lord.

557
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
This Spirit-Molding Pill

558
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,750
is indeed beneficial, to my surprise.

559
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,550
Tu Jiuyuan.

560
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,350
Although I am in seclusion,

561
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,170
I still have my informants

562
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,570
watch your every move

563
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,110
and pay attention to the news about the Spirit Spring.

564
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,160
I advise you

565
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,520
not to harbor any thoughts of usurping my position.

566
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,070
Elder.

567
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,030
You have already offered the Spirit-Molding Pill

568
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,030
to our lord?

569
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,320
It isn't in vain that you

570
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,340
went to great lengths to collect spirit fruits

571
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,200
and used your heart's blood to refine this pill.

572
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,000
Now that our lord has benefited from it,

573
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,080
he will surely

574
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,240
understand your loyalty

575
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,350
and won't keep targeting you anymore,

576
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,160
right?

577
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,480
As long as half of the Scarlet Sect Token

578
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,930
remains in my possession,

579
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,800
he will continue

580
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,030
to see me as a thorn in his side.

581
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,440
But I promised the former sovereign

582
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,430
to safeguard the Scarlet Sect Token in my hands.

583
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,960
This was the former sovereign's dying wish.

584
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,200
Yes.

585
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,580
[Young Tu Jiuyuan]

586
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,920
Wei Jiu, you're hurt.

587
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,720
It's nothing.

588
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,240
Stop whining.

589
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,160
Here's a Revitalizing Pill.

590
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,350
Take it.

591
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
There's only one.

592
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,070
What about you?

593
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,880
When I tell you to take it, just take it quickly.

594
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,040
We're a team for this trial.

595
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,440
I'm your boss.

596
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,960
As long as you don't hold me back,

597
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,720
we'll definitely win.

598
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,110
From now on,

599
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,160
I won't hold you back anymore.

600
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,310
Those times from before

601
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,610
can never be found again.

602
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,210
Grandmaster's Nine-Transformation Dark Iron Furnace.

603
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,720
Master actually gave it to me.

604
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,400
And I even made Master angry.

605
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,240
That was really inappropriate of me.

606
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,550
What?

607
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,310
You even dared to add fuel to the fire?

608
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,070
I heard that back then, Grandmaster

609
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,830
was the universe's top alchemist.

610
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,610
All she wanted

611
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,110
was to create the best pill in the world for her sister.

612
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,750
To think that Grandmaster, a Demon's child,

613
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,400
actually cared so deeply for someone.

614
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,170
If you ask me,

615
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,960
there are many legends

616
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,160
surrounding Grandmaster.

617
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,200
Ever since she came up the mountain,

618
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,170
this entire Mount Wester

619
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,350
has been enveloped in the scent

620
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:18,960
of Master's heartbreak.

621
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,510
I can hardly breathe.

622
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,880
When will these bitter days

623
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,790
finally come to an end?

624
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,960
It seems Master's heartbreak

625
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,960
is truly severe.

626
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,800
We need to quickly find a way

627
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,720
to help him recover.

628
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,110
Oh, right.

629
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,680
The Collection of Entertainment

630
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,960
mentions how to make dried longan.

631
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,680
Why don't I

632
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,730
make some of Master's favorite food

633
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,790
as a form of food therapy?

634
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,270
I'll get going now.

635
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,110
Okay.

636
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,200
Heartbreak.

637
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,030
I've also thought of a good idea.

638
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,500
It's hard to choose, isn't it?

639
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,210
What are you all gathered here for?

640
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,370
Ranran, look, look.

641
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:08,720
Have a seat.

642
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,790
As the saying goes,

643
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
'There are plenty of fish in the sea.'

644
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,520
To get over heartbreak,

645
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,000
the best way

646
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,550
is to start a new relationship.

647
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,680
As long as we

648
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,210
find a female immortal master

649
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,920
as beautiful as Grandmaster,

650
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,400
we don't need to worry about

651
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,720
Master not finding a satisfactory partner,

652
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,960
do we?

653
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,650
Is it okay for you to do this?

654
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,160
Would this method go too far?

655
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,440
Don't worry.

656
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,790
I've heard

657
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,720
that Master was originally from a noble family,

658
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,080
so he's not really

659
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,160
a person of few desires.

660
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,750
Since he could like Grandmaster,

661
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,850
he can naturally

662
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,960
like other female immortal masters,

663
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,550
right?

664
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,070
Weird.

665
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:44,760
Even though I know

666
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,030
it's to help Master move on,

667
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,480
why do I

668
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,610
feel somewhat

669
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,590
uneasy about it?

670
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,550
Xue Ranran,

671
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
you must have practiced too much in the Ice Lotus Pool

672
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,000
and become confused.

673
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,150
Master.

674
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,680
Why aren't you practicing?

675
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,160
Why are you fiddling with books and paintings here?

676
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,570
Master,

677
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,240
we just feel that Mount Wester

678
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,440
is a bit too quiet.

679
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,440
Why don't we invite some immortal masters

680
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,310
to visit here?

681
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:31,940
Master, look.

682
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,000
This Master Song Qingyan from the Qingyang Sect

683
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,040
was top-ranked

684
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,590
in last year's Immortal Beauty Rankings.

685
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,930
Master, can you tell

686
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,960
how old she is?

687
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,200
This Master Song

688
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,190
is best at the art of preserving youth.

689
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,830
So, even in her forties,

690
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,480
she can still remain pure and elegant,

691
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
surpassing all in beauty.

692
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,510
Master,

693
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,830
don't you want to invite her

694
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,070
to visit Mount Wester

695
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,440
and learn some immortal techniques?

696
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,510
She has a nice name.

697
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,310
It suits her temperament.

698
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,550
But what does it have to do with me?

699
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,640
You may not know

700
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
that in the immortal realm,

701
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,240
there's a saying that goes,

702
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,880
'Su Yishui is the most handsome among all men,

703
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,160
and Song Qingyan is the most beautiful among all women.'

704
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,720
Some matchmakers

705
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,590
have already paired you two

706
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,480
together.

707
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,800
Master, take a closer look.

708
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,590
You're truly a perfect match.

709
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,790
You're truly a perfect match.

710
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,710
If you're willing,

711
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,680
why don't you invite Master Song to Mount Wester

712
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,480
to discuss the art of preserving youth?

713
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,270
Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing?

714
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,030
Since you've wasted so much breath,

715
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,930
you think I'm too old, huh?

716
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,820
No, no, no!

717
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,920
Master,

718
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,070
you're so vibrant.

719
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,270
You seem even younger than me.

720
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,750
Let's try another.

721
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,680
Let's try another.

722
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,070
Master,

723
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,250
what about

724
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,900
Master Bi Yun from the Cangqiong Sect?

725
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,220
It's said

726
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,110
that she has a voice like a lark,

727
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,640
clear and melodious.

728
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
Just listening to her speak

729
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,650
is like being in a celestial realm,

730
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,680
making one's body and mind relaxed.

731
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
If you

732
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,510
have any worries,

733
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,680
having her come here

734
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,830
could solve them all.

735
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,690
So you think

736
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,620
my voice is unpleasant

737
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,720
and I have worries, huh?

738
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,970
No, no, no!

739
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,720
Try another, come on.

740
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,480
As for Master Wen,

741
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,480
I don't need to say much, right?

742
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,440
I heard

743
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,550
you and she were childhood friends

744
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:42,770
and...

745
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,480
And you were quite compatible.

746
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,560
If it weren't for Grandmaster back then,

747
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,550
you and Master Wen

748
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,680
would have already become a couple.

749
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,000
Master, would you like

750
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,240
to invite her to the mountain

751
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,020
to reminisce about old times?

752
00:33:59,310 --> 00:33:59,750
Enough!

753
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,350
I understand

754
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,030
what you're all implying.

755
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,830
How dare you

756
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,030
meddle in

757
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,880
your master's personal affairs!

758
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,400
Pack all of these up!

759
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,150
Go to the training field and practice for two extra hours.

760
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,690
Yes, Master.

761
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:22,960
Oh no!

762
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,070
Ranran,

763
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,080
why did you put the communication talisman in

764
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,120
too?

765
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,090
It's all been sent out.

766
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,929
The peach blossoms on the back mountain have bloomed.

767
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,800
Beautiful scenery needs a beauty to complement it.

768
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,670
I have admired you for a long time

769
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,179
and wish to invite you to enjoy the view together.

770
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,920
Immortal Master, please have some tea.

771
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,360
It's so lively here.

772
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,150
Could it be

773
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,220
[Master Peach Blossom]

774
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,730
that you're all here to appreciate the flowers?

775
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,030
Even Master Peach Blossom has come.

776
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,970
You're even more elegant and handsome

777
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,510
than the legends say.

778
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,810
No wonder people say

779
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,670
Su Yishui bewitches people with his looks

780
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,920
and causes chaos among the masses.

781
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,480
I have to say,

782
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,880
Mu Qingge

783
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,230
really had good taste back then.

784
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,180
Master doesn't like noise to begin with.

785
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,480
We're going to

786
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,840
get scolded to death by Master later.

787
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,760
Sovereign Su, what do you mean by this?

788
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,780
I even had some good feelings towards you.

789
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,710
I didn't expect

790
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,150
you to be such a frivolous person.

791
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,630
You called us all here

792
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,550
to make us compete for you,

793
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,630
didn't you?

794
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,930
You're quite attractive

795
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,270
yet fickle-hearted, huh?

796
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,150
Let's go. Let's go.

797
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,190
No matter how handsome he is,

798
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
such a man doesn't deserve us.

799
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,190
Fellow immortals, come to your senses.

800
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,440
Let's go back and focus on our immortal cultivation.

801
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,810
If you want to leave, then leave.

802
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,640
I've finally

803
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,630
gotten to see Sovereign Su.

804
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,630
I want to stay.

805
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,060
I truly have no intention of toying with you all.

806
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,680
These unworthy disciples

807
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,550
misused a magical artifact,

808
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,360
causing this absurd situation unintentionally.

809
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,030
They caused this trouble themselves,

810
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,590
so they should apologize themselves.

811
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,510
Esteemed Immortal Masters,

812
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,400
I'm truly sorry.

813
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,280
My master has no such intentions.

814
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,070
It was all my unintentional mistake,

815
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,400
which caused a misunderstanding.

816
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,760
I've wasted everyone's time.

817
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,550
I apologize to everyone.

818
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,760
And us too.

819
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,360
We apologize to you.

820
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,230
Since it was unintentional,

821
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,360
it only proves

822
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,150
that fate is secretly bringing us together.

823
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,550
Sovereign Su,

824
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,320
it doesn't matter whether there is intention at first.

825
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,480
Feelings

826
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,070
can be cultivated.

827
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,920
As for the others,

828
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,090
if you want to leave, then leave.

829
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,630
I will stay alone

830
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,550
to compete in beauty

831
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,400
with the peach blossoms of Mount Wester.

832
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,480
Immortal Master, please return as well.

833
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,320
I have cultivated the Unfeeling Mantra.

834
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,540
I have no such intentions.

835
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,260
Could it be that the rumor about Sovereign Su

836
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,000
developing feelings for Mu Qingge over time

837
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,920
and still unable to forget her

838
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,800
is true?

839
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,280
See the guests out.

840
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,840
Immortal Master,

841
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:09,800
please.

842
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,070
My Peach Blossom Sect

843
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,650
specializes in teaching people to pursue love.

844
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,480
We never fail in matchmaking.

845
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,680
Your disciple

846
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,760
has humiliated me today

847
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,740
and damaged my sect's reputation.

848
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,160
With a few words of apology,

849
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,320
you think you can send me away?

850
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,760
My disciple has already apologized.

851
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,440
If you're still unsatisfied,

852
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,590
direct it at me.

853
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,200
Su Yishui rarely

854
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,710
showed such protective feelings so openly.

855
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,880
This female disciple...

856
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,070
I see.

857
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,360
Sovereign Su's attitude towards this female disciple is that

858
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,360
the more harshly you scold her verbally,

859
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,200
the more you protect her in your heart.

860
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:51,960
All right.

861
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,280
Since it was a misunderstanding,

862
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,480
let's leave now.

863
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,760
Don't delay any further.

864
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,960
Since Master Wen has spoken,

865
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,320
I won't linger any longer either.

866
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,550
Farewell.

867
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,460
[Carefree Pavilion]

868
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,670
I'm not giving up so easily.

869
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,320
What Unfeeling Mantra?

870
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,800
My Peach Blossom Intoxication

871
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,030
will surely break it.

872
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,880
Anyone who falls under my Peach Blossom Intoxication

873
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,760
will fall in love

874
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,370
with the first person he sees

875
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,480
uncontrollably.

876
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:56,920
Oh no.

877
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:09,920
Yu Chen,

878
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,150
help me change my clothes.

879
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,260
Master,

880
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,430
let me help you.

881
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,400
Xue Ranran,

882
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,440
have you lost your mad?

883
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,400
Master,

884
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,400
this dark robe is too stuffy.

885
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,320
It doesn't look good at all.

886
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,760
Let me give you a red outfit.

887
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,400
Master, you've been gloomy for so long.

888
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,670
It's time to change your clothes

889
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,700
and your mood.

890
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,880
It's said that when you wear red,

891
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,590
you're the most mesmerizing.

892
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,630
Indeed, you can captivate everyone.

893
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,880
Your beauty is truly bewitching.

894
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,510
No wonder Grandmaster forcibly brought you to the mountain.

895
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,670
She must have been enchanted by your beauty.

896
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,960
Are you so drunk

897
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,440
that you're acting so unrestrained?

898
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,760
Xue Ranran, listen.

899
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,510
I'll punish you...

900
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,590
I really don't understand.

901
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,840
Why is such a handsome face

902
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,880
always so cold?

903
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,390
Why do your deep eyes

904
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,950
always emit a cold light?

905
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,480
Why do you always talk about punishment

906
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,420
with such a nice voice?

907
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,440
Xue Ranran,

908
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,920
are you drunk?

909
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,230
I'm not drunk.

910
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,320
Look,

911
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,490
one's body

912
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,680
doesn't lie.

913
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,150
When I drink too much, I grow trees.

914
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,630
There are none now.

915
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,150
How come a leek has grown?

916
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,480
Master,

917
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,760
do you remember that day

918
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,960
when we stole green onions together?

919
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,450
Let me pin it on your new clothes

920
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,170
as a decoration.

921
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:40,630
What...

922
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,440
What exactly are you trying to do?

923
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,840
Master,

924
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,000
you're so smart.

925
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,400
Why can't you move on

926
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,510
from your broken heart?

927
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,280
Since Grandmaster

928
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,400
has a new love interest,

929
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,360
you should let go of the past

930
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,360
and look forward.

931
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,440
Absurd.

932
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,030
When have I ever been hung up on this?

933
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,960
Are you sober now?

934
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,240
Have you had enough of this nonsense?

935
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,330
M-Master...

936
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,000
Believe it or not,

937
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,110
I-I just wanted to come and apologize.

938
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,480
If I had known, I would have listened to Ranran

939
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,770
and brought Master dried longan.

940
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,400
Otherwise,

941
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:46,960
it wouldn't have come to this.

942
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,630
Forget about it.

943
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,330
I'm even more embarrassed.

944
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,330
Master,

945
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,070
let me help you.

946
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,550
It's time to change your clothes

947
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,590
and your mood.

948
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:40,670
♫I've shed thousands of tears, but my feelings haven't run dry♫

949
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,180
Don't cling to it.

950
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,710
Let go of my thoughts.

951
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,230
Why is such a handsome face

952
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,560
♫Hatred adds grayness to my hair♫

953
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,880
always so cold?

954
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,630
Let go of my thoughts.

955
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,900
♫Which side does destiny choose?♫

956
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,360
Your deep eyes.

957
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,110
Your nice voice.

958
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:55,290
♫Demon or immortal?♫

959
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,670
Let go of my improper thoughts!

960
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,190
Why can't you move on

961
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:01,350
♫With you by my side, I'm fearless in the face of life's hardships♫

962
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,260
from your broken heart?

963
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:58,710
Don't cling to it.

964
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,570
Let go of my improper thoughts quickly!

965
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:05,820
♫If love wants me to die♫

966
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,340
♫We'll be together again when the flowers bloom♫

967
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:15,820
♫The moment between us is worth 10,000 years♫
