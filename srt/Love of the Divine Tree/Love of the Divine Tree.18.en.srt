00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,910
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,039
I made this myself.

4
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,400
It's for you.

5
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,509
You used to be into such stuff.

6
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,790
"Used to"?

7
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,840
Master, you...

8
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,560
Master, you drunk?

9
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,520
Master, who do you

10
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,680
take me for?

11
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,079
Who?

12
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,430
You're the one I've been thinking about

13
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,630
for these 19 years, of course.

14
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,430
What about you?

15
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,620
What am I to you?

16
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,810
I used to think

17
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,630
you had at least some feelings for me.

18
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,680
But after stirring up emotions

19
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,800
I couldn't bear to let go of,

20
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,890
you still chose Su Yu.

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,240
Master, you're drunk.

22
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,560
I'm not...

23
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,520
Then tell me.

24
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,310
Everyone says

25
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,710
Mu Qingge was so obsessed with me.

26
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,560
Was that true?

27
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,240
Someone smiled at you,

28
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,680
treated you well,

29
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,079
and called you the best,

30
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,460
making you think this was an obsession.

31
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,240
But it was all bullshit.

32
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,960
♫Fallen leaves swirling and covering the empty garden♫

33
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,870
If I were given another chance,

34
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,870
I would still fall deeply in love.

35
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:52,710
♫Clouds and dust rolling in the distant sky♫

36
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,470
I just

37
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,680
couldn't avoid it.

38
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,750
♫Generations of dreams fold into one♫

39
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,190
I've long known I shouldn't,

40
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,590
♫Solitary branches hidden in clothing♫

41
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,240
and I don't deserve it.

42
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,590
♫Extend fate to call you back; How lucky to meet by chance♫

43
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,680
But even if it's just a fleeting moment of affection,

44
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,310
I still want to indulge in it.

45
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,590
♫I've shed thousands of tears, but my feelings haven't run dry♫

46
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,450
But God loves playing tricks on me.

47
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,690
♫Hatred adds grayness to my hair♫

48
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,630
The person I love is right in front of me,

49
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,120
but I can't court her.

50
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,840
♫Which side does destiny choose?♫

51
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,340
♫Demon or immortal?♫

52
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,800
Neither can I let her go.

53
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,210
♫With you by my side, I'm fearless in the face of life's hardships♫

54
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,360
Can we only end up

55
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,630

56

♫Why does the world have everything but love?♫

62
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,120
See who you are kissing!

63
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,390
Of course it's you.

Xue Ranran,

86
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,040
you're such a fool.

87
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,120
Ranran, how are you feeling now?

88
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,310
It's not even raining.

89
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,000
But why do you smell so bitter and astringent?

90
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,810
I shouldn't have

91
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,380
fallen for Master.

92
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,580
I really did get punishment.

93
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,480
Sovereign.

94
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,120
The medicine for Tu Jiuyuan?

95
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,290
Yes.

96
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,560
Where are those premium herbs

97
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,750
from the pill and medicine storehouse?

98
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,800
Send them all to her.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,310
I've already lost Da Wu.

100
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,800
I can't afford to lose Tu Jiuyuan as well.

101
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,870
Do you understand?

102
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,360
Yes, My Lord.

103
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,360
My Lord,

104
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,070
this is all

105
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,370
the Illusion Liquid we refined this time.

106
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,040
It couldn't even nail that small task.

107
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,270
I don't need this useless thing.

108
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,750
Get lost.

109
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:28,650
Yes, My Lord.

110
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:36,750
Come here

111
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,530
and drink with me.

112
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,159
Ziyun,

113
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,240
Elder,

114
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,920
why are you up?

115
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,120
Why is it so noisy outside?

116
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,850
The Lord

117
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,750
is having fun with those dancing girls

118
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,680
and courtesan again.

119
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,100
My Lord.

120
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,600
Good wine.

121
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
My Lord.

122
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,070
Come on.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,920
My Lord,

124
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,450
take another sip.

125
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,190
My Lord,

126
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,530
how can you indulge in lust

127
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,510
in the main hall?

128
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,860
Get out...

129
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,760
All of you, get out!

130
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,309
Where are you going?

131
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,440
My Lord!

132
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,120
My Lord...

133
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:12,880
Come here.

134
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,150
So charming.

135
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,360
I like it.

136
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,480
My Lord,

137
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,640
you're drunk.

138
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,580
Where are you going?

139
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,840
Could it be that

140
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,690
you're playing hard to get with me?

141
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,080
M-My Lord.

142
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,620
You...

143
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,720
Why are you here?

144
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,630
Last night,

145
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,720
you were intoxicated.

146
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,490
Even if I was drunk, I wouldn't have...

147
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,390
My Lord,

148
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,200
this is all

149
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,040
the Illusion Liquid we refined this time.

150
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,870
Even if I was drunk,

151
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,240
what about you?

152
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,120
You...

153
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,790
You tried to mess up with me on purpose?

154
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,890
So I played some tricks,

155
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,670
threw myself at you,

156
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,360
and displeased you, My Lord?

157
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,480
Shut up.

158
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,360
That's enough.

159
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,670
Let's pretend this never happened.

160
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,120
And do not mention this

161
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,840
to anyone.

162
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:38,810
Otherwise...

163
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,370
My Lord!

164
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,440
My Lord,

165
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,440
the pill storehouse...

166
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,830
Elder Tu?

167
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,550
What are you looking at?

168
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,860
If you dare to spill a word of this,

169
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,490
I'll cut off your tongue.

170
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,080
Yes, My Lord.

171
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,480
So what's the matter?

172
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,430
Speak.

173
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,880
As you ordered,

174
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
we've sent the Scarlet-Dew Ganoderma Pills

175
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,870
from the pill storehouse to...

176
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,600
Enough.

177
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,590
I got it.

178
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,670
Yes.

179
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,670
I'll take my leave, My Lord.

180
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,000
What are you waiting for?

181
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,750
Get out of here quickly.

182
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,230
Don't let anyone else see this.

183
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,480
How did this happen?

184
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,320
After this...

185
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,750
You.

186
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,690
I didn't see anything, My Lord.

187
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,720
I saw nothing.

188
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,070
M-My Lord, please spare my life!

189
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,440
When did I say

190
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,420
I'd end your life?

191
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,510
Get up.

192
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,360
Tell me.

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,480
If you were drunk

194
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,630
and did something

195
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,510
inappropriate to someone,

196
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
how would you deal with her?

197
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,080
Kill her.

198
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,670
Not this!

199
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,030
Then just

200
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,320
marry her.

201
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,020
I didn't mean to do this either...

202
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,320
My Lord,

203
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,490
to be honest...

204
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,870
Well,

205
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
our Scarlet Sect

206
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,290
will need a mistress sooner or later

207
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,750
to help you manage affairs.

208
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,910
Elder Tu,

209
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,200
she's been dedicated to the sect all these years.

210
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,120
And she grew up with you

211
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,240
at the Scarlet Sect together.

212
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,270
Isn't she just perfectly suitable for that role?

213
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,790
Suitable?

214
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,830
She's completely stiff

215
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,320
from head to toe,

216
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,410
never willing to give in.

217
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,240
How is she suitable?

218
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,520
Hold on.

219
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,150
I was caught up in that Illusion Spell,

220
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,170
but she wasn't.

221
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,480
Yet she didn't push me away.

222
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,670
Doesn't that mean I won?

223
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,960
That's right!

224
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,750
I won.

225
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,720
If that's the case,

226
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,710
what's wrong with giving her a title?

227
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,750
Exactly!

228
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,270
Elder Tu.

229
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,800
My Lord.

230
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,390
You may leave now.

231
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,200
Yes, My Lord.

232
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,270
You came at the right time.

233
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,320
I've just decided,

234
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,510
since you've been so dedicated

235
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,480
to Scarlet Sect all these years,

236
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,510
I'll let you

237
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,050
sit by my right side

238
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,240
from now on,

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,910
and stay close to me.

240
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,630
That won't be necessary.

241
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,390
My Lord, I'm here to tell you

242
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,000
that I happened to be in a bad mood yesterday as well,

243
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,320
so I used it as a way to relieve.

244
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,210
We should treat it as a night of fun,

245
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,670
nothing else.

246
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,720
Is that really what you think?

247
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,240
What else should it be?

248
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,910
You said that.

249
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,320
I already

250
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,680
gave you the chance.

251
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,740
Don't come bothering me in the future.

252
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,440
Rest assured, My Lord.

253
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,210
That actually saved me a lot of trouble.

254
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,670
A night of fun?

255
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,400
You treat me as some cheap thrills?

256
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,270
You've got some nerve, Tu Jiuyuan!

257
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,090
My Lord.

258
00:15:59,270 --> 00:15:59,670
My Lord.

259
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,320
My Lord, Mu Qingge requests an audience outside the hall.

260
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,920
Greetings, My Lord.

261
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,080
What brings the great beauty Mu

262
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,820
here with such leisure?

263
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,960
Leisure?

264
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,120
It took me a lot of effort to find an opportunity

265
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,480
to counter Su Yishui,

266
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,150
yet the mission was failed.

267
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,920
I was so angry that I was sleepless through the night.

268
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,150
How could I be as untroubled

269
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,340
as the great sovereign Wei?

270
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,720
Mistakes,

271
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,790
blame...

272
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,500
all brushed aside by you.

273
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,200
What are you implying

274
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,670
by saying that?

275
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,600
That useless Tu Jiuyuan

276
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,860
ruined everything,

277
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,120
yet she didn't even realize
she should fight to the death to make up for it.

278
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,870
What's the point of keeping her alive?

279
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,200
Why haven't you killed her yet?

280
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
My affairs

281
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,900
are none of your concern.

282
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,220
Tu Jiuyuan is my subordinate.

283
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,960
If I want her dead,

284
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,170
she dies.

285
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,310
If I'm happy to let her live, she lives.

286
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,680
You have no right to question this!

287
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,210
I may call her useless,

288
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,550
but you dare not.

289
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,480
Is that clear?

290
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,920
I didn't expect the great sovereign Wei

291
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,589
to be so protective of her.

292
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,589
It's none of your business.

293
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,710
Now, tell me.

294
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,240
What brings you

295
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,310
to me today?

296
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,640
Of course, I'm here for the whereabouts of Su Yishui

297
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,270
and that

298
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,160
other piece of fruit.

299
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,770
Another piece of fruit?

300
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,030
Have you found her?

301
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,610
Is it Su Yishui's

302
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,720
little disciple?

303
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,110
That's right.

304
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,640
That day at the foot of Mount Cuiwei,

305
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,410
when that girl's spiritual power surged,

306
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,400
I sensed it clearly from the shadows

307
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,870
that my own spiritual power was also affected.

308
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,550
It must be her.

309
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,960
I'm sure of it.

310
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,160
So it's true.

311
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,510
Well, well, Su Yishui,

312
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,760
you've fooled me

313
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,750
time and time again.

314
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,160
I certainly won't let you off the hook.

315
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,880
I have a plan.

316
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,350
Wait.

317
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,240
It's a bit strange.

318
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,350
Why would Su Yishui

319
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,480
keep that useless sister of yours

320
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,310
by his side?

321
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,740
What's he trying to do?

322
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,590
Who cares what he's doing?

323
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,830
As long as we kill those two,
both the master and disciple,

324
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,850
you can take revenge on Su Yishui

325
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,790
for repeatedly humiliating you.

326
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,200
And my memories and spiritual power

327
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
will all come back as well.

328
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,310
The Spirit Spring...

329
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,110
will be yours too.

330
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,110
You used to be...

331
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,930
so generous.

332
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,160
Why are you

333
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,550
more impatient than I am

334
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,790
to see them dead now?

335
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,550
In my past life, what did my generosity

336
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,070
eventually bring me in the end?

337
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,210
Anyone who has wronged me in the past,

338
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,030
I'll make them pay one by one.

339
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,640
You've become just as bad as me now.

340
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,880
How boring.

341
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,230
Well then, tell me,

342
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,240
what's your scheme?

343
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,440
Mr. Zeng.

344
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,880
Your wounds

345
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,410
have nearly healed

346
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,350
over the past few days.

347
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,720
After finishing breakfast and packing up,

348
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,790
you may go down the mountain

349
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,720
with your master.

350
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,590
Bai Baishan.

351
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,970
You'll come back with me

352
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,640
to continue your cultivation.

353
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:53,640
Yes, Master.

354
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,030
Understood.

355
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,650
I wonder how

356
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,160
they've been living here?

357
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,110
Have they been sleeping well?

358
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,640
You came at the right time.

359
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:02,920
We were just about to

360
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,070
bid farewell to you two seniors.

361
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,440
Thank you for your hospitality these past few days.

362
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,510
Seniors,

363
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,030
thank you for looking after us these past few days.

364
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,400
When I have more time,

365
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,680
I'll come back to brew some wine for you.

366
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,200
Good.

367
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,720
Ranran,

368
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,770
I feel like we've known each other for years.

369
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,680
I'm very fond of you.

370
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,400
I'll give you these small magical tools as gifts.

371
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,710
They might be helpful on your cultivation journey.

372
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,250
What Senior Liang has given me

373
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,750
must be something truly valuable.

374
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,750
Thank you, Senior.

375
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,000
Also...

376
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,270
I know.

377
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,220
This is the paper talisman that Mu

378
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,480
asked me to make for her back then.

379
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,720
This paper talisman can

380
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,860
seal evil beings in the world.

381
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,880
You may need it in the future.

382
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,000
Take it,

383
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,310
and it will fulfill

384
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,530
Qingge's wish from back then.

385
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:48,950
Thank you, Senior.

386
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,400
I'll definitely take good care of it.

387
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,440
Take care.

388
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,440
Your Highness,

389
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,970
the Puxin Village

390
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,960
is not far ahead.

391
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,160
The collapsed waterway

392
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,200
is on the western side of the village.

393
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,750
Follow this path,

394
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,970
we can reach there in two hours.

395
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,440
Once we're rested,

396
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,880
we'll continue on.

397
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,590
Yes, Your Highness.

398
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,310
Your Highness,

399
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,480
several supply carts ahead

400
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,160
have their wheels stuck

401
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,200
and have overturned into the mud.

402
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,160
The terrain of this road

403
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,170
seems unsuitable for carts.

404
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,170
Mud?

405
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
Take the road next to it.

406
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,590
Let's go around.

407
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,140
Yes, Your Highness.

408
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,590
Yes, Your Highness.

409
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,510
Ranran,

410
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,110
since last night,

411
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,240
you and Master

412
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
have been giving off a strange tension.

413
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,680
My nose is almost ruined.

414
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,970
What happened between you two

415
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,640
last night?

416
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,070
Fine.

417
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,300
Keep your secrets.

418
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,560
So mysterious.

419
00:21:59,230 --> 00:21:59,790
But where exactly

420
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,830
are we going?

421
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,000
This place is

422
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,680
in the middle of nowhere.

423
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,880
Could it be that Master is taking us

424
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,550
to fight monsters?

425
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,830
The Reincarnation Tree branch is reacting.

426
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,510
We should head that way.

427
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,310
Ranran, what's wrong?

428
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,640
Ranran.

429
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,920
Are you feeling unwell?

430
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,720
You've completely forgotten

431
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,330
what you've done so quickly.

432
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,070
What's the matter?

433
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,270
Now you even act

434
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,510
all cold and aloof.

435
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,750
Shouldn't I be the one

436
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,640
keeping distance?

437
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,350
Master, now you get it?

438
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,400
Xue Ranran.

439
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,290
Stop right there.

440
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,640
You've been in a mood since early morning.

441
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,920
What are you up to?

442
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,030
I...

443
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:54,440
That's because...

444
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,720
I couldn't sleep last night

445
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,350
and felt unsettled.

446
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,070
Unlike Master

447
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,170
who is radiant

448
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,110
and full of energy.

449
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,790
Looks like the wine from last night really

450
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,070
was quite tasty.

451
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,550
Qiu Xi'er.

452
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,160
Master.

453
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,750
Why is she in such a bad mood today?

454
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,030
Master, you're asking me?

455
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,110
If you don't even know,

456
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,940
how would I know?

457
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,460
Forget it, forget it.

458
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,350
It's something I shouldn't have dreamed of anyway.

459
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,350
It's better to forget it all!

460
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,270
This is the sigil of the Eastern Palace.

461
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,750
Why did these carts

462
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,590
break down here?

463
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,270
The road is flat.

464
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,160
Could there be danger nearby?

465
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,450
There doesn't seem to be anyone around,

466
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,680
so it shouldn't be anything unusual.

467
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,160
Why is Su Yu here?

468
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,790
Since everything is fine,

469
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,240
why are you still standing here?

470
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,720
Puxin Village.

471
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,160
[Puxin Village]

472
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,070
This village is so quiet.

473
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,400
Master,

474
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,480
are you sure we should go this way?

475
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,820
[Puxin Village]

476
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,440
Who's there?

477
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,160
Get out!

478
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,510
Don't come any closer!

479
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,000
All of you, get out of here!

480
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,940
Get out!

481
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,050
Calm down.

482
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,630
Stay back! Stay away!

483
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,420
Be careful! Move!

484
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,960
She must be a lunatic.

485
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,600
She ran off pretty quick though.

486
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:34,960
Let's go.

487
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,510
We've been walking in the village for so long,

488
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,830
finally we see someone.

489
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,920
[Natural Residence]

490
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,750
Esteemed guests,

491
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,480
please, come in and have a seat.

492
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:08,920
Come.

493
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,780
Come, come, come.

494
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:10,590
Quickly.

495
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,200
Have a seat inside.

496
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,240
Here.

497
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,830
Guests,

498
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,790
please have some tea.

499
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,920
My surname is Liu.

500
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,200
If there's anything you need,

501
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,680
just let me know.

502
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,270
Mr. Liu,

503
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,480
have you recently

504
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,350
seen a

505
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,040
military troop passing by?

506
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,410
Among them, there's

507
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,040
a rather elegant and noble young master.

508
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,270
Well...

509
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,810
I haven't seen that.

510
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,880
However,

511
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,730
there are a few other households in the village.

512
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,920
I can ask around for you.

513
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,990
I see the forests here are dense,

514
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,230
and the transportation is convenient.

515
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,920
Why is this village so desolate?

516
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,310
It seems there's hardly anyone around.

517
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,000
Our village used to be

518
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,480
quite populous indeed.

519
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,830
It was very lively.

520
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,510
But in the past decade,

521
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,550
for some unknown reason,

522
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,440
ground fissures have been occurring everywhere.

523
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,070
People who passed by

524
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,270
have disappeared one after another.

525
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:08,960
Ground fissures?

526
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,720
Something this bizarre actually happened?

527
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,550
Yes.

528
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,160
The even stranger thing is that

529
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,790
shortly after the fissures appear,

530
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,240
they would close up on their own.

531
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,510
The villagers tried to search for the missing people

532
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,680
by digging

533
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,140
where the fissures had once been,

534
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,850
but they never found any remains.

535
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,680
Miss,

536
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,330
could the person you're looking for

537
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,480
encountered

538
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,110
these fissures too?

539
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,550
If that's the case,

540
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,350
Young Master Yu might be in danger.

541
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,050
How can there be such a place

542
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,850
that swallows people without a trace?

543
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,440
I wonder

544
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,020
if we've angered the Mountain God.

545
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,030
All the villagers have fled.

546
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,090
Why haven't you left, elder?

547
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,480
This elder here

548
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,440
is already halfway

549
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,720
in the grave.

550
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,030
I might as well stay

551
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,160
to warn passersby

552
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,160
about the danger.

553
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,710
Elder,

554
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,640
don't be sad.

555
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,550
Our Master's magical powers are incredible.

556
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,400
He'll surely be able to identify the problem

557
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,030
and help solve the village's...

558
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,330
Troubles.

559
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,350
Oh, you all are

560
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,720
Heavenly Immortal Masters.

561
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,200
Elder, I,

562
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,770
failed to recognize your greatnesses.

563
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:27,780
Immortal Master,

564
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,780
I beg you

565
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,580
to save our village.

566
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,310
Please rise, elder.

567
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:34,790
Rest assured,

568
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,400
I will do my utmost

569
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,200
to investigate this matter.

570
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,200
Thank you, Immortal Master.

571
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,510
Thank you, Immortal Master.

572
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,590
By the way, uncle,

573
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,310
among the few remaining households in the village,

574
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,790
is there a mad woman?

575
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,800
When we first entered the village,

576
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,550
she threw slop water at us.

577
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,880
There's no mad woman in the village.

578
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,480
Perhaps the sky dimmed,

579
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,880
and you mistook what you saw.

580
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,460
It's getting late now.

581
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,630
If you don't mind,

582
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,940
you can stay at my place.

583
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,380
When dawn breaks tomorrow,

584
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,590
I'll bring you into the mountains to investigate.

585
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,300
Thank you for your trouble then.

586
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,610
Make yourselves at home.

587
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,530
I'll go attend to some matters now.

588
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,640
Ever since entering this village,

589
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,370
I've been feeling

590
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,350
a strange inexplicable restlessness,

591
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,890
and it's growing stronger and stronger.

592
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,270
Perhaps it's related to

593
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,480
the strangeness of this village.

594
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,720
Is it really a Spirit Spring?

595
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,640
This village is quite strange.

596
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,200
Young Master Yu's carriage

597
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,640
overturned halfway for no apparent reason.

598
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,920
The more I think about it, the more suspicious it seems.

599
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,510
Could it be that

600
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,790
there are harmful monsters

601
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,820
hiding underground?

602
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,270
It's highly likely.

603
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,160
What should we do then?

604
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,690
None of us have practiced

605
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,920
the Earth-Burrowing Technique.

606
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:01,790
I've got it!

607
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,000
The Earth-Burrowing Pearl.

608
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,640
Senior Liang's gift for us

609
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,230
before we left is indeed reliable.

610
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,310
This should solve the problem.

611
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,830
Alcohol Immortal and Senior Liang,

612
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,510
one is interesting and the other is handsome.

613
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,890
Although Master Mu was a demon in his past life,

614
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,000
the friends he made

615
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,030
are quite nice.

616
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,270
Actually, back then

617
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,280
when I was in Xue Village,

618
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,000
I've heard that Liang Wumeng has profound cultivation

619
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
and planned on finding him.

620
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,070
But I eventually went to Mount Wester.

621
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,160
Otherwise, I would have...

622
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,030
Otherwise what?

623
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,160
Otherwise,

624
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,680
I would have gone directly to the capital

625
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,450
to find Liang Wumeng,

626
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,510
cure Ling Xiao,

627
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,830
return it to its Guardian,

628
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:39,920
and then go live

629
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,160
the life I've always longed for.

630
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,930
I want to travel across mountains, rivers, and seas,

631
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,270
take in all the beautiful sights of the world,

632
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,550
and in the end,

633
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,550
marry a handsome, ideal husband。

634
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,340
Live a peaceful

635
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,460
and simple life.

636
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,400
Sure.

637
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,240
When you get married,

638
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,440
I'll get you a dowry.

639
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,510
Keep your promise.

640
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,460
Bad news! Bad news!

641
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,160
Bad news!

642
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,720
Bad news!

643
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:20,830
Just now,

644
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,620
I went to fetch water from the west side of the village,

645
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,790
and it seems the ground there has cracked open again.

646
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,510
Let's go take a look first.

647
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,310
Yes.

648
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,700
The soil is compacted,

649
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,200
and it's not hollow underneath.

650
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,490
There's a token here.

651
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,160
Ranran.

652
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,030
This is...

653
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,970
The token of Young Master Yu's personal guard.

654
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,200
Master,

655
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,510
Young Master Yu and his group

656
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,430
really encountered danger.

657
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,200
We need to find a way to rescue them quickly.

658
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,980
The crevice is so tightly closed.

659
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,680
If it's really Su Yu,

660
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,030
he would have been crushed to a pulp by now.

661
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,880
There's no need to waste our energy.

662
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,640
This place

663
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,830
is indeed strange.

664
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,720
We shouldn't stay long.

665
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,030
Let's discuss it again at sunrise.

666
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,370
Master,

667
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,720
even if you hold grudges

668
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,590
against Young Master Yu,

669
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,620
a whole group have gone missing.

670
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,110
How can we just leave like this?

671
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,070
The Heavenly Sect doesn't interfere with affairs of the court.

672
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,420
Young Master Yu is my friend.

673
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:23,810
I won't abandon him.

674
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,550
Ranran, don't do anything rash.

675
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,010
You're acting for Su Yu again.

676
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,230
You really haven't changed at all.

677
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,000
Master.

678
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,630
I'm at the underground now.

679
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,790
Master.

680
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,230
The resentment is strong here. Don't wander off.

681
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,960
Didn't you say you wouldn't interfere?

682
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,030
If I can't even control

683
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,810
my own disciple,

684
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,440
if words got out,

685
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,400
how will Wester Sect save its face?

686
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,880
I see.

687
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,850
I'm just Master's disciple.

688
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,720
How could he watch me

689
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,160
venture into danger and not care?

690
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,590
But in his heart,

691
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,070
I'm just a disciple after all.

692
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,960
Don't worry, Master.

693
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,310
I will not get into trouble

694
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,830
and bring shame to the Wester Sect.

695
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,030
Master.

696
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,750
Ranran.

697
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,000
Master.

698
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,770
The resentment is concentrated here.

699
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,640
It's far from ordinary.

700
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:38,960
Everyone needs to be careful.

701
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,450
Let's go ahead and take a look.

702
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,110
These must be the people Mr. Liu mentioned

703
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,270
who were swallowed by the ground fissures.

704
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,880
Their remains are all here.

705
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,200
This space is quite deep.

706
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,620
Ordinary people couldn't possibly reach here.

707
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,159
No wonder those villagers

708
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,110
couldn't find the remains.

709
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,840
What's that?

710
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,400
They're soldiers from the Eastern Palace.

711
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,590
How did they end up like this?

712
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,400
Young Master Yu!

713
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,620
Young Master Yu.

714
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,510
Young Master Yu.

715
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,320
Wake up.

716
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,710
He's still breathing.

717
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,000
He won't die.

718
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,480
Young Master Yu.

719
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,590
You're awake.

720
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,320
Ranran.

721
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,150
Come on.

722
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,110
Young Master Yu,

723
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,150
are you alright?

724
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:54,960
I'm fine.

725
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
These are just superficial wounds.

726
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,230
Fortunately, Ranran discovered

727
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,440
the Crown Prince's trace,

728
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,460
so we were able to find you.

729
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,920
You entered such a dangerous place

730
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,110
just to save me.

731
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,540
Master and the others are here too, aren't they?

732
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,890
Young Master Yu,

733
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,430
why did you ended up here?

734
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
What exactly happened?

735
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,500
I only remember we had just entered the village

736
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,230
and suddenly the mountain crumbled and the earth split open.

737
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,110
Before we could react,

738
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,840
we fell down here.

739
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,840
Later, I was injured

740
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,190
and was helped to walk for a while.

741
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,550
But for some reason, I was knocked to the ground.

742
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
In a semi-conscious state,

743
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,880
I saw everyone

744
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,920
acting as if possessed.

745
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,040
Protect the Crown Prince!

746
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,190
Then I completely passed out.

747
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,710
I suppose it must have been these soldiers

748
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,590
who protected me at the cost of their lives,

749
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,510
so I could survive.

750
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,880
The souls of these soldiers

751
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,510
are all gone.

752
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,960
How could this happen?

753
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,480
I wanted to use the Seeing Sunflower

754
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
to look at their memories,

755
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,750
but I couldn't see anything.

756
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,550
Their souls

757
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,440
must have been

758
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
absorbed by something.

759
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,400
Could it be the Spirit Spring?

760
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,230
Young Master Yu.

761
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,550
What is that?

762
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,880
There's a magic formation here.

763
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:11,950
The Earth-Burrowing Technique can't be used.

764
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:12,700
Quickly find an exit.

765
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,280
Alright.

766
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,360
Everyone, be careful.

767
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,440
Master.

768
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:54,960
Ranran.

769
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,070
Ranran.

770
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:01,880
Master.

771
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:03,960
Ranran.

772
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,070
Xi'er.

773
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:08,970
Save me.

774
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,110
Senior Gao!

775
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:10,920
Senior Gao!

776
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,320
Senior Gao!

777
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,480
Senior Gao, you...

778
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,590
Master.

779
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,400
Xi'er.

780
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,030
Senior Gao.

781
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:42,800
Ranran.

782
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,110
Ranran, come here.

783
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,590
It's dangerous over there.

784
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
Come to Master quickly.

785
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,440
No.

786
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,880
Master would never

787
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,840
speak to me

788
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,710
so gently.

789
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,840
Which monster is trying to trick me?

790
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,000
How dare you deceive me!

791
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:11,920
That's so strange.

792
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,920
This monster can even bewitch people's hearts.

793
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,190
Ranran.

794
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,360
Xue Ranran.

795
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,840
You...

796
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
You are real?

797
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,480
I am your master, Su Yishui.

798
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,290
The monsters here

799
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,440
can mimic human voices

800
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,090
and create illusions.

801
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,590
Once you're drawn to them,

802
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,480
and make eye contact with them,

803
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,070
your soul will be absorbed.

804
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,150
And you will

805
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,400
turn to stone like those soldiers you saw.

806
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:39,890
If you hear anything,

807
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,590
don't believe it easily,

808
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,150
and don't ever make eye contact with it.

809
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,670
However,

810
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,550
it can only steal voices

811
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,730
from your memory and mimic them.

812
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,440
It can't identify people's identities.

813
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,170
Since I can tell you who I am,

814
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,310
you can trust me now.

815
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,840
As if I'd trust you!

816
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,400
You might be the monster

817
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,920
disguised as Master to trick me.

818
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,030
The Collection of Entertainment mentioned that

819
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,550
Master hates it most

820
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,000
when others praise his appearance.

821
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,320
You're so good looking.

822
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,760
If you like, you can look all you want when we get out of here.

823
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:10,880
Now, stay close to me.

824
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,550
Don't run.

825
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,240
If I don't, do I stay and become your snack instead?

826
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,360
Your acting is quite convincing.

827
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
The troublesome Collection of Entertainment.

828
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,030
Didn't I tell you

829
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,230
not to believe what's written in the Collection of Entertainment?

830
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:26,840
Did you bring dried longans?

831
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,360
Dried longans?

832
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,800
You like eating these?

833
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:42,840
I don't like to.

834
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,540
But I like the new ones you made.

835
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,880
Last time, when you made

836
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,740
dried longans for me,

837
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,630
your hands got all blistered.

838
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,520
I told you I didn't like eating them,

839
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,030
but eventually...

840
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,110
I finished them all.

841
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,150
You finished all?

842
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:03,920
Also,

843
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,480
I told you to shout "Master, help!"

844
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,230
if you encounter danger,

845
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,520
but you just wouldn't listen.

846
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,460
I am very angry.

847
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:11,960
What else you want to ask

848
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,550
for me to prove myself?

849
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,400
Then, Master, do you

850
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,170
still remember last night?

851
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,960
We...

852
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,550
Xi'er.

853
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,070
Ranran.

854
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,150
It's Senior.

855
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Master.

856
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,810
Xi'er.

857
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,760
Xi'er!

858
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,150
Do you believe me now?

859
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,280
Alright.

860
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,440
Then you stay here.

861
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,400
Remember what I just said.

862
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,460
I'll go rescue them.

863
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,550
Yu.

864
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,280
Yu.

865
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:13,900
Qingge.

866
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:17,760
Yu.

867
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,590
Qingge.

868
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:45,880
Master.

869
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,320
Let's leave.

870
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,110
Okay.

871
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,360
Young Master Yu.

872
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,840
Young Master Yu.

873
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,400
Young Master Yu.

874
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,400
Ranran.

875
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,030
Fortunately, it was cut off in time.

876
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,600
Only half of the soul was absorbed;

877
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,340
It can still return.

878
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,190
Thank you.
