00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,910
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:54,509
Oh no.

4
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,640
It's worse than I imagined.

5
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,320
The Ice Lotus inside him

6
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,280
has completely shattered.

7
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,640
The Ice Lotus?

8
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,950
He consumed half of his Golden Core

9
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,230
to nurture the Reincarnation Tree,

10
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,370
so he had to cultivate the Ice Lotus Technique

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,240
to complete the Golden Core.

12
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,750
Now,

13
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,470
with the Ice Lotus Technique broken,

14
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,190
that half of the Golden Core has shattered as well.

15
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,550
So he has fallen from the Transcendence Stage,

16
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,310
and his spiritual power is now imbalanced.

17
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,970
If we don't find a way

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,910
to stabilize his spiritual power,

19
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,680
he'll go berserk

20
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,780
and live a life worse than death.

21
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,079
I will find a way to save him.

22
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,800
However,

23
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,490
the hope is faint.

24
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,000
Master,

25
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,910
I'll help you control your spiritual power.

26
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,470
Ling Xiao,

27
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,150
what have you done?

28
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:33,770
Master...

29
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,240
Don't move.

30
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,520
Your wounds haven't healed. Why are you running around?

31
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,520
Master,

32
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,700
I'll definitely save you.

33
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,290
Master,

34
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,910
I will save you.

35
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,280
I will definitely save you.

36
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,800
Vine,

37
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,020
help me.

38
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,260
I need to enter Master's consciousness.

39
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,300
Master!

40
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:51,770
Master?

41
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,560
What should I do?

42
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,090
How can I save you?

43
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,920
Master's Ice Lotus Technique is broken,

44
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:32,390
♫Who knows the loneliness of mountains and seas?♫

45
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,560
and he has fallen from the Transcendence Stage.

46
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,120
That's why he can't control his spiritual power,

47
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,830
leading him to be in such endless pain.

48
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,800
♫The sharp wind cuts at my heart♫

49
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,950

nurtured by Master,

51
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,510

Master is too weak to respond.

59
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,100
The primal spiritual power can't flow into his body.

60
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:06,810
♫Coming to the abyss despite knowing retreat is possible♫

61

Master,

87
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,930
your face...

88
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,730
Master,

89
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,720
please get on the carriage first.

90
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,360
I'll cover the rear.

91
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,040
Master!

92
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,430
Master.

93
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,480
Master, are you alright?

94
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,110
Master,

95
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,360
what happened,

96
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,830
Master?

97
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,840
Please forgive me, Master!

98
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,299
Look what you did!

99
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,240
Master, please forgive me!

100
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:41,630
What is this?

101
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,030
This is the Third Prince's Death Guard Token.

102
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,010
Master,

103
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,600
we have never had any grievances

104
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,150
with the Third Prince.

105
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,630
Why does he want to kill you?

106
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,000
What else could it be?

107
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,390
I've been with the Crown Prince.

108
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
His hands have actually reached here.

109
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,790
We'll talk about it when we get back.

110
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,790
Yes.

111
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,630
[Madam Battle's Palace]

112
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,130
Why?

113
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,210
Why can't your medicine

114
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,360
heal my wounds?

115
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,290
It's probably because Wei Jiu

116
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,370
carried poison in his hands.

117
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,390
Damn Wei Jiu.

118
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,960
Master, don't worry.

119
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,020
Give me a bit more time.

120
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,270
Time?

121
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,910
I'm about to get married.

122
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,200
How can I afford to wait?

123
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,360
I've been through a lot

124
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,930
to get this appearance.

125
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,550
Anyway, you need to find a way

126
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,050
to heal me quickly.

127
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,600
Why hasn't Yu come to see me yet?

128
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,120
Didn't I tell you

129
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,120
to go invite him earlier?

130
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,410
Hurry up and send someone to urge him!

131
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,810
Madam Battle,

132
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,770
Wu Mi requests an audience.

133
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,200
Invite him in.

134
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,150
Yes.

135
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,360
Your Highness.

136
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,720
Where is Yu?

137
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,480
His Highness has something urgent to attend to.

138
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,360
Tonight,

139
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,510
I'm afraid he won't be able to come and see you.

140
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,480
Your Highness, please rest and focus on healing.

141
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,720
Does His Highness not know

142
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,480
that I'm injured?

143
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,750
Also,

144
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,550
I was ambushed on the way.

145
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,160
It was the Third Prince's doing.

146
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,550
He is not only targeting me.

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,150
I must tell Yu

148
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,790
the details

149
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,770
and remind him to be cautious.

150
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,910
His Highness has said that

151
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,870
the Third Prince and he share a deep brotherly bond.

152
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,270
Your Highness, you should not jump to conclusions.

153
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,510
He will investigate it thoroughly.

154
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,800
Once the truth is uncovered,

155
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,240
His Highness will seek justice for you.

156
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,270
Also,

157
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,750
His Highness said that

158
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,200
due to your facial injury,

159
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,790
the wedding will be postponed

160
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,720
and discussed in the future.

161
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,630
What does he mean by that?

162
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,290
Does it mean that as long as

163
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,000
my face is injured,

164
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,630
he won't marry me?

165
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,270
No.

166
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,360
I must go and talk it through with His Highness.

167
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:00,840
Your Highness.

168
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,550
The Crown Prince has been worried about His Majesty's health

169
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,240
for many days.

170
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,080
But you haven't made

171
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,390
another Health Pill

172
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,000
that he asked for.

173
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,120
The Crown Prince has long had no energy for anything else.

174
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,910
Your Highness, please understand.

175
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,120
Madam Battle,

176
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,120
Concubine Zhou heard that you were injured

177
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,360
and sent over a bottle of secret medicine.

178
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,930
She said it was made from the secret formula

179
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,270
you once gave her,

180
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,980
and it's very effective for injuries

181
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,000
caused by magic.

182
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,360
She hopes it can help you recover.

183
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,630
Tell her to get lost!

184
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,080
Your Highness, please calm down!

185
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,320
All of you, get out!

186
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,960
Master.

187
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,080
She can't wait for me

188
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,600
to lose favor with the Crown Prince.

189
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,120
How could she possibly send anything good?

190
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,240
That bitch.

191
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,390
Trying to use this opportunity to climb up?

192
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,870
She's way too eager.

193
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,080
A mere Health Pill

194
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,510
won't stop me.

195
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll definitely make

196
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,930
another Health Pill.

197
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,390
Wang Suizhi,

198
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,400
have you found the Ghost Grass

199
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,200
I asked you to search for?

200
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,000
Master,

201
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,960
you used to not allow us

202
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,290
to use that kind of herb

203
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,720
that boosts

204
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,510
spiritual power in a short time.

205
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,480
It's highly depleting

206
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,180
and can easily backfire.

207
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,670
It's not a long-term solution.

208
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,870
Give it to me!

209
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,270
Master,

210
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,510
please listen to my advice.

211
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,240
Leave the palace.

212
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,570
Don't force yourself to break through

213
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,080
for Su Yu anymore.

214
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,320
He's not worth it.

215
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,510
Who do you think you are

216
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
to tell me whether he's worth it or not?

217
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,720
This time, while I was

218
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,000
searching for the Ghost Grass to help you advance,

219
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,790
I found that

220
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,150
Wu Mi was also looking for it.

221
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,390
Not only does this herb enhance one's power,

222
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,270
but it also has detoxifying effects.

223
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,790
Out of curiosity,

224
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,790
I followed the guard

225
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,000
and sneaked into the Crown Prince's palace.

226
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,720
I saw that

227
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,650
he had long been severely poisoned

228
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,480
and didn't have much time left.

229
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,120
I dug deeper into this matter.

230
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,870
Do you know

231
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
who poisoned him?

232
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,030
It was the Second Prince,

233
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,510
the one you saved from Su Yishui

234
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,840
many years ago.

235
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,670
Did that Second Prince

236
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,570
die long ago?

237
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,630
That's right.

238
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,690
So Su Yu must have been poisoned

239
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,550
more than 10 years ago.

240
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,670
The Health Pill

241
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,150
was never for the Emperor.

242
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,670
Obviously, the Crown Prince

243
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,820
wants it made for his own use.

244
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Master, if you can't make

245
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,690
a high-quality Health Pill,

246
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,910
how can you be of any use to him?

247
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,120
Under the power of the throne,

248
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,320
how can there be true love?

249
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,840
He has long since become a man

250
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,150
of schemes and calculations,

251
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
no longer

252
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,990
the Yu that you cared about.

253
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,260
Impossible.

254
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,630
He loves me.

255
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,510
He waited for me for 18 years

256
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,270
with the position of Crown Princess vacant.

257
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,320
He would never scheme against me.

258
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,670
Master!

259
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,510
If he truly loved you,

260
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,120
how would he widely spread the news

261
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,550
of you going to the Marrow-Cleansing Pool?

262
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,120
He only intentionally let the rumor slip

263
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,150
to the Third Prince,

264
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,390
making you the target

265
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,000
for all kinds of attacks,

266
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,600
acting as his shield.

267
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,320
Enough!

268
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,120
Even so,

269
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,120
it's even more impossible for me to leave.

270
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,030
As long as I'm strong enough,

271
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,500
Su Yu won't be able to leave me.

272
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,260
I will win his heart sooner or later.

273
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,500
In this life,

274
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,480
I haven't enjoyed enough wealth and glory.

275
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,610
It's just a Health Pill.

276
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,030
The Mu Qingge from the last life could make it,

277
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,150
and the Mu Qingge now can do the same.

278
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,040
I will restore my spiritual power

279
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,650
and help him detoxify.

280
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,080
Master!

281
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,030
Say no more.

282
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,870
Find everything I need right away.

283
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,700
In this life, I was born with Five Spirit Roots.

284
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,080
Heaven is on my side.

285
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,710
I will never leave Su Yu,

286
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,550
and I will never let anyone take the position

287
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,750
of Crown Princess from me.

288
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,360
Master,

289
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,440
you're awake?

290
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,920
Are you still feeling unwell?

291
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,300
Master, do you need to use the restroom?

292
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,690
Let me help you.

293
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,840
No need.

294
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,220
Let me help you.

295
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,310
Get out!

296
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,840
Master, your wounds haven't fully healed yet.

297
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,150
I must stay by your side.

298
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,840
I am no longer your master,

299
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,000
and I don't need an outsider to take care of me.

300
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,790
Why are you still here at Mount Wester?

301
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,790
I won't leave you,

302
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
and I won't leave Mount Wester.

303
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,970
Once you're recovered,

304
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,190
I'll go find Liang Wumeng.

305
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,460
I will definitely find a way

306
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,440
to return Ling Xiao to you.

307
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,550
Haven't you already discovered my identity

308
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,589
in the Memory Cave?

309
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,680
Why do you still dare to stay here?

310
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,589
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you to silence you?

311
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,300
I'm not afraid.

312
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,440
No matter who you are,

313
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,089
I know

314
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,480
you would never harm me.

315
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,640
I've finally realized that

316
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,430
your Ice Lotus Technique

317
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,000
only freezes yourself,

318
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,640
and your Unfeeling Mantra

319
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,190
is also only ruthless toward yourself.

320
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,030
You've done so much for me,

321
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,880
yet told me nothing.

322
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,830
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

323
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,160
Master,

324
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,960
may I have

325
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,830
the boldness to say

326
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,960
that you have feelings for me?

327
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,550
Your little disciple

328
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,650
knows you're the Demon's child

329
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,720
but doesn't despise you.

330
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,750
Release me.

331
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,650
Let me enter your heart

332
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
and help you keep her.

333
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,680
What are you waiting for?

334
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,220
Don't you want her?

335
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,720
Can you bear to let her go in this lifetime?

336
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,040
Let me help you.

337
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,640
Shut up!

338
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,470
Master, what's wrong?

339
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,880
Does it hurt anywhere?

340
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,000
Who taught you to talk to yourself like this?

341
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,510
I've despised you, this rebellious disciple, for a long time.

342
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,110
I was afraid you wouldn't make it out

343
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,200
of Heavenly Meridian Mountain in one piece,

344
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,790
that you'd get trapped at Mount Wester

345
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,360
and cause me lifelong annoyance,

346
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,510
which is why I helped you.

347
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,350
It was simply my own miscalculation

348
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,550
that caused my technique to become ineffective,

349
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,210
so I failed in detaching myself

350
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,310
from the White Tiger in time.

351
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,310
Who would have known you were so useless,

352
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,650
dragging me down to this point?

353
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,070
If I had known you would have

354
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,750
such foolish thoughts,

355
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,160
I wouldn't have helped you.

356
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,350
As expected,

357
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,280
you're going to say these hurtful things

358
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,030
that you don't really mean again.

359
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,830
Do you think I will believe you?

360
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,100
If someone despises another person,

361
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,990
how could they possibly sacrifice a piece of their soul

362
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,960
to protect them?

363
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,240
Master,

364
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,000
if you want to pretend to be cold and heartless,

365
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,030
at least try to make it convincing.

366
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,410
If, in the past,

367
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,480
it was because I was too weak,

368
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,610
now I have formed

369
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,550
my Golden Core.

370
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,680
Whatever happens,

371
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,030
we can face it together.

372
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,280
Do you know why

373
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,480
I care for you so much?

374
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,510
Why?

375
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,900
Of course, it's because of Mu Qingge.

376
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,400
Haven't you already realized

377
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,240
how deeply I love her?

378
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,280
It's just that she doesn't know

379
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,200
my feelings for her.

380
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,920
She was always a bleeding heart,

381
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,180
foolishly trying to save everyone.

382
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,550
She even risked her life

383
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,340
to help a rebellious disciple like me.

384
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,440
But before she died, she told me

385
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,210
that she never wanted to see me again, alive or dead.

386
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,480
What could I do?

387
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,400
I could only prove to her

388
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,550
that I could be a good person.

389
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,270
That's why I've been taking such good care of you.

390
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,280
She was always so loyal

391
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,350
and selfless toward her disciples.

392
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,970
I can only do

393
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,160
what she wanted me to do,

394
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,440
in the hope of

395
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,920
regaining a place in her heart.

396
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,790
Master,

397
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,900
I don't believe

398
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,200
that none of what you did for me

399
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,790
was out of love.

400
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,550
No.

401
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,520
If what I did for you

402
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,750
made you develop

403
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,110
inappropriate expectations,

404
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,000
then let me

405
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,350
make it clear to you today:

406
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,510
In my heart, whether in the past or the future,

407
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,550
there is only Mu Qingge,

408
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,960
and never you.

409
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,310
But you know very well

410
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,440
that Master Mu

411
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,680
is not Mu Qingge.

412
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,510
Whether she is real or fake, I can judge for myself.

413
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,270
This is between me and her,

414
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
and it's none of your business.

415
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,510
When I took you as my disciple,

416
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,160
it was only because I pitied you.

417
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,680
I've fulfilled my duties as a master,

418
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,000
and you should

419
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,030
know your place as a disciple.

420
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,480
If you're going to have

421
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,440
such inappropriate expectations again,

422
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,790
then get out of my Wester Sect.

423
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,750
Your constantly changing attitude

424
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,820
is so confusing.

425
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,270
But if you say everything you did

426
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,580
was just out of duty as my master,

427
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,400
I will never believe it.

428
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
Whether you believe it or not is up to you.

429
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,070
Get out.

430
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,000
Don't delay my healing.

431
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,450
Do you think saying such harsh words to her

432
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,690
will stop your little disciple

433
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,350
from having

434
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,160
deep affection for you?

435
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,110
You were never a good person to begin with.

436
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,550
What's wrong with following your own desires

437
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,590
and ambitions?

438
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,920
Why do you suppress yourself?

439
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,070
Self-restraint is the most painful.

440
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,640
By sealing me,

441
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,750
you're sealing your true self.

442
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,960
After all, you've already fallen from the Transcendence Realm.

443
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,270
Su Yishui,

444
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
sealing me will kill you.

445
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,400
Aren't you afraid of death?

446
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,240
I'm afraid this bottle won't be able to contain

447
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,110
the Spirit Spring for long.

448
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,240
I don't have much time left.

449
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,240
I must recover quickly

450
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,230
and obtain the Xuantian Teachings.

451
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,680
Ranran.

452
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,720
Mr. Zeng.

453
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,200
Why are you crying?

454
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,000
Did he scold you?

455
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:27,920
Mr. Zeng,

456
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,790
I already know it.

457
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,310
Ling Xiao is Master's spiritual soul.

458
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,480
You must have known about it long ago, right?

459
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,240
Well...

460
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,240
I can feel that

461
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,880
Master has been hiding many things from me.

462
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,480
I know if I asked you,

463
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,580
you wouldn't tell me either.

464
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,610
But I absolutely won't

465
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,590
leave the Wester Sect at this time.

466
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
I'm going to write to Liang Wumeng now

467
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,310
and ask him for the method to return the spiritual soul.

468
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,640
It's been 19 years.

469
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,070
There's no such method.

470
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,400
Even if there was,

471
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:56,610
the cost

472
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,790
would be something you can't bear.

473
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,680
Since your Master gave it to you,

474
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,110
he never intended to take it back.

475
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,310
But that was Master's kindness.

476
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,720
I can't just accept it

477
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,480
without doing anything.

478
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,420
He always arranges things for me

479
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,350
and takes care of me.

480
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,240
But I've grown up now.

481
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,000
I want to take care of him too.

482
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,610
I want to stand by his side,

483
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,880
shielding him from storms.

484
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,240
That's what he owes you.

485
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,400
He should do that.

486
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,790
Anyway,

487
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,830
it's natural for a master

488
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,200
to take care of his disciple.

489
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,680
Don't overthink it.

490
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,830
But does he really

491
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,480
only have the duty of a master towards me?

492
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,730
What if I want more?

493
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,880
Mr. Zeng,

494
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,080
I've developed a greedy thought.

495
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,200
Mr. Zeng,

496
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
what kind of person

497
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,590
is Mu Qingge really?

498
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,400
Why is Master

499
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
so obsessed with her?

500
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,470
She is an extremely good person.

501
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,730
So are you.

502
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,260
You deserve better.

503
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,400
But I don't want better.

504
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,440
If Master keeps waiting and Master Mu doesn't come,

505
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,270
maybe someday

506
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,350
he will notice me, right?

507
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,680
Congratulations,

508
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,400
My Lord.

509
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:43,830
My Lord,

510
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
since you returned from the Black Pool,

511
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,650
not only have you restored your previous spiritual power

512
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,510
but also reached the peak of the Nascent Soul Realm.

513
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,480
If it hadn't been

514
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,960
for Mu Qingge's ambush,

515
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,240
I would have only become stronger.

516
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,310
Unfortunately,

517
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,030
I didn't get the Spirit Spring,

518
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,680
so I still can't open Mount Red Flame.

519
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,110
Where is Tu Jiuyuan?

520
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,270
Why didn't she come to welcome me?

521
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,070
My Lord,

522
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,350
since Su Yishui

523
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,680
injured her Spirit Root

524
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,640
last time,

525
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,400
Elder Tu hasn't fully recovered yet.

526
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,920
Recently,

527
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,790
some of her old ailments have resurfaced.

528
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,830
My Lord.

529
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,790
My Lord.

530
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,740
Did you do this on purpose?

531
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,440
When did you become

532
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,400
so vulnerable?

533
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,200
What is this?

534
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,830
Water from the Black Pool.

535
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,590
The entire mountain's spiritual vein has collapsed.

536
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:57,960
No one stopped me,

537
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,920
so I brought it out.

538
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,790
You're lucky.

539
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,510
Once you gather enough spiritual power

540
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,400
to deal with Su Yishui,

541
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:07,680
don't

542
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,280
let yourself

543
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,270
get almost killed again.

544
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,790
Thank you, My Lord.

545
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,480
When His Lordship came out of the Black Pool,

546
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,110
he was already at his peak.

547
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,110
Why did he have to take the water

548
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,350
from the Marrow-Cleansing Pool?

549
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,510
Looks like

550
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,310
this water was brought back

551
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,150
specifically for you.

552
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,070
There's something

553
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,070
I'm not sure if I should say.

554
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,920
Elder,

555
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,830
why do you always have to meet force with force?

556
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,960
You mean...

557
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,560
If you

558
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,940
want to achieve your goal,

559
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,880
you should be gentler.

560
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
It's better to use softness to overcome strength

561
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,990
than to confront head-on.

562
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,440
Elder Tu.

563
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,240
My Lord.

564
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,310
Guards!

565
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,180
Which blind fool

566
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,200
mistook Illusion Liquid for wine

567
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,680
and served it to me again?

568
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,400
Why did I see someone

569
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,500
who looks like Elder Tu again?

570
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,590
My Lord, you're not mistaken.

571
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,750
It is me.

572
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,160
Why are you dressed like this?

573
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,720
I used the Black Pool water you gave me,

574
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,200
and my internal injuries have healed.

575
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,100
I specifically came to thank you.

576
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,030
Is that so?

577
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,030
But why do

578
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,590
your lips look much redder

579
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,510
and your face much paler than usual?

580
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,720
You look like you've been poisoned.

581
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,960
My Lord,

582
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,950
Elder just applied some rouge.

583
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,480
I made some desserts,

584
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,550
all of which you used to like.

585
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,200
Alright.

586
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,130
Now that you're recovered, don't delay your work.

587
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,200
Usually,

588
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,270
you're not one for formalities.

589
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,640
Just kill a few more people for me.

590
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,510
Making desserts?

591
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,880
That's not like you at all.

592
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,160
I used to make them for you in the past.

593
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,480
When we were little,

594
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,600
you liked the fennel cakes from the shop at the foot of the mountain.

595
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,440
Back then, every time you got punished,

596
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,310
you asked Senior Sister to take you to eat them.

597
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,160
Later, that shop moved,

598
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,920
so I learned to make them myself.

599
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:57,960
Is that so?

600
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,070
Why don't I remember that I like them?

601
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,310
Times change.

602
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,720
Over time,

603
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,200
people always change.

604
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,160
That's right.

605
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,030
Speaking of which,

606
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,750
the Mu Qingge from before

607
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,680
was so spirited

608
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,750
and unique.

609
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,550
But the Mu Qingge now

610
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,670
only has a shell,

611
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,720
and has become vulgar, dull,

612
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,680
malicious, and despicable.

613
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,300
So disappointing.

614
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,160
My Lord, it's good that you can see

615
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,310
her true color.

616
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,560
In comparison, that disciple of Su Yishui

617
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,240
suits my taste quite well.

618
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,640
She has some of the charm that Mu Qingge used to have.

619
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,130
Prepare some gifts and send them to Ranran.

620
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,030
The Wester Sect is quite austere,

621
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,480
so there probably aren't many good things.

622
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,160
She should be easy to win over.

623
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,960
These fennel cakes are a good choice.

624
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,640
Take some to her.

625
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,500
She's from a righteous sect.

626
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,510
She might not be used to the desserts

627
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,790
of a demonic cultivator like you.

628
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,510
Righteous sect?

629
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,550
Once I destroy it, it will be nothing.

630
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,030
This time, after Su Yishui returned from the Marrow-Cleansing Pool,

631
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,640
his cultivation was damaged.

632
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
He won't be able to suppress the Spirit Spring for long.

633
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,960
He will definitely be eager

634
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,190
to find the gate to the netherworld.

635
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:30,960
At that time,

636
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,350
I'll be waiting for him,

637
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,590
and I'll kill him, the sovereign of the Wester Sect.

638
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,830
By then,

639
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,690
the Spirit Spring and his beautiful disciple

640
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,960
will both be in my grasp.

641
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,830
Where are you going?

642
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,970
Aren't you here to drink with me?

643
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,110
My Lord, you should savor

644
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,350
your grand ambitions on your own.

645
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,270
What's wrong with her?

646
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,790
Isn't this

647
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,420
a perfect way to enrage Su Yishui?

648
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,200
With the moonlight by the window,

649
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,400
in moments of restlessness,

650
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,830
I often think of the sweet potato chips

651
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,750
you gave me.

652
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,550
I'm deeply grateful.

653
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,830
Therefore, I'm returning the favor with a generous gift.

654
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,350
I'm also worried that your fair skin might be left with scars

655
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,280
from the Devourer Bugs,

656
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,110
so I'm sending you some miraculous medicine from the Scarlet Sect.

657
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,650
I hope that when we see each other again,

658
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,510
you will still be as beautiful as before.

659
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,940
There are 10 poems I wrote along with all these things.

660
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,720
I hope you will accept them.

661
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,240
Wei Jiu.

662
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,550
Ranran,

663
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,130
the poems from Sovereign Wei are all love poems.

664
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,310
What is he up to?

665
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,960
Are you stupid?

666
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,550
Isn't it obvious

667
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,920
that he has fallen for our Junior?

668
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,510
The pills he sent are all good ones.

669
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,240
It seems Sovereign Wei has really gone all out.

670
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,960
Ranran,

671
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,210
how do you plan

672
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,030
to handle these things?

673
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,550
Just burn them.

674
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:24,970
Ranran,

675
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,350
you smell like you're in a hurry.

676
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,750
What's wrong?

677
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Master told me

678
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,450
not to reveal his injuries to anyone

679
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,030
to avoid causing panic.

680
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,510
Master is a little exhausted

681
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,440
from protecting us from the sword formation.

682
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,580
Don't worry.

683
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,050
If there's any letter from Master Liang,

684
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,900
you must inform me right away.

685
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,310
Here's a letter.

686
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,570
It's for Master.

687
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,070
It should be

688
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,070
from Su Yu.

689
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,940
I'll go take it to Master.

690
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,400
Burn them?

691
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,630
Burn them.

692
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,659
Master.

693
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,070
Master?

694
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,190
The Soul Control Technique is so draining.

695
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,150
Will there be

696
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,190
any side effects?

697
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,360
The person who uses the Soul Control Technique

698
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,510
stores their soul

699
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,840
in a spiritual beast's body,

700
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,570
so within a month,

701
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,190
they are often possessed by the spiritual beast.

702
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,290
Sometimes,

703
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,030
they'll also retain

704
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,920
some of the spiritual beast's habits.

705
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,880
Don't be scared if you see that.

706
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,710
So it's the side effect acting up.

707
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,590
Master.

708
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,600
Do you want me to scratch you

709
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,760
like I did to Bai?

710
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,850
Do you like it,

711
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,460
Master?

712
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,410
I prefer you like this.

713
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,840
Not keeping people at arm's length at all.

714
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,250
Master, are you hungry?

715
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,150
I've made something delicious for you.

716
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,960
I originally thought you'd

717
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,400
throw me out along with the bowls.

718
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:46,800
Here.

719
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,320
When did you come in?

720
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,180
Master,

721
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,790
when I came in just now,

722
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,670
I saw Bai possess you again.

723
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,440
You wanted me to pet you,

724
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,320
so I...

725
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,400
Didn't I tell you

726
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,240
to stay away from me?

727
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,070
Are you ignoring my words?

728
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,960
Well, just consider me a rebellious disciple.

729
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,360
Mr. Zeng said that

730
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,510
in these days,

731
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,640
you would experience the side effects

732
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,930
of the Soul Control Technique just like you did just now

733
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,000
and act like a little tiger sometimes.

734
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,710
Your rebellious disciple has to stay by your side,

735
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,920
scratching you

736
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,920
and smoothing your fur.

737
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,630
You...

738
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,880
Master, are you hungry?

739
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,180
Do you want to eat the food

740
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,110
your rebellious disciple made for you?

741
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,510
Xue Ranran,

742
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,550
don't think

743
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,710
I can't bring myself to punish you.

744
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:57,630
Master,

745
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,420
for what reason are you going to punish me?

746
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,480
For liking you?

747
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,710
I've flipped through

748
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,960
the Wester Sect rules overnight,

749
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,630
not a single one says

750
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,280
you can't have feelings for your own master.

751
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:11,880
Besides,

752
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:12,960
isn't our Wester Sect

753
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,150
known for producing rebellious disciples?

754
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,840
Master, I think

755
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,450
you were quite similar to me back then.

756
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,710
Since your heart already belongs to someone else,

757
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,880
that means I came too late.

758
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,800
I accept that.

759
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,450
But I can't

760
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,420
take you out

761
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,200
of my heart.

762
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,080
Because of Master Mu's

763
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,800
kindness to you,

764
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,380
you are deeply in love with her;

765
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,320
that's your fate with her.

766
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,130
I developed feelings for you

767
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,030
through our time together;

768
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,230
that's my fate with you.

769
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,070
From the moment you abducted me up the mountain,

770
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,030
on the very first day, you said that

771
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,960
the Wester Sect has its own way,

772
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,800
and I should follow my way.

773
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,670
I listened to you.

774
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,840
You have your own convictions,

775
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,440
and I have mine.

776
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,710
You're holding onto yours,

777
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,960
and I'm holding onto mine.

778
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,590
We have a long future ahead.

779
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,190
I won't give up.

780
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,560
You can control everything, including your disciples,

781
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,960
but you can't control what's in my heart.

782
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,630
Master, what's wrong with your eyes?

783
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,360
I don't have time

784
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,320
to listen to your nonsense.

785
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,190
You're simply incorrigible.

786
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:27,960
From now on,

787
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,680
I'll make delicious food for you every day

788
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,760
to help you recover.

789
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,400
Now I'm the most powerful

790
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,550
alchemical cultivator on the mountain.

791
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,690
The food I make

792
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,030
is not only delicious but also beneficial for your health.

793
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,360
Master,

794
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,000
you must eat it.

795
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,400
Only when you're healed

796
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,280
can you continue to bicker

797
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,880
with your rebellious disciple for a long time, right?

798
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,810
Look what your little disciple

799
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,030
cooked for you.

800
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,440
Red bean porridge.

801
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,360
Red beans cure lovesickness.

802
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,930
The response you've been waiting for for over a decade

803
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,070
is right before your eyes.

804
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,840
Can you bear to die?

805
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,480
Are you really so cruel to yourself?

806
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,440
Master,

807
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,550
I don't believe

808
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,800
that none of what you did for me

809
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,480
was out of love.

810
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,550
You have your own convictions,

811
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,070
and I have mine.

812
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,480
You're holding onto yours,

813
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,550
and I'm holding onto mine.

814
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
We have a long future ahead.

815
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,030
I won't give up.

816
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,520
Let me stay with you.

817
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,670
This time, the outcome will surely be different.

818
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,390
Trust me.

819
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,150
I'll grant you power.

820
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,800
You'll be able to control me.

821
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,550
Dominating the universe with the beauty in your arms.

822
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,480
No one will dare harm Xue Ranran again.

823
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,590
If I keep you,

824
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,370
it will only be me who hurts her in the future.

825
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,760
I will never let the past repeat itself.

826
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,060
[Wester Sect]

827
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,840
[Su Yishui, I have urgent matters to discuss with you in person. It about Ranran. Su Yu.]

828
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,250
Su Yu has already seen through

829
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,400
Ranran's true identity.

830
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,960
Guardian,

831
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,450
then what does he mean

832
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
by sending this letter?

833
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,670
He didn't tell me in the letter.

834
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,810
But actually, back in Puxin Village,

835
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,760
Su Yu had already known

836
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,000
the true identity of Mu Ranwu.

837
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,190
Yet he kept quiet about it,

838
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,130
and instead, he helped her enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

839
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,570
He must be plotting something.

840
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,760
I guess what he's plotting

841
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,110
is related to the Dragon Mother

842
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,150
in Puxin Village.

843
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,880
Guardian, are you saying...

844
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,640
Could it be that Su Yu's target

845
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,760
was Meng Zhang?

846
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,280
Could it be

847
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,000
that his appearance in Puxin Village at that time

848
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,960
wasn't a coincidence?

849
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,760
This cousin of mine

850
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,800
is much more shrewd than I am.

851
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,230
These past few days, my injuries have improved.

852
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,000
I should indeed go to the palace

853
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,360
to get the Xuantian Teachings.

854
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,090
And to see what he's

855
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,930
really up to.

856
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,960
What about Ranran?

857
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,250
[Two days later]

858
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,590
She will have her own life,

859
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,710
a brand new life

860
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,440
without me.

861
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,800
Ranran,

862
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,840
I bear much responsibility for your reincarnation,

863
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,230
which is why I brought you back to the Wester Sect.

864
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,910
Now, all our past favors and grudges are dissolved.

865
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,950
And I have more important things

866
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:39,720
to attend to now.

867
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,670
I won't come back again.

868
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,190
You should leave on your own.

869
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,070
If you still consider me your master,

870
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,190
promise me

871
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,960
you won't be held back by anything.

872
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,960
Live as freely as the wind.
