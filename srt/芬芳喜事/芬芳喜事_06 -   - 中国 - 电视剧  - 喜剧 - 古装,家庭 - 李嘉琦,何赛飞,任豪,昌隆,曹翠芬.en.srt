You lied about your pregnancy.

You should end up in jail!

00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,900
Jing Kan,

30
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,980
you really let me down.

Family rule,

34
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,740
a deliberate liar

35
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,300
will be flogged 20 times!

36
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,780
Yes.

37
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,660
Young Master, it'll start.

38
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,300
Young Master, it's over.

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,340
Young Madam.

40
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,340
Flog me again. Come on.

41
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,260
Shut up.

42
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,700
Flog her!

43
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,660
Honey.

44
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,860
As long as you and I

45
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,780
stick together,

46
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,100
we can suffer any consequences.

47
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,060
We will always...

48
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,860
Are you all right?

49
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,980
I'm fine.

50
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,100
What about you?

51
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,020
I'm not fine.

52
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,060
Disgusting.

53
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,820
Get me up.

54
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,860
When we knew you were pregnant,

55
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,860
we were all expecting the baby.

56
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,860
We took great care of you.

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,180
Don't you feel sorry

58
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,100
for breaking our hearts?

59
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,340
You're not only bold,

60
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,960
but also evil-minded.

61
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,780
We used to think

62
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,780
we would have a descendant.

63
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,780
Sadly,

64
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,460
you're getting our hopes up.

65
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,500
Mother,

66
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,980
I have failed them.

67
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,780
I'm to blame, too.

68
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,500
Hey, Jing Kan.

69
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,140
You shouldn't have joked about this.

70
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,100
Yeah.

71
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,980
Compared to disappointment,

72
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,900
the despair after hope
is less acceptable.

73
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,220
If you ask me, a man like him

74
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,420
doesn't deserve to be part of this family.

75
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,380
He wants to be Qin Kan, right?

76
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,380
Then let him be.

77
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,460
Let's not force him.

78
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,500
You can just be Qin Kan.

79
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,660
Very well, that shop. I...

80
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,540
That shop

81
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,840
doesn't need to be open.

82
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,020
It'll be returned to the main store

83
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,740
for unified management.

84
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,420
In this case,

85
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,220
I think a reliable female manager

86
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,500
is quite necessary.

87
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,260
Why don't you just say her name?

88
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,220
Old woman,

89
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,620
who do you think you're staring at?

90
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,060
- I...
- Don't be aggressive.

91
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,860
You're in no position to speak.

92
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,620
Let me say something, please.

93
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,460
Mr. An intended

94
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,920
to give the young guys of this family

95
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,100
a chance to gain experience.

96
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,660
Sadly,

97
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,980
he trusted the wrong guy.

98
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,420
Actually, I'm very experienced

99
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,780
in business management.

100
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,340
You just won't stop, huh?

101
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,580
Madam is the chief manager

102
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,780
of Jinyu Tea.

103
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,700
She decides who will or will not

104
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,540
have a shop.

105
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,220
Shut up. Who are you to talk?

106
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,380
- I...
- Enough!

107
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,380
It's all my fault.

108
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,420
I let you down.

109
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,660
Because of me,

110
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,700
you fight over a shop

111
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,660
and consistently satirize each other.

112
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,620
Who are you talking about?

113
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,580
We'll talk about the shop thing later.

114
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,380
You should first explain

115
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,260
the fake pregnancy.

116
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,660
Right. Don't change the subject.

117
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,820
I was wrong.

118
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,460
I'm sorry, Grandmother.

119
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,780
I'm guilty about your family

120
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,140
and I'm guilty about Jing Kan.

121
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,700
Actually,

122
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,460
Jing Kan didn't know

123
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,380
about my fake pregnancy.

124
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,980
Ridiculous. How could he not know?

125
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,020
Why must he know that?

126
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,740
Do you insist

127
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,500
that he knew it

128
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,300
and then you could punish him?

129
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,980
Then why did you tell Jing Kan

130
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,260
you'd keep it until the end?

131
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,620
What do you mean

132
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,740
"until the end?"

133
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,340
Yeah. Explain it.

134
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,700
Will he be the chief manager in the end

135
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,860
or will he be

136
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,180
the master of this family?

137
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,620
Grandmother, I was wrong.

138
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,580
However,

139
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,420
if I hadn't lied about the baby,

140
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,220
would Jing Kan be back here?

141
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,860
If I hadn't lied about the baby,

142
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,580
it wouldn't be long

143
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,580
before I was expelled

144
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,380
from this family.

145
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,500
Why do you look at me?

146
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,100
Don't change the topic.

147
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,860
Answer your grandmother.

148
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,500
What do you mean

149
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,380
"until the end"?

150
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,260
Until this family

151
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,220
ends up in harm.

152
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,260
What harm?

153
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,580
Harmony. She's illiterate.

154
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,180
On one hand, I wished

155
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,940
my husband would come back,

156
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,340
accompany Grandmother,

157
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,620
and take good care of her.

158
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,060
So, she wouldn't worry
about his wandering life.

159
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,460
On the other hand, I wished

160
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,420
he and I

161
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,780
could live a peaceful life

162
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,380
on our own.

163
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,500
This was all I wished for.

164
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,340
But that day,

165
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,340
Mother kept pressing me

166
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,820
and trying to expel me.

167
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,860
I really didn't have a choice.

168
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,620
I had to lie

169
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,940
about the pregnancy.

170
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,180
I was wrong.

171
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,260
I really was.

172
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,940
Shut up!

173
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,780
You're telling more lies!

174
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,740
Under such circumstances,

175
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,420
I don't know what to say.

176
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,220
Punish me or kill me.

177
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,780
Curse me or divorce me.

178
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,340
It's up to you.

179
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,220
I have only one request.

180
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,660
I don't want Jing Kan to be involved.

181
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,260
He's my only husband.

182
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,380
I don't want him to get into my trouble.

183
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,260
My Lady,

184
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,700
she's really good at the act.

185
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,860
Don't fall for that.

186
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,580
I believe they colluded.

187
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,100
- But they play innocent.
- Any proof?

188
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,020
I certainly...

189
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,300
If I'm wrong about that,

190
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,820
humiliate me as you wish.

191
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,940
All right. Plump girl.

192
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,860
You...

193
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,060
Grandmother, look at her.

194
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,140
How could she still

195
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,300
talk nonsense?

196
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,220
Jing Kan,

197
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
did you not know that?

198
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,220
Oh, Grandmother.

199
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,140
Mother.

200
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,540
Nod now.

201
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,540
This is ridiculous. Ridiculous!

202
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,460
Grandmother,

203
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,180
we will have a baby.

204
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,580
Trust me.

205
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,340
Zhusi,

206
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,540
how shall we deal with them?

207
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,460
Mother,

208
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,260
you aren't going to shield them, huh?

209
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,340
I'm not, of course.

210
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,940
They'll be punished by the rules.

211
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,780
So, the punishment is...

212
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,140
In the next three months, Sixi will

213
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,780
do the washing, cooking, and cleaning,

214
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,340
and serve everybody.

215
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,420
Your mother-in-law is right.

216
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,820
Learn some manners

217
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,500
to be a good daughter-in-law.

218
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,680
Mother,

219
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,740
I haven't said anything yet.

220
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,860
Yeah, Grandmother.

221
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,740
You're way too partial to her.

222
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,460
People will complain.

223
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,060
- What people think matters.
- Right.

224
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,500
Jing Kan and his wife are deceitful,

225
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,420
and incompetent.

226
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,100
He isn't good enough

227
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,660
to be our chief manager.

228
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,180
- How about...?
- Three months.

229
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,100
Within three months,

230
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,060
I will prosper

231
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,980
Anping Bridge Shop.

232
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,660
Sixi, you have so much faith in me.

233
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,660
I won't let you down.

234
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,420
What if you fail?

235
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,060
If I fail, I'll quit.

236
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,020
Then either of you

237
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,060
will get this shop back.

238
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,340
You can fight over it.

239
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,300
Silly boy,

240
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,220
do you know what you're saying?

241
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,580
It's a deal, then.

242
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,380
But I don't think

243
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,540
Sixi will learn manners at home.

244
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,100
She'll go to Yuanyang House in town.

245
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,100
All right. I'll go.

246
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,180
Fine. Let's do it, then.

247
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,780
(Veneration of Ancestors)

248
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,980
Are you all right?

249
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,900
Get off me.

250
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,220
Such a terrible idea.

251
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,300
It was a great chance,

252
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,620
but we didn't get back that shop.

253
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,980
Again, that woman

254
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,940
tricked us.

255
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,980
That woman

256
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,180
knew what she should do.

257
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,060
She knew exactly

258
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,020
how to manipulate Mother.

259
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,300
How?

260
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,420
She knew

261
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,060
as long as she shielded Jing Kan,

262
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,980
Mother would definitely defend her.

263
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,380
Oh, I see.

264
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,300
But you!

265
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,900
She faked pregnancy for long

266
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,860
while you didn't notice anything wrong.

267
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,700
Essentially,

268
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,340
I'm not as evil as her.

269
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,860
I didn't even dare

270
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,780
to think about the fake pregnancy thing.

271
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,980
Governesses Hua and Zhu

272
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,020
in Yuanyang House

273
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,700
are your friends, right?

274
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,660
When she's in there,

275
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,540
you'll know what to do, huh?

276
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,940
No wonder you didn't want her

277
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,180
to learn manners at home.

278
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,500
I know what to do.

279
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,940
Why do you wear

280
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,820
this gloomy look?

281
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,700
These days,

282
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,620
you've tried something.

283
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,740
But think about it.

284
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,380
Did any of it really work out?

285
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,020
Tell me about it.

286
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,060
What are you going to do next?

287
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,380
I'm going to ask those two governesses

288
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,660
to give her a good lesson

289
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,860
about being a daughter-in-law.

290
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,940
When she's back, she'll respect you

291
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,060
and never disobey you.

292
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,900
Why do I insist

293
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,660
sending her there?

294
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,420
Why?

295
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,140
You said you knew it.

296
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,620
Yes. Yes, I know.

297
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,220
I sent her there

298
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,580
to break them up.

299
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,580
Without this woman,

300
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,580
Jing Kan is just nothing.

301
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,860
Do you understand? Huh?

302
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,820
Yes. Yes, I do.

303
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,140
Fine. Then tell me.

304
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,820
What should we do? Tell me.

305
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,700
Madam, I totally understand.

306
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,420
You'll see what I'm going to do.

307
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,340
I'm warning you.

308
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,540
If you mess this up,

309
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,540
you'll get a problem.

310
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,460
Understood.

311
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,020
I'm so furious.

312
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,860
Go tell Liu of the tea plantation.

313
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,340
During this period,

314
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,820
he can't give Jing Kan any tea.

315
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,660
I'd like to see

316
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,060
how he will run the shop

317
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,340
within three months

318
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,420
without any tea leaves.

319
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,060
- Got it.
- Are you sure?

320
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,900
We won't give him any tea.

321
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,740
Or what?

322
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,820
Then I really understand.

323
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,700
I'm not an idiot.

324
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,940
You're almost one.

325
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,380
You're really going to Yuanyang House?

326
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,140
Look at you.

327
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,380
Why did you make a bet?

328
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,420
And three months...

329
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,500
What if you fail?

330
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
I will succeed.

331
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,420
You...

332
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,220
Sometimes, you're really confident.

333
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,140
What? You don't trust me?

334
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,940
That's not true.

335
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,580
But the point is, the shop is actually

336
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,540
my dream of fortune,

337
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,420
my cash cow,

338
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,060
and my last hope. Understand?

339
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,180
You can't risk that shop.

340
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,340
Don't worry.

341
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,060
Since you defended me with your life,

342
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,220
I will not let you down.

343
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,580
Fine. What's done is done.

344
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,180
We'll leave it to fate.

345
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,140
Ms. Luo asked you to be quick.

346
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,020
The governesses

347
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,340
are waiting in the hall.

348
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,980
Got it.

349
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,660
Look at her.

350
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,180
I should go.

351
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,540
Do you have to go?

352
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,740
Why? You don't want me to leave?

353
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,300
I just fear that nobody will help me

354
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,420
when you're away.

355
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,620
And I don't know

356
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,460
- Mr. Wise.
- Kan,

357
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,220
one has to get over his own problem.

358
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,220
Everybody has his fate.

359
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,180
No one can get help.

360
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,620
Good luck to you and Mr. Wise.

361
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,340
Bye.

362
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,340
When I'm in Yuanyang House,

363
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,460
give me 20 taels a day, huh?

364
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,220
That's not a problem.

365
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,820
You can even get 50 taels.

366
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,820
How could you say that

367
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,340
so casually?

368
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,180
Do you know how hard

369
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,250
it is to earn that much?

370
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,140
Or are you actually

371
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,220
making empty promises?

372
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,140
I'm not that guy.

373
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,020
I'm just a little bit...

374
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,060
A little bit worried.

375
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,420
You may suffer in there.

376
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,340
No need to worry.

377
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,660
In there, I may just serve people drinks

378
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,860
or learn some needlework.

379
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,900
I can enjoy a quiet life there.

380
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,740
Sometimes, it's exhausting to stay here.

381
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,140
I should go.

382
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,460
I prepared a sachet for you.

383
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,380
You can't open it

384
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,900
unless you have to.

385
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,820
Alright.

386
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,060
Only in an emergency.

387
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,540
Don't worry.

388
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,860
Keep a low profile.

389
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,260
Don't brag too much.

390
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,420
I brag very little.

391
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,380
Take care.

392
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,780
Eat more in there.

393
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,420
She's so stubborn.

394
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,740
This is really unnecessary.

395
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,940
(Bear it.)
What's on it?

396
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,860
Bear it?

397
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,260
Totally useless.

398
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,580
(Anping Bridge)

399
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,060
Guiwei.

400
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,940
Guiwei.

401
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,900
Guiwei.

402
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,060
Guiwei...

403
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,380
Mr. Wise.

404
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,300
There you are, Kan.

405
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,500
Your cousin tried really hard

406
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,860
to entrust you to me.

407
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,580
So, Mr. Wise

408
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,820
means you aren't wise at all.

409
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,820
My cousin told me

410
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,700
to help you handle this shop.

411
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,100
So, don't worry.

412
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,260
Count on me.

413
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,500
Any brilliant idea?

414
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,780
Kan, tell me.

415
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,500
What matters most in opening a shop?

416
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,420
What?

417
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,580
To open the door.

418
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,660
Then people will know

419
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,980
our shop is open.

420
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,660
It makes sense.

421
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,700
And then?

422
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,300
Then, we'll clean this shop.

423
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,660
We sell the tea.

424
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,780
It's what people drink.

425
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,620
So, we must keep

426
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,540
a clean environment.

427
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,100
Are we missing

428
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,420
something important?

429
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
Yes, of course.

430
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,420
The most important part

431
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,460
remains undone.

432
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,300
Move in a little bit.

433
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,700
Is it all right now?

434
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,620
Yes, that's it.

(Jinyu Tea)

436
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,580
I think we still need something.

437
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,500
Confidence?

438
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,340
- No.
- Courage?

439
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,660
- No.
- My cousin?

440
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,580
No, either.

441
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,860
We don't have tea leaves, do we?

442
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,180
(Yuanyang House)

443
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,780
Thanks for waiting.

444
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,260
I'm Ai Sixi.

445
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,860
Let's go.

446
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,540
Stop right here. Go back now.

447
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,140
You may go back. Bye.

448
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,380
I'll remember the days in here.

449
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,340
I didn't expect

450
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,580
such strong feelings

451
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,540
from this place.

452
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,460
- Yeah.
- Good.

453
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,140
Move now! Move!

454
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,020
What are you doing? Go back to work!

455
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,620
Come this way.

456
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,540
You'll be living in the Supreme Room.

457
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,700
Wait a minute.

458
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,580
I left something at home.

459
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,500
I'll go get it.

460
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,460
Give in when you're here.

461
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,620
Since you're here, you'll suffer.

462
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,940
You'd better show some respect.

463
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,260
Don't ask for trouble.

464
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,380
You speak quite boldly.

465
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,100
Have you heard
of Hua Erniang, the Iron Fist?

466
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,620
The one who killed
three wild boars barehanded?

467
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,260
You know me very well.

468
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,420
I advise you not to be the fourth.

469
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,580
I'm not a wild boar!

for Women.

473

(Mind-awakening Chamber)

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,980
Don't poke me.

478
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,220
Or I'll be angry.

479
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,540
I'm angry now.

480
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,540
Someone asked me

481
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,020
to give you a good lesson.

482
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,740
(Be Demure)
From this day on,

483
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,180
your name

484
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,620
will be No. 357.

485
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,580
What is that?

486
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,420
To prevent the ladies

487
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,340
from showing off
their family background,

488
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,020
only numbers are used here

489
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,980
instead of names.

490
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,060
I won't talk back
when my husband curses me.

491
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,020
I won't fight back
when his parents hit me.

492
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,500
What are they doing?

493
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,180
This is the Mind-awakening Chamber.

494
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,860
This is where you'll have lessons

495
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,660
about woman's virtues.

496
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,620
You be here in a couple of days.

497
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,180
- Let's go.
- Go.

498
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,500
Move.

499
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,140
I won't fight back when his parents...

500
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,780
You're quite strong.

501
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,940
What is this place?

502
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,820
(Cultivation Chamber)
Cultivation Chamber.

503
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:33,900
This is where

504
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,500
you'll do self-cultivation.

505
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,820
Fine. Looks good.

506
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,060
I'll come often.

507
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,860
They're being punished.

508
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,940
Being punished?

509
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,460
Like this?

510
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,580
You have a toothy grin.

511
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,180
Use a wire brush instead.

512
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,540
I wouldn't dare. I won't grin.

513
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,500
Please spare me.

514
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,260
Brush her feet with a wire brush?

515
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,940
Is this necessary?

516
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,980
What wrong have they done?

517
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,780
No. 258 was too loud,

518
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,060
which was a bad way of speaking.

519
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,460
No. 134 embroidered

520
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,980
a very short beak of a mandarin duck,

521
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,540
which was a bad embroidery skill.

522
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,980
(Cultivation Chamber)
What kind of mistake is that?

523
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,100
Move.

524
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,860
You missed, huh?

525
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,580
I'll walk by myself.

526
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,180
And what is this place?

527
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,020
This is the Etiquette Chamber.

528
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,730
If a lady doesn't correct herself

529
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,420
after she talks rudely over three times,

530
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,300
she'll enjoy some herbal tea here.

531
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,560
Herbal tea?

532
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,780
The pepper water, actually.

533
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,100
You're so inhumane.

534
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,340
One warning to No. 357.

535
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,660
What?

536
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,660
Done looking around, huh?

537
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,060
Then get to work.

538
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,140
Wait, wait.

539
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,180
What work?

540
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,380
My back still hurts.

541
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,820
How about I make it hurt more?

542
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,740
Move!

543
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,860
Who are you yelling at?

544
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,000
You.

545
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,140
You know what?

546
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,420
I'm not a pushover.

547
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,460
I just used a little strength.

548
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,260
- It hurts!
- I also used

549
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,500
a little strength. Strong enough?

550
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,340
Yes, yes.

551
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,940
- Can you move now?
- Yes, yes.

552
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,900
- Then, move.
- Go.

553
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,900
My pack.

554
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,620
(Wei Shuangxi, No. 132)
Pick it up.

555
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,380
- And the book.
- Wait. My book.

556
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,780
Stop looking out!

557
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,700
Drink it up.

558
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,940
This is such a big tea plantation.

559
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,980
What are they doing?

560
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,060
Tea leaves prefer warmth and dryness.

561
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,940
And they prefer coolness.

562
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,340
For the first step,
bamboo leaves are used

563
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,780
in porcelain jars to avoid moisture.

564
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,020
So many rules for tea leaves.

565
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,380
Tea leaves are precious.

566
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:00,780
From a leaf

567
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,140
to a treasured drink,

568
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,420
it goes through fire, water,

569
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,660
and hard work of countless people.

570
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,980
So every step must be serious.

571
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,460
I'll keep that in mind.

572
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,220
What are they steaming?

573
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,660
Tea steaming?

574
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,500
You must do three things.

575
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,620
First, grasp it cleanly.

576
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,420
Second, shake it quickly.

577
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,100
Third, spread it evenly.

578
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,740
- Turn it.
- Liu.

579
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,660
Young Master.

580
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,060
Making steamed tea?

581
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,780
Yes.

582
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,100
Since when do we

583
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,020
sell steamed tea?

584
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,620
Business is hard.

585
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,340
A lot of people drink steamed tea.

586
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,300
Chief Luo asked us

587
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,620
not to give up these customers.

588
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,020
So, we've made

589
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,740
some steamed tea.

590
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,420
Can we outperform Laolongtan Tea?

591
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,700
Their ancestors

592
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,820
made compressed tea.

593
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,100
And our tea pan-firing

594
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,220
hasn't ever improved

595
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,340
in the past few years.

596
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,820
I think we should

597
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,660
focus all our energy

598
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,940
on its breakthrough.

599
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,500
This is the key.

600
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,380
It's not about the technique.

601
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,820
But money, Young Master.

602
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,580
You don't know how hard business is.

603
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,340
All over our shops, there are

604
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,300
more than a hundred men.

605
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,340
They need money to live.

606
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,380
Without money,

607
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,700
how could we keep them?

608
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,700
Then, the other two tea shops

609
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,620
would poach them.

610
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,260
Besides,

611
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,220
the tea pan-firing

612
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,620
can't be improved overnight.

613
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,460
It requires

614
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,700
manpower, resources, and money.

615
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,300
A breakthrough is great.

616
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,500
But what if we fail?

617
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,420
What a waste of time, huh?

618
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,500
What are you thinking?

619
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,980
That's not a waste of time.

620
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,180
Anyway, if you think you can do that,

621
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,420
go ahead.

622
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,860
Nobody will stop you.

623
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,980
Watch your tone.

624
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,740
And who are you?

625
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,100
Who am I?

626
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,580
I'm Li Guiwei,

627
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,060
manager of Anping Bridge Shop.

628
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,300
Today, we're here

629
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,420
to get back some tea leaves.

630
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,340
Wait, wait.

631
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,940
No leaves for Anping Bridge Shop.

632
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,580
What did you say?

633
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,340
Young Master,

634
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,420
we have rules.

635
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,940
A shop will get

636
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,380
what it was selling before

637
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,300
based on the sales.

638
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,220
Young Master, you know.

639
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,620
Tea leaves have to be fresh.

640
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,340
If they're kept in a shop

641
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,380
instead of being sold,

642
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,620
they'll be wasted

643
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,780
and occupy the other share.

644
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:06,940
But Anping Bridge Shop

645
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,900
was closed years ago.

646
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,380
Nothing has been sold in recent years.

647
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,780
Then get a signed sheet from Chief Luo.

648
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,860
Anyway, in here,

649
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,060
no sheet, no tea.

650
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,420
Don't give us a hard time.

651
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,740
Don't say that.

652
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,340
I'm following the rules.

653
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,460
Without rules,

654
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,980
we would have been in a mess.

655
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,820
Rules are rigid.

656
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,740
But you aren't, huh?

657
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,140
Well, I have things to do.

658
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,420
Excuse me, then.

659
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,380
Young Master, I'll go back to work.

660
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,450
- Look at him.
- Guiwei.

661
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,380
Don't argue with him.

662
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,300
He won't help us.

663
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,820
Take my message to Chief Luo.

664
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,740
She won't laugh at me.

665
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,820
Turn it!

666
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,140
Don't just stand there!

667
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,940
Let's go.

668
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,580
Look. I can do this.

669
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,820
Oh no.

670
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,820
You have a try.

671
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,980
Could you please stop?

672
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,740
You don't deserve food
for such poor work.

673
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,980
There.

674
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,220
Here.

675
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,300
It's everywhere.

676
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,420
And here.

677
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,260
Very dirty.

678
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,100
And here.

679
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,960
So dirty.

680
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,500
And here. Rather dirty.

681
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,980
What do you want?

682
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,580
What? Try to complain?

683
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,020
No. 357 will have no food for today.

684
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,780
Give me food. I want food.

685
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,300
When will you stop

686
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,980
trying to hit me all the time?

687
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,220
Fine. No food, huh?

688
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,460
Then, I'll bite you.

689
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,940
Stop!

690
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,540
You bad woman, how dare you bite me!

691
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,900
What are you? A dog?

692
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,260
You want food, huh?

693
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,740
No problem.

694
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,700
You can't eat until you finish

695
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,900
grinding 30 jin of flour.

696
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,700
You couldn't have made me work.

697
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,100
The steamed bun isn't necessary.

698
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,140
You want food, don't you?

699
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,300
Will you let me eat?

700
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,860
I'll make you see it but not eat it.

701
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,700
Psychopath.

702
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,580
What did you say?

703
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,460
I said, any pancake?

704
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,980
When I'm out,

705
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,020
you'd better not fall into my hands.

706
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,620
What are you muttering?

707
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,940
Nothing. I'm working.

708
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,220
Who are you?

709
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,260
Hello, No. 357.

710
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,380
I'm No. 132.

711
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,420
Do I know you?

712
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,260
I gambled in your gambling house.

713
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,820
That was an inn.

714
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,660
Here.

715
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,180
Where did you get this?

716
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,700
After staying here for long,

717
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,300
I have an inside track.

718
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,540
Are you all right?

719
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,180
I'm fine. Still alive.

720
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,180
I've been watching you for a while.

721
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,900
You're really foolhardy.

722
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,020
Miserable fate.

723
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,660
Tragic destiny.

724
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,780
One single mistake led to total failure.

725
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,180
Do you know why this place exists?

726
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,420
Is it because

727
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,580
the evil Magistrate Meng

728
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,820
wants everybody to get married?

729
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,900
No.

730
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,380
Because it's a place

731
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,900
for disciplining women.

732
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,660
Discipline?

733
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,500
How?

734
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,300
- By torturing them.
- Torturing?

735
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,460
It's another word

736
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,460
for "punishing".

737
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,060
Do you want to get out?

738
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,580
You can do that?

739
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,420
I can't tell you.

740
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,620
Why?

741
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,900
Because what we have to do

742
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,820
is rather risky.

743
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,180
If you're caught,

744
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,380
you'll be terribly tortured.

745
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,300
Now, I'm already terribly tortured.

746
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,220
No.

747
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,100
If you're caught,

748
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,740
you'll blame me.

749
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,540
Why would I blame you?

750
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,260
When you appeared

751
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,460
with the food,

752
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,700
I knew

753
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,340
you were a heaven-sent angel.

754
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,180
It feels so good

755
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,220
to be trusted.

756
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,340
No time to waste.

757
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,300
I'm taking you out now.

758
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,880
- All right.
- Let's go.

759
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,580
Kan,

760
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,460
you looked calm.

761
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,340
Any solution?

762
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,260
No.

763
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,100
No? Then why...?

764
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,580
Guiwei, remember.

765
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,980
A man lives on his dignity.

766
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,980
The worse the situation is,

767
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,420
the more confidence you must fake.

768
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,820
Sometimes, as you keep faking,

769
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,100
it will really work out.

770
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,420
Why aren't you excited to hear

771
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,460
such inspiring words?

772
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,780
When Sixi said this to you,

773
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,700
I was also there.

774
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,380
There's a steamed bun shop nearby.

775
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,660
Steamed bun?

776
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,580
There isn't any.

777
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,100
Not at all.

778
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,100
Are you sure?

779
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,300
Why have you been selling

780
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,340
tea leaves instead of fish?

781
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,980
I met a very kind man.

782
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,540
He thought I earned
very little money from fish.

783
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,020
So, he gave me some tea leaves.

784
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,260
I'll sell them, then.

785
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,580
Who's that man?

786
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,500
Such a great man in our county.

787
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,420
He isn't a local guy.

788
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,100
He's Tea Master.

789
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,620
Who exactly is he?

790
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,460
You don't even know him?

791
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,580
He's a man who makes great tea.

792
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,300
Kan, how about

793
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,460
we check somewhere else?

794
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,980
Watch and learn.

795
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,540
I've heard you sell tea leaves.

796
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,180
How do you know?

797
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,140
I knew it from my best friend,

798
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,580
Tea Master.

799
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,700
You're his friend?

800
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,900
The closest friend.

801
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,540
Two taels of silver for half a jin.

802
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,940
Two taels?

803
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,220
Way too expensive.

804
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,140
Don't interrupt.

805
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,020
How about this?

806
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,140
I give you four taels

807
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,980
and you'll tell me

808
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,420
where the Tea Master is.

809
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,020
But you're his friend.

810
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,500
Why do you not know that?

811
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,260
Well, umm...

812
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,100
We lost contact for a long time.

813
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,500
But you just said

814
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,700
he told you

815
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,820
about the tea leaves here.

816
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,100
Kids just don't know

817
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:03,940
the adult thing.

818
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,100
He moved away, huh?

819
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,620
That's right.

820
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,780
He has moved away.

821
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,820
That's the thing.

822
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,780
How about this?

823
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,740
You give me ten taels.

824
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,660
I won't give you tea leaves,

825
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,140
but tell you where he lives.

826
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:14,980
Ten?

827
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,220
That's not too much, is it?

828
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,460
Listen, Kan.

829
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,580
This boy is tricky.

830
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,500
Don't let him fool you.

831
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,740
Take this.

832
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,340
Go away.

833
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,980
Hey, boy.

834
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,060
You'll be very promising.

835
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,380
You just gave him that?

836
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,580
Watch and learn.

837
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,900
I can't learn anything.

838
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,860
I won't talk back
when my husband curses me.

839
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,580
I won't fight back
when his parents hit me.

840
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,260
I won't talk back
when my husband curses me.

841
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,980
I won't fight back
when his parents hit me.

842
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,580
I won't talk back
when my husband curses me.

843
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,020
I won't fight back
when his parents hit me.

844
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,580
I won't talk back
when my husband curses me.

845
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,100
I won't fight back
when his parents hit me.

846
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,900
I won't talk back
when my husband curses me.

847
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,100
Here?

848
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,980
Outside the wall is Sipo Bay.

849
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,500
A lot of ghosts haunt there.

850
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,620
Will you be scared?

851
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,540
Scared?

852
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,420
Even ghosts will be tortured here.

853
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,660
Everybody has to work here.

854
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,180
Nobody can live an easy life here.

855
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,050
What else scares me?

856
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,900
At this critical time,

857
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,500
the rhyme isn't necessary.

858
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,580
Keep this in mind.

859
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,740
Pass the Sipo Bay

860
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,220
and you'll go straight to Sheji Altar.

861
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,580
Then you'll reach Jianping Academy.

862
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,660
If we get separated,

863
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,980
we'll meet there, all right?

864
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,900
Got it.

865
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,100
Tie up your dress.

866
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,180
Alright.

867
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,340
You go first.

868
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,820
No. I'll go after you.

869
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,340
I never thought

870
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,940
I could have

871
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,300
such a loyal friend here.

872
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,660
Stop nagging.

873
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,700
They'll be back soon.

874
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,580
Get up there.

875
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:01,940
I'm leaving, then.

876
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,620
- Come on.
- Sure.

877
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,980
One, two, go.

878
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,100
Try harder. Come on.

879
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,900
One, two, go.

880
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,420
Go.

881
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,980
Are you holding it?

882
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,140
Yes.

883
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,460
- Tight?
- Yes.

884
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,580
Good. I'll let go.

885
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,500
Alright.

886
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,340
Hey, hey.

887
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,420
You hold tight.

888
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,860
Somebody come!

889
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,940
Governesses! Governesses!

890
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,140
Come, governesses!

891
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,180
Someone's running away, governesses!

892
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,580
Somebody come!

893
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,380
Come, governesses!

894
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,900
Governesses, come here.

895
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,100
Hey, ma'am.

896
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,140
Get down here.

897
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,860
Help! Help!

898
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,460
Careful, governesses.

899
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,740
Get down here.

900
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,500
- Come down here.
- Help!

901
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,620
Be careful.

902
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,820
Don't get hurt, governesses.

903
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,380
Be very careful.

904
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,740
Get down here.

905
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,900
Let me jump.

906
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,900
Get down here!

907
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,260
(Isolation Chamber)

908
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,260
How dare you escape!

909
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,620
It doesn't hurt.

910
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,580
How dare you talk back!

911
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,620
It doesn't hurt at all.

912
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,380
Does it hurt, huh?

913
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,740
No.

914
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,660
Does it hurt now?

915
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,900
No.

916
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,380
How dare you escape!

917
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,700
Does it hurt?

918
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,020
No.

919
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,580
What about now?

920
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,100
Yes, yes.

921
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,380
I was wrong, governesses.

922
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,420
I won't do that again.

923
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,780
I just won't.

924
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,580
No. 132 made a contribution.

925
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,860
After you catch one more runaway,

926
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,180
you will be released.

927
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,380
Yes.

928
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,220
Governess Zhu,

929
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,300
you've taught me a lot.

930
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,300
I'm really grateful.

931
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,620
You treacherous woman.

932
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,460
I trusted you.

933
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,580
But you sold me out.

934
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,620
According to Item 3,

935
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,500
Article 6, Chapter 8

936
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,620
of Necessary Virtues

937
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,580
for Women

938
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,540
in Yuanyang House,

939
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,380
when one insults a stranger,

940
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,900
curses, and refuses to repent,

941
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,980
she deserves a big demerit.

942
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,700
Three family members must vouch for her.

943
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,740
Or she can never leave this place.

944
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,140
Is there no law here?

945
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,420
Law?

946
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,940
She just recited it.

947
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,940
What can you get

948
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,140
from flattering them like that?

949
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,420
Stop yelling!

950
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,300
Don't argue with her.

951
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,740
Go get the Misfortune-dispelling Liquid.

952
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,940
Liquid?

953
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,340
What is that?

954
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,700
It's some liquid

955
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,180
made from pepper and tears

956
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,020
of other women,

957
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,940
my silly girl.

958
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,860
Alright, No. 132.

959
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,460
You go back to work.

960
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,740
Yes.

961
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,660
Come back.

962
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,020
Come back here!

963
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,580
No. 132! No. 132!

964
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,100
Come on, my stubborn lady,

965
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,140
my caged bird,

966
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,100
and my helpless captive.

967
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,180
Try the wonderful taste

968
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,620
of the Liquid.

969
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,380
I'll drink this much?

970
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,620
Don't worry. You won't drink it.

971
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,180
You'll put your feet in it.

972
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,820
Your feet are injured, right?

973
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,780
This is the treatment.

974
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,140
Hey, don't. Please don't.

975
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,100
Governesses, hey.

976
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,060
I won't run away again.

977
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,860
Governesses, I'm begging you.

978
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,780
Please don't.
