chopping wood)

Landlady.

36
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,490
- Bye.
- You're leaving?

37
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,290
Come again,
and I'll give you a discount.

38
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,170
All right.

39
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,450
Take it slow.

40
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,940
(No gambling)
Place your bets.

41
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,260
- Big.
- Big, big.

42
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,300
Hurry up and bet.

43
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,380
Place your bets.

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,410
Big, big.

45
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,610
- Big.
- Big!

46
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,660
Okay, let's take a look.

47
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,980
Is this one big?

48
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,980
Big, big, big!

49
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,860
You big fools.

50
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,820
I told you not to gamble here.

51
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,570
What if you bring the officials here?

52
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,330
Landlady, this isn't right.

53
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,340
If gambling is forbidden,

54
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,500
why open an inn here?

55
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,940
I like it here. Is that not allowed?

56
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,260
I thought you chose this place

57
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,500
for your inn.

58
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,540
Stop your nonsense.

59
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,060
- Put it away.
- Fine, fine.

60
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,910
Stop it, stop it.

61
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,010
No more gambling.

62
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,050
Okay, we'll stop.

63
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,100
(No gambling)
Can you come

64
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,270
and see me earlier next time?

65
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,150
All right.

66
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,450
Landlady.

67
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,330
Just in case...

68
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,050
I mean,

69
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,820
if my wife asks about this,

70
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,170
you know what to say, right?

71
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,220
You're such a coward.

72
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,170
No, no.

73
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,540
What should I say?

74
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,100
Listen, I can't help you with this.

75
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,690
- Why?
- Why?

76
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,480
Aren't you ashamed?

77
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,380
I'm doing you a favor
by not reporting you.

78
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,110
This is so remote.

79
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,990
Isn't it to accommodate people like us?

80
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,540
What nonsense are you saying?

81
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,610
Every day...

82
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,650
Fine, I won't say anything.

83
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,940
But if your wife actually comes,

84
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,860
then I will...

85
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,820
Honey, you look stunning today.

86
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,380
I will shout,

87
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,660
"The butcher is here."

88
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,080
Then you two can use the back door.

89
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,820
Honey, the way you paid her

90
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,450
is so cute.

91
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,820
(Guiwei, Ai Sixi's cousin)
Enjoy.

92
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,020
It's just a bit remote.

93
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,420
Is that a crime?

94
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,100
Of course.

95
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,020
Why did you open an inn here then?

96
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,840
Why not raise your voice?

97
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,900
Just go report it.

98
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,420
What crime did I commit?

99
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,480
That man died suddenly.

100
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,500
What's it to me?

101
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,660
Sixi, why didn't you make it clear
to the officials?

102
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,940
Can I make it clear?

103
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,640
Good deeds go unrewarded.

104
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,220
Landlady.

105
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,020
What's wrong?

106
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,660
Compensate for my daughter's dowry!

107
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,180
What? Why should we?

108
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,500
Huo Lao'er lost

109
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,260
my daughter's dowry here.

110
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,420
Ma'am,

111
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,700
you're being unreasonable.

112
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,220
We forbid gambling.

113
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,540
You can see it there.

114
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,860
(No gambling)
Not our business.

115
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,220
I don't care.

116
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,780
If you don't pay up today,

117
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,380
I...

118
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,420
I won't leave.

119
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,500
Don't make a scene here.

120
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,380
Come on, come at me.

121
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,100
I don't want to live anyway.

122
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,700
How will I get by from now on?

123
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,220
God, why is my life so bitter?

124
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,860
What are you looking at?
She's after you.

125
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,060
Ma'am, why are you so hopeless?

126
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,880
What's good about getting married?

127
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,820
Look at my friend,

128
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,580
sitting here every day
eating and drinking.

129
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,760
Tell her. Are you happy?

130
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,620
Yes.

131
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,300
If you ask me
why your life is so bitter,

132
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,740
isn't it because you married

133
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,780
Huo Lao'er?

134
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,180
If you hadn't married him,
would you have so many troubles?

135
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,540
If you say that...

136
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,540
Just you wait.

137
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,700
This isn't over.

138
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,300
You broke my chair.

139
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,740
Sixi, what you said earlier

140
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,980
was indeed a bit harsh.

141
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,260
Honest words are always harsh.

142
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,900
I'm just being frank.

143
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,980
It's true.

144
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,860
What's good about getting married?

145
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,940
Say it, say it out loud.

146
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,540
Can you even say it?

147
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,620
Marriage is the most losing trade

148
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,740
in the world.

149
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,100
Right, Miss?

150
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,260
Love yourself.

151
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,420
If you don't marry,

152
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,780
what will you do when you're old?

153
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,420
Can marriage stop aging?

154
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,260
If I marry, I'll age even faster.

155
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,920
Fine.

156
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,780
When you fall in love,

157
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,040
we'll see if you'll get married.

158
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,940
Why should I fall in love?

159
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,260
Am I doing so well

160
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,360
that I need some trouble?

161
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,540
Or have I made so much money

162
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,700
that I want to lose some?

163
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,740
I just love myself.

164
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,700
Isn't that fine?

165
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,060
Do you know what the people

166
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,860
at our inn call you?

167
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,780
What?

168
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,740
The Black Widow.

169
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,340
Black Widow?

170
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,620
Is my skin so dark?

171
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,380
Shouldn't you care more about "widow"?

172
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,420
Landlady.

173
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,020
Why hasn't the privy been cleaned?

174
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,180
Why haven't you cleaned it?

175
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,220
I'm on it.

176
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,740
Coming.

177
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,540
I wanted to open an inn

178
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,680
and live under a false name,

179
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,780
but life turned out

180
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,100
like doing my time outside prison.

181
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,380
What a fate.

182
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,620
You're my only friend.

183
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,100
I prepared some hearty dishes for you.

184
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,940
You must help me.

185
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,300
This one, I'll down it.

186
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,180
I'm not demanding.

187
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,180
First,

188
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,580
I hope our inn

189
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,780
can earn enough money

190
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,100
for Guiwei and me to live on.

191
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,940
Second,

192
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,500
I hope the Jin Buhuan matter

193
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,460
will be resolved soon.

194
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,740
Keep me safe.

195
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,060
Something is wrong, Sixi!

196
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,060
Sixi.

197
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,060
Where are you?

198
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,140
Here.

199
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,660
- Quick.
- Why are you on the ground?

200
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,700
Help me up.

201
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,540
My waist, my waist.

202
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,300
I told you not to buy that stool.

203
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,020
You insisted on the bargain.

204
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,140
What's wrong?

205
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,180
Are you sure you want to hear it now?

206
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,860
Why are you panicking?

207
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,100
It's not that.

208
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,780
Ms. Huo reported us

209
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,860
for gambling,

210
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,540
and now a few constables

211
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,180
have come to seal our inn.

212
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,140
Sixi.

213
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,300
Sixi.

214
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,860
Sixi, slow down.

215
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,540
Milord.

216
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,420
I heard the Prefect

217
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,020
was furious this afternoon.

218
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,220
Why?

219
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,420
Because we don't have

220
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,260
enough new babies

221
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,780
here in Anning Prefecture.

222
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,780
(Magistrate Meng, Taiping County)
Think about it.

223
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,560
(Advisor Xia, Meng's advisor)
He troubles me

224
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,640
with matchmaking.

225
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,020
He should've known better.

226
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,300
My monthly wage

227
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,620
is only dozens of taels.

228
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,100
Only over 100,000 taels a year.

229
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,700
Why should I fuss over that?

230
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,500
Actually, this is important.

231
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,860
Without marriages,

232
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,900
there won't be

233
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,860
enough new babies,

234
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,220
and taxes will decrease.

235
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,060
Taxes affect...

236
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,180
Speed up.

237
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,600
The Prefect ordered us

238
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,020
to resolve this within half a year.

239
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,380
I give you three months.

240
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,980
Milord, I can't, because...

241
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,940
What are you doing?

242
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,940
Are you going to watch me pee?

243
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,300
Magistrate Meng.

244
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,260
Magistrate Meng, right?

245
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,300
I've heard that you like

246
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,460
to make friends.

247
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,820
I'm here to make friends

248
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,780
with you.

249
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,780
Let's be serious.

250
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,020
We have no grievances.

251
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,900
I don't need...

252
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,820
I understand.

253
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,820
Pi Laowu sent you, right?

254
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,100
Yes, I took his money,

255
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,980
but his case is hard to handle.

256
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,380
You must give me some time.

257
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,580
Magistrate Meng.

258
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,300
I have long admired you.

259
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,940
I've been waiting here

260
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,420
because I had nowhere to call on you.

261
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,980
Here's the thing.

262
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,260
My inn was sealed.

263
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,220
Your inn?

264
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,660
Yueji Inn.

265
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,340
That gambling den?

266
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,740
An inn. It really is an inn.

267
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,700
It's a misunderstanding.

268
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,260
After it was sealed,

269
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,180
I came to beg for your mercy.

270
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,260
You jerk!

271
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,260
You scared me to death

272
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,360
by coming so late with arms.

273
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,620
Turning up with blades and sticks.
So what are you after?

274
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,500
If I refuse,

275
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,350
do you plan

276
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,340
to use your sticks on me?

277
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,100
- No, no.
- See? Here it is.

278
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,980
Blown your cover, huh?

279
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,540
No. I hurt my waist. It's a cane.

280
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,660
Don't give me that act.

281
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,500
Listen.

282
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,260
Setting up a gambling den
is a grave crime,

283
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,020
and you even named it

284
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,260
Yueji Gambling House?

285
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,700
How shameless.

286
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,780
You outlaw.

287
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,780
Inn.

288
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,580
Get out. If not,

289
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,500
I'll break your staff

290
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,660
and make you crawl away.

291
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,660
Fine, I'm leaving.

292
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,620
Hurry up.

293
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,580
I'm trying.

294
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,660
Outlaw?

295
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,740
You're the real outlaw.

296
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,220
(Sealed by Taiping Government)

297
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,500
(Yueji Inn)

298
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,580
With the inn sealed,

299
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,180
all my money is down the drain.

300
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,620
Sixi, let's think positively.

301
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,540
Luckily, the woodshed wasn't sealed,

302
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,780
or we wouldn't even have
a place to stay.

303
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,740
Listen.

304
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,620
No matter what,

305
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,460
I'll get my inn back,

306
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,460
even if it risks my life.

307
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,920
Otherwise, how are we supposed

308
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,660
to live?

309
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,860
We can't even make a living.

310
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,700
But are you sure

311
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,700
you want to buy a gift

312
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,820
for Magistrate Meng here?

313
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,500
Didn't you say so?

314
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,140
Magistrate Meng likes carp.

315
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,740
I also said he likes gold bars
and ancient paintings.

316
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Forget about that.

317
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,420
Gold bars and ancient paintings?

318
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,540
If I could afford it,
I could just buy another inn.

319
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,860
I don't want to whisk it.

320
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,020
I want to brew it at home.

321
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,770
Roosters for sale!

322
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,050
Roosters for sale!

323
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,420
Jinyu Tea?

324
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,980
What do they sell here?

325
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,620
Sixi, you don't know Jinyu Tea?

326
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,280
The top tea shop

327
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,480
(Jinyu Tea)
in Taiping County.

328
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,580
Oh, right.

329
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,420
Why not buy this for Magistrate Meng?

330
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,780
What's so good

331
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,740
about those leaves?

332
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,020
Do you even understand?

333
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,020
This is better than carp.

334
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,900
Kid, why are you here alone?

335
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,900
My sister was arrested.

336
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Arrested?

337
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,060
Why?

338
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,660
The officials urged my sister to marry,

339
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,800
and she said that marriage
is a losing trade

340
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,240
and that she wants to love herself.

341
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,260
The officials got angry

342
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,380
and arrested her.

343
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,380
Listen to that.

344
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,540
"Love herself".

345
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,380
How wise.

346
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,580
Sixi,

347
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,300
I feel like you abetted his sister...

348
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,260
Go away.

349
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,740
Abetted?

350
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
It's encouragement.

351
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,380
Kid,

352
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,700
how much is the carp?

353
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Fifty wen per jin.

354
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
So expensive.

355
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,220
Is it expensive?

356
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,300
Kid,

357
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,380
if your sister were here,

358
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,820
she'd give me a discount.

359
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,460
Why?

360
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,740
Because my life motto is

361
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,980
Ai Sixi loves herself.

362
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,940
Exactly.

363
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,980
So, you are Ai Sixi?

364
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,420
Yes, it's me.

365
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,900
My goodness.

366
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,700
This child.

367
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Fine.

368
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm fine. Don't hit him.

369
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,580
- Let go.
- Stop it. I'm fine.

370
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,940
Kid.

371
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,660
Here, ten wen.

372
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,100
No need to give change.

373
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Keep it for candy.

374
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,580
Hey, what are you doing?

375
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,580
Robbing me?

376
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,700
Guiwei.

377
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,660
Sixi, I'm fine.

378
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,520
You want to give the fishing net
to Magistrate Meng?

379
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,400
You like fish, right?

380
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,460
Take this.

381
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,920
Go to Shigui Lake and catch two carp.

382
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,180
The big one for Magistrate Meng,

383
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,280
the small one for yourself.

384
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,740
Consider it a reward from me.

385
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,300
Sixi, you surely know
how to please someone.

386
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,580
Are you going or not?

387
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,740
Sixi.

388
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,780
Listen.

389
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,380
I don't want fish today.

390
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,340
What's wrong?

391
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,620
Guiwei, are you angry?

392
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,980
Guiwei.

393
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,940
I'm talking to you.

394
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,700
Guiwei!

395
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,220
Guiwei!

396
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,460
Why are you running?

397
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,180
Ai Sixi,

398
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,500
I'll make you pay today.

399
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,860
(Jing Kan)

400
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,900
You haven't paid yet.

401
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,540
Stop!

402
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,540
Carp, carp, help me.

403
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,500
Come back as the Dragon King.

404
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,700
Come here.

405
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,060
You haven't paid yet.

406
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,780
I put it on your table. Didn't you see?

407
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,740
Is it there?

408
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,340
Sorry.

409
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,780
When did she put it there?

410
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,900
Something's off about her.

411
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,500
Miss, be careful!

412
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,620
Hey, why did you push her?

413
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,100
Weren't you the one who pushed her?

414
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,460
Miss.

415
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,580
Come here, come.

416
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,700
Grab it, grab it.

417
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,260
Try harder.

418
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,780
Help her, or I'll report you.

419
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,500
Do you want...

420
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,380
A pair of fools.

421
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,260
You can't swim?

422
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,220
Why are you saving me then?

423
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,580
Up you go.

424
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,260
All right, come on.

425
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,940
Hurry! Help!

426
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,140
(Yueji Inn)

427
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,340
Not a good swimmer,

428
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,380
but surely good-looking.

429
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,340
So white.

430
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,100
What are you doing?

431
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,060
I thought your heart stopped,

432
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,200
so I was checking your pulse.

433
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,140
Done.

434
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,540
Not bad.

435
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,980
Luckily, I know a bit of dog paddle,

436
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,260
or we'd both be done for.

437
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,340
You got it wrong.

438
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,740
You knocked me in,

439
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,020
and I pulled you out.

440
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,940
What?

441
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,420
I have to go.

442
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,660
Come on.

443
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,820
Next time you try to be chivalrous,

444
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,980
keep an eye on things.

445
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,220
Here, let me help you up.

446
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,940
Slowly, slowly.

447
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,670
♪I love you♪

448
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,180
Don't take advantage of me.

449
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,980
You had a lot of water
in your ear just now.

450
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,300
Could it be from your brain?

451
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,900
It's all right.

452
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,060
Don't pretend to be tough.

453
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,780
If not, I'll call your family.

454
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,180
I have no family.

455
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,300
You're an orphan?

456
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,380
Knowing too much isn't good for you.

457
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,100
What's that?

458
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,180
I told you.

459
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,740
Knowing too much isn't good for you.

460
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,380
You're a bandit?

461
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,100
Do I look like a bandit?

462
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,420
I'm a killer.

463
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,940
Isn't a killer just a bandit?

464
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,900
Let me give you some advice.

465
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,180
Mind your own business,

466
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,380
and you'll be safe.

467
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,140
An educated killer.

468
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,140
Farewell.

469
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,740
This killer is quite cute

470
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,700
but a bit clumsy.

471
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,540
Fifty taels.

472
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,220
Sixi,

473
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,300
now, we can only rely

474
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,700
on the officials to reopen the inn.

475
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,580
This is even a bargain from a friend.

476
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,100
Your friend...

477
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,340
Fifty taels is too expensive.

478
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,620
What isn't expensive nowadays?

479
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,260
The beans are cheap. Do you want some?

480
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,220
No.

481
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,280
I'm afraid they're spoiled.

482
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,100
Didn't you say

483
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,380
that Magistrate Meng
likes gold bars and...

484
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,980
- Ancient paintings.
- Yes.

485
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,940
What kind of paintings?

486
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,980
I heard he collects

487
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,580
paintings by Wu Daozi.

488
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,020
Where is Taoist Wu now?

489
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,540
Show some respect.

490
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,220
He's the painter Wu Daozi.

491
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,700
Yes, the painter.

492
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,380
I know him.

493
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,580
Kid.

494
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,260
Do you want some beans?

495
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,140
What's wrong with you?

496
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,780
What a naughty kid.

497
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,180
Last time he splashed me,
and now he scolded me?

498
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,220
I...

499
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,820
Speaking of Wu Daozi,

500
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,940
I have a friend

501
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,660
who paints in his style.

502
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,620
Sir, look.

503
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,740
You painted me so ugly.

504
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,940
You should compensate me.

505
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,380
Ugly?

506
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,700
I think it's fine.

507
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,340
Right?

508
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,180
You painted me so handsome.

509
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,420
Not realistic.

510
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
You should compensate me.

511
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,820
Yes, does my buddy look like this?

512
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,780
No.

513
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,660
I beautified you on purpose.

514
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,940
You made me realize

515
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,660
I'm not that handsome,

516
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,580
causing serious harm to my spirit.

517
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,860
- Pay up.
- Pay up.

518
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,500
- Are you crazy?
- He's scolding you.

519
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,520
You painted me like this

520
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,540
and scolded me?

521
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,460
- Pay up.
- Pay up.

522
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,020
- You must pay.
- I won't.

523
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,980
What are you looking at?

524
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,020
You lousy painter.

525
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,300
Come at me.

526
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,460
Lousy painter.

527
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,500
You know him?

528
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,940
Guiwei, on guard.

529
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
What are you doing?

530
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,160
Saving Taoist Wu.

531
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,140
- Are you crazy?
- Go.

532
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,100
You must pay me.

533
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,180
You even took my things.

534
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,500
- Pay up.
- You must pay me.

535
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,540
What are you doing?

536
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,260
He's under my protection.

537
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,820
Your protection?

538
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,860
Bro!

539
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,380
I...

540
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,580
You can paint?

541
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,060
Yes, a little.

542
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,580
Slow down.

543
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,580
Don't break it.

544
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,220
Where should I put this box?

545
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,980
At the door. It'll be fine there.

546
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,940
Okay, come on.

547
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,900
Done.

548
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,540
Well.

549
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,060
Thank you both for helping today.

550
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,060
Then...

551
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,860
Take some food.

552
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,380
That's great.

553
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,620
Great.

554
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,020
Guiwei, hurry, sit here.

555
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,190
- It's fine.
- Yes.

556
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,060
It's okay.

557
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,900
Come here.

558
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,860
No manners.

559
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,140
All right.

560
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,460
Don't let him fool you.

561
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,740
He looks like a painter,

562
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,860
- but he's actually a killer.
- This...

563
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,620
It's fine. He's my cousin.

564
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,600
How many people have you killed?

565
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,980
None yet.

566
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,380
Then you're not a killer.

567
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,940
I only have one target,

568
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,740
and she is certain to die.

569
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,100
See? How confident.

570
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,460
By the way,

571
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,780
I noticed some bowls at the door.

572
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,700
Is there a rule

573
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,700
in your line of work?

574
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,230
Not really.

575
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,740
Some nearby cats and dogs

576
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,700
sometimes come here

577
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,940
when they have nothing to eat.

578
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,420
See? How caring.

579
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,740
A caring killer.

580
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,820
I can't stand the strong
getting their way

581
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,820
and the weak suffering.

582
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,020
Guiwei, you should learn.

583
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,060
A killer must be like this,

584
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,060
disdaining everyone.

585
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,060
Of course.

586
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,420
Do you live with your wife?

587
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,860
I haven't married yet.

588
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,140
Not married?

589
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,700
Then why the embroidered pillow?

590
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,100
Someone once called me

591
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,580
an embroidered pillow (useless man),

592
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,100
so I bought one

593
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,420
to remind myself.

594
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,820
He's taking it seriously.

595
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,860
Is your target the one

596
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,500
who said that?

597
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,740
Exactly.

598
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,840
But I'm not killing her for that reason.

599
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,940
I'm not that childish.

600
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,300
See? How mature.

601
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,780
A mature and caring killer.

602
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,580
Shall I make you a cup of tea?

603
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,580
Sure.

604
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,580
Oh, I just remembered.

605
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,680
I ran out of that tea today.

606
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,900
Too bad.

607
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,860
Yes.

608
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,060
I understand.

609
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,100
He doesn't want us

610
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,580
to stay.

611
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,980
No, no. Well.

612
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,940
Then I'll be brief.

613
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,860
I've saved you twice.

614
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,900
Can you do me a favor?

615
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,540
Twice?

616
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,500
That's a bit ungrateful.

617
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,740
An ungrateful killer.

618
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,380
Go ahead.

619
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,440
Tell me what favor it is.

620
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,620
You know Taoist Wu, right?

621
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
No.

622
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,660
He doesn't know the painter Taoist Wu.

623
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,620
Wu Daozi.

624
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,900
You've heard of Wu Daozi, right?

625
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,620
A little.

626
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,180
What about him?

627
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,620
I want you

628
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,700
to paint me a painting

629
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,740
in Wu Daozi's style.

630
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,180
Wu Daozi's style is vigorous

631
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,140
and majestic in spirit.

632
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,740
I'm not capable of that.

633
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,780
I'm not demanding.

634
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,340
Just make it exactly the same.

635
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,020
You're being demanding.

636
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,580
What do you want?

637
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,260
Selling fake paintings?

638
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,220
I have a friend.

639
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,420
A dying friend.

640
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,980
Who?

641
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,180
Wang.

642
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,340
I want to fulfill

643
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,420
his last wish.

644
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,740
He wants to see a painting

645
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,140
of Wu Daozi before he dies.

646
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,020
Whether it's true doesn't matter.

647
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,820
Can you do it, gentleman?

648
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,220
I know

649
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,260
you won't refuse

650
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,500
a plea from a weak person.

651
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,620
Wait, what did you just say?

652
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,740
A plea from a weak person?

653
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,740
No, no.

654
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,620
The previous line.

655
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,900
I have a dying friend.

656
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,220
The next line.

657
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,860
Gentleman?

658
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,900
Gentleman.

659
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,820
Let me think.

660
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,740
Please, gentleman.

661
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,700
All right.

662
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,980
Isn't he a killer?

663
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,020
Shut up.

664
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,060
This tea may be ornate,

665
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,940
but it lacks elegance.

666
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,300
These candied tangerines are fragrant

667
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,300
but still low-grade.

668
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,660
This plum blossom is not ordinary,

669
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,300
lingering in charm.

670
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,420
Truly worthy of Taiping County's fame

671
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,380
as a center for tribute tea.

672
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,340
I don't know about these things.

673
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,500
I only know

674
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,420
how to serve you, milord.

675
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,620
You...

676
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,660
What do you want?

677
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,900
Lady, a lord seeks audience.

678
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,500
He's here for you.

679
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,580
A lord seeks...

680
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,020
What?

681
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,580
Milord, a lady seeks your audience.

682
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,140
A lady?

683
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,220
A lady?

684
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,900
What did you just say

685
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,460
about your gift?

686
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,820
It's the Roaring River and Sea

687
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,860
by Wu Daozi.

688
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,340
Wu Daozi?

689
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,220
You even know Wu Daozi?

690
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,940
Wu Daozi,

691
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,140
also known as Daoxuan,

692
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,980
liked Lady Gongsun's dance.

693
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,980
Not bad.

694
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,620
Milord, milord.

695
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,700
Milord, bad news.

696
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,980
Xia.

697
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,500
Oh, you're busy.

698
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,860
How could you tell? I'm not busy at all.

699
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,900
What is it?

700
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,140
I...

701
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,740
Got it.

702
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,700
Milord, bad news.

703
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,180
It's said Prefect Song

704
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,340
will soon inspect

705
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,180
our county.

706
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
Inspect?

707
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,860
Inspect our tea

708
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,700
or our work?

709
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,260
Our work.

710
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,300
What?

711
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,700
Why? He...

712
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,660
Milord, don't worry.

713
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,540
The Prefect's coming

714
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,780
this time is because there are

715
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,940
too many unmarried women

716
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,620
in our county.

717
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,600
Why such a small matter

718
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,980
hasn't been resolved?

719
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,140
Wait, didn't I already ask you

720
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,100
to handle this?

721
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,100
Milord, I've thought of it.

722
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,420
We should arrest a few typical ones.

723
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,900
Like those who always say

724
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,420
"Marriage is a losing trade"

725
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,980
and "We must love ourselves".

726
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,060
If we arrest them,

727
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,340
others won't dare act recklessly.

728
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,100
It's time

729
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,860
to discipline these women.

730
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,260
Listen.

731
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,220
Announce my order.

732
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,940
All eligible women in the county

733
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,780
who remain unmarried

734
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,140
shall be exiled to Shamen Island.

735
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,540
Milord,

736
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,380
isn't that a bit harsh?

737
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,380
What's the difference

738
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,540
from sentencing them to death?

739
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,940
Can't you see it?

740
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,500
I want to make their life

741
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,020
worse than death.

742
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,340
Understood.

743
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,140
Where is she?

744
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,700
The painting...

745
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,700
It's here.

746
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
Here, here.

747
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,500
Bring out Wu Daozi's painting.

748
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,780
Come on.

749
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,980
I went

750
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,580
through immense effort
for this painting.

751
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,540
Is that so?

752
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,860
But milord,

753
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,860
my inn...

754
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,180
The one you called a gambling den...

755
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,620
What gambling den?

756
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,380
That's just an inn.

757
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,700
If a guest makes a minor mistake,

758
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,180
what does it have to do with your inn?

759
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,220
How wise of you.

760
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,620
Who painted this again?

761
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,820
Wu Daozi.

762
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,500
(Qin Kan)
Who is Qin Kan then?

763
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,620
Milord, milord.

764
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,460
What lord?

765
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,460
Don't touch me.

766
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,820
Milord.

767
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,300
Please calm down. You're walking out.

768
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,260
Up, up.

769
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,940
Why touch me?

770
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,340
- Milord.
- Shameless.

771
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,780
You outlaw.

772
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,520
Not only organized gambling,

773
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,140
but also deceived me.

774
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,260
I don't think you want

775
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
that gambling den.

776
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
Confiscate it.

777
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,980
- Milord, calm down.
- Don't touch me.

778
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,020
Milord!

779
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,620
Xia, Xia.

780
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,300
Milord.

781
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,140
Your Yueji Inn

782
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,980
has been shut down.

783
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,900
Yes.

784
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,900
And Magistrate Meng knew about it.

785
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,380
Honestly,

786
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,140
only I can fix this.

787
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,220
Yes, yes.

788
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,860
Only you can fix this.

789
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,100
You're the best.

790
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,220
You are Magistrate Meng's advisor.

791
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,020
Listen.

792
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,180
Who is it?

793
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,820
Who's outside?

794
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,060
Nonsense.

795
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,540
Miss Hu from Xiange Studio

796
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,700
is singing a tune.

797
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,220
Did you hear?

798
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,860
Miss Hu charges two taels

799
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,580
for singing all night.

800
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,580
All right, Xia.

801
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,060
As long as you help me

802
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,420
reopen my inn,

803
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,620
I'll invite you

804
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,980
to hear Miss Hu sing that night.

805
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,220
But

806
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,060
I want to listen for a year.

807
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,060
A year?

808
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,060
I'd love to keep you company,

809
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,620
but sometimes I'm too busy.

810
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,180
Teasing me? Farewell.

811
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,540
No, no, Xia.

812
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,620
Let's discuss it.

813
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,700
Come on.

814
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,540
Don't think about it.

815
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,620
Why not do something else?

816
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,300
Hey, what can I do?

817
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,420
I only have that inn.

818
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,000
You don't have money. Who can help you?

819
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,260
Xia, my good brother.

820
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,460
It's hard

821
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,500
for a girl to run an inn.

822
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Let go.

823
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,700
Let go!

824
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,260
Fine.

825
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,060
Do I have to make it so clear?

826
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,980
One hundred taels of silver,

827
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,260
and I'll help you settle this

828
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,620
and ensure

829
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,980
your safety afterward.

830
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,140
One hundred taels?

831
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,580
Xia,

832
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,620
you're pushing me into a dead end.

833
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,300
You know I'm being wronged.

834
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,900
Farewell.

835
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,300
Xia! Xia!

836
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,340
Xia.

837
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,700
- Ten taels.
- Move.

838
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,660
Xia,

839
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,700
must you be so heartless?

840
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,740
Move!

841
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,860
You...

842
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,820
Sorry.

843
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,620
Sorry? What's the use of that?

844
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,300
This isn't over.

845
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,940
Help!

846
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,980
Assault!

847
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,180
Fifty taels in silver.

848
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,180
Also, reopen my shop.

849
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,180
What are you thinking?

850
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,340
Fine.

851
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,580
Help!

852
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,420
Acting like a lunatic.

853
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,540
Xia, Xia!

854
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,020
Xia, Xia!

855
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,700
Please, help me.

856
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,180
Xia, Xia!

857
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,220
Please!

858
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,480
I'm officially warning you.

859
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,220
Stop pestering me.

860
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,580
I'm really annoyed.

861
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,540
Understand?

862
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,380
Advisor Xia,

863
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,140
as a respected official,

864
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,740
how can you refuse to help me

865
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,820
and treat me this way?

866
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,620
Smearing me, huh?

867
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,420
How shameless.

868
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,620
I can do that, too.

869
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,100
Assault!

870
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,820
Assault!

871
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,220
Listen.

872
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,220
In Taiping County,

873
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,860
I act fearlessly with integrity.

874
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,940
Come on.

875
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,780
What's wrong with you?

876
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,140
I'm fine.

877
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,140
Are you all right?

878
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,380
What's wrong?

879
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,500
We don't start trouble,
and we won't fear it.

880
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,200
Someone tried to assault her.

881
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,700
It's Advisor Xia.

882
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,420
Look what you've done.

883
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,580
Catch that culprit!

884
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,700
No.

885
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,380
- Advisor Xia?
- In fact, it was me...

886
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,780
Culprit, stop!

887
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,980
Stop!

888
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,460
I hit him.

889
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,980
(Taiping Government)

890
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,740
(Justice and Order)

891
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,820
What's your name?

892
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,900
Huo Lao'er.

893
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,460
What?

894
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,020
Aren't you Ai Sixi?

895
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,060
"Ai Sixi loves herself."

896
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,020
Isn't that you?

897
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,460
Yes.

898
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,820
Milord, you know my name, so why ask?

899
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,900
How humorous.

900
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,900
Impudent.

901
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,620
Gambling,

902
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,740
assault,

903
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,740
and corrupting minds.

904
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,020
Today, I will definitely

905
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,220
punish you severely.

906
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,180
Milord,

907
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,220
my inn has been confiscated.

908
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,660
I've handed over all the money.

909
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,140
What more do you want?

910
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,180
But you injured innocent citizens.

911
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,180
What to do about that?

912
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,340
Who?

913
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,300
He.

914
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,980
I didn't hit him.

915
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,300
You didn't?

916
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,780
Give her a harsh punishment!

917
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,260
Fine, fine.

918
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,300
I'm willing to pay two taels

919
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,740
to compensate this innocent citizen.

920
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,980
How much?

921
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,820
Two taels.

922
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,780
Listen.

923
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,860
You have to pay 200 taels.

924
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,900
Two hundred taels?

925
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,300
Yesterday, Advisor Xia

926
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,620
demanded 100 taels from me.

927
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,180
- I...
- She paid you?

928
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,820
I was testing her.

929
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,180
You're being talkative.

930
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,780
Just do as the Magistrate says.

931
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,620
Milord, the thing is,

932
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,180
I don't have that much money.

933
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,180
That's your problem,

934
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,220
not mine.

935
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,780
Anything more to say?

936
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,100
Nothing? Then I will judge.

937
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,100
Considering your false speech,

938
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,540
twisting the truth,

939
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,580
and corrupting morals,

940
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,100
I hereby sentence you

941
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,340
to be exiled to Shamen Island.

942
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,100
Milord.

943
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,580
Then I shall grant you a marriage.

944
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,820
Milord, this is ingenious.

945
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,220
One, it punishes this woman,

946
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,380
setting an example.

947
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,540
Two,

948
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,500
Prefect Song will be pleased.

949
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,860
Two birds, one stone. Brilliant.

950
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,300
I won't marry.

951
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,560
If not,

952
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,940
you'll be exiled to Shamen Island.

953
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,500
The key is, who can I marry?

954
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,700
Who can you marry?

955
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,380
Who knows?

956
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,900
You must marry by tomorrow.

957
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,780
Court dismissed.

958
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,780
Order!

959
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,140
Milord, you're wise.

960
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,140
Milord, can I choose?

961
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,340
I...I...

962
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,700
I already have someone in mind.

963
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,740
I can't marry blindly.

964
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,140
After so many years here,

965
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,700
I finally got lucky.

966
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,540
One more word,
and I'll pull out your tongue.

967
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,500
I dare you.

968
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,580
What a temper.

969
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,180
What a personality.

970
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,620
I really like it.

971
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,540
I can't take it anymore.

972
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,560
Another word?

973
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,380
Another word?

974
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,220
- Stop hitting me!
- Another word?

975
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,180
I...

976
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,500
Miss.

977
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,100
Gentleman,

978
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,940
you're here.

979
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,380
Are you all right?

980
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,900
I'm fine. I'm fine.

981
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,180
I made a mistake earlier.

982
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,220
Sorry about that.

983
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,460
It's okay.

984
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,920
It's not your fault. It's mine.

985
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,060
Evil meets its retribution.

986
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,100
You can't say it that way.

987
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,400
It's been tough for you, too.

988
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,580
But in the future, if anything happens,

989
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,460
you can report it

990
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,060
and let the officials solve it for you.

991
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,140
Right, right.

992
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,100
Exactly.

993
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,620
If you hadn't written Qin Kan

994
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,740
on the painting,

995
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,620
Magistrate Meng would've helped me.

996
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,220
Let's not mention that anymore.

997
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,180
Water under the bridge.

998
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,420
I asked for you today

999
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,820
because I need a favor.

1000
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,380
Please find my cousin.

1001
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,560
Ask him to bring all the money

1002
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,520
from home.

1003
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,900
Then just tell him directly.

1004
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,300
There's a second favor.

1005
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,700
Tell me.

1006
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,940
Are you free tomorrow,

1007
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,580
gentleman?

1008
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,020
I...I...

1009
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,660
What do you need?

1010
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,300
Marry me.

1011
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,770
What?

1012
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,860
Marry me.

1013
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,830
Marry you?
