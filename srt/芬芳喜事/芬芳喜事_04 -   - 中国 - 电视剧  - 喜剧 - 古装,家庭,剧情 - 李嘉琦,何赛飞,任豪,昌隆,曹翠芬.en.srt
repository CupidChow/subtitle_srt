I think Grandmother is hinting

27
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,380
Jing Kan is most likely

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,560
to be the chief manager.

29
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,720
A vote is necessary, I think.

30
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,660
Before,

31
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,660
in case of something big,

32
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,480
Father usually had us vote.

33
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,710
Vote for me, then.

34
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,870
Focus on your food.

35
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,920
Why?

36
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,980
Fine. You're hungry, anyway.

37
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,920
Donglin, go on.

38
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,640
If we have to vote,

39
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,610
it's usually equal and fair.

40
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,550
Grandmother has one.

41
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,730
Ms. Luo has one.

42
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,670
You have one, Mother.

43
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,720
And we have one.

44
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,540
Now, Jing Kan is back.

45
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,450
Five votes in total.

46
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,430
So, we have two votes.

47
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,950
I think I'll be the chief manager.

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,450
- Yes, yes.
- Don't be silly.

49
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,540
Mother will surely

50
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,890
vote for Jing Kan.

51
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,260
Luo Zhusi will vote for herself.

52
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,290
And Jing Kan...

53
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,270
He won't vote for her.

54
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,480
What do you mean?

55
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,710
Vote for another guy?

56
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,510
No, no, no.

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,440
Mother,

58
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,270
Jing Kan will have two votes.

59
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,130
So, our votes will be crucial.

60
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,170
Who will we vote for?

61
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,570
I think it's quite risky

62
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,670
to take Jing Kan's side.

63
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,660
After all, Jinyu Tea

64
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,080
will fall into Ms. Luo's hands.

65
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,200
Now, Jing Kan has Grandmother's support.

66
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,220
But he knows nothing about business.

67
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,290
So, I think we should

68
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,260
vote for Ms. Luo.

69
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,010
You're such a fence-sitter.

70
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,100
You changed so quickly.

71
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,170
Vote for her? Why?

72
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,290
My husband is the eldest son

73
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,290
while hers is the second.

74
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,170
You know what?

75
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,450
One nation can't have two queens.

76
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,500
Yes, I know.

77
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,540
I won't vote for her.

78
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,450
I've thought about it.

79
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,780
I'm Jing Kan's auntie.

80
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,980
Whatever happens, he won't hurt me.

81
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,220
It makes sense.

82
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,260
But you know

83
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,130
about Ms. Luo. She's ruthless

84
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,040
and revengeful.

85
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,060
Compared to her,
Jing Kan is a green hand.

86
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,930
If we take a side,

87
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,690
we should pick a more powerful one.

88
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,040
Come on. Take a side?

89
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,410
We did that before.

90
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,850
But how did Luo Zhusi treat us?

91
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,790
Don't you remember?

92
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,320
How many times do I have to say this?

93
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,270
Vote for me.

94
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,790
I'm Jing Kan's only cousin.

95
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,290
Maybe two votes for Jing Kan

96
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,220
and two for me.

97
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,100
Many clan relatives will be there.

98
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,270
They can judge.

99
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,940
Everybody knows

100
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,110
what kind of person I am.

101
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,350
Mother,

102
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,170
when I'm the chief manager,

103
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,320
even before you request,

104
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,820
I will give you

105
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,830
a shop immediately.

106
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,940
In that shop,

107
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,510
you can embezzle any money you want.

108
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,010
A chief manager like you

109
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,890
will give me one shop

110
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,880
out of twelve.

111
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,850
Come on.

112
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,150
What a daughter you are.

113
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't vote, then.

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,060
No shops will be yours.

115
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,570
Stop this, for God's sake.

116
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,780
- She's kidding.
- Listen.

117
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,010
At this moment,

118
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,940
I have to

119
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,290
give Luo Zhusi a lesson,

120
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,450
or she'll take us for pushovers.

121
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,610
Mother, look before you leap.

122
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,660
I won't.

123
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,690
I've made up my mind.

124
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,880
This is what I'm going to do.

125
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,480
If you ask me,

126
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,120
you two are green hands.

127
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,880
Two chicks

128
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,580
keep thinking

129
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,150
about how to swallow that weasel.

130
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,800
Are you capable enough?

131
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,460
Anyway,

132
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,240
I'll vote for myself.

133
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,700
And I don't care

134
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,700
if you'll vote for me.

135
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,640
I should go.

136
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh my goodness.

137
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,870
Donglin,

138
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,540
next time we talk seriously,

139
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,470
let's get rid of her.

140
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,750
In your dreams!

141
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,760
What a rude woman.

142
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,000
The two of them are really unreliable.

143
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,390
I should explain to Ms. Luo

144
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,170
in case we have

145
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,470
no breathing room.

146
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,350
Is Auntie in there?

147
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,980
Yes.

148
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,920
All right.

149
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,910
We're sisters-in-law.

150
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,190
Zhusi,

151
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,760
let me be honest.

152
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,440
I strongly support you.

153
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,100
At the clan meeting,

154
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,470
we will give you

155
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,470
two votes.

156
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,760
Mother is finally getting wise.

157
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,920
Muyun,

158
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,560
the clan meeting

159
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,320
is a big event.

160
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,340
Whoever you vote for,

161
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,980
I won't have a problem.

162
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,900
Oh, come on.

163
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,590
Speaking of the meeting,

164
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,910
I think it's unfair to you.

165
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,050
What is Mother's plan?

166
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,810
Isn't that as obvious

167
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,780
as it seems?

168
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,250
She wants all of us

169
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,700
to support Jing Kan.

170
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,700
Muyun,

171
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,850
she's our mother-in-law.

172
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,220
We'd better not surmise
what she is thinking.

173
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,080
Come on.

174
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,020
Don't talk like an outsider.

175
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,880
All these years,

176
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,080
you've been surmising a lot.

177
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,160
Right?

178
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,370
Today, I'm really talking

179
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,350
from the bottom of my heart.

180
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,580
You don't do this

181
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,930
just to remind me,

182
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,150
do you?

183
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,370
Smart woman, indeed.

184
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,320
I like to talk with smart guys.

185
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,600
Look at this.

186
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,440
On this piece of paper

187
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,760
are some capable guys.

188
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,410
As the new chief manager,

189
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,680
you'll need helpers.

190
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,200
By then,

191
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,950
(Cheng Yunfei)
you can hire them.

192
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,580
First, we don't know

193
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,590
if I can be the chief.

194
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,150
Anyway, what you're doing

195
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,120
is really inappropriate.

196
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,030
It's against our family rules.

197
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,200
What are you talking about?

198
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,710
Against our family rules.

199
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,390
Come on, you...

200
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,440
Don't be ridiculous.

201
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,020
I remember in Jinyu Tea,

202
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,240
eight staff members out of ten

203
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,950
work for you, right?

204
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,830
You've never thought

205
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,270
it's against our family rules.

206
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,080
Anyway,

207
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,140
you want to plant your guys

208
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,900
in our shops.

209
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,900
If I'm not the chief manager,

210
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,440
I'll have no problem with that.

211
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,390
But if I'm still in charge of Jinyu Tea,

212
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,760
I will never

213
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,910
set a precedent like that.

214
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,250
Usually,

215
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,850
Donglin and Zhenzhu gave me some advice.

216
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,370
Do you know what they said?

217
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,350
They asked me

218
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,950
to be formidable on behalf of my family.

219
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,270
But I'm softhearted.

220
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,900
You know that, huh?

221
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,930
Oh, Mother.

222
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,850
- I overrated her.
- Today,

223
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,470
I just asked for a small favor.

224
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,520
But you said

225
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,220
it was against our family rules.

226
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,320
You're being harsh on me, huh?

227
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,540
All right.

228
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,930
Luo Zhusi, don't forget.

229
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,930
Jing Kan's wife is pregnant now.

230
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,540
They're the legitimate heir

231
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,340
of Jinyu Tea.

232
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,080
I can vote for you.

233
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,590
Or I can vote for Jing Kan.

234
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,760
Like I said,

235
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,680
the clan meeting is a big event.

236
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,640
Whoever you vote for,

237
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,350
I won't have a problem.

238
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,510
All right, then.

239
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,710
Whatever it is

240
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,160
and whatever you do.

241
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,250
Under such circumstances,

242
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,320
I won't force you.

243
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,540
I wish you

244
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,390
all the best.

245
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,270
Forget the list, then.

246
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,640
See you. Bye.

247
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,240
Are you blind?

248
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,470
Such birds of a feather.

249
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,560
What's wrong with her again?

250
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,350
Wants to get her hands on Jinyu Tea?

251
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,990
In her dreams.

252
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,130
You should stop being so elegant.

253
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,030
Scold her if necessary.

254
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,890
Don't lecture me

255
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,420
as if you had too much free time.

256
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,770
Fine. Show me what you can do.

257
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,850
You can be the chief manager

258
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,850
and I'll be a maid.

259
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,110
That's not what I mean.

260
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,730
I mean, at the meeting
the day after tomorrow,

261
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,010
Jing Kan is very likely to be

262
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,300
the chief manager of Jinyu Tea.

263
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,230
Shouldn't we be prepared?

264
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,200
Since Mother wants a desperate fight,

265
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,040
very well...

266
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,350
I'll let it be.

267
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,200
Make an appointment with someone.

268
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,640
Yes.

269
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,160
So, who will you meet?

270
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,400
That man.

271
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,750
Which man?

272
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,420
Come on, Madam.

273
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,520
Only you and I are here.

274
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,100
Don't keep me guessing.

275
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,870
Sixth Uncle!

276
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,130
Grandmother, what is your plan

277
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,320
about the chief manager?

278
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,470
Give me a certain answer.

279
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,230
How about you vote for me?

280
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,770
I promise you won't lose

281
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,710
or fall for anything.

282
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,400
Who mentioned this vote thing?

283
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,040
No vote?

284
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,460
In this case,

285
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,530
you should have told us.

286
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,750
We guessed really a lot.

287
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:04,830
You?

288
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,680
Who specifically?

289
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,880
No one.

290
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,530
Grandmother,

291
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,680
who will you make

292
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,350
the chief manager?

293
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,820
Your grandfather has a will.

294
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,280
How could he have one?

295
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,440
And who told you this?

296
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,830
That's what they all say.

297
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,950
Then, in his will,

298
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,990
who will take charge of Jinyu Tea?

299
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,990
Now, our family

300
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,490
is facing

301
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,950
grave difficulties.

302
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,530
Everyone thinks the chief manager

303
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,160
can be a great position.

304
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,430
Come on.

305
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,440
Tell me about it.

306
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,400
If you're the chief manager,

307
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,950
what will you do?

308
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,710
Grandmother,

309
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,400
you're talking to the right guy.

310
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,990
I've thought about it.

311
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,990
Our shops

312
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,160
can't just sell tea.

313
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,240
What else shall we sell?

314
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,370
Wine.

315
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,250
Wine?

316
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,650
Yeah. Think about it.

317
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,750
Now, people

318
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,430
live a hard life

319
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:15,830
and they're depressed.

320
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,160
But you sell tea to them.

321
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,920
Tea will make them clearer-headed.

322
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,400
But wine is different.

323
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,230
It can drown their sorrows.

324
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,080
They'll only get more excited.

325
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,370
And we can

326
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,320
water down the wine.

327
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,530
If it fails,

328
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,470
we can make vinegar.

329
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,590
Anything else?

330
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,850
What's more,

331
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,990
I want to open an arena.

332
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,890
For cockfighting, dog fighting,

333
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,830
and cricket fighting.

334
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,670
It'll lead to addiction.

335
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,920
Customers

336
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,680
will come after their first visit.

337
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,990
Later, they'll keep coming.

338
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,800
Then, I'll run a pawnshop.

339
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,060
The wine, tea, or vinegar

340
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,990
that we fail to sell

341
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,160
will be pawned

342
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,350
for a huge profit.

343
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,640
What do you think?

344
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,080
You're a business genius.

345
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,160
I am, right?

346
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,560
I can't agree more.

347
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,950
Why does the tea taste the same?

348
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,560
- What taste?
- A bitter taste.

349
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,360
Taste it.

350
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,990
Tea leaves in Jinyu Tea

351
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,870
are indeed much worse than before.

352
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,870
The fragrance is shallow.

353
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,470
The aftertaste is poor.

354
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,320
The sensation is narrow.

355
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,440
And the water doesn't feel right.

356
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,130
What?

357
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,470
What aftertaste? What sensation?

358
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,670
Shallow fragrance.

359
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,200
It means the tea

360
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,490
smells good,

361
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,630
but doesn't taste good.

362
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,940
Poor aftertaste.

363
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,220
It means the tea

364
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,750
doesn't taste sweet in the end.

365
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,460
The sensation means

366
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,400
how it feels

367
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,230
when the tea gets through the throat.

368
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,710
Thin water

369
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,800
means the tea is smooth

370
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,950
and easy to swallow.

371
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,470
Wide water means

372
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,040
when the tea gets into your throat,

373
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,110
it will feel astringent

374
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,800
and make people sick.

375
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,550
Done talking?

376
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,160
I didn't know any of this before.

377
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,870
Let's get down to business.

378
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,590
Here.

379
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,640
Please review it.

380
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,550
What is this?

381
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,700
Well, I know very few words

382
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,540
and I write poorly.

383
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,580
So, I painted something.

384
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,230
But you'll understand the general idea.

385
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,040
Since I promised to help you,

386
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,990
we should keep careful accounts.

387
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,160
I won't help you for free.

388
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,520
Come on. Let me explain.

389
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,320
Five qian for talking with Grandmother.

390
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,490
One tael for talking with Luo Zhusi.

391
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,430
Wait, wait.

392
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,770
It's the talking thing.

393
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,920
Why are the prices different?

394
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,830
Are you willing to talk with Luo Zhusi?

395
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,240
Go on.

396
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,680
One qian for making the bed.

397
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,800
Five qian for comforting you.

398
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,630
Four qian for fighting for you.

399
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,010
But rest assured.

400
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,040
I'll always win.

401
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,040
Two qian for calling you honey.

402
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,280
Honey, huh?

403
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,750
Two qian for eating with you.

404
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,350
One qian for sweeping.

405
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,370
Why are you so greedy for money?

406
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,440
You should be thanking me for that.

407
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,200
Or who would offer to help you?

408
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,920
If you hate it, I can go.

409
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,440
Suppose I accept these conditions,

410
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,160
what about the baby thing?

411
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,200
Don't worry about that.

412
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,470
I know what to do.

413
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,980
But just so you know,

414
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,560
there's another price for a baby.

415
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,530
Is it possible

416
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,680
that you're already pregnant?

417
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,230
I'll beat you.

418
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,040
If you can help me with revenge,

419
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,080
money won't be a problem.

420
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,670
It's a deal, then.

421
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,550
There you go.

422
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,320
I don't need to do this.

423
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,750
I'm a man of my word.

424
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,920
Bite your finger.

425
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,430
My fingers are dirty.

426
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,070
I've prepared something.

427
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,160
You should have taken it out earlier.

428
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,340
I'll keep this then.

429
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,980
Keep the prices in mind.

430
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,950
Of course, you can ask me if you forget.

431
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,790
As long as you can do
what you've listed,

432
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,880
I will give you

433
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,950
as much as I've promised.

434
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,730
I used to think marriage would be bad.

435
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,770
But now, I think

436
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,750
it's a good job for me.

437
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,920
I can't agree more.

438
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,770
On the surface,

439
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,160
we're a couple.

440
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,340
But actually, I'm the boss

441
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,890
while you're my assistant.

442
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,990
Are you clear about that?

443
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,730
- Yes.
- Glad to hear that.

444
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,990
Boss, your assistant is thirsty.

445
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,560
Can you get me a cup of water?

446
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,280
How could you order me around?

447
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,400
Boss,

448
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,560
your assistant is pregnant.

449
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,920
If people know I'm faking it,

450
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,110
your future will be affected.

451
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,950
Indeed, we should be cautious.

452
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,710
Here, assistant.

453
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,550
Have some tea.

454
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,950
Thank you.

455
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,650
It's bitter. I want no more.

456
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,590
Fine.

457
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,630
Nice bed, indeed.

458
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,060
(Jinyu Tea)

459
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
Sixth Uncle,

460
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,560
you've been witnessing

461
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,750
the development of our shops.

462
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,800
Now, we need

463
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,460
a new chief manager.

464
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,700
(Sixth Uncle, Clan relative)
Yes.

465
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,990
And I heard Jing Kan was back.

466
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,060
Ms. Luo,

467
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,100
I'm not an outsider.

468
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,780
You can be honest.

469
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,860
Sixth Uncle,

470
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,820
here's my plan.

471
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,300
If Mother

472
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,500
insists on making Jing Kan

473
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,820
the chief manager,

474
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,740
then I will...

475
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,140
I will open my own shop.

476
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,180
Are you saying

477
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,540
you want a separation?

478
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,180
I know.

479
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,700
My plan

480
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,780
will hurt Beishui

481
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,700
and my father-in-law.

482
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,260
It will hurt

483
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,380
all our ancestors, too.

484
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,580
But Sixth Uncle,

485
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,620
Jinyu Tea

486
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,540
is actually some rubbish

487
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,620
coated in gold and jade.

488
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,580
If Jing Kan takes charge

489
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
of this kind of business,

490
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,460
then,

491
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,900
our family will collapse

492
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,020
right in front of our eyes.

493
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,380
Things are hard for you, indeed.

494
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,380
In my opinion,

495
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,380
you deserve to be the chief

496
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,060
of Jinyu Tea.

497
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,540
How about this?

498
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,460
Since you begged me for help,

499
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,500
I'll introduce someone to you.

500
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,580
Wait.

501
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,060
Sixth Uncle,

502
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,900
this is our family stuff.

503
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,420
Is it appropriate

504
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,780
to get an outsider in?

505
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,180
No, he isn't an outsider.

506
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,940
Isn't an outsider?

507
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,860
- Chief Tan.
- You know?

508
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,380
Come on in here.

509
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,740
(Tan Long, Chief manager
of Laolongtan Tea)

510
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,260
Most of our clan relatives

511
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,980
hold shares in Laolongtan Tea.

512
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,340
With one word from Chief Tan,

513
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,620
we'll support your separation

514
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,740
at the clan meeting.

515
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,500
By then,

516
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,660
even if you start a new business

517
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,460
and open a tea shop,

518
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,700
we won't object.

519
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,980
I believe you want something

520
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,500
from helping me.

521
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,260
Chief Tan wants

522
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,220
the tea pan-firing of Jinyu Tea.

523
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,940
It's so beautiful
around your mother's grave.

524
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,980
After I die,

525
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,140
I wish I could be buried

526
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,060
in such a nice place.

527
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,380
(Tomb of Mother Qin Baoyi)

528
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,220
When my mother was alive,

529
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,260
she loved this place most.

530
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,740
How did Luo Zhusi kill your mother?

531
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,460
My mother killed herself.

532
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,580
But you said Luo Zhusi killed her.

533
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,500
She must have something

534
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,140
to do with my mother's death.

535
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,860
You...

536
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,300
I don't know what to say.

537
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,820
Oh, here.

538
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,540
Where did you get this?

539
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,940
From your grandfather.

540
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,260
Not from his plates.

541
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,190
They bought too much

542
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,030
and leave it in a food box.

543
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,340
So, I brought them here.

544
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,600
I have more.

545
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,140
Here.

546
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,540
Still more?

547
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,620
Here.

548
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,140
A peach.

549
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,940
Some dates.

550
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,300
That's all.

551
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,260
We're a fake couple.

552
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,540
But anyway,

553
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,820
we have the certificate.

554
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,300
Your mother is an elder to me.

555
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,740
I should offer her something.

556
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,620
Mother,

557
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,500
eat as much as you can.

558
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,660
She brought all this to you.

559
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,900
Look. Such beautiful flowers.

560
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,780
That's camellia oleifera.

561
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,100
What kind of camellia is that?

562
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,580
Its fruit

563
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,860
can be used to make oil.

564
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,060
Other camellias can't.

565
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,980
How can you distinguish them?

566
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,100
Look, there's fuzz on its twigs.

567
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,380
Other kinds don't have any.

568
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,340
During the White Dew,

569
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,260
flowers and fruits will both hang there.

570
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,700
"Holding the offspring".

571
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,940
You know really a lot.

572
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,660
Help!

573
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,220
Help!

574
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,780
Is anybody calling for help?

575
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,940
Let's get out of here.

576
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,100
I've heard some bandits

577
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,140
stick around here,

578
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,020
fake cries for help,

579
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,100
rob people,

580
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,020
and even kill them.

581
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,100
Don't be afraid.

582
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,540
I may rob them instead.

583
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,300
Hey, what was your job?

584
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,740
I just try to make you courageous,

585
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,660
gentleman.

586
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,980
Let's go.
What if someone's really in need?

587
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,140
Help!

588
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,020
Help!

589
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,740
Help!

590
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,140
Help!

591
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,900
Is it here?

592
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,500
Sir, are you all right?

593
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,100
Don't ask and pull me up.

594
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,020
- In a minute.
- Wait.

595
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,980
We need a tool.

596
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,460
Hang in there.

597
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,020
Be quick.

598
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,620
This one will work.

599
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,900
Come on.

600
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,260
Grab it.

601
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,540
I...

602
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,740
All right.

603
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,580
Be careful, sir.

604
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,420
Are you all right?

605
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,660
I'm fine. Fine.

606
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,180
Are you all right?

607
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,100
How did you fall down there,

608
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100
sir?

609
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,940
There's a wild tea tree on the cliff.

610
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,860
It's good.

611
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,060
Unexpectedly, I missed a step

612
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,700
and nearly lost my life.

613
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,220
For those lousy tea leaves?

614
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,180
Lousy leaves?

615
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,500
Idiot.

616
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,340
Total idiot.

617
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,860
Lousy leaves?

618
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,540
Ridiculous.

619
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,580
Is he thanking us?

620
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,460
Doesn't sound so.

621
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,490
How ungrateful.

622
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,340
Never mind.

623
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,780
We just helped him for Mother's sake.

624
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,980
Come on.

625
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,180
Let's go.

626
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
My hands are dirty.

627
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,340
(Jinyu Tea)
Madam,

628
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,500
the Jings aren't concerned about you.

629
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,460
Why must you care about them?

630
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,780
Don't be silly.

631
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,900
Think about it.

632
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,340
If I tell him

633
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,260
about tea pan-firing,

634
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,580
Aji will lose

635
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,380
this reliable technique.

636
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,660
That's right.

637
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,660
Parents always care about their kids.

638
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,900
How's everything going in our shops?

639
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,500
Now, Jinyu Tea

640
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
has twelve shops.

641
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,100
Shop assistants and managers

642
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,260
in seven shops claimed

643
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,660
they would leave with you.

644
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,020
However,

645
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,180
the tea plantation belongs to the Jings.

646
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,100
We can't take it away.

647
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,620
If we open a new tea shop,

648
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,700
we'll need another tea plantation.

649
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,340
Go tell those seven managers.

650
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,180
Tomorrow, if Mother

651
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,860
really makes Jing Kan

652
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,020
the chief manager,

653
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,740
I'll open my own shop immediately.

654
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,700
Yes.

655
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,460
(Jing Residence)

656
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,580
Young Master, admit it.

657
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,220
Everybody saw that.

658
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,540
I didn't steal it. I didn't.

659
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,780
I just didn't steal it.

660
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,860
Get me Qingming Stick.

661
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,700
Flog him until he confesses.

662
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,620
Madam,

663
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,580
I know my son

664
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,540
very well.

665
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,260
He wouldn't steal anything.

666
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,180
Are you saying

667
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,660
I'm setting him up?

668
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,860
How about this?

669
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,940
I'll make up for the missing money.

670
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,100
So, you're confessing

671
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,420
that he stole the money.

672
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,180
No.

673
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,700
You like tea making, don't you?

674
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,740
- From this day on,
- Mother!

675
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,780
- you won't live at home.
- Mother!

676
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,700
Move out to the shop.

677
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,860
Jing Kan has to stay, though.

678
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,220
Mother!

679
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,260
Mother!

680
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,780
(Composed in spring, Geng Chen Year)

681
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,700
Madam,

682
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,740
Concubine Qin's body has been burned.

683
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,740
Luo Zhusi, I'm going to kill you!

684
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,780
Stop him! Grab him!

685
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,620
How dare you!

686
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,860
Don't be so rude to your mother!

687
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,780
She isn't my mother!

688
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,980
From this day on,

689
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,540
I'm no longer one of this family.

690
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,100
Never will I

691
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,380
come back here again.

692
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,420
Mother,

693
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,740
at tomorrow's meeting,

694
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,340
I swear I will

695
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,180
expel Luo Zhusi.

696
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,540
(Spring Breeze)

697
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,500
Why hasn't he come yet?

698
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,660
Chickening out again, huh?

699
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,180
Young Madam,

700
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,820
you're pregnant.

701
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,780
The house is bustling with people.

702
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,660
Come in and avoid them.

703
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,380
I got it. I'll do that later.

704
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,460
(Yuming Chamber)

705
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,860
- Mr. Jing.
- Mr. Jing.

706
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,380
What took you so long?

707
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,980
I was too excited last night.

708
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,540
I tried so hard to get up.

709
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,420
Good.

710
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,540
You're overdressed

711
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,460
for today.

712
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,980
Today is my big day.

713
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,580
Do I have to act it out

714
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,660
where you insist on leaving

715
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,760
- while I want to...
- No.

716
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,670
It will degrade me.

717
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,500
The weather is iffy.

718
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,500
(Yuming Chamber)

719
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,460
Overwhelming, indeed.

720
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,140
Be careful.

721
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,500
There you are.

722
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,900
(Mr. Wang, Manager of main store)
If Jing Kan's declared chief,

723
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,350
we'll raise our hands
for immediate objection.

724
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,410
- Got it?
- Yes.

725
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,460
All right. Off you go.

726
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,820
Why hasn't he come yet?

727
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,620
Invite him over again.

728
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,620
Yes.

729
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,580
Be polite.

730
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,820
All right.

731
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,940
(Yuming Chamber)

732
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,860
Here I am.

733
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,420
Stop rushing me.

734
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,860
Mr. An.

735
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,980
Mr. An.

736
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,420
(Mr. An, Clan relative)

737
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,820
Come on.

738
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,180
This way, please.

739
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,620
Take your seat.

740
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,140
Mr. An,

741
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,420
shall we start?

742
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,780
Cousin, please.

743
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,500
Even if we prosper separately,

744
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,140
we actually share the same ancestors.

745
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,660
Entrusted by Wei Junyi,

746
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,940
wife of Jing Dayou,
third son of the sixteenth generation,

747
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,540
we're gathering here

748
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,420
to witness the heir of Jinyu Tea.

749
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,220
Bring the will over here.

750
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,540
(Jinyu Tea, Will)

751
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,300
My late husband Dayou had a will.

752
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,420
Don't stagger when you walk up there.

753
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
I won't.

754
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,740
The Chief Seal of Jinyu Tea
will be given

755
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,220
to Luo Zhusi,

756
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,420
wife of my second son.

757
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,860
It's well deserved.

758
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,980
Well deserved, indeed.

759
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,460
Well deserved.

760
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,380
So it is.

761
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,900
But...

762
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,660
Everybody, please be our witnesses.

763
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,100
Mr. An, cousin,

764
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,420
any objections?

765
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,500
I have no objection.

766
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,580
Let's move on, then.

767
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,540
Please be seated.

768
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,460
Your grandfather

769
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,740
didn't treat you very well.

770
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,860
Luo Zhusi,

771
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,580
will you accept this?

772
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,860
I, Luo Zhusi, am grateful

773
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,220
for the trust of my family and clan.

774
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,700
Ancestors,

775
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,940
I hereby swear

776
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,500
I will manage Jinyu Tea

777
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,700
by working diligently without complaint,

778
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,100
developing thrifty habits,

779
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,940
abiding by the law to restrain myself,

780
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,660
and serving selflessly.

781
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,220
I will prosper our family property.

782
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,900
- Good.
- Nice.

783
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,420
Chief Luo, take your seat, please.

784
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,340
She has taken over the seal.

785
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,300
But I still have something to say.

786
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,940
Before, the burden of twelve shops

787
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,420
all fell

788
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,980
on the chief manager.

789
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,820
This isn't fair.

790
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,980
I advise

791
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,980
distributing the twelve shops

792
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,140
to each household

793
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,060
so that everybody will know

794
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,020
how hard it is to make a living.

795
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,860
Chief Luo, what do you think?

796
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,820
It's up to you, Mother.

797
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,980
All right.

798
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,100
Our twelve shops...

799
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,100
Chief Luo is very capable.

800
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,700
She'll take care of nine.

801
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,620
The remaining three shops

802
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,780
will be entrusted to Muyun.

803
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,980
Chief Luo,

804
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,580
what do you think?

805
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,220
I've taken over Jinyu Tea.

806
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,300
But the family affairs,

807
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,820
big or small,

808
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,660
must be done the way you want, Mother.

809
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,620
Nobody shall disobey her.

810
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,020
We won't.

811
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,460
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

812
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,580
I shouldn't have come.

813
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,180
I want to say something.

814
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,420
Jinyu Tea's prosperity

815
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,100
is greatly indebted to Banfang Tea

816
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,300
of Concubine Qin.

817
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,460
Now, Jing Kan is back.

818
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,460
And his wife is pregnant.

819
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,140
I think he needs an opportunity

820
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,580
to practice doing business.

821
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,100
What do you say, cousin?

822
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,420
Mr. An,

823
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,140
you have a point.

824
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,220
So, Jing Kan deserves

825
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,580
one of the shops.

826
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,620
Chief Luo,

827
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,580
what do you think?

828
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,620
It seems that Jing Kan

829
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,620
isn't interested in tea.

830
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,540
He is.

831
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,260
Come on, he's interested.

832
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,580
Chief Luo, if you're worried,

833
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,540
why don't you give Jing Kan

834
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,660
the dilapidated

835
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,660
and deserted shop

836
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,260
at Anping Bridge?

837
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,140
If you think it's inappropriate,

838
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,260
forget it, then.

839
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,820
I just slipped that casually.

840
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,500
She won't think like that.

841
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,980
Chief Luo is always impartial

842
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,020
and cares most about Jinyu Tea.

843
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,540
I believe Mr. An offered some advice

844
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,140
for the good of Jinyu Tea.

845
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,900
Right?

846
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,020
Of course.

847
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,820
Jing Kan is also my son.

848
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,220
I should make arrangements for him.

849
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,860
We'll take your advice, Mr. An.

850
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,300
Good.

851
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,420
So, the future of Jinyu Tea

852
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,620
will count on you guys.

853
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,580
Shall we leave now?

854
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,900
Alright.

855
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,100
There you go, Mr. An.

856
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Alright then.

857
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,060
We'll count on you.

858
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,940
Pretty good.
