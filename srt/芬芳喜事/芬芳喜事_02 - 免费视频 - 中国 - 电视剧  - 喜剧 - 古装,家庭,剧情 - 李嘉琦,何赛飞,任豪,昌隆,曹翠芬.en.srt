1
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,500
(Two years ago, Song Residence)

2
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,960
Today is my master's wedding day.

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,540
- Get out of the way!
- Milord!

4
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,760
I've heard Landlord Song is an alcoholic

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,960
(Wedding)
and hits his concubines when he's drunk.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,380
He's killed several concubines.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,520
My daughter Yue! Milord!

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,560
Look what a terrible world it is.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,500
Yue!

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,880
I'll drink this Sweet Couple Tea

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,940
and finish our wedding.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,110
Haven't seen you for days.

13
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,810
You look much plumper.

14
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,060
Who are you?

15
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,890
Hey, son.

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,040
Do you like

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,300
Mother's kick?

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,810
Hey, who exactly are you?

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,480
I'm your mother

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,360
who will never change her name.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,670
I'm famous Jin Buhuan

22
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,100
who kills bad guys for justice.

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,780
You're Jin Buhuan?

24
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,200
Oh, no. Mother. Mother.

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,110
Spare me, Mother.

26
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,790
You've abducted girls
and terrorized the neighborhood.

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,410
How can I spare you?

28
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,250
How about this?

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,250
If you swear to let go of Yue,

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,350
I will consider

31
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,660
doing it quick.

32
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,530
Drop the act.

33
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,100
Don't pretend to be dying.

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,500
Get up.

35
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,460
The tea is poisonous.

36
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,520
- Master?
- Master.

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,400
Are you all right?

38
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,300
Master?

39
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,220
What was the noise, Master?

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,620
Who's that? Go after her!

41
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,090
- Master!
- Master!

42
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,340
Master is dead.

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,310
Master is dead!

44
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,570
Someone killed him!

69
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,660
Get married?

70
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,440
Who will get married?

71
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,530
You and I.

72
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,020
You.

73
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,700
You and I?

74
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,190
Yes. Let me explain.

75
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,360
Look, you hit someone,

76
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
but they thought I did.

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,320
So, they arrested me.

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,310
But I don't mind at all

79
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,520
because you tried to help me.

80
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,480
But the problem is

81
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,360
they now blame me

82
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,710
for girls' avoiding marriage.

83
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,750
I have only two choices,

84
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,920
to get married or to die.

85
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,730
And this guy is my only option.

86
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,000
As you can see,
our marriage can be fake.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,570
But he really wants to marry me.

88
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,470
Sorry I can't help you.

89
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,910
But I helped you twice.

90
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,910
Sorry.

91
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,020
Fine. You can leave now.

92
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,970
Whatever. I'll just die.

93
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,040
Nobody would care

94
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,120
about a stranger,

95
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,700
even if he's a gentleman.

96
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,690
Well, not everybody can be a gentleman.

97
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,860
Do you not have another option?

98
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,180
You can go if you want.

99
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,560
Don't bother to dawdle here

100
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,660
or pretend to care about me.

101
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,350
My plan is

102
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,330
to wander around

103
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,530
after I kill that person.

104
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,120
I'll take this as atonement

105
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,100
for my sin.

106
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,320
Right.

107
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,680
This is what a gentleman does.

108
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,150
You know what? If you marry me,

109
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,000
you'll be saving me.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,580
It'll totally atone for your murder.

111
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,060
That's too much, though.

112
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,660
Let me be clear on this.

113
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,260
We'll just make a bow

114
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,260
as a mere formality.

115
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,020
Yes, yes. That's my plan, too.

116
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,620
There's a marriage certificate.

117
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,620
A mere piece of paper.

118
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,260
We'll just bow to each other

119
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,660
in front of them and then break up.

120
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,620
I won't pester you.

121
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,380
But I must warn you.

122
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,580
In no case will I have sex with you.

123
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,940
And don't fall in love with me.

124
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,660
Rest assured. I won't try that.

125
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,660
Then, it's a deal.

126
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,700
At Chen hour tomorrow,

127
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,340
I'll see you in the woodshed

128
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,340
of my inn.

129
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,740
Sweetheart.

130
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,740
Don't call me that anymore!

131
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,020
Gentleman,

132
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,940
at Chen hour tomorrow,

133
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,260
don't forget to come.

134
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,540
I, Qin Kan, am a man of my word.

135
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,620
You're so cool, gentleman!

136
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,900
So cool!

137
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,420
See?

138
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,900
You could have spent
only 100 taels yesterday

139
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,380
but now you have to pay 200 taels.

140
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,540
200, huh?

141
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,940
Let me count it again.

142
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,660
Don't bother.

143
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,700
Last night, you hit me

144
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
for no reason.

145
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,900
Did you really have to?

146
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,380
Oh, yeah.

147
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,780
Do I really have to get married?

148
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,460
Why don't you give back my inn?

149
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,540
Stop.

150
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,740
That's a different thing.

151
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,500
This is the money for hitting me.

152
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,820
And you know what?

153
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,660
Magistrate Meng allowed you

154
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,660
to marry Qin Kan.

155
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,860
But he also said,

156
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,260
"If you fail to get married

157
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,420
before noon today,

158
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,660
you'll be killed."

159
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,500
I'll get married.

160
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,460
Everything's ready.

161
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,580
The two of you.

162
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,900
Follow her everywhere.

163
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,180
If she tries to escape,

164
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,660
kill her immediately.

165
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,900
Be careful.

166
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,820
You'd better pack them.

167
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,220
What if they're blown away?

168
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,660
Let's go, bride.

169
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,340
All right.

170
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,300
Here we are.

171
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,380
Qin Kan.

172
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,340
Maybe he's cooking.

173
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,660
Let's go check the kitchen.

174
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,300
Any food for us?

175
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,340
Yes. Yes, of course.

176
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,300
Food for both of you.

177
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,660
Qin Kan.

178
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Qin Kan.

179
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,940
Where's the food?

180
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,940
Food...

181
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,820
Maybe he's asleep in the woodshed

182
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,900
and we fail to see him.

183
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,060
Let's go take a look.

184
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,500
Don't play tricks.

185
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,350
I wouldn't dare.

186
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,700
Or I'd get killed.

187
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
Qin Kan.

188
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,020
Qin Kan.

189
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,700
Come out. Time to get married.

190
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,740
Qin Kan!

191
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,340
I have no time

192
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,540
to playact with you.

193
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,860
- Pick a room for death.
- No.

194
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,860
He must be away on business.

195
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,340
Can I go out and find him?

196
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,020
Do you think

197
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,340
we're idiots?

198
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,620
Are we idiots?

199
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,820
No, no.

200
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,620
I have two jars of mellow plum wine.

201
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,660
Would you like some?

202
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,700
Why?

203
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,700
Try to get us drunk

204
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,700
and then escape?

205
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,500
Don't say that.

206
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,980
Besides the plum wine,

207
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,220
do you have roast lamb leg

208
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,780
or roast baby goose?

209
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,260
No, actually.

210
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,260
They're available in Zuixian Restaurant.

211
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,780
You reminded me.

212
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,340
I feel hungry, too.

213
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,260
But we don't have any money.

214
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,940
I do.

215
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,500
I'll go get some for you.

216
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,140
I told you not to take us for fools.

217
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,100
I'm really going out

218
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,180
to find my husband.

219
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,420
So, she can't get married in time.

220
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,140
I can. I really can.

221
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,300
Chief, shall we finish up early?

222
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,540
Fair enough.

223
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,300
No, no. Please don't.

224
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,660
Qin Kan, you're finally here!

225
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,900
She...

226
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,900
Where's she?

227
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,260
- Out of my way!
- Move aside!

228
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,220
- Make way!
- Make way!

229
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,220
Get out of the way!

230
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,820
Hurry.

231
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,700
A woman avoiding marriage has escaped.

232
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,860
Guard the city gates.

233
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,980
- Don't let her run away!
- Yes!

234
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,010
If she fights,

235
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,900
you need no permission.

236
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,070
Just kill her there!

237
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,260
Are you clear?

238
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,660
- Yes!
- Search!

239
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,780
Move aside.

240
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,780
Get out of the way!

241
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,300
Seriously?

242
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,660
Kill me for not getting married?

243
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,780
Magistrate Meng is so narrow-minded.

244
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,260
Where exactly has Qin Kan gone?

245
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,940
Let go of me.

246
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,980
Help!

247
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,820
Stop struggling.

248
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Tie him tighter.

249
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,420
What are you doing?

250
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,420
Let him go!

251
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,860
Help! They're kidnapping me!

252
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
Wait a minute.

253
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,460
Who are you?

254
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,620
Who are you guys?

255
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,860
Who's she?

256
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,140
Do you know who she is?

257
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,460
Nobody.

258
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,460
Who's she, then?

259
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,460
I don't care. Go get the constable.

260
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,220
How dare you kidnap someone

261
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,620
in broad daylight!

262
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,340
Who on earth are you?

263
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,660
I...

264
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,940
Who on earth are you guys?

265
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,340
I'm his mother.

266
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,380
She said she was...

267
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,940
Mother?

268
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,700
You're the eldest grandson of the Jings?

269
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,020
So, the tea shop Jinyu Tea

270
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,300
is your family business?

271
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
I'm not related to that.

272
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,140
You should have been Jing Kan.

273
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,340
Why are you Qin Kan?

274
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,100
I take my mother's surname.

275
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,780
The lady I just tied up?

276
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
You did a great job.

277
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,460
You're totally confusing me.

278
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,660
Why must you follow me?

279
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,660
Come on, dude.

280
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,060
We must get married before noon.

281
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,060
Don't you remember?

282
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,740
You...

283
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,580
Gentleman,

284
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,980
you won't go back on your word, huh?

285
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,980
I'm a man

286
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,460
who keeps his word.

287
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,780
But my grandfather passed away.

288
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,620
I have to go home first.

289
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,540
(Jing Residence)

290
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,980
Welcome back home, Young Master.

291
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,300
Marvelous.

292
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,900
Marvelous, indeed.

293
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,660
And you are?

294
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,620
Honey.

295
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,460
(Jing Residence)
Honey, wait for me.

296
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,140
Honey?

297
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:46,940
(Veneration of Ancestors)

298
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,260
Grandfather,

299
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,060
I'm late.

300
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,420
Sorry, Grandfather.

301
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,460
This is such a mess.

302
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,100
Bad timing, indeed.

303
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,380
I...

304
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,860
Do you

305
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,500
have to grieve for your grandfather?

306
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
He died at an old age.

307
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,380
It's not miserable.

308
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,740
I don't need to grieve.

309
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,580
And anyway, our marriage

310
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,340
- isn't real.
- Right.

311
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,580
I'm just helping you out.

312
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,540
That's right.

313
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,820
My grandfather used to be benevolent.

314
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,100
I believe he'll understand this.

315
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Thank you, Grandfather.

316
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,020
I didn't have a choice,

317
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,300
so I made this unwise decision.

318
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,660
Sorry for disturbing you.

319
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,900
Are we leaving now?

320
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,620
- I'll see Grandmother
- All right.

321
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,660
before I marry you.

322
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,540
Sure.

323
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,460
Focus on your own business.

324
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,020
Here.

325
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,980
I'm terribly sorry.

326
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,820
We can't

327
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,380
just let it go.

328
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,820
Jing Kan appears to blame

329
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,700
his mother's death

330
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,940
(Luo Zhusi, Second Madam)
on you.

331
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,180
I don't care.

332
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,140
Let me see

333
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,140
what waves he can make.

334
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,340
Madam,

335
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,940
(Cuiying, Luo Zhusi's maid)
without you,

336
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,500
this family would have fallen apart.

337
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,860
But anyway,

338
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,540
we still don't know who that woman is.

339
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,300
She tied us up without warning.

340
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,740
These days,

341
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,140
we should be cautious.

342
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,420
Before Father is buried,

343
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,740
we can't let down our guard.

344
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,260
Yes.

345
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,860
I asked you to inquire about something.

346
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,100
Have you got anything?

347
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,380
Yes.

348
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,940
When Master died,

349
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,580
he didn't even open his eyes.

350
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,140
He didn't make a will.

351
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,100
But now, Jing Kan is back.

352
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,780
So what?

353
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,980
Don't make that face.

354
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,740
Whatever trouble he makes,

355
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,380
I'll be able to handle that.

356
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,220
I won't fail to suppress him.

357
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,340
In you go, Young Master.

358
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,620
My Lady, there he is.

359
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,140
Grandmother.

360
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,420
(Wei Junyi, Jing Kan's grandmother)
I'm back.

361
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,540
For your grandfather's funeral?

362
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,860
Who's she?

363
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,940
Greetings, Grandmother.

364
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,060
I'm the woman

365
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,820
who will marry him soon.

366
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,940
What's your name?

367
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,500
Ai Sixi.

368
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,900
Dayou,

369
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,900
you have a really good grandson.

370
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,420
He's back here for your funeral

371
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,540
with his bride.

372
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,020
Grandmother, I'm just helping her.

373
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,980
That's not real.

374
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,020
Don't give away my secret.

375
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Good.

376
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,500
You've grown up.

377
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,460
Since you've returned,

378
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,340
you'll move back

379
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,900
in your parents' house.

380
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,620
I didn't say I'd move back.

381
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,180
What?

382
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,180
I won't move back.

383
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,780
Jing Kan,

384
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,740
will you really

385
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,820
hate this family forever?

386
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,140
You're my grandson.

387
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,580
But you stay out there

388
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,660
and live a tough life.

389
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,460
You may not be ashamed,

390
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,180
but I'm ashamed.

391
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,700
I'm not living a tough life.

392
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,620
It's better than the life here.

393
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,700
In this world,

394
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,700
some family members come together

395
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,220
for gratitude.

396
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,780
Some family members come together

397
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,100
for...

398
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,060
For revenge.

399
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,540
Wrong.

400
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,660
For forgiveness.

401
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Grandmother,

402
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,740
I'll leave if you don't mind.

403
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
Take care.

404
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,020
If I were from such a rich family,

405
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,460
I wouldn't be a killer.

406
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,620
This family property

407
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,620
is none of my business.

408
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,340
Is there any money you don't need?

409
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,660
You can leave it to me.

410
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,620
I just happen to...

411
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,620
Greetings, Young Master.

412
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,780
Greetings, Young Master.

413
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,260
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

414
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,260
Greetings, Young Master.

415
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,940
There are so many jars of pickles.

416
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,780
Those aren't pickle jars.

417
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,580
Those are water tanks.

418
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,460
Water?

419
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,660
Lu Yu, the Sage of Tea, once said,

420
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,380
for tea making,

421
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,340
spring water is best.

422
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,380
River water is medium,

423
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,380
Well water is inferior.

424
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,260
You know so much cool stuff.

425
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,540
No knowledge of water

426
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,860
means illiteracy in tea making.

427
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
My grandfather said that.

428
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,860
You're wise, Grandfather.

429
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,220
In these tanks

430
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,660
are waterfall water

431
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,140
from Kangwang Valley, Mount Lushan,

432
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,300
stone spring water
from Huishan Temple, Wuxi,

433
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,060
toad's saliva
from Mount Shanzi, Xiazhou,

434
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,260
spring water from the Yangtze River,

435
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,380
and snow water and rainwater

436
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,380
from local Shigui Lake.

437
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,900
You rich guys are really different.

438
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,540
How?

439
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,260
You're fastidious.

440
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,380
Don't you rush to get married?

441
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,620
Yes, yes.

442
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,380
I was just kidding.

443
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,860
Go ahead.

444
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,860
Enjoy the roast lamb leg

445
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,100
and the roast baby goose.

446
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,900
How will you answer to Magistrate Meng?

447
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,620
But chief,

448
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,980
you brought that topic up.

449
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,100
I...Fine, I did.

450
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,980
You didn't watch her.

451
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,020
I didn't watch her?

452
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,500
I didn't even see her.

453
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,660
Why didn't you go find her?

454
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,420
I looked for her.

455
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,700
But I failed to find her.

456
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,140
Thank you for waiting.

457
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,380
Second bow to your parents.

458
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,220
Bow to each other.

459
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
It's done.

460
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,010
- You...
- Yes, I do.

461
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,820
You...

462
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
I do, too.

463
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,580
Here, bride.

464
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,820
You have to sign

465
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,140
(Notice)
this notice.

466
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,140
What is this?

467
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,540
According to Magistrate Meng,

468
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,420
the marriage of a woman like you

469
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,500
must be made public.

470
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,460
And I'm warning you.

471
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,540
Keep your mouth shut.

472
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,860
If you dare

473
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,900
to incite any other woman

474
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,940
to avoid marriage again,

475
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,060
you'll be in trouble.

476
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,740
I didn't incite anyone.

477
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,620
I won't do that anymore.

478
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,260
I'll sign it right away.

479
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,340
Just be quick.

480
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,340
All right.

481
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,820
After this, we'll go after Jin Buhuan.

482
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
Chief,

483
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,420
I don't understand.

484
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,500
Landlord Song died

485
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,740
about two years ago.

486
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,220
Why must we reinvestigate this case?

487
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,340
That's how the government works.

488
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,540
We solve cases in bursts.

489
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,060
And let me tell you.

490
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,140
Magistrate Meng gave us

491
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,500
only three months for this case.

492
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,460
Even a pledge was made.

493
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,580
He must be serious this time.

494
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,460
You're wearing a weird look.

495
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,570
Me?

496
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,900
Are you involved in this case?

497
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,780
You know Jin Buhuan.

498
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,700
Who?

499
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
Hey, stop joking.

500
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,740
Look, she's so scared.

501
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,220
Wait.

502
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,980
What are Jin Buhuan's characteristics?

503
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,420
What's your problem?

504
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,700
It's none of your business.

505
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Off you go.

506
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,220
Hope you'll get Jin Buhuan soon.

507
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,020
All right.

508
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
They've left, huh?

509
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,940
So, it's done.

510
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,140
I should go, too.

511
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,180
Hey, this is where you leave me.

512
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,400
- See you.
- All right.

513
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,140
What do you want?

514
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,460
- Anything else?
- No.

515
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,620
Oh, actually, yes.

516
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,900
Can I stay at your place for a few days?

517
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,420
I want to lie low.

518
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,260
For what?

519
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,980
For the marriage thing.

520
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,380
We'll break up after marriage.

521
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,220
That's your promise.

522
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,340
Yes. I promised that.

523
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,740
But it suddenly occurred to me

524
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,220
that it would be weird

525
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,420
if we didn't live together.

526
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,300
Don't push it.

527
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,140
Fine. Whatever you think.

528
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,500
Just for a couple of days.

529
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,340
If it's inconvenient,

530
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,020
I can stay at your mansion.

531
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,460
You think too much.

532
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,380
You can't profit from me.

533
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,180
My family and I aren't related, either.

534
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,140
I won't go back there.

535
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,060
It's just for now.

536
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,100
What if you regret it?

537
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Never!

538
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,100
Are you sure?

539
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,740
Yes. I'm pretty sure.

540
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,740
And...

541
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,580
Stop moving.

542
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Now, we're even.

543
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,820
- Sure.
- We're even.

544
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,780
All right.

545
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,780
Will you really not go?

546
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,180
Are you sure...?

547
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,140
Perfect, then.

548
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,620
I'll go there instead.

549
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,460
Madam,

550
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,320
it's the soothing tea,

551
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,860
our new product.

552
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,900
Mr. Wang asked me to bring you some.

553
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,060
What about Jing Kan?

554
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,500
I heard he and that woman

555
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,820
kowtowed to Master

556
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,780
and talked to Old Lady

557
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,710
before they left.

558
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,860
Talked?

559
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,700
At first, they talked in a low voice.

560
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,740
But later, they argued.

561
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,660
Argued?

562
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,340
About what?

563
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,660
I don't know.

564
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100
I didn't hear clearly.

565
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,220
Then don't bring it up.

566
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,700
Even if Mother wants

567
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,820
to hand over Jinyu Tea to him,

568
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,540
he won't be able to handle that.

569
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,300
But anyway,

570
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,220
don't forget.

571
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,060
He's a real descendant.

572
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,140
They're a family, after all.

573
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,780
We can't let down our guard.

574
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,420
I got it.

575
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,020
What about that woman?

576
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,940
She left.

577
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,660
She couldn't stay alone, after all.

578
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Oh.

579
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,100
What a coincidence.

580
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
Mother.

581
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,460
Cuiying.

582
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,260
This is your room, huh?

583
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,780
Get some rest early.

584
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,140
I'll get around.

585
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,860
But you told me she had left.

586
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,940
I'm confused, too.

587
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,660
You...

588
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,660
Is it her?

589
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
Did she really leave?

590
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,140
When, actually?

591
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,380
I just want to ask...

592
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,500
Where is

593
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,460
Jing Kan's old room?

594
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,180
I'll go ask someone else.

595
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,940
She left, huh?

596
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,740
What is that? A ghost?

597
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,740
She left, huh?

598
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,180
Such inaccurate information.

599
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,700
This is Young Master's room.

600
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,860
All right.

601
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,820
No need.

602
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,580
- I'll do it myself.
- All right.

603
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,580
Thank you.

604
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,340
Marvelous.

605
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,900
Marvelous, indeed.

606
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,660
You...

607
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,940
Haven't rested yet, huh?

608
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,820
Who allowed you to live here?

609
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,620
Grandmother.

610
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,300
Mother?

611
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,820
How did I not know that?

612
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,100
What about

613
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,660
you go and ask her yourself?

614
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
Where's Jing Kan?

615
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Jing Kan...

616
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,900
He has things to do, so he sent me back.

617
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,140
What exactly

618
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,180
is your relationship with him?

619
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,780
We're a couple.

620
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,900
This is our certificate.

621
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,460
It's real, I think.

622
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,020
(Yuming Chamber)
I kept telling him to come back.

623
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,500
But he refused all the time.

624
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,940
Due to my efforts

625
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
and persistence,

626
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,420
he sent me back for you, Grandmother.

627
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,180
Then, Jing Kan...

628
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,540
Will he never

629
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,940
come back to this family?

630
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,580
He...

631
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,500
He said he'd think about it.

632
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,900
He asked all of you

633
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,100
not to look for him.

634
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,340
When he thinks it over,

635
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,660
he will come back.

636
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,700
How did you and Jing Kan

637
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,780
meet each other?

638
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,900
Here's the thing.

639
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,660
I used to work at Yueji Inn...

640
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,140
Yueji Inn?

641
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,780
You know that?

642
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,020
Isn't it Yueji Gambling House?

643
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,820
Not a gambling house. It's an inn.

644
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,700
Did you gamble there?

645
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,620
No.

646
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,260
I read the official notice.

647
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,460
That's a gambling house.

648
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,580
No, no. It's exactly an inn. It...

649
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,300
It's a long story, anyway.

650
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,900
I'll tell you later.

651
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,980
What did you do
in that gambling house?

652
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,560
Well.

653
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,700
You all think
it's a gambling house.

654
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,500
Actually in there, I was...

655
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,140
A cook.

656
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,380
Cook?

657
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,790
Then how did you and Jing Kan

658
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,380
meet each other?

659
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,180
Let me explain.

660
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,100
That day,

661
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,500
I was fishing by the lake.

662
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,220
Jing Kan suddenly popped up

663
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,620
and tried to drown himself.

664
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,500
I got him out of the water immediately.

665
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Drown himself?

666
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,500
He even tried to kill himself?

667
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,620
How has he been supporting himself

668
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,420
over the past year?

669
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,740
By painting.

670
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,020
How much money could he make, then?

671
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,220
Very little.

672
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,620
So, the two of us

673
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,500
didn't have steady food.

674
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,540
Life was really hard.

675
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,060
Grandmother,

676
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,060
can I not be expelled?

677
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,420
Who expelled you?

678
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,540
Don't look at me.

679
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,340
Did I ever expel you?

680
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,340
I didn't expel her.

681
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,660
My Lady.

682
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,140
My Lady.

683
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,380
What's up?

684
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,380
My Lady.

685
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,100
- Madam.
- What happened?

686
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,500
Two constables are at the door.

687
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,740
What for?

688
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,020
To find the murderer

689
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,460
who killed Landlord Song.

690
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,380
They're inquiring from door to door.

691
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,580
Even in our house?

692
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,620
They're showing no respect!

693
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,860
I'll send them away, then.

694
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,720
No!

695
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,500
Kick them out!

696
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,260
Kick them out now.

697
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,180
Mother is just cross.

698
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,900
Go pack some money and tea.

699
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,180
Then, kick them out.

700
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,780
Yes.

701
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,780
Hurry.

702
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,300
Zhusi,

703
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,540
what's your plan
for your daughter-in-law?

704
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,940
Mother,

705
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,300
I haven't acknowledged

706
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,260
that she's my daughter-in-law.

707
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,940
Mother, are you still angry?

708
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,100
It was my bad that day.

709
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,460
I tied her up by accident.

710
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,220
I was wrong.

711
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,660
I really didn't mean that.

712
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,180
You tied her up?

713
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,820
She did.

714
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,620
Since Madam was born,

715
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,260
she's never humiliated like that.

716
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,660
Indeed,

717
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,980
you don't respect her at all.

718
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,220
I believe

719
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,860
you have a lot in common
to talk about.

720
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,260
Anyway,

721
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,420
I'm in charge of my own house.

722
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,340
I'm being merciful

723
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,620
when they've been married

724
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,660
without telling me.

725
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,700
And now,

726
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,420
this woman disrespects me.

727
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,300
If we let her stay,

728
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,420
we will break

729
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,820
our family rules

730
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,420
and ruin the reputation of Jinyu Tea.

731
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,100
Mother, don't be so narrow-minded.

732
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,140
I apologized.

733
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
What more do you expect?

734
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,140
Anyway, I'm Jing Kan's bride.

735
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,260
Don't be so harsh on me.

736
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,820
Bride?

737
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,900
A bride should have a formal wedding,

738
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,420
get here in a red sedan,

739
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,940
and serve tea to her mother-in-law.

740
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,420
It makes me feel aggrieved.

741
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,220
Other brides

742
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,740
have a formal wedding

743
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,500
and deserve a red sedan.

744
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,980
What about me?

745
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,740
I walked in by myself.

746
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,260
I could have blamed you.

747
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,460
Mother, have some tea.

748
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,660
Enough.

749
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,500
All right.

750
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,420
Anyway,

751
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,580
she's your mother-in-law.

752
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,340
You shouldn't have hurt her.

753
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,660
That's right.

754
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,780
As punishment,

755
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,140
you'll be grounded in this mansion.

756
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,500
Thank you, Grandmother.

757
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,860
Oh, My Lady.

758
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,660
Don't pretend to be obedient.

759
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
When you're here,

760
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,860
you must follow our family rules.

761
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,700
Don't try to get smart with us.

762
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,820
Follow your family rules?

763
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,860
People usually follow my rules.

764
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,820
That's some tough talk.

765
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,820
Let's see what will happen to you later.

766
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,660
What will happen?

767
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,180
Happen...

768
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,940
I happen to be hungry.

769
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,300
Where is the dining room?

770
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Thank you.

771
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,140
Excuse me.

772
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,700
Is this the dining room?

773
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,260
Young Madam,

774
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,380
Yushi Chamber

775
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,100
is the dining room, indeed.

776
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,060
Yanxia Chamber upstairs

777
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,540
is specifically for tea tasting.

778
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,020
Yuming Chamber across the hall

779
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,940
is specifically for honored guests.

780
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,820
Impressive.

781
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,020
Impressive, indeed.

782
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,660
Old Lady also gave you

783
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,780
some gold and silver jewelry.

784
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,260
You can dress yourself up.

785
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,780
Really?

786
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,660
This is super awesome.

787
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,100
Where is the jewelry?

788
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,660
In your room.

789
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,260
Fine. I'll check it later.

790
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,620
If I want something to drink,

791
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,820
do I have to order from you

792
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,340
or is there a daily menu?

793
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,140
You can order from me.

794
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,140
Today, we have Queshe, Yulu,

795
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,380
Yinye, Cunjin, Luoka,

796
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,660
Zisun, Shihua, and Huangya.

797
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,900
Young Madam, what would you like?

798
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,940
Is there any tea?

799
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,140
They're different kinds of tea.

800
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,780
- Umm...
- I've heard Jing Kan is back.

801
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,420
Umm...

802
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,060
Who's this?

803
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,620
(Xue Muyun, First Madam)
This is Ms. Xue Muyun.

804
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,900
Auntie.

805
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,060
Jing Kan's wife, huh?

806
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,340
- Yes.
- I've heard.

807
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,260
Take your seat.

808
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,220
All right.

809
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,580
Be seated, Auntie.

810
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,580
All right.

811
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,020
Hey, look at her.

812
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,180
It seems she's a lucky girl.

813
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,940
What should I call you?

814
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,140
Ai Sixi.

815
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,060
You can call me Sixi.

816
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,860
Si what?

817
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,100
Sixi. S-I-X-I.

818
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,700
Oh, goodness. Who gave you that name?

819
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,780
Sounds adorable.

820
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,900
What a genius.

821
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,220
Sixi.

822
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,180
Yeah.

823
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,580
Think about Jing Kan.

824
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,900
I don't mean to complain.

825
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,380
But he should have told his family

826
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,980
about the marriage thing.

827
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,820
Yeah.

828
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,820
Am I right?

829
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,460
Ms. Xue, would you like some tea?

830
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,860
Yes.

831
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,860
Luoka.

832
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
Use snow water.

833
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,940
Fresher water, please.

834
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,460
Young Madam, what about you?

835
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,420
Luo...Whatever Auntie ordered.

836
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,980
All right.

837
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,340
Have you eaten yet?

838
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,660
I'm here to get some food.

839
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,340
Have you ordered?

840
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,860
Umm...

841
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,900
I'd like some noodles.

842
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,180
Chewy noodles, please.

843
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,180
Don't just order some noodles.

844
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,580
Check the menu.

845
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,580
Today's meat dishes contain

846
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,780
roast goose, sheep trotters,

847
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,460
five-flavor steamed chicken,
original sheep bone,

848
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,540
mutton dumplings, chicken breast
with bamboo shoot,

849
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,820
and vinegar fish with iced sauce.

850
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,460
Vegetarian dishes contain
five-flavor steamed gluten,

851
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,460
asparagus, seafood soup,

852
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,780
Jiangnan lettuce, lettuce balls,

853
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,940
and wolfberry porridge.

854
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,100
What would you like?

855
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,420
Anything is fine.

856
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,860
Do the whole menu.

857
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,060
Yes, Madam.

858
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,700
The whole menu.

859
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,580
What does that mean?

860
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,580
It means

861
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,220
they will offer all the dishes.

862
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,140
We can't finish that much.

863
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,500
I had lunch.

864
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,700
You'll eat alone.

865
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,140
I definitely can't finish that much.

866
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,940
It doesn't matter.

867
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,020
You don't need to finish it.

868
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,940
What a waste of food, then.

869
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,740
It's not. Don't bother.

870
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,020
There's enough food here.

871
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,380
Oh.

872
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,500
When will Jing Kan come back?

873
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Well, he...

874
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,900
I want to prepare some food for him.

875
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,100
I'm not sure.

876
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,540
Come on, kid.

877
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,380
You should be honest with me.

878
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,460
I'm not a bad guy.

879
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,740
When we get along for a long time,

880
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,740
you will know.

881
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,460
We were cautious,

882
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,380
but Jing Kan fooled us eventually.

883
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,500
He's just like his mother.

884
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,300
He appears to expect nothing.

885
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,780
But actually, he's greedy.

886
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,620
He isn't back.

887
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,260
But he sent back a seedling

888
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,020
and would wait to gain something.

889
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,380
Ai...

890
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,780
Ai what?

891
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,780
Ai Sixi.

892
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,260
Whatever.

893
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,580
She's rude,

894
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,260
coquettish,

895
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,420
and snobbish.

896
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,540
- She's just...
- Auntie.

897
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,180
Jiao'e, what are you doing here?

898
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,660
(Lyu Jiao'e, Wei Junyi's maid)

899
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,520
Old Lady asked me

900
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,580
to bring you the Bird's Nest Ointment

901
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,860
and expected you to calm down.

902
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,660
It's so sweet of you, Jiao'e.

903
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,260
Regardless of any misunderstanding,

904
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,140
Madam is your auntie, after all.

905
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,620
She cares about you.

906
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,620
Cuiying, don't say that.

907
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,500
I've never complained.

908
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,180
Your auntie tried

909
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,780
to set you up with Jing Kan

910
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,980
for good intentions.

911
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,540
Unexpectedly, something happened

912
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,340
and he even ran away from home.

913
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,620
Now,

914
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,580
he has such a wife.

915
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,620
Jiao'e.

916
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,500
Have a seat.

917
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,620
Come on.

918
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,580
Get her some tea. Go ahead.

919
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,580
No need.

920
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,780
Just sit for a while.

921
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,900
Jiao'e,

922
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,350
let me tell you

923
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,060
about my original plan.

924
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,580
I had wanted you

925
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,020
to marry Jing Kan.

926
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,260
But sadly,

927
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,420
accidents happened.

928
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,580
Now, I'm in a critical moment.

929
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,780
Within days, I'll know

930
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,580
if I can take over Jinyu Tea.

931
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,180
Jiao'e,

932
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,220
try hard to persuade my mother-in-law

933
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,020
to expel Ai Sixi.

934
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,860
Auntie,

935
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,540
how can I persuade her?

936
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,900
Before,

937
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,860
I came here to be the young madam.

938
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,900
But now,

939
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,420
I'm just like a maid.

940
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,020
My word doesn't count for anything.

941
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,580
Who would take my advice?

942
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,540
What's wrong with being a maid?

943
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,220
There are benefits for maids.

944
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,180
If you're a...

945
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,700
Sorry to interrupt you.

946
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,780
But I'm not a maid.

947
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,740
I said I was like a maid.

948
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,740
The two expressions

949
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,060
are greatly different.

950
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,100
Right. You aren't a maid.

951
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Shut up.

952
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,660
Jiao'e,

953
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,580
you've been taking good care of Mother.

954
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,100
When you serve her well,

955
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,940
you'll have a bright future.

956
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,460
Then, I'm still a maid, aren't I?

957
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,180
Come on.

958
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,940
When I completely take over Jinyu Tea,

959
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,820
I'll get you a great husband.

960
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,100
I'll make it worth your while.

961
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,500
And I'll offer you

962
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,820
the dowry.

963
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,300
By then, among rich guys,

964
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,500
you can choose anyone you like.

965
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,620
Then,

966
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,940
I'll count on you.

967
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,060
I believe Ai Sixi

968
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,660
is a troublemaker.

969
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,980
You must do something to expel her.

970
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,820
Actually, yesterday,

971
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,740
I heard something

972
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,220
from their conversation.

973
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,620
Something was a bit weird.

974
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,020
What did they say?

975
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,260
Kan said

976
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,260
he was just helping her

977
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,660
and their marriage wasn't real.

978
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,900
Are you sure?

979
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,820
Yes.

980
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,020
Kan is a wonderful man.

981
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,340
He wouldn't have such poor taste.

982
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,660
I knew something was fishy.

983
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,460
Shut up.

984
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,620
I believe

985
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,900
I will have something

986
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,060
on Ai Sixi.
