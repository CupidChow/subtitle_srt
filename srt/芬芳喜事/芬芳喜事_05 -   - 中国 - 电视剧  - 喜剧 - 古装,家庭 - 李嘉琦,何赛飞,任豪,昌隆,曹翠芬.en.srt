Madam, I just changed the teacup.

26
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,600
When did Jing Kan

27
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,950
get tied to Mr. An?

28
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,880
He even defended him.

29
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,130
Madam, please calm your anger.

30
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,170
Everyone knows

31
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,410
the Anping Bridge Shop

32
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,380
is pretty shabby

33
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,450
with poor feng shui.

34
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,480
Utterly inauspicious.

35
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,980
Even if they took it over,

36
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,550
nothing good would come of it.

37
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,390
Since their return,

38
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,170
haven't we been caught off guard

39
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,110
many times?

40
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,480
I must ask you.

41
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,260
Of all the news you heard,

42
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,640
which one turned out to be true?

43
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,450
Isn't the Chief Seal

44
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,850
still in your hands?

45
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,990
You know nothing.

46
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,170
Mother is using me

47
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,710
to pave the way for Jing Kan.

48
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,710
In her heart, she knows it well.

49
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,950
Without me,

50
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,360
the family business would be ruined.

51
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,640
I see.

52
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,110
She sends you forward
in the bitter winds,

53
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,700
and once the road is cleared,

54
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,240
she gives it back to her grandson.

55
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,080
The Old Lady is indeed shrewd.

56
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,950
She is also left

57
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,580
with no choice.

58
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,620
If there were anyone else reliable,

59
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,740
would it fall to me?

60
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,620
Since Jing Kan now has a shop,

61
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,420
I shall go along with the flow

62
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,500
and give him another push.

63
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,500
Yes.

64
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,220
What does that mean?

65
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,340
I want Mother to see

66
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,100
how useless

67
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,380
her precious grandson is.

68
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,300
You've begun practicing slitting?

69
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,980
(Qin Kan)
It's your name.

70
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,220
What are you doing?

71
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,380
I want to kill the weak self within me.

72
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,300
Not bad.

73
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,980
I thought that failing
to become the Chief

74
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,260
would have you wailing.

75
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,180
How could I?

76
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,060
Why is it that in your family,

77
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,220
everyone treats An

78
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,340
with such respect?

79
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,980
Because when the Jing Clan

80
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,540
first arrived in Taiping County,

81
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,580
it was the An Clan

82
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,780
that saved our lives.

83
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,820
So, our ancestral rule

84
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,940
is to always treat the Ans

85
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,220
as benefactors.

86
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,300
When Jinyu Tea

87
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,340
started business,

88
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,460
Mr. An also helped us a lot.

89
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,620
You're crying.

90
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,540
I am not crying.

91
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,620
This is the weak me,

92
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,980
flickering back to life again.

93
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,220
I must draw him back in.

94
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,580
Today was too shameful.

95
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,500
It wasn't that bad.

96
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,860
No one even noticed you.

97
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,260
You left without anyone realizing.

98
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,380
I want everyone to know.

99
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,140
From now on, they will not be able

100
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,380
to ignore my existence.

101
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,140
Good that you have confidence.

102
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,740
Remember,

103
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,100
avenging your mother comes first,

104
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,220
not saving face.

105
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,980
That at least awakens me.

106
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,860
But still,

107
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,940
a man may be killed
but never humiliated.

108
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,340
Enough, I'll comfort you.

109
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,340
How much for comforting you again?

110
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,020
I'm fine.

111
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,300
I'm fine.

112
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,820
Mingnan, what is it?

113
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,100
Someone had a letter for Young Master.

114
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,500
Thank you.

115
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,820
You have a letter. I'll open it for you.

116
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,740
Who is it?

117
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,260
Well.

118
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,500
I can't read many words.

119
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,380
Hand it over.

120
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,500
Who is it?

121
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,820
Mr. An invites us to his courtyard.

122
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,620
Mr. An?

123
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,220
Madam, speak well later.

124
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,140
Spare me the chatter.

125
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,420
Mother.

126
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,340
Mother, why shut the door
in broad daylight?

127
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,640
At least get two shops.

128
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,820
One for you, and one for me.

129
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,740
Get out.

130
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,980
Mother, are you secretly rejoicing?

131
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,900
Those three shops

132
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,980
aren't yours alone.

133
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,180
You mustn't keep them all.

134
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,940
Be more polite,

135
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,260
or Mother will be angry.

136
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,580
Mother, I'm getting angry.

137
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,860
Milady, Madam is unwell.

138
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,260
What's wrong?

139
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,580
Her mouth, perhaps?

140
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,780
From grinning?

141
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,220
Let me see just how unwell she is.

142
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,180
Milady.

143
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,100
Mother.

144
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,660
Why are you avoiding me?

145
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,420
Madam, I did my best.

146
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,300
Mother.

147
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,540
Those three shops

148
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,820
aren't yours alone.

149
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,580
Grandmother said
they'd go to the first branch.

150
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,580
But she never said
they'd go to Xue Muyun.

151
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,980
What are you shouting about?

152
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,300
Look at how Jing Kan treats Auntie.

153
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,860
Even he gets a shop.

154
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,860
What about me?

155
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,900
I call you Mother

156
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,540
every day,

157
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,460
and yet I get nothing?

158
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,820
Do you think I don't deserve
to be your mother?

159
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,380
If you don't mind,

160
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,780
I can call you Xue instead.

161
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,220
- Madam.
- Jing Zhenzhu.

162
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,260
I've spoiled you so much

163
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,540
that you've lost all decency.

164
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,700
Dear.

165
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,700
This is Mother.

166
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
How can you say that?

167
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,860
Do you think you're so good?

168
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,960
I haven't even blamed you.

169
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,180
It's been five years,

170
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,380
but you accomplished nothing.

171
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,940
Others return and immediately conceive.

172
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,860
And you?

173
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,540
Goodness, you useless coward.

174
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,260
I never knew why I married you.

175
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,980
I went to Physician Guo

176
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,220
of Jiren Clinic again.

177
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,860
He said I had no problem.

178
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,380
God.

179
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,540
Is it my fault then?

180
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,400
I didn't say that.

181
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,660
- I said I was fine.
- Go away.

182
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,720
Enough. Always babbling on.

183
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,660
What a nuisance.

184
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,540
Jing Kan's shop

185
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,700
is a polished dung ball.

186
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,060
You wouldn't have wanted it.

187
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,860
But it's still his shop.

188
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,100
Mother.

189
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,180
I don't want them all.

190
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,860
I only want two.

191
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,020
Impossible.

192
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,340
Then one.

193
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,380
Is that okay?

194
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,580
Dear, I also want one.

195
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,820
You won't even get one.

196
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,060
Why?

197
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,460
Jing Zhenzhu,

198
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,380
you are simply not cut out

199
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,540
for business.

200
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,820
You know that?

201
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,260
You spend a lot.

202
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,020
If I give you this shop now,

203
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,340
I'm not helping you.

204
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,220
I'm harming you.

205
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,660
Besides, why the hurry?

206
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,660
My things will be yours anyway.

207
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,500
When will they be mine?

208
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,620
Can't it be sooner?

209
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,780
You wish me dead soon?

210
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,780
That's not what I meant.

211
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,060
You're not surnamed Jing,

212
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,620
yet you hold so many Jing shops.

213
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,780
Why?

214
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,700
Come on.

215
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,100
Luo Zhusi is not surnamed Jing either,

216
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,380
yet she's still the Chief, right?

217
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,980
How can you say that?

218
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,940
Luo Zhusi has

219
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,140
nine shops.

220
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,860
Go ask her for some.

221
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,900
You think I don't dare?

222
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,260
I'll go now and call her my mother.

223
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,460
No, dear.

224
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,540
May you live happily ever after.

225
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,500
Dear, no, no.

226
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,780
Come back, dear...

227
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,340
Mother.

228
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,380
I'll go persuade her.

229
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,980
If there's a chance for two shops,

230
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,580
please give me that opportunity.

231
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,380
You know I have a mind for business.

232
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,020
Hurry, go, go.

233
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,140
- Consider it.
- Go.

234
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,060
Consider it.

235
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,460
You decided to go.

236
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,340
Don't drag me into it.

237
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,340
Sure, sure.

238
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,860
Don't pull me in.

239
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,260
Two pests.

240
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,540
Your little courtyard is quite nice.

241
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,220
Mr. An, thank you today.

242
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,620
Your grandmother didn't pass

243
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,900
the Chief position to you.

244
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,020
You must be disappointed.

245
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,140
Not at all.

246
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,980
What's wrong?

247
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,180
It seems the weak you

248
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,140
is truly dead.

249
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,820
Old man,

250
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,260
well played.

251
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,620
We saved your life,

252
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,140
and you helped him back.

253
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,300
We're even.

254
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,140
My suggestion to give him a shop

255
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,700
is not because you saved me.

256
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,660
Then why?

257
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,780
Tea to drink.

258
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,780
Pregnant women shouldn't drink tea.

259
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,420
Right, right.

260
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,380
I forgot.

261
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,140
Can you name

262
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,940
these three teas?

263
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,980
Since you're in the mood,

264
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,660
I should only comply.

265
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,300
Wait.

266
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,540
If he can name them,

267
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,660
is there any reward?

268
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,540
If he manages to name them,

269
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,540
I'll praise him.

270
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,500
What kind of reward is that?

271
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,060
Anhua Foshou from Laolongtan Tea.

272
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,540
Why?

273
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,420
Among the three tea shops,

274
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,140
Laolongtan Tea started the earliest.

275
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,180
Their tea steaming

276
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,700
is the most refined,

277
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,020
so their tea soup

278
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,060
has a tender smoothness.

279
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,820
But their Foshou tea

280
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,100
always has

281
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,460
a faint grassy note,

282
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,300
not top grade,

283
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,340
and not as good
as their signature Longwochun.

284
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,180
The second cup.

285
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,060
Tingxicui from Ruicao Tea.

286
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,140
The fragrance

287
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,060
is different.

288
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,180
Taste again.

289
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,860
Could their flower for scenting

290
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,820
have switched to jasmine?

291
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,100
How did you tell?

292
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,340
Each of Taiping's three tea shops

293
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,100
has its own secret.

294
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,420
Steaming for Laolongtan Tea,

295
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,980
pan-firing for Jinyu Tea,

296
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,100
and scenting

297
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,740
for Ruicao Tea.

298
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,260
Don't be smug.

299
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,660
There's still the last cup.

300
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,220
The first is from Laolongtan Tea,

301
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,660
and the second is from Ruicao Tea.

302
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,260
Taiping only has three tea shops.

303
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,940
The third must be from Jinyu Tea.

304
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,780
Try it first.

305
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,700
Hurry.

306
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,380
Can you tell?

307
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,940
You can't tell?

308
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,420
This is a tea

309
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,340
I once drank,

310
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,820
but the flavor is a bit thin.

311
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,620
The tea you once drank

312
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,260
should be called Banfang Tea.

313
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,020
Over ten years ago,

314
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,820
a madam

315
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,700
passed by my little grass hut

316
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,180
and asked for a cup of water.

317
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,340
Before she left,

318
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,740
she gave me a packet of tea

319
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,460
as a gift.

320
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,100
That was the first time I drank

321
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,180
Banfang Tea.

322
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,540
I will never forget

323
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,860
the surprise I felt the first time

324
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,940
I drank it.

325
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,300
You once met her?

326
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,780
Who?

327
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,620
Banfang Tea has
a silver-green appearance,

328
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,500
a jade-green liquor,

329
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,580
and a bright green leaf base.

330
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,380
They're the three greens.

331
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,180
It also carries the fragrance of orchid,

332
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,780
mung bean, and chestnut.

333
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,380
They're the three scents.

334
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,380
All because of proper pan-firing.

335
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,140
Now, the method is lost.

336
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,860
For all these years,

337
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,700
I've been trying to recreate Banfang Tea

338
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,620
but never found the right way.

339
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,260
So,

340
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,500
there is always regret.

341
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,460
Why don't you

342
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,620
find that madam

343
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,860
and ask how she made it?

344
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,180
You can't find her?

345
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,700
She's no longer here.

346
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,540
You know her? Who is she?

347
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,100
You met her

348
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,580
on the mountain that day.

349
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,780
The one

350
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,940
who made Banfang Tea was your mother?

351
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,980
"Your mother"?

352
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,980
Our mother?

353
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,300
What's wrong?

354
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,780
Nothing, I just drank

355
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,140
some cold water at Mr. An's place.

356
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,820
My stomach aches a bit.

357
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,860
There is no privy here.

358
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,700
It's not that kind of ache.

359
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,520
What kind of ache is it?

360
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,540
A kind of ache you can't imagine.

361
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,420
Don't worry about me.

362
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,780
I'll sit here and rest for a while.

363
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,060
I really didn't expect

364
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,940
our mother to be so good.

365
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,060
Back then, thanks to Banfang Tea,

366
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,060
Jinyu Tea won the Tea Contest

367
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,060
against Laolongtan Tea,

368
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,260
so our family earned

369
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,700
the right to help make tribute tea.

370
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,300
Yet even so,

371
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,220
no one ever saw
my mother's contribution.

372
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,500
So,

373
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,500
people must live for themselves.

374
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,180
Ai Sixi loves herself.

375
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,380
That's right.

376
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,380
I have decided.

377
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,580
I will open the shop

378
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,500
by Anping Bridge.

379
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,580
You were right.

380
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,640
There are many ways to seek revenge.

381
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,660
I will take back, piece by piece,

382
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,940
what my mother lost

383
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,980
to Luo Zhusi.

384
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,340
That is good.

385
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,260
But there is one key point.

386
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,500
Once you earn money,

387
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,740
you must pay me on time.

388
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,940
A gentleman's word is his bond.

389
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,580
I never go back on my word.

390
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,260
Why are you acting again?

391
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,860
My hat is a bit tight. Let me adjust it.

392
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,460
But ever since you helped me,

393
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,180
things have gone more smoothly.

394
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,220
Perhaps our fates

395
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,140
do match well.

396
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,340
Of course.

397
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,100
Though we have little affection,

398
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,780
at least we are a married couple.

399
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,460
What a surprise

400
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,780
that our marriage
can turn misfortune into fortune.

401
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,940
You...

402
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,580
You're such a smooth talker.

403
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,140
I know.

404
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,060
You can help me watch the shop.

405
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,300
With you there, I feel at ease.

406
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,060
Who agreed to watch the shop for you?

407
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,700
Didn't you say you'd help me?

408
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,560
I'll recommend someone to you.

409
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,580
Who?

410
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,660
Mr. Wise

411
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,620
of Taiping County.

412
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,860
Mr. Wise?

413
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,140
Me?

414
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,660
I am Mr. Wise?

415
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,260
Here is my reasoning.

416
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,900
I might someday be forced to flee

417
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
for my life.

418
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,260
Sixi, what are you saying?

419
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,900
So, I must plan

420
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,900
a path for you.

421
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,300
I've set the price.

422
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,220
Five taels a month.

423
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,540
Five taels a month?

424
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,840
Sixi, how did you manage that?

425
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,540
I'm worth five taels?

426
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,860
Sixi.

427
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,860
Is Qin Kan truly

428
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,220
the eldest grandson of Jinyu Tea?

429
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,340
Of course.

430
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,340
Sixi, you're so good to me.

431
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,540
Sixi, what's wrong?

432
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,140
My period has come.

433
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,540
I drank some cold water again.

434
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,740
See? You should drink less cold water.

435
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,500
Now, you'll be writhing in pain
like before.

436
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,880
Here, I'll pour you something hot.

437
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,980
Enough, enough.

438
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,580
Go pack your things.

439
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,900
I'll take you to Jing Residence.

440
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,020
Now?

441
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,220
We should seize the time
to enjoy the good days.

442
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,180
Sixi, I'm not ready.

443
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,580
Five taels a month?

444
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,060
No one even paid me 50 wen before.

445
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,660
If I go

446
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,620
and become Mr. Wise...

447
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,580
Don't go then.

448
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,740
No, Sixi, I'll go.

449
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,660
I'm only afraid

450
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,020
of shaming you.

451
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,540
(Jing Residence)

452
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,100
Scattered Flowers, go.

453
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Perfect.

454
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,860
Attack, Butterfly Duo.

455
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,020
Don't rush.

456
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,700
All three of us win.

457
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,610
Not bad.

458
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,460
Very good.

459
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,780
My Lady.

460
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,060
My eyes are a little sore.

461
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,100
My Lady.

462
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,820
This time you can't cheat. Pay up.

463
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,540
- When have I ever cheated?
- Yes, pay up.

464
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,460
You...

465
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,380
Grandmother.

466
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,060
See?

467
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,380
Someone's upset.

468
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,380
Hurry and go.

469
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,540
- Go.
- The money?

470
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,660
Just go.

471
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,860
Next time.

472
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,980
Next time again?

473
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,900
Grandmother.

474
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,620
We're both surnamed Jing.

475
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,420
If Jing Kan can have a shop,

476
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,820
then give me one, too.

477
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,260
I only manage home matters,

478
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,380
not outside affairs.

479
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,460
Who said so?

480
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,060
Don't think I don't know.

481
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,900
Auntie listens to you in everything.

482
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,340
Didn't you even praise me,

483
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,940
saying I was a business prodigy?

484
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,700
Come on.

485
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,540
You can't even tell flattery from jest.

486
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,000
I just want it.

487
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,140
If you don't give it to me,

488
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,060
I won't leave today.

489
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,540
How old are you now?

490
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,460
I don't care.

491
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,060
Outsiders

492
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,100
laugh at me,

493
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,020
saying I am useless.

494
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,020
None of you cares for me.

495
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,060
If you don't stand up for me today,

496
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,380
I will not leave.

497
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,660
Just one shop, right?

498
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,340
Then I'll ask your Auntie.

499
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,540
Grandmother, you're the best.

500
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,620
Thank you, Grandmother.

501
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,940
Stay here. Don't move.

502
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,620
- Don't go anywhere.
- Sure.

503
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,220
Don't let me come back and not find you.

504
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,160
Rest assured, Grandmother.
I won't go anywhere.

505
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,340
My Lady, are we really going?

506
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,980
Are you foolish like her?

507
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,100
Go call those girls back.

508
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,820
We'll find another,
farther place to play.

509
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,380
Yes.

510
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,420
Tell them

511
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,980
the last round doesn't count.

512
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,620
Look at this pond.

513
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,780
- How clear that water is.
- Yes.

514
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,820
Sixi, look at those fish.

515
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,020
It's golden.

516
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,420
I bet Magistrate Meng

517
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,620
likes this kind of carp.

518
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,820
Exactly, this is the carp

519
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,140
Magistrate Meng would like.

520
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,860
See that window?

521
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,900
A craftsman carved it by hand.

522
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,140
So beautiful.

523
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,100
And this wood...

524
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,420
Jinsi Nanwu wood. Smell it.

525
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,260
Fragrant.

526
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,180
Right?

527
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,060
Sixi,

528
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,900
this place

529
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,940
is so grand.

530
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,300
Keep your voice down.

531
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,340
If they hear,
they'll think we're bumpkins.

532
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,540
Don't worry, Sixi.

533
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,620
I will not let them know

534
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,620
we are bumpkins.

535
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,820
Don't put on that act.

536
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,740
I'm happy.

537
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,420
Is anyone here?

538
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,660
Anyone here?

539
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,700
Mingzhen.

540
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,540
Young Madam.

541
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,940
I brought my cousin

542
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,900
here to eat.

543
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,100
Recite for him what's on your menu.

544
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,300
All right.

545
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,580
Today's meat dishes are

546
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,060
Lubo meat, mandarin duck roast,

547
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,140
pan-dragon meat,

548
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,340
stir-fried prawns, frog legs,

549
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,100
- and braised pufferfish.
- Prawns.

550
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,580
Vegetables include braised shiitake,

551
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,460
stir-fried Huangcai,

552
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,260
- Gelidium amansii,
- Fewer vegetables.

553
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,460
- Enough.
- black fungus...

554
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,060
Then, just get a full set for him.

555
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,980
Okay.

556
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,900
Thank you.

557
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,700
What does "a full set" mean?

558
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,160
Make one portion of everything

559
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,880
she just listed.

560
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,340
I can't finish them all.

561
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,800
Then pack it to go

562
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,820
and take it to the shop.

563
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,380
I've arranged a place for you to stay.

564
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,540
Sixi, you're so kind.

565
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,140
Alright, wait here for the food.

566
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,140
I'm going out for a bit.

567
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,740
Where are you going? Aren't you eating?

568
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,420
I won't eat.

569
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,860
Things outside aren't so tense now.

570
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,780
I'll go scout around.

571
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,780
Sixi, be careful.

572
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,500
Wonderful.

573
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,380
(Taiping Government)

574
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,540
Three,

575
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,900
two,

576
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,300
one.

577
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,100
Time to go.

578
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,180
Bride.

579
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,100
Jia.

580
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,260
What do you need?

581
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,940
Taiping Government,

582
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,260
at your service.

583
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,800
I'm asking about something.

584
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,860
Come this way.

585
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,060
Sure. Let me, let me.

586
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,180
It's okay.

587
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,100
Thank you.

588
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,300
Tell me.

589
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,700
What do you want to know?

590
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,540
I...

591
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,900
You can trust me.

592
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,740
I take people's money
and ease their worries.

593
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,180
I will keep your secrets.

594
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,500
Yes, yes.

595
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,820
I want to know

596
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,140
what have you

597
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,340
been busy with lately?

598
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,540
Catching those

599
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,100
unmarried men and women.

600
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,540
Nothing else?

601
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,280
What do you mean?

602
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,580
You think we're not busy enough?

603
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,820
No, no, not at all.

604
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,620
I just thought...

605
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,380
I heard you mention
that you were catching

606
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,500
that one called

607
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,020
Jin Buhuan, right?

608
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,220
Jin Buhuan?

609
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,980
Yes, yes.

610
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,900
She's been caught.

611
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,660
How did you catch her?

612
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,180
She killed Landlord Song.

613
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,300
The prefecture takes it very seriously.

614
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,220
You...

615
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,020
Do you know who Landlord Song is?

616
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,780
Landlord Song is

617
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,740
Prefect Song's younger brother.

618
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,020
The Prefect has just taken office.

619
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,940
Which magistrate

620
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,340
would not want

621
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,460
to be credited

622
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,900
with catching Jin Buhuan?

623
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,500
Seven or eight people

624
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,260
in Anning Prefecture have been sent.

625
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,180
Seven or eight?

626
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,580
Someone must be

627
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,620
wrongly accused.

628
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,540
How many cases

629
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,820
aren't wrongful accusations

630
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,020
these days?

631
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,300
Besides,

632
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,380
those who can bear the infamy
of Jin Buhuan

633
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,580
are habitual criminals
full of evil deeds.

634
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,180
They're not wronged at all.

635
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,660
Why are you asking about this?

636
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,060
Do you

637
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,500
have a lead?

638
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,740
No, no.

639
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,540
I'd advise you, don't be nosy.

640
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,180
Alright.

641
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,660
Thanks, Jia.

642
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,980
I'll take my leave then.

643
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,420
Bye.

644
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,220
- How about lunch?
- No.

645
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,500
This is what a full set looks like.

646
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,660
I've never eaten
so many dishes in my life.

647
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,340
Look at those prawns.

648
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,860
So big.

649
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,900
Everyone is bullying me.

650
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,540
I waited for so long.

651
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,420
Delicious, delicious.

652
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,620
Who are you?

653
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,940
I...

654
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,340
I am my cousin's cousin.

655
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,780
Who is your cousin?

656
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,020
Ai Sixi.

657
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,340
Ai Sixi's cousin?

658
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,820
You know my cousin?

659
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,260
Then you must be a nanny here.

660
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,940
How can you say that?

661
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,140
As expected

662
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,220
of her family.

663
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,700
Since you're here,

664
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,620
let's eat together,

665
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:31,980
or the food will go cold.

666
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,220
I can't eat that much, either.

667
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,140
My goodness.

668
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,100
You really treat yourself as one of us.

669
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,380
Don't be so distant. Come on.

670
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,400
Do you have chopsticks?

671
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
If not, use mine. I can use my hands.

672
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,740
Go away.

673
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,460
- Chopsticks.
- Be my guest.

674
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,900
I'm eating now.

675
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,460
So delicious.

676
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,460
Minglian,

677
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,940
was the pigsty in our backyard

678
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,340
left open?

679
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,260
You even have a pigsty?

680
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,180
How clueless.

681
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,820
I'm talking about you.

682
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,060
What kind of upbringing is this,

683
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,300
eating like a piglet,

684
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,500
smacking your lips so hard?

685
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,780
Doesn't that prove the food is tasty?

686
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,420
It doesn't justify smacking like that.

687
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,460
So noisy.

688
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,220
Don't be angry.

689
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,520
There are chicken legs here.

690
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,020
Let's each have one.

691
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,500
No, no.

692
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,880
It's so dirty.

693
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,820
Did you wash your hands?

694
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,740
How can you grab it?

695
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,620
See? Just a bumpkin

696
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,820
like Ai Sixi.

697
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,740
Open your mouth.

698
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,620
- Milady.
- What's wrong with you?

699
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,780
Fine, you're bullying me.

700
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,380
I'll headbutt you to death!

701
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,820
- Milady.
- Dear.

702
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,680
Dear, what's wrong?

703
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,800
Dear, where were you hurt?

704
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,100
Are you all right?

705
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,020
The pearl...

706
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,980
The pearl.

707
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,940
Zhenzhu, does it hurt?

708
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,140
- The pearl...
- Zhenzhu.

709
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,980
Don't cry. It's okay.

710
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,400
It got into my head.

711
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,380
Who are you?

712
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,380
Why hit her?

713
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,220
I didn't hit her.

714
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,020
She said she'd headbutt herself.

715
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,500
How would I know? I knew nothing.

716
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,100
Don't go.

717
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,330
Call a physician.

718
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,420
Hurry up.

719
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,780
Physician, physician.

720
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,220
Don't touch me. It hurts.

721
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,140
Okay, I won't.

722
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,540
Where is it?

723
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,660
In my head.

724
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,740
In your head?

725
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,420
Let me lift it a bit, okay?

726
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,340
Get lost.

727
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,540
Sixi, you finally came back.

728
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,620
A nanny wanted
to headbutt herself to death.

729
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,640
Who was it?

730
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,580
Who?

731
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,180
The one with a loud,

732
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,500
strange voice.

733
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,660
Well.

734
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,580
Never mind.

735
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,940
There are lots of odd folks here.

736
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,980
Don't mind it, sit down.

737
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,300
- Listen.
- I was scared.

738
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,780
Go find someone

739
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,460
you trust.

740
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,540
Have them write a letter

741
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,040
and send it to the prefectural yamen,

742
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,380
saying that Landlord Song's death

743
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,020
was related

744
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,960
to the Sweet Couple Tea

745
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,660
he drank and had nothing to do

746
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,740
with Jin Buhuan.

747
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,860
Sixi,

748
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,780
didn't you say this can't be made clear?

749
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,220
Even so, we can't implicate

750
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,260
innocent people.

751
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,620
Who'd be implicated?

752
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,820
Seven or eight people.

753
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,340
Don't ask for details.

754
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,700
Sixi, shall I make you

755
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,860
some brown sugar water?

756
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,820
You're in so much pain.

757
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,900
Do it when you think of it.

758
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,460
Ask for it when you want it.

759
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,940
Sixi.

760
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,860
Look.

761
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,260
You're back.

762
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,220
Allow me to introduce.

763
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,700
This is Mr. Wise.

764
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,900
Isn't this your cousin?

765
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,660
You've met before?

766
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,140
You two went to my place, remember?

767
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,300
Right, right, I forgot.

768
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,540
He is Mr. Wise.

769
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,820
He is...

770
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,740
Kan.

771
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,580
Kan, I'll leave you two to chat.

772
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,220
I'll go make some brown sugar water.

773
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,820
- Sit.
- Sure.

774
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,460
What are you scheming now?

775
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,980
Nothing.

776
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,780
Where did you go today?

777
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,220
Nowhere special.

778
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,260
I tidied up

779
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,340
our shop a bit.

780
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,780
When your cousin returns,

781
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,660
I'll discuss with him

782
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,580
how to run it.

783
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,580
Yesterday, you owed me

784
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,820
4 taels, 3 qian, and 50 wen.

785
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,740
Did you record it?

786
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,300
Yes.

787
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,860
It's always about money.

788
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,300
How much do you owe me in total now?

789
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,420
A little over 50 taels.

790
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,260
What's wrong?

791
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,820
Only a little over 50 taels?

792
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,500
Are you sure?

793
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,660
Honey, honey.

794
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,180
What's wrong?

795
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,060
I'm leaving Anning Prefecture.

796
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,020
Honey, honey.

797
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,420
Where will you go?

798
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,700
I haven't decided.

799
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,180
Maybe Dali,

800
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,860
Turfan, or Suzhou.

801
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,180
Anywhere will do.

802
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,100
Honey, honey.

803
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,540
You can't earn money like that.

804
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,940
Why are you in such a hurry to go?

805
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,260
None of your business.

806
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,500
Why don't you

807
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,460
give me the 50 taels

808
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,820
you owe me, honey?

809
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,220
I have no money.

810
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,380
You have no money?

811
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,020
Yeah.

812
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,500
Since I returned,

813
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,140
when have you ever seen me make money?

814
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,700
With so much family property,

815
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,180
can't you spare some?

816
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,420
Where to spare from?

817
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,640
I'll sell my grandmother's cane

818
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,300
if I must.

819
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,220
If you have no money,

820
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,900
why sign the contract with me?

821
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,940
That's the exact reason

822
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,140
why I must open the shop.

823
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,540
Then I'll have money.

824
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,020
So, you're here tricking me

825
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,820
with no money?

826
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,900
Lower your voice.

827
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,660
Rest assured.

828
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,780
It'll be at most half a year.

829
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,820
You'll get all your money.

830
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,740
You...

831
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,140
What did I do?

832
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,260
Get out.

833
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,180
Fine.

834
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,060
This is my room.

835
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,020
Shall I leave?

836
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,940
I'll leave.

837
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,340
Sit down.

838
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,820
(Heavenly Feathers)

839
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,180
It hurts? Be gentler.

840
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
Come on.

841
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,260
Didn't you go

842
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,980
to embrace your new mother?

843
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,540
What, that mother didn't accept you?

844
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,500
Now, you know

845
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,740
the one who loves you most

846
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,580
is me, your own mother.

847
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,380
Then give me a shop.

848
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,260
Whoever gives me a shop

849
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,300
is my mother.

850
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,260
Shut up.

851
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,940
Your act is irritating.

852
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,020
So foolish.

853
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,580
Alright.

854
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,900
Listen to me.

855
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,820
In our branch,

856
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,100
every lamp we light

857
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,700
and every food we have

858
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,060
relies on these three shops.

859
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,420
Do you think I'm joking?

860
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,300
No, no, no.

861
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,820
If I lived to be bullied,

862
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,860
I'd better go die.

863
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,140
My dear.

864
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,780
You mustn't say such things.

865
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,980
Anyway, you can't headbutt the door.

866
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,740
Who said I headbutted the door?

867
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,860
I didn't headbutt the door.

868
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,660
I headbutted Ai Sixi's cousin.

869
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,100
So, Ai Sixi's cousin

870
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,020
is called Door?

871
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,580
What nonsense.

872
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,380
What did her cousin do to you?

873
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,660
He burned me with a chicken leg.

874
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,860
Where did he burn you, dear?

875
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,020
He burned my mouth.

876
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,140
Your mouth?

877
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,980
Wasn't he feeding you?

878
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,940
Who feeds like that?

879
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,700
You were wronged.

880
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,780
I don't care!

881
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,260
Bring him here.

882
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,500
I'll headbutt him to death!

883
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,700
No, no, no headbutting.

884
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,180
I'll headbutt him to death.

885
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,420
What are you standing for?

886
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,300
The young lady has been bullied.

887
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,820
Hurry and bring

888
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,220
that thing.

889
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,860
- Bring it.
- Bring the door.

890
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,860
- Yes.
- Hurry.

891
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,420
- A bumpkin.
- We'll stand up for you.

892
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,500
How dare he bully Zhenzhu?

893
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,780
Look how upset she is.

894
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,820
Zhenzhu, don't cry.

895
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,780
Zhenzhu.

896
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,380
What happened?

897
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,900
It's dislocated. Come on.

898
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,060
How did it happen?

899
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,060
Careful.

900
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,460
You scared me to death.

901
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,060
You mustn't get so worked up.

902
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,620
Zhenzhu.

903
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,740
Enough, don't cry like that.

904
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,100
- There, there.
- Shut up and cry.

905
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,020
There, there.

906
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,460
Yes, yes.

907
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:38,420
(Heavenly Feathers)

908
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,180
Hey.

909
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,460
Hey.

910
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,620
Hey.

911
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,740
I'm talking to you.

912
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,580
My name isn't hey.

913
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,420
I'm called Guiwei.

914
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,060
Come with me to Ms. Xue

915
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,940
to clear things up.

916
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,380
No, no, I'm cooking.

917
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,460
You're still in the mood

918
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,140
to cook here?

919
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,260
My cousin's period has come.

920
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,760
I'm making her brown sugar rice wine.

921
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,840
By the way,

922
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,340
do you know where the rice wine is?

923
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,660
You're asking me?

924
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,580
You...

925
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,660
What did you say your sister had?

926
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,060
My God.

927
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,580
Why does it hurt so much?

928
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,140
Is it because I'm poor?

929
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,660
So it hurts so much.

930
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,700
Sixi.

931
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,260
Grandmother.

932
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,740
Rest, rest.

933
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,580
- It's okay.
- Sit here.

934
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,740
At the North Port today,

935
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,220
I saw such a large fish maw.

936
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,660
I bought it right away

937
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,860
to have it cooked for you.

938
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,380
Eat it later.

939
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,700
Alright.

940
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,940
How is my great-grandson?

941
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,660
Your great-grandson

942
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,860
is doing well.

943
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,780
Grandmother.

944
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,820
You went shopping.

945
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,000
Why bother buying me fish maw?

946
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,500
Hot, hot, hot.

947
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,020
It burned.

948
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,540
Who is he?

949
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,380
This is my cousin.

950
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,060
He came to see me.

951
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,340
This is Grandmother, greet her.

952
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,660
Greetings, Grandmother.

953
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,980
Sixi, drink it while it's hot,

954
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,180
or your belly will hurt again.

955
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,580
Hurt?

956
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,400
Where hurts?

957
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,300
My sister's period came,
so her belly hurts.

958
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,540
What did you say? Out.

959
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,100
What are you laughing at?

960
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,540
I'm just laughing.

961
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,540
I'm pregnant.

962
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,940
How could my period have come?

963
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,620
Sixi, you're pregnant?

964
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,140
You and Qin Kan...

965
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,580
Aren't you two...

966
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,140
What's going on?

967
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,140
He's too young to understand.

968
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,660
It's a misunderstanding.

969
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,700
My Lady,

970
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,620
I think

971
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,180
it's better if we ask a physician

972
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,180
to take a look.

973
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,540
Just to be safe.

974
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,380
How considerate.

975
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,540
Please don't meddle.

976
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,100
Does it really not hurt?

977
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,980
Grandmother, I'm fine.

978
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,980
I just love this.

979
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,420
So good.

980
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,980
- Really?
- Yes.

981
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,140
Your belly doesn't hurt?

982
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,060
Not at all.

983
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,120
Do I look like I'm in pain?

984
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,820
Sixi,

985
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,620
your belly now

986
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,940
can't suffer the slightest accident.

987
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,960
I understand, Grandmother.

988
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,940
I understand.

989
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,860
Rest assured.

990
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,660
It's getting late.

991
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,100
You must return to rest.

992
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,420
Remember to eat the fish maw.

993
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,380
Take care.

994
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,140
Please help Grandmother back.

995
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,820
Goodbye, Grandmother.

996
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,020
Best to check.

997
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,940
Greetings, Grandmother.

998
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,580
I've invited the physician.

999
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,180
Grandmother,

1000
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,180
perhaps we shouldn't.

1001
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,700
Are you feeling guilty?

1002
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,860
Who's guilty?

1003
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,460
I just think it's unnecessary

1004
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,620
to waste the money.

1005
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,100
Sit down.

1006
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,740
The physician is here.

1007
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,100
To be safe,

1008
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,020
let him check on you.

1009
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,940
Exactly.

1010
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,780
Physician Zhou, hurry.

1011
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,340
Young Madam, please.

1012
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,380
Is my hand dark?

1013
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,340
Young Madam, what do you mean?

1014
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,940
- Sunburned.
- Ai Sixi.

1015
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,740
Come on.

1016
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,900
Are you afraid?

1017
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,260
Afraid of what?

1018
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,380
Then take out your hand.

1019
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,700
Shut up, you maid.

1020
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,760
Who are you calling a maid?

1021
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,420
So what if I said you're a maid?

1022
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,640
- Let's fight it out.
- You...

1023
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,140
Do you submit or not?

1024
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,700
- Submit or not?
- What are you doing?

1025
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,340
I submit, I submit.

1026
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,980
Come.

1027
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,380
Sit down.

1028
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,300
Sit first.

1029
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,540
Hold out your hand.

1030
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,220
Check.

1031
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,180
Not as fast as me.

1032
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,340
Grandmother, look at her.

1033
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,700
Isn't it obvious enough?

1034
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,340
- Exactly.
- Sixi.

1035
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,260
Everyone's here.

1036
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,700
Quiet.

1037
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,580
What's going on?

1038
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,540
My cousin is pregnant?

1039
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,460
Why didn't you tell me?

1040
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,660
What's the matter?

1041
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,740
The physician is checking
her pregnancy signs.

1042
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,060
She...

1043
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,820
She...

1044
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,060
She what?

1045
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,980
What about her?

1046
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,380
Her pregnancy signs are steady.

1047
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,180
The pulse is smooth,

1048
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,580
like pearls rolling on a jade plate.

1049
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,260
The child is very healthy.

1050
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,480
- Impossible!
- Impossible!

1051
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,020
So healthy?

1052
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,140
That's good.

1053
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,260
Physician, sit.

1054
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,180
Shall we prescribe
some stabilizing medicine?

1055
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,300
Medicine?

1056
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,420
Old Lady,

1057
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,620
normally,

1058
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,860
we'd prescribe some,

1059
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,500
but given Young Madam's condition,

1060
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,660
I think

1061
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,940
it's unnecessary.

1062
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,820
How did you manage it?

1063
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,980
Take a guess.

1064
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,460
I knew long ago you had a trick.

1065
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,860
What trick?

1066
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,380
It means...

1067
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,380
You had someone else's child.

1068
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,490
- Nonsense.
- Stop it.

1069
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,180
The physician said it.

1070
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,620
It's all thanks to this.

1071
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,060
Money?

1072
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,060
Everyone's here.

1073
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,740
Quiet.

1074
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,620
You'll pay.

1075
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
Mr. Jing,

1076
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,940
rest assured.

1077
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,820
With me here,

1078
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,500
this child can forever

1079
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,460
remain hidden.

1080
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,700
Then I'll take my time

1081
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,340
taking my revenge.

1082
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,500
I told you to be quiet.

1083
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,900
The child is sleepy.

1084
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,820
Yes, he's kicking me.

1085
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,740
Let's go to sleep.

1086
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,380
- Grandmother.
- When did you arrive?

1087
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,340
Good.
