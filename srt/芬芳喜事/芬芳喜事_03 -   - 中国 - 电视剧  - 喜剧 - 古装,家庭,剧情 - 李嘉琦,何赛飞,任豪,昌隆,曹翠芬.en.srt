So boring.

It's been some time now.

29

Things shouldn't be
so tense anymore, right?

30
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,420
Young Madam, hello.

31
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,180
So busy.

32
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,340
(Jing Residence)

33
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,220
Why has it been even more serious?

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,740
What are you doing?

35
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,340
You scared me.

36
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,420
Why do you, a maid, walk so quietly?

37
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,940
I'm not a maid.

38
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,780
Then why are you following me?

39
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,220
I'm not following you.

40
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,540
You appeared somewhere

41
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,100
you weren't supposed to appear.

42
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,260
How is the front gate

43
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,700
a place I shouldn't appear?

44
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,620
Let me correct you.

45
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,420
You didn't appear

46
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,220
where you should've appeared.

47
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,380
Fine.

48
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,660
Today, I want to hear

49
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,580
where I am supposed to appear.

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,740
How long do I have to kneel?

51
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,660
As the eldest grandson's wife,

52
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,780
you must kneel
for eight hours every day.

53
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,020
I'm a little thirsty.
Can you bring me a cup of water?

54
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,260
Say "please".

55
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,940
Bring me a cup of water, please.

56
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,260
Put "please" first.

57
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,940
Please, a cup of water.

58
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,860
You...

59
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,700
Do you ever stop?

60
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,500
What are you doing?

61
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,000
Who told you to stand up?

62
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,380
I'm looking at Grandfather's portrait.

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,780
That's Mr. Lu, the Sage of Tea.

64
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,380
Don't point and comment here.

65
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,260
Grandfather's gone.
Why hang Mr. Lu's portrait?

66
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,020
We're a family of tribute tea,

67
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,500
so surely we hang Mr. Lu's portrait.

68
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,740
Thank you.

69
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,060
Grandfather.

70
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,020
Tell me.

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,100
(Jing Zhenzhu, Jing Kan's cousin)
I just went

72
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,340
to Yangzhou for a hot spring trip.

73
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,580
How could you just leave me?

74
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,460
With you gone,

75
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,340
I don't want to live anymore.

76
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,060
Grandfather.

77
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,020
What is this?

78
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,460
Is this the ivory cup

79
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,660
you loved most in your life?

80
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,060
Every time I see it,

81
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,660
it makes me feel

82
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,180
as if you're beside me.

83
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,020
Please, Grandfather, allow me

84
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,620
to keep it with me.

85
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,180
Who is she?

86
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,740
Jing Zhenzhu, Jing Kan's cousin.

87
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,220
Come on. Can she do this?

88
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,900
She pockets it, and it's hers?

89
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,180
No, no.

90
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,860
Let's not talk about this.

91
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,340
We don't discuss these things.

92
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,820
By the way, Grandfather,

93
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,860
I've already moved

94
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,180
your Huanghuali

95
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,740
Wood Curved-Rest Armchair

96
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,580
to my study.

97
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,340
Why?

98
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,900
Because whenever I sit on it,

99
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,580
I remember

100
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,900
the days you taught me

101
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,860
to read and recognize characters.

102
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,580
Grandfather!

103
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,380
Grandfather!

104
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,100
Grandfather!

105
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,580
Before marrying Jing Kan,

106
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,380
I only wanted to see you.

107
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,620
But now,

108
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,260
I can only

109
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,540
take these

110
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,780
three golden wine cups with me.

111
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,100
Grandfather,

112
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,460
every time I drink,

113
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,340
I will remember you.

114
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,060
Grandfather!

115
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,900
Grandfather!

116
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,180
Sorry for being unfilial.

117
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,540
As for your Gold-Sprinkled

118
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,740
Sichuan Fan...

119
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,500
I...

120
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,140
I...

121
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,860
I will take this fan

122
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,020
with me.

123
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,620
Wait, who are you?

124
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,380
Nice to meet you.

125
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,700
I'm Jing Kan's wife, Ai Sixi.

126
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,620
What?

127
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,660
Grandfather!

128
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,380
Grandfather!

129
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,500
Grandfather!

130
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,310
I will also take your prayer beads.

131
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,180
Grandfather.

132
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,340
This cup holder, too.

133
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,180
Seeing this little thing,

134
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,220
I think of you.

135
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,460
Oh, my, stop it.

136
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,780
Grandfather!

137
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,000
Grandfather!

138
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,740
Grandfather!

139
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,940
Grandfather!

140
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,300
Grandfather!

141
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,980
Oh, my.

142
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,380
What's wrong with her?

143
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,580
To fight with Zhenzhu over items,

144
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,300
she's fainted
due to crying multiple times.

145
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
She?

146
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,300
That's enough.

147
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,260
Bring me a bowl
so I can drink some soup.

148
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,100
Say "please".

149
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,180
Please, bring me a bowl.

150
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,420
Good.

151
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,620
What about Zhenzhu?

152
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,900
She's exhausted.

153
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,980
Still in a coma due to crying.

154
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,900
By the way,

155
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,740
Muyun and Donglin said

156
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,900
that they wouldn't come.

157
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,580
Look at that.

158
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,140
So much better.

159
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,220
Eat up.

160
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,140
Alright.

161
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,260
Young Madam, you've cried enough.

162
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,820
Here, have a piece

163
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,900
of Young Master's favorite, ginger duck.

164
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,260
Sure.

165
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,060
I have to say,

166
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,900
the food here is really good.

167
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,660
Weren't you a cook before?

168
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,620
Your skill must be much better.

169
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,700
Of course.

170
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,820
You're so capable?

171
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,140
When we were at home,

172
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,900
Jing Kan often had me make

173
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,780
his favorite dish,

174
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,580
ginger duck.

175
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,740
My Lady,

176
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,500
I remember Kan

177
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,780
seems to never eat ginger.

178
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,380
What's wrong with you?

179
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,540
Even when Jing Kan caught a cold,

180
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,100
he never drank ginger soup.

181
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,260
My fault.

182
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,460
I had

183
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,820
little contact with Young Master.

184
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,260
Young Madam and Young Master

185
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,520
have lived together for so long.

186
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,500
Don't you know he doesn't eat ginger?

187
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,820
We were out there.

188
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,020
We weren't doing well,

189
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,380
so he wouldn't be picky.

190
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,620
Having food was good enough.

191
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,140
That's true.

192
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,820
Give her a few more pieces.

193
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,180
Mother,

194
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,460
who knows

195
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,060
when Jing Kan

196
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,100
will be back?

197
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,140
Should we

198
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,580
prepare some new clothes

199
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,660
for him?

200
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,780
How thoughtful of you.

201
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,460
Does Jing Kan prefer

202
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,060
silk or satin?

203
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,540
Old ones are fine.

204
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,460
Shoes must be new.

205
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,980
What size feet does Young Master have?

206
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,940
Same as before.

207
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,260
You've lived with Young Master

208
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,900
for a while now.

209
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,180
How come it feels

210
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,060
like you know nothing about him?

211
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,060
You've been

212
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,020
with him longer.

213
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,260
Why ask me then?

214
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,300
I'm asking you now.

215
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,180
My head aches.

216
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,100
Maybe I'll just go back to eat.

217
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,340
You all enjoy. I'll go to my room.

218
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,740
Stop.

219
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,660
As a married woman,

220
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,300
you know nothing

221
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,780
about your husband's daily life.

222
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,860
Weren't you a cook?

223
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,820
You said you cooked

224
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,260
for Jing Kan every day.

225
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,380
Then tell me. What does he like to eat?

226
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,500
Meat.

227
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,420
Wrong!

228
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,380
What does he like to drink?

229
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,220
Wine.

230
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,140
Wrong!

231
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,820
Does he like salty

232
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,740
or sweet and sour flavors?

233
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,720
- What?
- Wrong!

234
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,020
You claim

235
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,700
that you cooked for him every day,

236
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,980
but you don't even know this?

237
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,900
Tell me!

238
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,940
Who exactly are you?

239
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,020
Tell me!

240
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,380
Back at home,

241
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,100
Jing Kan wouldn't let me do

242
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,940
these things.

243
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,860
Why?

244
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,460
Why?

245
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,860
Why...

246
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,220
Because

247
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,740
I'm pregnant.

248
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,340
What did you say?

249
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,540
I said I'm pregnant.

250
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,020
We married because of the child.

251
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,580
What?

252
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,420
What did you say?

253
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,740
Grandmother, you heard it.

254
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,980
I'm pregnant.

255
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,220
Why didn't you say so earlier?

256
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,940
Jing Kan wouldn't let me.

257
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,300
Come on, sit.

258
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,940
No need.

259
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,140
Chair.

260
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,820
Dayou,

261
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,940
we have an heir now.

262
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,100
You can rest in peace.

263
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,940
Sixi...

264
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,500
She's now the treasure of our family.

265
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,020
Take care of her carefully.

266
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,220
No mistakes are allowed.

267
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,820
Yes.

268
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,620
Madam, calm down.

269
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,260
Now, I understand

270
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,900
what Jing Kan

271
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,500
has been up to.

272
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,980
It's just

273
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,740
an unborn child.

274
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,820
How about...?

275
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,820
Auntie.

276
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,100
Aji.

277
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,140
What's going on?

278
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,100
Young Master Aji is back.

279
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,500
Auntie, who upset you?

280
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,390
Tell me.

281
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,260
I'll stand up for you.

282
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,380
Earlier...

283
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,300
Get a cup of tea for Aji.

284
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,740
Sure.

285
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,020
Aji,

286
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,140
have a seat.

287
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,940
Why are you back so early?

288
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,900
Someone took Miss Hu

289
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,260
from Xiange Studio.

290
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,700
(Luo Aji, Luo Zhusi's nephew)

291
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,940
On my way back,

292
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,940
I bought your favorite pastries

293
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,100
from Yuxing Pastry.

294
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,580
Aji,

295
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,660
you're at the age

296
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,860
to learn your skills.

297
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,020
Focus more on serious matters.

298
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,580
As for places like Xiange Studio,

299
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,900
go as little as possible.

300
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,980
Is the money enough?

301
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,500
Yes.

302
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,820
It's enough.

303
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,340
I'll have Cuiying

304
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,740
give you a bit more.

305
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,700
Thank you, Auntie.

306
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,740
There's one more thing.

307
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,460
My mother's birthday

308
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,820
is coming next month.

309
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,100
I want to return to Zhoushan.

310
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,500
Alright.

311
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,980
You want to go to Zhoushan?

312
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,300
Yes.

313
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
It's Mother's birthday.

314
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,780
I must go.

315
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,740
Auntie.

316
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,700
What's wrong?

317
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,620
Are you unwell?

318
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,820
No.

319
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,180
I mean...

320
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,300
You...

321
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,860
On Madam's birthdays,

322
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,220
there's usually

323
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,340
no one...

324
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,260
Cuiying,

325
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,180
give Aji 30 taels of silver

326
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,300
and buy

327
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,780
a few pieces of jewelry,

328
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,220
so Aji

329
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,300
can bring them back to my sister-in-law.

330
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,260
No need, Auntie.

331
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,220
It's necessary.

332
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,100
Your mother's birthday

333
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,820
is important.

334
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,100
Buy a few things she likes

335
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,340
to make her happy.

336
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,820
Thank you

337
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,740
on behalf of my mother.

338
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,620
Remember to eat

339
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,540
these pastries.

340
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,900
I'll go back to my room.

341
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,580
Go.

342
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,540
Read some books.

343
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,420
Madam.

344
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,620
When have you ever eaten

345
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,940
these lard pastries?

346
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,500
Why not just tell him?

347
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,140
His thinking of me

348
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,460
is enough.

349
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,940
Why bother?

350
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,340
I have nothing to make up for him,

351
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,020
so

352
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,100
Jinyu Tea

353
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,340
must belong to Aji.

354
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,140
(Lin Donglin, Jing Zhenzhu's husband)

355
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,060
Mother,

356
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,260
Jing Kan really came back?

357
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,420
Of course.

358
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,260
With the Old Master gone,

359
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,940
leaving such a huge family fortune,

360
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,660
how could he not return?

361
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,660
This ungrateful brat.

362
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,880
He could've returned earlier or later,

363
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,580
but he returned at this moment.

364
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,940
What impeccable timing.

365
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,060
Yes.

366
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,740
And he brought along

367
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,180
a simple, rustic girl,

368
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,140
saying she's his wife.

369
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,660
The most infuriating part is

370
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,380
that Grandmother didn't oppose it.

371
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,740
What's there to oppose?

372
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,940
Jing Kan came back

373
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,420
with a helper.

374
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,620
How could she oppose?

375
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,180
It suits her perfectly.

376
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,460
Good news.

377
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,340
Good news!

378
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,860
What's good? What's wrong with you?

379
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,740
Now, there's another Jing.
What's so great?

380
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,660
Think of it this way.

381
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,100
Jing Kan must've been called back
by Grandmother.

382
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,980
They want to have
a little competition with Auntie.

383
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,100
Now, at least someone in the house

384
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,260
can balance Auntie.

385
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,340
Yes, that's right.

386
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,420
But so what

387
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,380
if they win?

388
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,980
We'll still get nothing.

389
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,260
Mother,

390
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,220
look further ahead.

391
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,500
What?

392
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,220
Are you saying I'm short-sighted?

393
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,660
No, no, I don't mean that.

394
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,180
I mean,

395
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,380
over the years,

396
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,660
we've been suppressed

397
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,420
by the second branch.

398
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,900
Auntie is just the Deputy Chief now.

399
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,860
One day, if she becomes the Chief,

400
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,340
the consequences will be unimaginable.

401
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,540
That's true.

402
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,180
But if Jing Kan rises,

403
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,220
he'll have Grandmother's support.

404
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,780
Can we win then?

405
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,780
Let them fight.

406
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,020
Drive a wedge between them,

407
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,900
so we can

408
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,300
reap the benefits.

409
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,180
Zhenzhu is right.

410
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,940
I agree.

411
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,180
Let them fight.

412
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,620
We stay out of it.

413
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,140
We can't.

414
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,740
We need to set the arena

415
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,220
so they can have

416
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,700
a good fight.

417
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,180
Yes.

418
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,300
The more chaotic,

419
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,380
the better.

420
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,420
Exactly.

421
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,340
We just need to be

422
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,980
the trouble-maker

423
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,380
and stir

424
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,380
things up.

425
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,420
Alright, Madam.

426
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,460
Keep your voice down.

427
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,540
Be careful.

428
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,140
We mustn't let anyone hear

429
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,180
our careful plan.

430
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,100
Yes, yes.

431
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,820
(Jing Residence)

432
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,620
How are you?

433
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,540
Grandmother.

434
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,700
- Grandmother.
- Careful.

435
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,740
Don't worry about me.

436
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,660
Sit down.

437
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,380
I'm fine.

438
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,300
Look how much I've eaten today.

439
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,900
Good, eat more.

440
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,780
You might not feel it yet.

441
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,820
How nice.

442
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,740
My Lady.

443
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,860
The chicken soup is ready.

444
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,180
Why are you so flustered?

445
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,820
No, I'm not.

446
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,380
Come on, come.

447
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,980
Drink.

448
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,900
Thank you, Grandmother.

449
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,540
So good.

450
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,020
It tastes strange.

451
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,780
Well.

452
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,620
Isn't it just ordinary chicken soup?

453
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,940
No, it's different.

454
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,780
Try it.

455
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,140
I won't drink. I won't.

456
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,340
Please, taste it.

457
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,740
I really won't.

458
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,340
If you like it,

459
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,980
I'll have them make it
for you every day.

460
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,620
Sure, thank you.

461
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,020
What's wrong?

462
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,780
My stomach hurts a bit.

463
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,140
It's nothing, Grandmother.

464
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,060
I just ate a bit too much today.

465
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,700
I'll go to the privy, and I'll be fine.

466
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,660
Listen.

467
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,080
The first three months are crucial.

468
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,740
You must be careful.

469
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,940
Don't worry, Grandmother.

470
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,100
I'm full of energy now.

471
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,780
I could punch a cow to death.

472
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,860
Why punch a cow?

473
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,820
You need to do good things

474
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
to protect the child

475
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,700
in your belly.

476
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,940
Okay, Grandmother, got it.

477
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,220
I'm off to the privy.

478
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,520
Go on. Be careful.

479
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,820
Leave some chicken soup for me.

480
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,700
Two more bowls later.

481
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,620
It's delicious.

482
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,780
This child brings so much joy.

483
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,860
The more I see her, the more I like her.

484
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,540
Oh, right.

485
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,460
Tonight,

486
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,180
make her the bird's nest

487
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,180
and shark fin soup.

488
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,220
Half a sheep, half a sow.

489
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,220
Can she finish all that?

490
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,020
Does it matter?

491
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,260
If she wants it, she gets it.

492
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,220
Oh, right.

493
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,540
Prepare a few

494
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,580
loose-fitting clothes.

495
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,900
Don't squeeze her belly.

496
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,780
Understand?

497
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,700
Yes.

498
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,740
Are you sure you saw her drink it?

499
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,500
What are you doing?

500
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,140
Go get to work.

501
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,780
Strolling around.

502
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,300
Are you sure

503
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,780
you saw her drink it?

504
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,620
She drank several large bowls.

505
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,740
Besides a few privy trips

506
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,740
and a couple of burps,

507
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,100
no other reactions.

508
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,740
Added enough safflower to the soup?

509
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,060
Plenty.

510
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,620
The soup was golden.

511
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,900
Adding more would give it away.

512
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,620
Strange.

513
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,980
Did you get the safflower

514
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,180
from Physician Zhou?

515
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,500
Why do I have to change into this?

516
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,020
The Old Lady is worried

517
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,280
about you squeezing your belly.

518
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,180
Isn't this the kind of clothing
you usually wear?

519
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,460
What do you mean?

520
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,220
I don't dress the same as them.

521
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,220
Can't you see?

522
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,860
Am I wearing it?

523
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,500
Why aren't you wearing it?

524
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,760
They didn't ask you to wear it?

525
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,140
I...

526
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,180
Just do what I say.

527
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,340
As for how it looks,

528
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,820
it has nothing to do with the clothes.

529
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,060
What matters is the aura.

530
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,460
Aura?

531
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,100
If it's been three months,

532
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,060
it should be about this size.

533
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,460
Ai Sixi.

534
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,820
Why have you come back?

535
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,220
You're truly shameless.

536
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,620
If I hadn't heard from others

537
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,060
that my family got a new young madam,

538
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,180
I would never have imagined
you could have

539
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,620
such thick skin.

540
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,420
Weren't you absolutely certain

541
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,980
that you wouldn't come back?

542
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,820
Had I known you were

543
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,340
such a brazen, shameless woman,

544
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,700
I never would've married you.

545
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,020
Come with me.

546
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,100
No, no, no.

547
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,500
No, I can't go.

548
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,740
I don't know how to explain it.

549
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,620
Calm down.

550
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,720
Let's sit and talk it out.

551
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,640
Talk my foot.

552
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,220
I'm taking you to the authorities now

553
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,900
to settle this.

554
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,180
I'll divorce you.

555
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,960
No, no.

556
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,020
Gentleman, great gentleman.

557
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,540
Noble gentleman... No!

558
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,420
I beg you!

559
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,700
You've ruined

560
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,080
my pride

561
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,020
and my mother's honor.

562
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,900
Yes, yes.

563
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,460
Do you have to drive away your wife

564
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,780
in front of your mother?

565
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,740
Mother.

566
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,980
(Composed in spring, Geng Chen Year)

567
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,780
Fine, got it.

568
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,740
(Intoxicating Spring)
I'll leave

569
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,060
after your grandfather's funeral.

570
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,060
I'll see him off,

571
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,260
so this period of fate with him

572
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,500
won't have been in vain.

573
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,860
When my mother was alive,

574
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,980
she often studied with me
under this grape arbor.

575
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,060
I can't believe five years

576
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,480
have already passed.

577
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,380
Is your target

578
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,860
Luo Zhusi?

579
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,660
How do you know?

580
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,660
Is it Luo Zhusi

581
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,020
who killed your mother?

582
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,860
How do you know?

583
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,260
I'm desperate.

584
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,620
I'm not stupid.

585
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,860
I can see it.

586
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,660
Why do you seem to have a grudge

587
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,060
against your entire family?

588
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,880
My mother gave everything

589
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,600
to this family,

590
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,520
but she couldn't even enter

591
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,040
the ancestral tombs or the clan hall.

592
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,200
Do they deserve my mother?

593
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,100
Sorry.

594
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,020
It's okay.

595
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,900
I don't understand one thing.

596
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,580
If you want revenge,

597
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,060
why leave home?

598
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,980
Shouldn't you stay,
inherit the family business,

599
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,020
and kick Luo Zhusi out?

600
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,780
I don't care about the family business.

601
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,220
When my mother died,

602
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,940
they were all accomplices.

603
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,820
As expected of you.

604
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,340
You never get along with anyone.

605
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,940
Tomorrow is Grandfather's funeral,

606
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,980
also the day Luo Zhusi dies.

607
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,540
You're going to act tomorrow?

608
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,740
I'll chop her head

609
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,980
and stab her stomach.

610
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,500
If you want to kill her,

611
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,060
shouldn't you slit her throat?

612
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,060
You don't get it.

613
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,620
Killing isn't as simple

614
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,540
as you imagine.

615
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,980
Then

616
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,580
how difficult is it?

617
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,300
I've been practicing

618
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,220
chopping and stabbing,

619
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,900
not slitting.

620
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,620
I'm not familiar with that.

621
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,260
You're not afraid to act, are you?

622
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,540
Of course not.

623
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,940
I practiced by Shigui Lake

624
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,020
for a whole year.

625
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,020
I don't know how many bones I broke

626
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,540
and how much flesh I tore.

627
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,620
It's all for this day.

628
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,340
- Flesh?
- Yes, pork belly.

629
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,020
Even some tenderloin inside.

630
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,380
So diligent.

631
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,980
Anyway, whatever happens,

632
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,320
I don't want to get involved

633
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,240
in your family matters.

634
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,540
Just don't drag me into it.

635
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,380
Fine.

636
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,540
Luo Zhusi,

637
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,700
I'll make sure you don't see
the sun tomorrow.

638
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,260
But at the funeral,

639
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,620
won't the sun already have risen?

640
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,620
You talk too much.

641
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,260
Fine.

642
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,620
Luo Zhusi,

643
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,100
I'll make sure you don't see

644
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,300
the sun the day after tomorrow.

645
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,180
(Mourning)

646
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,380
We'll remember

647
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,340
his laughter,

648
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,060
ambitions,

649
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,900
joys, and passions.

650
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,580
We shall part today...

651
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,780
Hey,

652
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,500
aren't you being too obvious?

653
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:34,220
The honorable elder that we admire,

654
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,100
Jing Dayou,

655
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,620
has left us.

656
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,540
I'm going.

657
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,340
Leaving all of us

658
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,620
heartbroken.

659
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,060
Now is the best time to kill her.

660
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,980
Go.

661
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,300
This morning...

662
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,060
Go.

663
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,980
Don't rush me.

664
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,380
If you don't go,

665
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,300
she'll come back.

666
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,020
Sixi, maybe

667
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,340
I should wait and kill her

668
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,260
on our way back.

669
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,140
Can you do it?

670
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,420
Yesterday, you were all fired up,

671
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,940
pork belly and everything.

672
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,580
Are you chicken now?

673
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,460
Look, she's back.

674
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,140
Eldest grandson Jing Kan,

675
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,700
please place the coffin.

676
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,980
Jing Kan.

677
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,900
Why are you carrying a knife

678
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,820
at your grandfather's funeral?

679
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,700
Young Master,

680
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,500
do you know that bringing a blade

681
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,460
to a funeral is ominous?

682
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,380
You're making the Old Master

683
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,700
die without peace!

684
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,980
You...

685
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,260
Jing Kan, what's going on?

686
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,260
I...

687
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,980
Jing Kan

688
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,220
is just protecting himself.

689
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,580
What?

690
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,620
At this funeral,

691
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,380
someone is out to get him.

692
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,660
Sixi,

693
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,700
what do you mean by that?

694
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,520
Grandmother, don't panic.

695
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,740
When Jing Kan lifts the coffin later,

696
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,700
if nothing goes wrong,

697
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,460
this rope will snap.

698
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,420
What?

699
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,820
Not only will the hemp rope break,

700
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,940
but when Jing Kan

701
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,500
shovels soil here,

702
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,260
if he applies even a little force,

703
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,460
the handle of the shovel will snap.

704
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,420
Then, when he lights the incense,

705
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,420
he'll find the incense

706
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,860
won't light no matter what he does.

707
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,620
At that moment, this man will shout,

708
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,940
"Perhaps the Old Master"

709
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,020
"doesn't want Jing Kan back!"

710
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,540
Immediately after, he'll shout,

711
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,380
"Changing a surname is rebellious!"

712
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,660
No, no.

713
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,540
When Jing Kan offers tea here,

714
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,020
this man will conveniently

715
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,220
stick out a foot

716
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,140
and trip Jing Kan, making him fall.

717
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,340
And right here,

718
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,300
there's a blood pouch made
from an animal's pancreas.

719
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,940
At that moment,

720
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,380
the man will shout at once,

721
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,580
"Our family cannot accommodate him!"

722
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,780
What? You...

723
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,180
How do you know all this?

724
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,620
You admit it?

725
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,700
Of course.

726
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,540
If you

727
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,900
don't believe me,

728
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,860
then please,

729
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,900
light these incense sticks yourself.

730
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,780
You're trying to frame me?

731
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,180
Listen.

732
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,860
You won't be able to frame our madam.

733
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,500
She doesn't know anything.

734
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,340
If she doesn't know, do you know?

735
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,900
I...I don't know.

736
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,060
Grandmother, sorry.

737
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,540
Alright, Sixi.

738
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,460
Enough.

739
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,580
Everyone, lend a hand

740
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,380
and lay the Old Master to rest.

741
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,540
Yes, yes.

742
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,740
Lay him to rest.

743
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,580
(Veneration of Ancestors)

744
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,820
Now that the Old Master

745
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,500
is laid to rest,

746
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,860
one worry of mine is gone.

747
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,660
(Spirit Tablet of Jing Dayou,
Late Husband)

748
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,900
Sixty years ago,

749
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,100
the Old Master founded Jinyu Tea.

750
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,420
To outsiders, Jinyu Tea

751
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,100
is our family's glory.

752
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,020
To me, it's a mix

753
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,700
of fortune and disaster.

754
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,100
Not to mention the sealed shops,

755
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,100
and the debts...

756
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,620
Of my two sons,

757
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,620
one died in the shop,

758
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,260
and one was ruined by the goods.

759
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,180
If I could choose,

760
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,820
I'd rather our family

761
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,180
be ordinary people.

762
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,660
When people die,

763
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,100
they can be buried peacefully,

764
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,940
free from inner strife

765
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,340
or those

766
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,860
who think themselves clever

767
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,780
and line their own pockets.

768
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,100
I won't say more.

769
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,060
I've sent invitations

770
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,420
to all the local gentry

771
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,940
and clan members.

772
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,180
The day after tomorrow,
there will be a clan meeting

773
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,620
to discuss the new Chief of Jinyu Tea,

774
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,460
so everyone can witness it.

775
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,900
The new Chief must be someone

776
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,220
with integrity,

777
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,820
good character,

778
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,540
and courage to take responsibility.

779
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,460
Does everyone agree?

780
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,340
Mother, I agree.

781
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,420
I agree.

782
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,300
That's me.

783
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,700
- No objections? Good.
- How so?

784
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,820
Go away.

785
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,420
Muyun will handle

786
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,180
the clan meeting.

787
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,260
Me alone?

788
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,340
A bit sudden, isn't it?

789
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,620
Sudden?

790
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,900
The funeral was more sudden,

791
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,580
but Zhusi handled it

792
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,300
so well alone.

793
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,940
Of course,

794
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,740
aside from minor accidents.

795
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,500
It's my fault.

796
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,580
Please, punish me.

797
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,100
You're just tired.

798
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,700
Everyone makes mistakes.

799
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,460
You're my daughter-in-law

800
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,420
and the Deputy Chief of Jinyu Tea.

801
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,500
Since your father-in-law passed,

802
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,940
you've been busy

803
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,860
inside and out.

804
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,420
Thank you.

805
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,700
Now,

806
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,620
you can finally rest.

807
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,780
Jing Kan,

808
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,700
I know you want to leave,

809
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,220
but Sixi just got pregnant.

810
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,140
You shouldn't wander

811
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,780
outside.

812
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,860
Just stay at home.

813
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,260
I won't.

814
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,020
Thank you, Grandmother.

815
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,420
I'm not in the best condition,

816
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,340
so I won't kneel.

817
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,540
Jing Kan,

818
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,060
stand up.

819
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,860
Alright.

820
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,380
That's it.

821
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,540
I'm useless.

822
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,540
Mother,

823
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,620
I've failed you.

824
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,420
Even with such a perfect chance today,

825
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,620
I couldn't kill her.

826
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,940
I've been deceiving myself.

827
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,180
I'm the coward.

828
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,060
Killer?

829
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,380
Revenge?

830
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,660
It's easy

831
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,780
to talk about killing,

832
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,780
but doing it is not so simple.

833
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,900
Now, I understand you.

834
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,900
You're too kind and not ruthless enough.

835
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,220
Maybe it's best to abandon revenge.

836
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,180
But my mother's grudge...

837
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,040
Revenge isn't only done one way.

838
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,140
If you live better than her

839
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,320
and earn more money than her,

840
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
that's also revenge.

841
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,580
Fine.

842
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,700
When I go out,

843
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,780
I'll work hard and earn money
to get my revenge.

844
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,260
Come on.

845
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,020
What's wrong with you?

846
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,740
Didn't your grandmother say today

847
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,980
about holding a clan meeting

848
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,540
to decide who will be the Chief?

849
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,020
A family

850
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,540
fighting to the death

851
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,820
over the Chief title.

852
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,700
It's pathetic.

853
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,940
But from what I saw,

854
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,380
your grandmother probably intends

855
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,500
to pass the position to you.

856
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,100
Really?

857
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,340
I don't care.

858
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,600
Where does your phony pride

859
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,840
come from?

860
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,300
You ignore a shortcut

861
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,500
and take the long way instead.

862
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,100
You don't want to avenge your mother?

863
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,300
Of course, I want revenge.

864
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,220
Good.

865
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,660
Do you know

866
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,860
the cruelest way
to take revenge on someone?

867
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,940
Tell me.

868
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,180
It's to take away

869
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,300
what she loves the most.

870
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,620
So you want me

871
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,380
to be the Chief

872
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,180
and make Luo Zhusi miserable?

873
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,140
Congrats on your epiphany.

874
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,540
It's a perfect chance.

875
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,020
Alright.

876
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,500
There isn't

877
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,900
a better revenge plan.

878
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,420
And at home,

879
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,620
food is better.

880
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,500
Congratulations, Young Master,

881
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,420
you've figured it out.

882
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,020
So, when will you leave?

883
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,380
I just gave you the idea,

884
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,700
and now you want to kick me out?

885
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,620
If it weren't for me today,

886
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,500
do you know how many times
you would've died?

887
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,860
Oh, right.

888
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,380
How did you know

889
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,300
about all this?

890
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,220
Do you know

891
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,520
- why I called you here?
- Good.

892
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,240
This maid outfit
is actually comfortable.

893
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,020
Each of you was carefully chosen by me.

894
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,620
Before leaving,
did you lock all the doors tight?

895
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

896
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,220
Sand down the rope

897
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,380
Jing Kan will pull tomorrow.

898
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,700
Make sure no one notices.

899
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,260
Take the shovel and saw off half.

900
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,340
Sure.

901
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,620
For tomorrow's paper burning,

902
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,700
sprinkle more water.

903
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,120
You two,

904
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,620
- go prepare the blood pouch.
- Sure.

905
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,020
- Got it?
- Yes.

906
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,540
Afterwards, lock the doors tight.

907
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,220
No leaks are allowed.

908
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,580
You were all carefully chosen by me.

909
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,180
Don't disappoint me.

910
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,420
- Got it?
- Yes.

911
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,460
That's how I knew it.

912
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,180
So simple?

913
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,100
So simple.

914
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,620
So, the best disguise

915
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,140
is an ordinary appearance.

916
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,220
That's right...?

917
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,180
No.

918
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,380
I mean,

919
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,700
luckily, you were here today.

920
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,140
Are you still kicking me out?

921
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,700
You can stay.

922
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,540
Agree to one condition.

923
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,340
What condition?

924
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,020
Earlier, I insisted on leaving.

925
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,940
I was determined.

926
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,940
So, staying now feels so awkward.

927
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,900
You have to act out a scene with me.

928
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,860
A scene?

929
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,260
I hold my bundle

930
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,540
and insist on leaving,

931
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,660
and you insist on staying,

932
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,020
clinging to my leg

933
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,580
so I can't pull away,

934
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,100
however hard I scold you.

935
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,620
Then,

936
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,260
through your crying

937
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,180
and throwing tantrums,

938
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,100
I'm forced,

939
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,780
reluctantly,

940
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,340
finally,

941
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,100
to stay.

942
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,860
You'll save face that way?

943
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,740
Exactly.

944
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,260
You don't stand on ceremony at all.

945
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,560
Neither do you.

946
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,940
What?

947
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,340
What?
