00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Fairy hall?

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,880
You're not dead.

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,880
You're still alive.

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
But I had to waste some time.

34
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,880

Are you sure?

Master Xuan Wei Ming is too confident.

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
You wanted to kill me?

50
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
What do you think?

51
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
Why?

What's this?

101
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Flower.

102
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
I know you're flower.

103
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
Why are you talking about flowers again?

104
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,300
I'm tired.

105
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
I want to get along with you in another way.

106
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,300
I'm tired.

107
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
To be good friends again.

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,300
So you're going to have aoss directing a case against each other?

109
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,300
That's right.

we're doomed,

114
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
we have no place to stand.

115
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,300
You're so lonely,

116
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,300
I'm sure you're happier than me.

117
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Are you happy?

118
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
Of course I'm not.

119
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
What are you going to do?

120
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,300
I have a way.

121
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,300
But you have to listen to me.

122
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,300
I'll listen to you as long as I can.

123
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,300
I'm sorry.

124
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300

I'm sorry.

128
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,300
I'll never part with you.

129
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,300
I'll cover your face.

130
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,300
I'm sorry.

131
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
Ah Yoon.

132
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
Ah Yoon.

133
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,300
Ah Yoon.

134
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,300
You're so sad.

135
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,300
I'm sorry.

136
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,300
You're awake.

137
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Why are you panicking?

138
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,300
If I wanted to kill you,

139
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,300
you were in a coma.

140
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,300
I would have done it when you were in a coma.

141
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Why are you waiting for me?

142
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
The sky is the ancient god.

143
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
It's powerful.

144
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,300
You used your blood to make the sky

145
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,300
clear and clear.

146
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,300
Then I sent you here.

147
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,300
When we first entered the world,

148
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,300
we were in Songhe County.

149
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,300
We didn't leave for a few days.

150
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,300
When we came back to Songhe County to catch Hong Lian,

151
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,300
I thought you would confess to me.

152
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,300
But I didn't expect you to take back the tree of fire

153
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
on purpose.

154
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,300
For today's sky.

155
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,300
You mean...

156
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
you know it all along?

157
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
Ah Yoon.

158
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
I told you.

159
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,300
I won't admit my mistake.

160
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,300
I know you've always been you.

161
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,300
You've always been.

162
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,300
I've tried everything in the past.

163
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,300
But I only gave you a chance to confess to me.

164
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,300
Do you think I'll believe you?

165
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,300
I was hurt by the arrow.

166
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,300
Then you took me and took me.

167
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,300
You saved my life and saved my life.

168
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,300
You made me use the sky seal.

169
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,300
You used the sky seal to cure my life.

170
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
Ah Yoon.

171
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,300
Have you ever thought about

172
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,300
why you did everything so smoothly?

173
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
I've never thought about it.

174
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,300
Did you do it all by yourself?

175
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,300
It's because I'm with you.

176
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,300
When you used the sky seal to cure me,

177
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,300
didn't you think about it completely?

178
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,300
I can't let go of you.

179
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,300
I want you to be my shield.

180
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,300
I want you to be my shield.

181
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,300
I want you to be my shield.

182
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,300
I'm the sky seal.

183
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,300
I'm the sky seal.

184
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,300
I'm the sky seal.

185
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,300
Ah Yoon.

186
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,300
You said you'd do anything for us.

187
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,300
You said you'd do anything for us.

188
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,300
You said you'd do anything for us.

189
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,300
It's like you've been gone for more than 400 years.

190
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,300
The sky is so beautiful.

191
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,300
The sky is so beautiful.

192
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Father, is this where you're going to work?

193
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
It's so beautiful.

194
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
Yes, it's here.

195
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,300
Chul, do you remember how I told you

196
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,300
before I came here?

197
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
It's a huge distance.

198
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
I can't run around.

199
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
I can't follow you.

200
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,300
Chul, you're so weird.

201
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Let's go.

202
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,300
Who are you looking for?

203
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,300
I'm looking for the Stewardess.

204
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
Wait a minute.

205
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,300
You're...

206
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
Stewardess.

207
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
I'm Meng Qi.

208
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
I'm here to paint lanterns for the manor.

209
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,300
This is the recommendation letter from Mr. Liu.

210
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Come in.

211
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Thank you.

212
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Let's go.

213
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,300
My master is a good man.

214
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
He's kind and kind to his servants.

215
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,300
You'll know when you get there.

216
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
Yes.

217
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,300
You're really lucky to be here.

218
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
Yes.

219
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,300
Mr. Liu told us everything.

220
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
Only a few things.

221
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
There aren't many people here.

222
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,300
You just have to do your job.

223
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
Don't do anything else.

224
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
Don't ask anything else except your job.

225
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,300
Okay.

226
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,300
Especially, don't let him go to the master's yard.

227
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,300
Meng Qi, did you hear that?

228
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
Yes.

229
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,300
You saved my granddaughter's life.

230
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,300
I'm just grateful to you for giving her a good life.

231
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,300
Come back.

232
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,300
Manager Wu.

233
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,300
Yang Cao, what's the matter?

234
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
I came to give you a good life.

235
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
You gave me the medicine.

236
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,300
You saved my granddaughter's life.

237
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:38,300
You don't know that Dr. Zhu and Dr. Zhang

238
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,300
of the Chun Chun Hall saved me.

239
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,300
But after you gave me the medicine, I was so happy.

240
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,300
My granddaughter was gone for a few days.

241
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
She was so happy to eat and drink.

242
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
You were so happy to live.

243
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,300
Isn't this the medicine?

244
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
What medicine?

245
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,300
Don't go out and talk.

246
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,300
Let the others come to our door and ask for medicine.

247
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Let them know.

248
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,300
Be careful.

249
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Go out.

250
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
I understand.

251
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
You're out of the room.

252
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,300
You've been gone for a few days.

253
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,300
You don't know when you'll be back.

254
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,300
Besides, she doesn't like these.

255
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,300
If you really want to live,

256
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,300
you can live in the yard.

257
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,300
Yes.

258
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,300
Thank you, Manager Wu.

259
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
Let's go.

260
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,300
Madam, you saved my life.

261
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,300
Thank you, madam.

262
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
You saved my granddaughter.

263
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,300
Thank you, madam.

264
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
Meng Chi.

265
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,300
Meng Chi.

266
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,300
Madam.

267
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Thank you, madam.

268
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,300
Don't run away.

269
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,300
Okay.

270
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,300
Dog.

271
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,300
Dog.

272
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Don't run away.

273
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,300
Come here.

274
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
Don't run away.

275
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
Come here.

276
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,300
I'll feed you a bone.

277
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,300
I'll feed you a bone.

278
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,300
I'll feed you a bone.

279
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,300
I'll feed you a bone.

280
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,300
Thank you, madam.

281
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,900

you like so many

288
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,840
Im so droped

289
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,840
If you don't want to get married, you have to follow the rules of the mortal world.

290
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,840
You can't use the magic to interfere with the cause of the mortal world.

291
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,840
If I don't go out to earn some money, how can I raise this family?

292
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,840
You also know that some people

293
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,840
give the beggars some money and give the servants some money.

294
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,840
If you continue like this,

295
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,840
I think this family will be empty sooner or later.

296
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
You already know?

297
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,840
Who else can you hide from?

298
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,840
You've met Yang Sao's granddaughter.

299
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,840
She's smart and cute.

300
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,840
If she really dies like this, how can she be so kind?

301
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,840
But you have to know that there are many things that are born with no end.

302
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,840
There are certain rules that you have to follow.

303
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,840
Why do you have to let yourself into the Qing Empire for them?

304
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
You're making a big excuse.

305
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,840
To be honest, aren't you afraid that the people of the mortal world

306
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,840
will be the one who will lead the mortal world?

307
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,840
You know that.

308
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,840
We're here to make a living.

309
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,840
We're not here to help you.

310
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,840
Don't blame me for not saying anything.

311
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
If you really are the one who leads the mortal world,

312
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,840
I can't help you.

313
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,840
I know.

314
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Well,

315
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,840
I came to the mansion today to see a new kid.

316
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
He's so cute.

317
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,840
I even became a puppy and scared him to death.

318
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,840
You think that kid is so cute?

319
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,840
I'm not a puppy.

320
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,840
I'm just a puppy.

321
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,840
You think that kid is so cute?

322
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Why don't we have one too?

323
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
Maybe after having a kid,

324
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
we can have a good ending.

325
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
You like kids so much?

326
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,840
You don't like them?

327
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
I'm not interested.

328
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,840
I'll go get some tea.

329
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,840
I'll go get some tea.

330
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,840
You came to see me

331
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,840
just to ask about the kid?

332
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Yes.

333
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,840
I think I should

334
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
forget about it.

335
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Why?

336
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
Why?

337
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,840
The god wants the kid to be a good kid.

338
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,840
You're going to be a good kid

339
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,840
when you're with the god.

340
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,840
You'll be more weak when you're with the god.

341
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
So,

342
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
I'm afraid that

343
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,840
it's going to be harder for me.

344
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
It hurts.

345
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,840
You're so stupid.

346
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
Big sister.

347
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Big sister.

348
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
Big sister.

349
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Give me the dragon.

350
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
Here you are.

351
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
What kind of fruit is this?

352
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
It looks amazing.

353
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,840
My dad said that it's a black-and-white fruit.

354
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,840
It's called black-and-white fruit.

355
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
It's black and oily.

356
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
It's big and long.

357
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
It's so delicious.

358
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
What's this?

359
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
I'm telling you.

360
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,840
It's better to choose a gold-colored fruit.

361
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,840
Gold-colored?

362
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
Yes.

363
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
Gold-colored fruits are rare.

364
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
They grow in the north.

365
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
They're blue-red, red-yellow,

366
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
and yellow-green.

367
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,840
They're yellow-green, yellow-green,

368
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
yellow-green, yellow-green.

369
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
They're gold-colored.

370
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,840
Is it all gold-colored?

371
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
It's fine.

372
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,840
Only the wall is green.

373
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
But you can't see it.

374
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,840
Gold-colored fruit is famous for its low-grade dust.

375
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
It's very powerful.

376
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,840
The sunlight shines like gold.

377
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
It shines like a shining armor.

378
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,840
It's so powerful.

379
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840
What are you doing in this house?

380
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
I'm doing a little private work in the house.

381
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,840
But the owner here doesn't seem to like it.

382
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
He doesn't treat the guests well.

383
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
He doesn't like to go out.

384
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
But my dad is so good.

385
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
He has work all day.

386
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
Look.

387
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
Look.

388
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
The painting on the lantern in the house

389
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
was drawn by my dad.

390
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
How is it?

391
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Isn't it beautiful?

392
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
Since your dad is so good,

393
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,840
why don't you follow him to the lantern

394
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
instead of a private work?

395
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
I can't draw on the sky.

396
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
So I can't learn to draw.

397
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,840
If you want to draw, you must know how to draw.

398
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840
You can also draw by hand.

399
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
By hand?

400
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Yes.

401
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,840
There is a kind of power in the world.

402
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,840
It's the same as everything in the world.

403
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
People have 60 years of age,

404
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,840
and they have a lot of teeth and teeth.

405
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
They can draw by hand.

406
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
They can draw by hand.

407
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
They can draw by hand.

408
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
They can draw by hand.

409
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
They can draw by hand.

410
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
They can draw by hand.

411
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
They can draw by hand.

412
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,840
They can draw by hand.

413
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
Really?

414
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Wenwen.

415
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,840
What does it taste like?

416
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
It's a bit sour.

417
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
It's cool.

418
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,840
It has a light fragrance.

419
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Yes, it's light.

420
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,840
This light fragrance is green.

421
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
The wild grass is from the wild grass.

422
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,840
The bamboo is from the cold wind.

423
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,840
They are all born with no skin and are not strong.

424
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,840
So green is the color of the tree.

425
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Green must be beautiful.

426
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
Yes.

427
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,840
Every color in the world

428
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
is born from the natural world.

429
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,840
It's not beautiful or beautiful.

430
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
What color do you like?

431
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I...

432
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
I like gold.

433
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Gold?

434
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
What kind of flavor is gold?

435
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Is it the flavor of gold?

436
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,840
You fool.

437
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
This is a light color.

438
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
It's not gold.

439
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,840
Come.

440
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
Follow me.

441
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Okay.

442
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,840
Shall we start?

443
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,840
Did you feel it?

444
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
What?

445
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
The light of the sun

446
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,840
is warm and soft.

447
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,840
It's the golden color of the grass.

448
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Why do you like black thing?

449
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,720
That'll be called

450
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,880
Night is oh~~

451
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,600
Purple is a hope

452
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,600
Seems like he should've gone somewhere more complicated than me.

453
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,200
Here, madam.

454
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
You...

455
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Big sister!

456
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
You can't hide in front of the master.

457
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
Yes.

458
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
Move aside!

459
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Move aside!

460
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Move aside!

461
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Move aside!

462
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Move aside!

463
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,200
Move aside!

464
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
Meng Chi!

465
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Meng Chi!

466
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Meng Chi!

467
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
Wake up!

468
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Meng Chi!

469
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Meng Chi!

470
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Meng Chi, you're so fast!

471
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
You're so fast!

472
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
There's a miracle!

473
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
There's a doctor!

474
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
There's a miracle!

475
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Hurry! Hurry and find the doctor!

476
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Meng Chi!

477
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Meng Chi!

478
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Chi Er!

479
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Chi Er!

480
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Chi Er!

481
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Chi Er!

482
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Where are you?

483
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Meng Chi!

484
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Chi Er!

485
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
Chi Er!

486
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Wake up, Chi Er!

487
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Madam!

488
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
You're not saved.

489
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
The magic of the sky.

490
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
Chi Er!

491
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
Chi Er!

492
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
Chi Er!

493
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,200
Chi Er!

494
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,200
Chi Er!

495
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Chi Er!

496
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Help her to rest.

497
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Yes, madam.

498
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
Meng Chi is too worried.

499
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Hurry and help her to rest.

500
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
Chi Er!

501
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,200
I'm sorry.

502
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,200
I'm sorry.

503
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,200
I love you.
