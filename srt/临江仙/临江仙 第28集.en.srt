Xingman!

5
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,729
Xingman, what are you doing here?

6
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
I've looked all over for you.

7
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,840
Xingman, what's wrong?

8
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,470
I miss home.

9
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,720
You don't have to
stay here to keep me company.

10
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,460
You can return to the Yinlian Sect first.

11
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,990
After I wrap things up here,

12
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,450
I'll go find you.

13
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,170
When will that be?

14
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,079
How long do I have to wait for you to take

15
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,540
the initiative to find me?

16
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,110
Xingman, once this matter is settled,

17
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,340
I will definitely go back with you.

18
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,590
You have responsibilities you can't shirk

19
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,800
and your master and fellows
you can't leave behind.

20
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,150
Yet to me, you always say,

21
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,520
"Wait, wait, and wait a bit more."

22
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,240
Meng Chu,

23
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,360
all I want is you.

24
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,960
Why can't you want me only?

25
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,700
I'll ask you one more time.

26
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,400
Are you going with me or not?

27
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,960
Xingman,

28
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,680
don't be mad.

29
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,950
Be patient.

30

My mother said,

31
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,400
"A man who won't
take the initiative to find you

32
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,460
is not worth courting."

33
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,720
I'll give you two days
to think it through.

34
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,920
I'm returning to the Yinlian Sect
the day after tomorrow.

35
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,570
Come with me or not,

How about this? Call me Big Bro,

to meet you.

55
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,400
Or he wouldn't go to bed.

57
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,360
but to bring him here.

Well, then, My Lady, I'm taking my leave.

Call me if you and His Lordship
need anything.

you think pretending to forget
everything from the past

Darling,

71
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,290
did I do something wrong

72
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,830
and upset you?

73
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Please don't leave me behind again.

00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,250
Bai Jiusi, what on earth
are you trying to do?

75
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,370
I only want to be with you.

76
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,080
Master.

77
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,070
What brings you here?

78
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,910
I heard that Heavenly Lord Dacheng
came to lodge in your place.

79
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,860
So I came to drop in on you, Master.

80
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,140
You're worried I can't let go of my hatred
and might hurt him?

81
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,160
You're always the most sensible one.
So there's no need to worry about that.

82
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,150
I'm actually concerned about
how you feel inside, Master.

83
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,550
Have you ever had a crush on someone?

84
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,440
There was once
during my days in seclusion.

85
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,700
Since my seclusion kicked off,

86
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,440
I'd often caught the fragrance of flowers
drifting into the cave.

87
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,240
I didn't pay much attention to it

88
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,000
until one time...

89
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,640
At that moment,
I wanted to open my eyes and take a look.

90
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,900
I'm a coward.

91
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,220
I fell for someone
but didn't dare to tell him.

92
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,610
I only had the guts

93
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,880
to secretly leave a bouquet
at his doorstep every few days.

94
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,410
I picked all the flowers

95
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,360
on Yufan Mountain.

96
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,550
Then I started traveling around,

97
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
leaving new flowers at his door
whenever I found some.

98
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,130
I kept drinking all day long,

99
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,600
hoping that alcohol could
help me pluck up my courage

100
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,030
and tell him my feelings for him

101
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,680
the next time we met.

102
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,970
Unfortunately, I'm uniquely gifted.

103
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,340
The more I drink, the more sober I become.

104
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,550
It doesn't help me
summon up courage at all.

105
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,190
Did you open your eyes to see?

106
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,960
No, I gave up later.

107
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,320
Some stuff's better left in the dark.

108
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,040
I was in seclusion
with unfinished responsibilities

109
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,830
and didn't want to mess up someone's life.

110
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,310
Did you later find out
who was sending you flowers?

111
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,560
Yes, I did.

112
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,030
She once asked me

113
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,250
about my favorite flower.

114
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,290
Master Xuan Wei,
do you have any favorite flowers?

115
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,390
I don't like flowers.

116
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,470
Dandelions are not bad though.

117
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,220
I see.

118
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,460
Sorry.

119
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,920
It was my own choice
and had nothing to do with you, Master.

120
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,000

138

I was healing him
with my spiritual energy.

139
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,180
His divine soul is almost utterly wrecked.

140
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,750
Li Mo was telling the truth.

141
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,980
He only remembers you, Divine Lord.
That's interesting.

142
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,360
Guess you are the only one
he can't let go of.

143
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,330
Why did you come together?

144
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,030
Despite my depleted spiritual energy,

145
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,560
I don't want to be
a burden on you, Divine Lord.

146
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,150
I've been delving into artifact forging
and formations the past few days.

147
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,280
I remember the Great Wilderness Stele
is still in your possession, right?

148
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,370
I've heard about
what happened the other day.

149
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,870
This Great Wilderness Stele is listed

150
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,800
in the Record of Artifacts
Xiao Jingshan gave to you.

151
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,910
According to my investigation,
unlike ordinary artifacts,

152
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,170
this item takes countless days to forge.

153
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,320
So I think this artifact must have been

154
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,380
forged by Xiao Jingshan for himself.

155
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,150
By repairing the Great Wilderness Stele,

156
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,010
we can rebuild the past illusion.

157
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,510
Perhaps it'll reveal

158
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,320
some clues about Xiao Jingshan.

159
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,150
I remember you said
you tried to activate the formation

160
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,380
remaining on it by all means but failed.

161
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,110
I can't activate it,

162
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,750
but maybe he can pull it off.

163
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,720
Zhang Suan's
current cultivation techniques

164
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
all belonged to Xiao Jingshan before.

165
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,650
Besides, he once entered

166
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,670
the illusion you used
the Great Wilderness Stele to create.

167
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,130
Based on my experience
in artifact forging,

168
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,840
Zhang Suan

169
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,430
should be the real owner
of the Great Wilderness Stele now.

170
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,530
Only he

171
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,250
can activate
the repairing formation on it.

172
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,240
I can give it a try.

173
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,770
Then let's do it.

174
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,870
[Prosperity]

175
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,250
Channel your spiritual energy
into the pattern

176
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,110
and guide it along the paths on it.

177
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,230
Look, Divine Lord!

178
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,970
It's really been repaired.

179
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,960
Ling'er, did you just say that
after the repair,

180
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,630
we could also restore the past illusion

181
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,830
created by the Great Wilderness Stele?

182
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,240
Are you okay to continue?

183
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,400
Sure.

184
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,089
Just tell me what to do.

185
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,880
Just like before,

186
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,310
channel your spiritual energy
to the Great Wilderness Stele,

187
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,569
follow the spiritual energy paths on it,

188
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:18,950
find the past you want to see,
and conjure it up.

189
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,660
Divine Lord,
my spiritual energy has been drained,

190
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,960
so I can't enter
the Great Wilderness Stele.

191
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,400
Zhang Suan needs
to activate the formation,

192
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,880
so he can't enter the illusion either.

193
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,270
Are you ready to enter the illusion

194
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,330
of the Great Wilderness Stele again?

195
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,440
In the past, Xiao Jingshan was always
lurking in the dark,

196
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,210
spying on our lives.

197
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,070
Now it's my turn to peep into his life.

198
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,840
Let's begin.

199
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,800
Darling.

200
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,630
Darling,

201
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,050
were you trying
to leave me behind again just now?

202
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,370
No.

203
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,310
Glad to hear that!

204
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,170
Anyway, wherever you go,
I'm sticking with you.

205
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,270
Where are we?

206
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,830
Honey, I'm back.

207
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,570
Welcome back.

208
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,460
Darling, where are you going?

209
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,880
How's Mr. Wei's leg?

210
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,410
He probably can walk without his crutches

211
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,750
in a couple of days.

212
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,480
He was just saying that
we don't need to bring him meals anymore.

213
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,240
Here you are. He fell over and got hurt
while hunting with you.

214
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,920
Besides, he lives alone.

215
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,960
We should show more concern for him.

216
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,210
Yes, you're right, honey.

217
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,140
Time to eat!

218
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,890
Come on, Baby Bean,
you must be hungry. Come here.

219
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,090
Dad!

220
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,290
Good boy.

221
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,830
Father, Mother, lunch's ready!

222
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,570
-Coming.
-Okay.

223
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,500
Take your seats.

224
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,400
Baby Bean, hand out the chopsticks.

225
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,870
Here.

226
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,830
Darling.

227
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,830
Sit properly.

228
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,490
Why do you keep looking at him?

229
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,720
-Yes, I missed you.
-Good boy.

230
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Look at me.

231
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,550
Did you behave yourself at home?

232
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,010
Look at me.

233
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,500
He's been very well-behaved.

234
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,550
-Baby Bean's grown up.
-Thanks.

235
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,280
He can hand out chopsticks now.

236
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,640
Good.

237
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,440
Thank you.

238
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,240
Here you are.

239
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,430
Jingshan, has Mr. Wei's leg
gotten any better?

240
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,100
Mr. Wei's leg will recover
in just a few days.

241
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,810
Come on, let's eat.

242
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,890
Darling, are you hungry too?

243
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,250
Come on, have some more.

244
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,950
Here you are, Mother.

245
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,440
What are you eating?

246
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,790
-Share some with Baby Bean.
-Okay.

247
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,110
I'm talking to you!

248
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,550
Eat some more meat.

249
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,590
Mother, keep it to yourself.

250
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,550
That's weird.

251
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,290
Why do they seem like they can't see us?

252
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Tastes good, huh?

253
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,310
Here, Baby Bean.

254
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,210
Give it a try.

255
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,870
Try it.

256
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,290
Dad, don't forget that you promised

257
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,200
to take me to the lantern fair tonight.

258
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,310
I want to light lanterns
and watch acrobatics.

259
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,400
Come back home early.

260
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,710
Alright, I won't forget.

261
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,710
Come here.

262
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,470
Take it slow.

263
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,470
I'm leaving then.

264
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,650
Come back early.

265
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,000
Goodbye, Dad.

266
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,550
This is not what I expected.

267
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,120
Let's go.

268
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,550
Darling,

269
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,540
why do you keep staring at him?

270
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,480
Why aren't you talking to me?

271
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,610
Why have you become so talkative?

272
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,110
Beautiful.

273
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,240
Look!

274
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,140
Lanterns for sale, take a look!

275
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,980
Look over here!

276
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,090
Look! Look!

277
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,440
Beautiful.

278
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,070
So pretty.

279
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,110
Hurry up, or we'll be late.

280
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,150
Alright!

281
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,310
Nice!

282
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,170
Bravo!

283
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:35,960
This one.

284
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,240
Bravo! Bravo! Brilliant!

285
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,750
Do another one.

286
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,510
Bravo!

287
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,190
Nice!

288
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,990
Bravo!

289
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,760
Amazing.

290
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,370
Bravo!

291
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,550
Bravo! Bravo!

292
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,070
-One more!
-One more!

293
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,920
Do another one.

294
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,550
Awesome!

295
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,310
Bravo!

296
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,060
Darling, do you like this too?

297
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,340
I can do the same trick!

298
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,280
I want to go over there.

299
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:17,720
Let's go.

300
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,960
Come on, let's go.

301
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:23,860
Bravo!

302
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:25,860
Nice!

303
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,550
Look.

304
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,540
It's moving!

305
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,770
Which one do you like?

306
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,350
This one.

307
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,400
You like this one?

308
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,880
Okay.

309
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,840
Be careful.

310
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,890
Take it slow.

311
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,590
-Be careful.
-Stay safe.

312
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,070
Lanterns.

313
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,720
Take a look!

314
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,350
Darling.

315
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,750
Check these lanterns out!

316
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,020
Honey.

317
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,920
Hey, people are watching.

318
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,710
Xiao Jingshan, why on earth did you create

319
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,880
this illusion?

320
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,520
This lantern we bought today
is so beautiful.

321
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,960
Do you like it?

322
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,370
I saw you staring
at the lantern he was holding.

323
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,480
So I conjured one up.

324
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,720
Do you like it?

325
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,640
Darling,

326
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,050
are you still mad at me
for being talkative?

327
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,040
Why aren't you even smiling?

328
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,330
Darling, you smiled!

329
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,510
My darling smiled!

330
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,780
You look so beautiful when you smile.

331
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,210
Give me another smile.

332
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:25,930
Gorgeous.

333
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,140
Bai Jiusi,

334
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,950
how am I supposed to deal with you?

335
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,260
Why is it morning again?

336
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,220
What happened? Did I miss something?

337
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,480
Honey, I'm home.

338
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,330
Welcome back.

339
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,970
How's Mr. Wei's leg?

340
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,440
He probably can walk without his crutches

341
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,970
in a couple of days.

342
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,880
He was just saying that
we don't need to bring him meals anymore.

343
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,590
Here you are. He fell over and got hurt
while hunting with you.

344
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,310
Besides, he lives alone.

345
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,240
We should show more concern for him.

346
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,460
Yes, you're right, honey.

347
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,450
Time to eat!

348
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,240
Come on, Baby Bean,
you must be hungry. Come here.

349
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,270
Why do they

350
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,200
keep repeating the same old lines?

351
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:16,880
Dad!

352
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,040
Good boy.

353
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,450
Father, Mother, lunch's ready!

354
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,700
Okay, coming!

355
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,930
Baby Bean, hand out the chopsticks.

356
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,070
Sit properly.

357
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,310
Baby Bean's grown up.

358
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,480
He can hand out chopsticks now.

359
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,240
Did you behave yourself at home?

360
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,750
Did you listen to your mother?

361
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,810
-He's been very well-behaved.
-Yes.

362
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,400
Today's lunch is delicious.

363
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,770
Then have some more.

364
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:44,200
Is this illusion just repeating itself?

365
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,790
-Mother, have some more.
-Here, Baby Bean.

366
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,480
Okay.

367
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,090
Dad, don't forget that you promised

368
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,110
to take me to the lantern fair tonight.

369
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,350
I want to light lanterns
and watch acrobatics.

370
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,350
Come back home early.

371
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,720
Alright, I won't forget.

372
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,540
Come here.

373
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,510
Take it slow.

374
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,510
I'm leaving then.

375
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,400
Come back early.

376
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,350
Goodbye, Dad.

377
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,040
Let's go.

378
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,580
It's time to go.

379
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,680
Where to?

380
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,110
Divine Lord, you're back so soon.

381
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,310
Did you discover anything?

382
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,590
In that illusion, there's only one day

383
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,320
that keeps repeating.

384
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,400
So you mean

385
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,590
Xiao Jingshan used
the Great Wilderness Stele

386
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,720
to create an illusion of a certain day,

387
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,360
and he's been living
the same day over and over?

388
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,160
That's right.

389
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,930
Anything special about that day?

390
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,130
I found nothing special.

391
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,550
It's just Xiao Jingshan's daily life
with his family.

392
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,420
But I guess his inner struggle
might lie there.

393
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,440
Xiao Jingshan spent
a whole lot of time getting to know

394
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,070
Bai Jiusi and me
and turning us against each other,

395
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,730
which gave him the upper hand.

396
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,680
Now his advantage is gone.

397
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,010
I'll go check it out in Wenxuan Palace.

398
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,040
I'll go with you.

399
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,300
You need to rest now.

400
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Your going along would only
drag the Divine Lord down.

401
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,550
I'm starting to believe that

402
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,680
Heavenly Lord Dacheng's
having a problem with his mind.

403
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,890
Otherwise, given his personality,

404
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,400
how could he possibly condescend

405
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,330
to keep pestering the Divine Lord?

406
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,350
This symptom

407
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,750
has actually given him
a chance to ease their tension.

408

Zhang Suan.

409

Let me remind you once again.

410
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,640
Don't forget that they are married.

411

Destiny of marriage...

416
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,420
Wonder if it's really a destiny

417
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,660
or a calamity.

418
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:05,090
All beings emerge in this world,

Where there are gods, there are demons.

Demons grow from the darkness
in human hearts.

422

As long as life goes on,

423

demons will never vanish.

424

A thought can beget compassion
as well as evil.

425
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,690
Evil rises from the depths of the heart,

Twelve armored celestial soldiers
died in this battle.

But after he ascended to the Nine Heavens,

00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,409
into peril just to wipe out a name?

505
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,480
Losing loved ones can indeed
drive a person crazy.

506
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,300
I, too, once lost it and went astray.

507
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,030
Xiao Jingshan lost

508
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,890
all his loved ones in a single day.

509
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,440
Lord Qing Xu must have
become his obsession.

510
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,450
Grandmaster, you didn't drag
any innocent people into it.

We've all been following you willingly.

Now that we know Xiao Jingshan's past,

00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,480
all that's left is to

514
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,280
find him and stop him.

00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:27,800

534
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,640
Xiao Jingshan,

535
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,680
you forged them all
for yourself, didn't you?

536
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,360
Who's so ill-mannered
to visit in the dead of night?

537
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,550
I've long heard about the Yinlian Sect's
disdain for manners and rules.

538
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,500
Are those rumors

539
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,510
incorrect?

540
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,600
We can be rude to you,

541
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,740
but that doesn't mean
you can disrespect us.

542
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,980
Your Yinlian Sect

543
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,800
has started to grow on me.

544
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,970
Who on earth are you?

545
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,420
My identity is not important.

546
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,920
I came here today to make a deal with you.

547
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,400
A deal on what?

548
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,710
Many sects here claim to be righteous

549
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,000
and call the Yinlian Sect
an evil demonic sect.

550
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,960
Don't you want to eradicate those who

551
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,440
look down on you?

552
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,860
No, I don't.

553
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
They call the Yinlian Sect
an evil demonic sect

554
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,850
because we are unrestrained

555
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,490
and don't play by the rules.

556
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,830
But that doesn't mean we're bad.

557
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,970
You just seem to be up to no good.

558
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,840
I won't join hands with you, of course.

559
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,180
Never mind.

560
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,160
I didn't intend to negotiate
with you anyway.

561
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,140
So hideous!

562
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,000
D-Don't come any closer!

563
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,470
How many times have I told you

564
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,930
not to bully His Lordship?

565
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,460
Alright, alright, I got it.

566
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,040
Untie me now.

567
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,440
It's way too tight.

568
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,930
That's what you get for not listening.

569
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,060
All things thrive, and that is creation.

570
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,520
The world settles down,
and that is stability.

571
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,710
Gradual destruction is decay.

572
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,360
Vanishing into nothing is void.

573
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,080
Over 400 years ago,
I slayed the Drought Dragon

574
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,710
and avoided the destructive calamity.

575
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,210
I didn't know it would still
be inevitable today.

576
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,690
You're a spiritual beast
with a sharp sense.

577
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,070
You must've also sensed
the upcoming calamity, right?

578
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,640
[Don't come back.]

579
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,650
[Don't come back.]

580
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,860
Immortal Lord, something terrible

581
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,390
happened at the Hell Ruins!

582
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,400
Greetings, Sect Leader.

583
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,650
D-Did anything happen?

584
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,760
Yin Tongzi is just a child.

585
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,110
Why are you afraid of him?

586
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,770
He threatened to eat me alive.

587
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:23,890
Go have fun.

588
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,330
Grandmaster.

589
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,450
Go.

590
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,550
What brought you back here?

591
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,400
Have you found
Xiao Jingshan's whereabouts?

592
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,280
I came here

593
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,280
to report other important matters.

594
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,730
Recently, Dan Yang and I,

595
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,880
along with other disciples,
have been searching everywhere.

596
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,070
We've discovered that
many people across the land

597
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,450
have lost their souls.

598
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,860
Normally, when the soul leaves the body,

599
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,960
the body dies immediately.

600
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,880
But lately, there have been
hundreds of these people

601
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,280
falling into a coma first

602
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,950
and dying in their dreams

603
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,630
on the fifth day.

604
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,560
Today is already the third day,

605
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,070
and things are getting out of hand.

606
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,760
So I came to seek help
from you, Grandmaster.

607
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:12,440
Any connection between the people
who lost their souls?

608
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,950
Where did their souls go?

609
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,190
They don't know each other.

610
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,840
Some are even thousands of miles apart.

611
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,710
I've sent the disciples

612
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,590
everywhere to check
how many people have fallen into comas.

613
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,320
I suspect that

614
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,590
it might be Xiao Jingshan's doing.

615
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,500
The Great Wilderness Stele he forged

616
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,400
can capture
the primordial spirits of immortals.

617
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,590
Now, he must have made
another magical artifact

618
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,720
that can capture the souls of mortals.

619
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,220
Capturing mortal souls
in such a high-profile way,

620
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,040
what on earth is he up to?

621
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,110
Xingman, Xingman.

622
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,000
Li Qingyue!

623
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,900
Mind your attitude
to our grandmaster.

624
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,760
Does your Jingyun Sect
have any available manpower

625
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,870
to go back with me to the Yinlian Sect?

626
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,030
What happened to your sect again?

627
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,710
My mother sent a message through a raven,

628
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,960
telling me not to go back.

629
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,580
No way she'd say that

630
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,740
unless something hit our sect hard.

631
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,460
Li Qingyue,

632
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,270
you can't ignore my trouble.

633
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,880
When the Jingyun Sect was in chaos,

634
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,940
I stood by you through thick and thin!

635
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:11,650
Xingman,

636
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,230
we don't know what's really going on yet.

637
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,230
Calm down first.

638
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:15,800
That's my mother.

639
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,390
How can I calm down?

640
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,320
Did anything happen in your place as well?

641
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,230
I just received a message
from Senior Long Yuan,

642
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,550
saying that the seal of the Hell Ruins
loosened for no reason.

643
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,840
The demonic beasts imprisoned inside

644
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,950
have all escaped.

645
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,670
Divine Lord, please accommodate
our Heavenly Lord for a few more days.

646
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:42,530
We need to return to Canglei Palace
to help subdue the demonic beasts.

647
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:48,280
So it's really Xiao Jingshan
behind all these issues.

648
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,030
He's been plotting for quite a while.

649
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,280
He knows he stands no chance
in a head-on fight.

650
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,880
So he's trying to split us up.

651
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,800
I'll keep an eye on Bai Jiusi

652
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,230
and keep him safe and sound.

653
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,070
You can go back to Canglei Palace.

654
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,400
Thank you, Divine Lord.

you go to Yinlian Sect with Qu Xingman.

Catch him alive if possible.

668
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,920
I'll leave Xuan Wei at Jingyun Sect.

669
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,630
When you can no longer handle it,

670
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:36,830
avoid confrontation

671
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,760
and send a message
to ask Xuan Wei for reinforcements.

672
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,920
There's no time to waste.

673
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,000
Let's split up and move.
