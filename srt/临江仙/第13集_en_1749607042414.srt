1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,660
¡Akaiya cubes!

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,620
Thanks for watching!

3
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,660
The water is getting deeper because of you

4
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,660
The fog is getting deeper because of you

5
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:50,660
The old scenery is gone, the old scenery is gone

6
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,660
The autumn leaves are falling, the wind is blowing, the wind is blowing

7
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:03,660
And the leaves of spring are falling, the leaves of spring are falling

8
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,660
I pretend that I don't want to listen

9
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,660
I don't want to see your eyes

10
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:17,660
But tears have fallen, the emotions of the time have gone

11
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,660
I want to learn to be independent

12
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:26,660
To be the spirit of the dream

13
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,660
Forget about the mistakes

14
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,660
The moon is embarrassed in my smile

15
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,660
And the flowers are Austin

16
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:57,660
f'n i f'n i f'n i f'n in floating

17
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,660
How could it be?

18
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,660
I saw it myself.

19
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,660
His legs are broken.

20
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,660
How could he do this without any damage?

21
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,660
I heard that our lady went in.

22
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,660
He didn't want to be caught.

23
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,660
Do you think that lady used some method to save him?

24
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,660
What kind of method could make him break his legs and recover?

25
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,660
How could he do this?

26
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,660
I think he must have used some magic.

27
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,660
This Huo Cheng...

28
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,660
He's not human at all.

29
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,660
He's not human?

30
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,660
Is he or is he blaming me?

31
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,660
He's really blaming me.

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,660
You guys,

33
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,660
if you have any problem,

34
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,660
go and re-re-create the soil in the garden.

35
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,660
Yes.

36
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,660
Hurry.

37
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,660
You are...

38
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,660
When did the manager come?

39
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,660
I was in the house.

40
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,660
I saw it.

41
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,660
Good.

42
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,660
I swear this is the last time.

43
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,660
I will never use any other method again.

44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,660
I know that using some method to change the fate of the mortal is a counter-revolution.

45
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,660
Why do you still need to save that child?

46
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,660
Hua Ru Yu,

47
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,660
we were born to be gods.

48
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,660
We are like the endless years.

49
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,660
The mortal lives for decades.

50
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,660
In our eyes, it's just a moment of greed.

51
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,660
What's the difference between those birds and bugs?

52
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,660
Do you think that you will die in the end

53
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,660
if you meet a dead horse?

54
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,660
You will also die in the end.

55
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,660
I'm not in love with anyone.

56
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,660
I just hope that you can protect yourself and save others.

57
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,660
I know.

58
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,660
Come.

59
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,660
Next time,

60
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,660
I will not let you go.

61
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,660
I will.

62
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,660
I will.

63
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,660
Next time,

64
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,660
I will not let you go.

65
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
Don't be angry.

66
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,660
It's just a little blood.

67
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,660
I can cure it very soon.

68
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,660
If I didn't use the method to cover your power,

69
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,660
if the mortal finds out,

70
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,660
I would have locked you up in the planet.

71
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,660
I know that you are the most important.

72
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,660
If you are weak, you will not die.

73
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,660
I will not save you.

74
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,660
The medicine is cold.

75
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,660
Drink it up.

76
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,660
But,

77
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,660
the rumors are spreading.

78
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,660
They say that something strange happened in our yard.

79
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,660
Some even say that I am watching the rabbits outside

80
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
and they are all by the power of my waist.

81
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,660
I am the true god of the Nine Heavens,

82
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,660
the great lord of the city,

83
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,660
and the evil spirits.

84
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,660
It's so ridiculous.

85
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,660
Great lord of the city,

86
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,660
don't be angry.

87
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,660
How about I kill myself to apologize to you tonight?

88
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,660
You can cook?

89
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
I learned it from Yang.

90
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,660
What do you want to eat?

91
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,660
What will you do?

92
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,660
Ice soup, silver soup,

93
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,660
bitter melon, ribs soup,

94
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,660
and winter melon, one meter soup.

95
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,660
Why is it all soup?

96
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,660
The soup is so hot.

97
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,660
I see that you are very energetic recently.

98
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,660
Drink more, and you will feel better.

99
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,660
A-Yuan,

100
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,660
I have thought it through.

101
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,660
I plan to be impolite

102
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,660
and concentrate on my work.

103
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,660
Anyway, I can't go out for a while.

104
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
I can't get out of your net

105
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
if I live in a situation like this.

106
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,660
Mom.

107
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
Mom.

108
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,660
Drink it.

109
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,660
I forgot to tell you the wrong thing.

110
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:49,660
I want to see you with a smile.

111
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,660
I will be back.

112
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,660
I will be back.

113
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,660
I want to see you with a smile.

114
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,660
I want to see you with a smile.

115
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,660
I want to see you with a smile.

116
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,660
I want to see you with a smile.

117
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,660
I want to see you with a smile.

118
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,660
I want to see you with a smile.

119
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,660
I want to see you with a smile.

120
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,660
I want to see you with a smile.

121
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,660
I want to see you with a smile.

122
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,660
I want to see you with a smile.

123
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,660
I want to see you with a smile.

124
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,660
I want to see you with a smile.

125
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,660
I want to see you with a smile.

126
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,660
I want to see you with a smile.

127
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,660
I want to see you with a smile.

128
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,660
I want to see you with a smile.

129
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,660
I want to see you with a smile.

130
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,660
I want to see you with a smile.

131
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,660
I want to see you with a smile.

132
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,660
I want to see you with a smile.

133
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,660
I want to see you with a smile.

134
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,660
I want to see you with a smile.

135
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,660
I want to see you with a smile.

136
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,660
I want to see you with a smile.

137
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,660
I want to see you with a smile.

138
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,660
I want to see you with a smile.

139
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,660
I want to see you with a smile.

140
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
I want to see you with a smile.

141
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,660
I want to see you with a smile.

142
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,660
I want to see you with a smile.

143
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,660
I want to see you with a smile.

144
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,660
I want to see you with a smile.

145
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,660
I want to see you with a smile.

146
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,660
I want to learn the law of separation.

147
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,660
Forget theсest of what happened.

148
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,660
This smile looks like a racing race.

149
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,660
Remember!

150
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,660
Remember!

151
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:49,920
ciliation

152
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:57,840
Han

153
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,660
How long has he been here?

154
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,700
It takes only 20 years.

155
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,560
【It can't be.】

156
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
【I'm sorry.】

157
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,880
It's time for us to leave

158
00:12:49,700 --> 00:13:18,820
In a week or two very few tunnels are left for the tea world to exist Knowledge.

159
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,220
I haven't been tall when you first came.

160
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,220
Now your son is taller than me.

161
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,260
Yes.

162
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,060
Hua Yu is growing up.

163
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,260
He's been wearing really high.

164
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,180
That's great.

165
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,180
You can keep this.

166
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,180
Here.

167
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,780
This...

168
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,180
Madam, I can't keep this.

169
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,980
Hua Yu is a good student.

170
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,340
I can't keep the money in the mansion.

171
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,580
You can buy a house with these money.

172
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,860
And find a good school for him.

173
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,340
I believe that Hua Yu's ambition

174
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,420
will be successful in the future.

175
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,260
You can live a good life without any worries.

176
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,260
You can be at ease.

177
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,340
Madam, you're so kind.

178
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,620
I'm so worried.

179
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,620
But...

180
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,660
Since you saved Meng Chi,

181
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,180
I'm in your hands.

182
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,460
I've been in the illusion of the real God of the Red Dream.

183
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,580
I want to use my life to take care of you.

184
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,700
I'll take care of you.

185
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,700
I won't betray you.

186
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,060
I'm fine.

187
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,060
I don't need your help.

188
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,900
Now that we're close to each other,

189
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
you don't have to keep it.

190
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,740
Madam.

191
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,580
Just let me stay.

192
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,580
Madam.

193
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,580
I'm sorry.

194
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,580
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,580
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,580
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,580
I'm sorry.

198
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,580
I'm sorry.

199
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,580
I'm sorry.

200
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,580
I'm sorry.

201
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,580
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,580
I'm sorry.

203
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,580
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,580
I'm sorry.

205
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,580
I'm sorry.

208
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,580
I'm sorry.

210
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,580
I'm sorry.

211
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
I'm sorry.

212
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,580
I'm sorry.

213
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,580
I'm sorry.

215
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
I'm sorry.

217
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
I'm sorry.

218
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,580
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,580
I'm sorry.

220
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
I'm sorry.

221
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,580
I'm sorry.

222
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,580
I'm sorry.

223
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
I'm sorry.

224
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,580
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,580

I'm sorry.

229
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,580
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,580
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,580
I'm sorry.

232
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,580
I'm sorry.

233
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,580
I'm sorry.

234
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,580
I'm sorry.

236
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,580
I'm sorry.

237
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,580
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,580
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,580
I'm sorry.

240
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,580
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
I'm sorry.

243
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,580
I'm sorry.

244
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
I'm sorry.

245
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,580
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,580
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,580
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,580
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,580
Thank you.

250
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,580
I'll do what I want.

251
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,580
Thank you.

252
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,580
I'll be sure to check my stop

253
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,580
with you for an hour

254
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,580
I...

255
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,580
I...

256
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,580
I...

257
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

258
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

259
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

260
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

261
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

262
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

263
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

264
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

265
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

266
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

267
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

268
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

269
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

270
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

271
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

272
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

273
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

274
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

275
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,580
I'll leave it to you, Sister Meng.

276
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,580
Master, please be quiet.

277
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,580
You guys usually stay in the room

278
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,580
after you finish your work.

279
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,580
Don't run around.

280
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,580
Especially, you can't enter the master's room.

281
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,580
And...

282
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,580
this winter, the master loves the red tree.

283
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,580
The red tree in the backyard is the most beautiful.

284
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,580
The red tree in the backyard must be taken care of.

285
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,580
The cold water is the most beautiful.

286
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,580
You must not stay here all day.

287
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,580
Yes, Master Meng.

288
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,580
I heard that your grandson is a official.

289
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,580
Why do you still have to be a servant and serve the people?

290
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,580
Leaving here to enjoy the joy of the world?

291
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,580
Isn't that better?

292
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,580
Master doesn't like to be a servant.

293
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,580
I don't like it either.

294
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,580
Stay in the house.

295
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,580
Don't talk too much.

296
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,580
I'll leave it to you.

297
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,580
Master Meng.

298
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,580
Master, which one is your husband?

299
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,580
My husband?

300
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,580
It's my grandson who wrote it for me.

301
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,580
It's my grandson.

302
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,580
I'm sorry.

303
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,580
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,580
I'm sorry.

305
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,580
I'm sorry.

306
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,580
I'm sorry.

307
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,580
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,580
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,580
I'm sorry.

310
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,580
I'm sorry.

311
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
I'm sorry.

312
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,580
I'm sorry.

313
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,580
I'm sorry.

314
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,580
I'm sorry.

315
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,580
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,580
I'm sorry.

317
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,580
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,580
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,580
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
I'm sorry.

323
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,580
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,580
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,580
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,580
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,580
I'm sorry.

328
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,580
I'm sorry.

329
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,580
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,580
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,580
It was my fault.

332
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,580
Did you forget this?

333
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,580
I thinkاشI gave you a doll.

334
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,580
She's broken it.

335
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,580
She's for what?

336
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
What?

337
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,580
I give you a doll.

338
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,580
What are you thinking about?

339
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,580
It comes about the difference of a young woman and a away couple.

340
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,580
No one wants to be my late partners.

341
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:24,580
I have a grandson who is the one who is being watched outside.

342
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,580
I don't know what crime he has been charged with.

343
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,580
In a few days, he will be executed.

344
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,080
I know him.

345
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,880
When I was a kid, he was the kindest and purest person.

346
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,580
He would never do anything bad.

347
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,080
Among these, there must be some misunderstanding.

348
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,580
Madam, I know you are not a mortal.

349
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:57,580
Please help him.

350
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,580
Help him.

351
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,580
She is our daughter-in-law.

352
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,080
Everything is posthumous here.

353
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,080
It can't affect me not to��록.

354
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,220
Fold your head upwards and bring him forward.

355
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,560
Without guarantee he won't slide down.

356
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,460
All I learned before

357
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,300
were two fingers diaconds.

358
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,700
I preserve a long time on my직ty filling,

359
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,440
putting刻萎叙 forth just to squeeze my good luck.

360
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,320
Yet we still go right into the instant again...

361
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,640
What for?

362
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

363
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
I'm sorry.

364
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
I'm sorry.

365
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
I'm sorry.

366
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
I'm sorry.

367
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
I'm sorry.

368
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
I'm sorry.

369
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
I'm sorry.

370
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
I'm sorry.

371
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
I'm sorry.

372
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
I'm sorry.

373
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
I'm sorry.

375
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
I'm sorry.

376

I'm sorry.

388
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
I'm sorry.

389
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640

I'm sorry.

395
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
I'm sorry.

396
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
I'm sorry.

397
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
I'm sorry.

398
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
I'm sorry.

399
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
I'm sorry.

400
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
I'm sorry.

401
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
I'm sorry.

402
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
I'm sorry.

403
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
I'm sorry.

404
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,640
I'm sorry.

405
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
I'm sorry.

406
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
I'm sorry.

407
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
I'm sorry.

408
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
I'm sorry.

409
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
I'm sorry.

410
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
I'm sorry.

411
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
I'm sorry.

412
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
I'm sorry.

413
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
I'm sorry.

414
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
I'm sorry.

415
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
I'm sorry.

416
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,640
I'm sorry.

417
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
I'm sorry.

418
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
I'm sorry.

419
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
I'm sorry.

420
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
I'm sorry.

421
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
I'm sorry.

422
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
I'm sorry.

423
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
I'm sorry.

424
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
I'm sorry.

425
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
I'm sorry.

426
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
I'm sorry.

427
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
I'm sorry.

428
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
I'm sorry.

429
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
I'm sorry.

430
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
I'm sorry.

431
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
I'm sorry.

432
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
I'm sorry.

433
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
I'm sorry.

434
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
I'm sorry.

435
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,640
I'm sorry.

436
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
I'm sorry.

437
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,640
I'm sorry.

438
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,640
Hurry up.

439
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,640
Hurry up.

440
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Hurry up.

441
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,640
lt's all yours again

442
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,720
Here, eat US off

443
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,600
Don't scare us

444
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,320
Take care

445
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,200
Thank you for watching.

446
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,640
I'll tell you more about it

447
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,640
The world has a kind of ability

448
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
It's based on the existence of one's own

449
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
It's the same as everything else

450
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
People have 60

451
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,640
Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body

452
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
You really have a sense of belonging

453
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,640
But as long as you work hard

454
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
You can still make it

455
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
Really?

456
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,640
Why do you like gold?

457
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,640
The long night is slowly, the days are clear

458
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,640
Gold is hope

459
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,640
The long night is slowly, the sun is in place

460
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
Although the candlelight is not there

461
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,640
But people can still break the loneliness

462
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,640
Bring hope

463
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,640
The promise that life and death are like a promise

464
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,640
The day after tomorrow, we'll talk about it

465
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,640
This moment, the burning light

466
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,640
Love is always empty

467
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,640
The legend of spring comes and passes

468
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,640
What crime did Meng Xianwei commit?

469
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
He said it was a soup and food party

470
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,640
How could it be possible?

471
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Meng Xianwei is a good official

472
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
Of course he wouldn't do such a thing

473
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,640
How could it be possible?

474
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,640
He must have been wronged

475
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Yes, he must have been wronged

476
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,640
The court of justice Meng Changqin, the judge of Huai'an County

477
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,640
He is greedy and has a good taste

478
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
He is a good official

479
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
He is a good official

480
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,640
He is a good official

481
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,640
He is a good official

482
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
He is a good official

483
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
I haven't finished my reading

484
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
I'm so tired

485
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,640
How about I read the last sentence?

486
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
Today, the emperor is in danger

487
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,640
He is sentenced to death

488
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Good

489
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Mr. Meng

490
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Mr. Meng

491
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Wake up

492
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
Mr. Meng

493
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,640
Mr. Meng

494
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Mr. Meng is a good official

495
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
He can't kill you

496
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
No, he is a good official

497
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
He can't kill you

498
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
He can't kill you

499
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Don't move

500
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Don't move

501
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Such a good wine

502
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,640
I'm going to lose it

503
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,640
Don't move

504
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
Don't move

505
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,640
Don't move

506
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Don't move

507
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Don't move

508
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Don't move

509
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
Wake up

510
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
Wake up

511
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,640
Don't move

512
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
Don't move

513
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
Don't move

514
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
Don't move

515
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
Don't move

516
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
Don't move

517
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
Don't move

518
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
Don't move

519
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
Don't move

520
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Don't move

521
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
Don't move

522
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
Don't move

523
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
Don't move

524
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
Don't move

525
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
Don't move

526
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
Don't move

527
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
Don't move

528
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
You

529
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Meng Chang Qi

530
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
I am

531
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
The grandson of Meng Chi

532
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Yes

533
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
Sir

534
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,640
Sir, what should we do?

535
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,640
What should we do?

536
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,640
We can't catch him

537
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
We must catch Meng Chang Qi

538
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,640
Come back

539
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,640
I am going to do some work

540
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
You don't have to learn from me

541
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
I will be back in a few days

542
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
What's this?

543
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Are you a fairy?

544
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640
Or a demon?

545
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,640
I just heard your grandfather's name

546
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
Do you know him?

547
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,640
What's your relationship?

548
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
Are you my grandma?

549
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,640
I have never seen him since I was a child

550
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
I just heard my grandfather say

551
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
He is a gentle beauty

552
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
I think you are quite similar

553
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,640
Are you okay?

554
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
Using the magic to change the fate of the mortal

555
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
Will cause trouble

556
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,640
Will cause trouble

557
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
Where are you going?

558
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,640
None of your business

559
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Where am I going?

560
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
None of my business

561
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,640
I am a fugitive

562
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,640
You are sitting on the ground

563
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
Give me a name

564
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,640
Are you okay?

565
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
I told you to bring me here

566
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
But you didn't listen

567
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
Look

568
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,640
If it wasn't for me

569
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,640
I would have been bitten by wild dogs

570
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,640
But you don't have to thank me

571
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,640
You saved my life

572
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,640
I saved your life too

573
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
We are one life

574
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,640
One life

575
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
We are one life

576
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
We are one life

577
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
We are one life

578
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,640
We are one life

579
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
We are one life

580
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
We are one life

581
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
We are one life

582
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,640
We are one life

583
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
We are one life

584
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
So good

585
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
I tell you

586
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
My rabbit skills

587
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
are great

588
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
I trained it from a young age

589
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
You ate my rabbit legs

590
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,640
Will you take me away?

591
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Wipe it

592
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
It's better than you

593
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,640
to be so stubborn

594
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,640
Come

595
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
I don't need it

596
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,640
You can take it

597
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
A stubborn and stubborn

598
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
You are so stubborn

599
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
What crime did you commit?

600
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,640
I didn't commit a crime

601
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,640
Why did you do it?

602
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
I did it for my own good

603
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,640
I didn't do it for my own good

604
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,640
What's wrong with being a person who doesn't do it for your own good?

605
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,640
I didn't do it

606
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
I did it for the sake of the food

607
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
and the chaos

608
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
I didn't leave any house with them

609
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,640
They are enough to give me a chance

610
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
The people in the case

611
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
are always fighting

612
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
They are so shameless

613
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
I don't want to do it anyway

614
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
You take me to the temple in the future

615
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,640
When I get the immortal

616
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,640
I will go back to Huai'an

617
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,640
and kill those dogs

618
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
and then I will...

619
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
I will scold the son of the emperor

620
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,640
with a wild boar

621
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
I can't even see the emperor's talent

622
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
He will also be with those stubborn and stubborn people

623
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,640
who are so stubborn

624
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,640
What?

625
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,640
Do you also think that I am a man

626
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
who is talented and talented

627
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,640
and wants to be my disciple?

628
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
I just think

629
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
you are not like your grandpa

630
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,640
Of course

631
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,640
My grandpa is not as good as me

632
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,640
This is my coffin

633
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,640
When the gate opens tomorrow

634
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,640
I will take you to the city to eat

635
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,640
It's my ceremony

636
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,640
You are so young

637
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
You only have a coffin

638
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,640
Of course

639
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,640
I am the first one to carry the coffin

640
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,640
to the county

641
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,640
It proves that I am not like the whole Dizuo

642
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
It's just a coffin

643
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
It's more scary than the sword

644
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
that you said

645
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
You don't understand

646
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,640
If someone

647
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
knows my name

648
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
he will be more scary than the hell

649
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,640
I want to tell you

650
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
the experience I had

651
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Shameless

652
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
Shameless

653
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
Shameless

654
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,640
Everyone

655
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,640
listen to the channel

656
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,640
Do you know that the north Han people

657
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,640
in the country are

658
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
born from the river?

659
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
Yes

660
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,640
Why?

661
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Because there is a Han dragon in the north

662
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
Han dragon?

663
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,640
Han dragon is a female tiger

664
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,640
The female tiger was trapped

665
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,640
by the emperor in the north of the water

666
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,640
Now Han dragon is born

667
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
The place where the golden tree

668
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
is the place of the army

669
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
The river is full of water

670
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
It's not easy to get it

671
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,640
You said so much

672
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
Do you have any way to deal with Han dragon?

673
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Yes

674
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
Of course

675
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Only one thing in this world

676
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,640
can kill this Han dragon

677
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
What?

678
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,640
It is this

679
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
The treasure

680
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,640
This is the precious

681
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,640
precious treasure

682
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
The person who has just been killed

683
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
is Han soldier

684
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
This knife can be used

685
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
to kill Han dragon

686
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,640
You are right

687
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,640
You are so good at talking

688
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,640
This knife can be used

689
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
to kill the king

690
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
It can be used to kill

691
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
the person who has the power

692
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
to be a good person

693
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,640
The channel is not enough

694
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
to be used

695
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
There is a channel where you can hear the sound of the tiger

696
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
You can't go to the dragon king's face

697
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
I am with you

698
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
Let's go

699
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
Brother

700
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,640
Brother

701
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
I think we have

702
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,640
700 people to sell to others

703
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,640
How about 500 coins?

704
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
Wait

705
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
I don't have money

706
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
300 coins

707
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
300

708
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
How about it?

709
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,640
No

710
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,640
You are so stupid

711
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,640
Stop

712
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,640
Man Shan?

713
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,640
I can cook

714
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,640
and feed

715
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,640
and work

716
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
to clean the yard

717
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,640
How old are you?

718
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,640
How much can you make?

719
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,640
But this

720
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,640
I don't sell

721
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
I can only buy myself

722
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,640
I told you

723
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,640
No one can buy

724
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,640
even if it costs a hundred meters

725
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,640
You are a good girl

726
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
You are so nice

727
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,640
You are so nice

728
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,640
You can buy two bags of rice

729
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,640
Master, we don't sell children

730
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
Please let him go

731
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,640
I want this

732
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,640
Let me go

733
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
Let me go

734
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,640
You are going to bite me

735
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,640
I am going to kill you

736
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,640
Let me go

737
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,640
Master, you are so small

738
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,640
Take the car

739
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,640
I can't even get a centimeter

740
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,640
Master

741
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
I want to kill you

742
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,640
What are you doing?

743
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,640
Go to hell

744
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,640
What are you doing?

745
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
Master

746
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
Master

747
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,640
Master

748
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,640
Master

749
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,640
Master

750
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,640
I live
