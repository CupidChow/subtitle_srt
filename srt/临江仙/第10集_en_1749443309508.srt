1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Speed up the race quality of your game to make it easier for you to away- occupied until you reach the corner to the goal.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,500
The rules take much less time and it's evenye easier than you can get rid of the Ralph and Jerry ZMake.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,000
You can see the ball swing a lot on the goal.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,500
You also need time to get to the corner Lane and three哥 but you can sit well too.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,500
I'm not sure if I can make it.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
I'll try to make it.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,500
I'll try to make it.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,500
I'll try to make it.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
I'll try to make it.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
I'll try to make it.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
I'll try to make it.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
I'll try to make it.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
I'll try to make it.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
I'll try to make it.

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,500
I'll try to make it.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
I'll try to make it.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
I'll try to make it.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
I'll try to make it.

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
I'll try to make it.

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
I'll try to make it.

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
I'll try to make it.

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
I'll try to make it.

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
I'll try to make it.

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
I'll try to make it.

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
I'll try to make it.

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
I'll try to make it.

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
I'll try to make it.

28
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
I'll try to make it.

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
I'll try to make it.

30
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
I'll try to make it.

31
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I'll try to make it.

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I'll try to make it.

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
I'll try to make it.

34
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
I'll try to make it.

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
I'll try to make it.

36
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
I'll try to make it.

37
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
I'll try to make it.

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
I'll try to make it.

39
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
I'll try to make it.

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
I'll try to make it.

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Finish being like the proverb on Three Clouds.

42
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Reminiscing,

43
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
poison,

44
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Why did you burn your legs in the fire?

45
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Yesterday you ate it.

46
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
It was fried.

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,520
Let's see if we can find it anyway.

48
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,100
A'Yu.

49
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
It's you.

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
Xuan Sun.

51
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Are you okay?

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Xuan Sun.

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Dong Yun.

54
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Wait.

55
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
What are you doing?

56
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Xuan Sun.

57
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Your spiritual power.

58
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,500
I've been sealed for hundreds of years.

59
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Do you think it's easy for you to deal with me?

60
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
You're just trying to make up for it.

61
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Instead of getting hurt more and more,

62
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I'd rather die.

63
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Lin Mo, why don't you do it?

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
If you weren't soft-hearted,

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
and didn't want to kill me,

66
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
you wouldn't have any trouble today.

67
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Don't do it.

68
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Her spiritual power is already out of control.

69
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
It won't cause any danger.

70
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
I've heard so many men say they love me.

71
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
But later,

72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
everything is fake.

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Life is in pain.

74
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,500
My biggest obsession in this life

75
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
is to see you again.

76
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,500
To hear you say something and love me.

77
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
The first one has been realized.

78
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,500
The last one is not important anymore.

79
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Kill me.

80
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
I'm done.

81
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
I'm so sorry.

82
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
She's your life.

83
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
You can't hide from her.

84
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,500
You're just trying to make up for it.

85
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
You're just trying to save her.

86
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
You didn't even save me.

87
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
You're trying to save others.

88
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
There are millions of people in this world.

89
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Not only men and women.

90
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
It turns out,

91
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
this is my ring.

92
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
I told you,

93
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,500
I'll help you with your evil spirit.

94
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Why is this so late?

95
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
I love you.

96
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
It's not love for men.

97
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
It's love for the people.

98
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Think about it.

99
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
The men you met before

100
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
are not all fake.

101
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
You're just trying to make up for it.

102
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
You promised me.

103
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
They're all real to you.

104
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
They're real.

105
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
They're real.

106
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Hong Lian.

107
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
It's you.

108
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
I'm here to marry you.

109
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
You just want to make up for it.

110
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
You're just trying to make up for it.

111
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
You're just trying to make up for it.

112
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
They're not real.

113
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Their blood

114
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,500
can't be seen on you.

115
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
The blood of the evil spirit

116
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
is not on you.

117
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
It's not others.

118
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
So,

119
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
I shouldn't have let others love me.

120
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I should have learned to love others.

121
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
That's exactly it.

122
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
As long as you love me,

123
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
no evil spirit can enter my body.

124
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
In the end,

125
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
I want to thank you.

126
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
You made me steal my sister.

127
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,500
I used to be a man.

128
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
But I didn't understand

129
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
the so-called man.

130
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
I can't solve the problem of others

131
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
if I want to make up for it.

132
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
So,

133
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
so,

134
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
I finally understand

135
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
the crime you said.

136
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,500
I heard that there's a demon on the sky.

137
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Please,

138
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
let me go.

139
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
But you

149
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
let me put me where

150
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
and let me practice again.

151
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
I don't need to spend

152
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
as many days as I can.

153
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
I won't be impolite anymore.

154
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Okay.

155
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
I'll support you.

156
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,500
The End

157
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Are you really okay?

158
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
You forgot what I was fixing.

159
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
This injury is nothing.

160
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
That's good.

161
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Now, it's time to do the proper thing.

162
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:43,500
The End

163
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Little Fairy,

164
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
are you going to board the ship?

165
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Yes.

166
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
I wonder how much the ship costs.

167
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
I only want to have fun.

168
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,500
I don't receive any orders.

169
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,500
I'm just a person who has a good fate.

170
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
So,

171
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
you have a good account.

172
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Come on, board.

173
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Sit down.

174
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,500
The wind blows through the clouds.

175
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
The people are all in the clouds.

176
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Little Fairy,

177
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
I know you have a good luck in the future.

178
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,500
But you have to use the Holy Wings of the Demon Tribe to pass the heaven.

179
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Yes.

180
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Do you know how good the heaven is?

181
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
I know.

182
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Since you know,

183
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
you should go to the Sky of Nine Flames

184
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
with a mortal.

185
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
I know you are not a good lucker

186
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
because you are not good at the hand of the Fairy.

187
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
So,

188
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
why do you come to the Sky of Nine Flames?

189
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
I'm an old friend.

190
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
The Sky of Nine Flames is so vast.

191
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
The Fairy is not good at the embroidery.

192
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Do you know where she lives?

193
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
I know.

194
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
The Sky of Nine Flames.

195
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
The Sky of Nine Flames?

196
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Yes.

197
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,500
So, the Sky of Nine Flames is where the Great Cheng Xuan is?

198
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
I know.

199
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Who doesn't know the Great Cheng Xuan?

200
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Come on, sit down.

201
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,500
The Great Cheng Xuan has a great magic power.

202
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,500
It's the highest God of the Sky of Nine Flames.

203
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
If you are really good,

204
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
you have been to the Sky of Nine Flames long ago.

205
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Why are you still here?

206
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,500
You seem to have some opinions about the Great Cheng Xuan.

207
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Then, you come to the Sky of Nine Flames

208
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
and you will be the most powerful God of the Sky of Nine Flames.

209
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Are you looking for trouble?

210
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
If I say yes,

211
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
the Fairy will believe me.

212
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
The Great Cheng Xuan is a great man.

213
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I can't help you.

214
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Sit tight.

215
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
I'm not born with a soul.

216
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
I'm born with a body.

217
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,500
I'm not born with a body.

218
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Immortal Li Mo,

219
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
is this the Dragon Plain Immortal?

220
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
What are you doing?

221
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Immortal Li Mo,

222
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Immortal Li Mo,

223
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
please say something.

224
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
It's been a long time.

225
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Four Spirit?

226
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
How dare you show up next to Immortal?

227
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
You...

228
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
You misunderstood me.

229
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
I'm Li Qingyue.

230
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
I'm not Four Spirit.

231
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
I saw your fire.

232
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
I saw it too.

233
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,500
That was the magic that Four Spirit Immortal used.

234
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
I don't know why.

235
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
I'm just...

236
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
I'm just...

237
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Four Spirit and Immortal are the same.

238
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
They are the same.

239
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
They are the same.

240
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Now, Immortal is injured.

241
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
But you have the power.

242
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Can you explain it to me?

243
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,500
We are surrounded by Star River.

244
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
We are surrounded by the same place.

245
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
We are surrounded by the same place.

246
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Now,

247
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
you have to leave.

248
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
You are wrong.

249
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Immortal is here.

250
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Can you tell me where he is?

251
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Can you tell me where he is?

252
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Immortal is here.

253
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
You are from Xuan Zun?

254
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Xuan Zun?

255
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Xuan Zun?

256
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
You mean the great Xuan Zun Bai Jiusi?

257
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
You are not his person.

258
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Who are you?

259
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Give me back the ring.

260
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
This is yours?

261
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Give it back.

262
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Who are you?

263
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Jing Yun Sect.

264
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Zhang Sun.

265
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Zhang Sun.

266
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Zhang Sun?

267
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
You are Li Qingyue's senior?

268
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Let's go.

269
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Why are you following me?

270
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
My things are still with you.

271
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Give it back to me.

272
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Where did you get this?

273
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Where is Jia Chuan?

274
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
You are very interested in my things.

275
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
You just mentioned Qingyue's name.

276
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
You know her.

277
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Where is she?

278
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Where is she?

279
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Why are you looking for her?

280
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
She is in danger.

281
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Master's old skill is very good.

282
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Now, it is more powerful and more powerful.

283
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
It is very hard to recover completely.

284
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Master.

285
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Master.

286
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Master.

287
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Master.

288
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Master.

289
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Master.

290
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Master.

291
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
Master.

292
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Master.

293
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
A mysterious rồizye filling.

294
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
TheďSal dla Charlie Lu

295
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
has found a solution.

296
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,620
Its breakfast is very difficult

297
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
to find.

298
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
What do we need?

299
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
take it into the bed

300
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
and smooth the nogetre

301
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,400
and clean the pepper

302
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
bleed your body

303
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,260
But these medicines are everywhere.

304
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,860
There is still a way to survive.

305
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,620
Let Longyuan Immortal go there,

306
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,180
it's not a difficult thing to do.

307
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:22,300
The result of the chaos is that the snake retreats are the real difficulties.

308
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,900
The general snake retreats are still unfilial to the master.

309
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,420
It must be a snake retreat that is not a snake.

310
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:35,580
And it must be the skin that was pushed when it was shaped.

311
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,220
A snake?

312
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,940
There are still the original gods.

313
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,780
The snake is not a human or a beast.

314
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,900
The original gods in the snake's nile palace are the gods of the heavens.

315
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,500
With the power of the real source in the nile palace,

316
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,180
when the chicken garden is destroyed,

317
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,780
the thunder will be destroyed and the meat will be left to the body.

318
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,940
In the end, the real source of the nile palace was released.

319
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,860
The snake retreats into the nile and becomes the real snake.

320
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,540
If it's not a snake, then it's not a snake.

321
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,460
The snake that is not a snake is different from the normal snake.

322
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,620
The snake retreats are also different from the normal snake.

323
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,740
Why haven't you mentioned this in the past?

324
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,140
Master also never hurt the need for...

325
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,980
After seeing this show recently...

326
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,740
he has suddenly washed away all the weapons that brought a snake away.

327
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:33,860
It seems thaturing the animal with anotherexplosion from the snake is away to the body.

328
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,000
I just didn't dare to find it.

329
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
regon layer isaganum.

330
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,060
The pure snake and the deer outfit come from Cassanza Slas.

331
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,740
I'm too old to find the one I want.

332
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,740
What did he say?

333
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,740
Madam...

334
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,740
Li Qingyue was arrested by the Dragon King.

335
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,740
You were injured before.

336
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,740
Dragon King took all the things.

337
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,740
Your wound!

338
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,740
After this war, you can leave the family.

339
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,740
Okay.

340
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,740
You're not leaving?

341
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,740
Since you know how to leave here,

342
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,740
why are you still locked up?

343
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,740
I'm not leaving. Of course I'm not leaving.

344
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,740
You just need to take care of your own path.

345
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
Don't ask around.

346
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,740
I'm sorry.

347
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,740
I'm sorry.

348
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,740
Don't ask around.

349
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,740
I'll leave.

350
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,740
Wait.

351
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,740
Go east.

352
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,740
The wind blows 3,000 miles.

353
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,740
You can go wherever you want.

354
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,740
Thank you.

355
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,740
You're welcome.

356
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,740
What are you doing?

357
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,740
Verses...

358
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,460
Take a break!

359
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,360
Hello regulator, be careful!

360
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,380
Let's kill him!

361
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,080
Hurry!

362
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,780
Get away!

363
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,680
Come on!

364
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,100
Come on!

365
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,580
Let's kill him.

366
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,420
to sting dead biscuit

367
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,140
Workshop

368
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,420
I hate you the most

369
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,400
It's your destiny to come here today

370
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,540
Who are youления

371
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,380
to make your name

372
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,900
You are so short

373
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,800
on front of the depends

374
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
You don't have the guts to build a base?

375
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Kid

376
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,680
Do you have wine?

377
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,820
Wow

378
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,060
Bad boy

379
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,300
You let water to wash100%

380
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,860
Don't go

381
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,960
Throw away the dead goat

382
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,440
You killed him?

383
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,000
Yes

384
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,940
There are yeahunty reviewed

385
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,620
But there is no weakness in processing

386
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,620
You can do whatever you want.

387
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,620
There's no need to waste so much.

388
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,620
You...

389
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,620
got hurt?

390
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,620
You're kidding me?

391
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,620
Who can hurt me?

392
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,620
You got hurt badly.

393
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,620
I didn't get hurt.

394
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,620
You're a pervert.

395
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,620
You're a criminal.

396
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,620
You have too many questions.

397
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,620
Get out.

398
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,620
Someone told me that

399
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,620
the three thousand miles of the Yufeng River

400
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,620
reached the Canglei Hall.

401
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,620
But I haven't seen it for a long time.

402
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,620
You've been in the Canglei Hall for so long.

403
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,620
Do you know where it is?

404
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,620
The Canglei Hall is the residence of Bai Jiu Si.

405
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,620
Why are you going there?

406
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,620
To find someone.

407
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,620
To find Bai Jiu Si?

408
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,620
I know Yu'er well.

409
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,620
He's a very arrogant person.

410
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,620
He's a good guy.

411
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,620
He's a good guy.

412
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
You're a little man.

413
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,620
I'm not afraid that he'll kill you.

414
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,620
You don't want to say it.

415
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,620
Three, two, one.

416
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,620
Go.

417
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,620
You little brat.

418
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,620
Do you want to go out?

419
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,620
I can help you.

420
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,620
But you have to promise me one thing.

421
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,620
Are you here to save me?

422
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,620
Do you think I'm a dead fairy?

423
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,620
When did you get along well with Hong Lian?

424
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,620
In the environment,

425
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,620
in the Lan Yue House,

426
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,620
you've already discussed it when the jade hair is needed.

427
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,620
I don't understand what you mean.

428
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,620
It's been a long time since I've played with you.

429
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,620
When are you going to kill me?

430
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,620
I'm not.

431
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,620
We're so close.

432
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,620
I lost the jade hair in the red lotus battle.

433
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,620
But you can control such a strong fire.

434
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,620
I'm sure you've already made a good deal with Hong Lian.

435
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,620
You helped him to show up with the jade hair.

436
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,620
He helped you to get through the window.

437
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,620
He helped you to get the magic power.

438
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,620
You said you weren't the dead fairy.

439
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,620
Then tell me.

440
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,620
Where did your fire come from?

441
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,620
Speak.

442
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,620
What are you doing happening?

443
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,620
Everything's been ahead of me.

444
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,620
It looks like the變 into没事ity.

445
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,620
Just where do you find your timid发 날?

446
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,620
What did you say then?

447
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,620
I did tell you very carefully.

448
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,620
I can't tell you all the rites.

449
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,620
Well.

450
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,620
When I saw Xuan Zi's illness,

451
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,620
I only had one thought.

452
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,620
It was that I didn't want to save you.

453
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,620
I just didn't expect...

454
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,620
I didn't expect that I would end up being a criminal.

455
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,620
Xuan Zi, I want to save you.

456
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,620
Am I wrong?

457
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,620
It seems that you have made up your mind.

458
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,620
You don't want to tell me the truth, do you?

459
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,620
Xuan Zi, you have already made up your mind.

460
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,620
Why are you trying to run away from me?

461
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,620
You and I are both waste of time.

462
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,620
Waste of time?

463
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:33,620
Indeed, it is indeed waste of time to be with you for so long.

464
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,620
A-Yun, we have both good and bad methods.

465
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,620
We have to fight each other.

466
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,620
Whoever gets hit by a window,

467
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,620
the other party will be able to do the same.

468
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,620
I will ask you one last time.

469
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,620
What are you planning?

470
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,620
If you want to admit it, I will stop.

471
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,620
Before I answer,

472
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,620
can you answer me one question first?

473
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,620
It's me.

474
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,620
The reason Xuan Zi treats me so well

475
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,620
is because I love you.

476
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,620
I love you.

477
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,620
Listen,

478
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,620
I am Li Qin Yue.

479
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,620
My family lives in the foot of Yufan Mountain.

480
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
My father is Li's mother, Xinjiang.

481
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,620
I was born in the Jinming Sect.

482
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,620
I have been practicing for 11 years.

483
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,620
I married into the Canglei Hall when I was 19.

484
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,620
I became the wife of the great Cheng Xuan.

485
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,620
I have my own friends.

486
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,620
I have my own anger and anger.

487
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,620
I also have my own life.

488
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,620
I am Li Qin Yue.

489
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,620
I will always be Li Qin Yue.

490
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,620
You are not my wife.

491
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,620
Do you insist on me being the witness?

492
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,620
How dare you to choose the right person to be the witness?

493
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,620
I just want my life.

494
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,620
I will do it myself.

495
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,620
I will do it myself.

496
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,620
I will do it myself.

497
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,620
I will do it myself.

498
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,620
I will do it myself.

499
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,620
I will do it myself.

500
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,620
I will do it myself.

501
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,620
I will do it myself.

502
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,620
I will do it myself.

503
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,620
I will do it myself.

504
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,620
I will do it myself.

505
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,620
I will do it myself.

506
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,620
The world has never been so beautiful.

507
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,620
Master.

508
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,620
Li Mo said you were badly injured and the enemy is shouting.

509
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,620
Master, you don't have to worry about it.

510
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,620
Just leave these things to the disciple.

511
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,620
Master Yuan, what is wrong with Madam?

512
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,620
Madam is sick and has a fever.

513
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,620
She is not well.

514
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,620
She is cold.

515
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
You just watch her...

516
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,620
Master, what is wrong?

517
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,620
Close her up to Yue Wuyuan.

518
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,620
Thank you, Master.

519
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Let go.

520
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,620
Don't move.

521
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,620
What are you doing?

522
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,620
Kid, your trick is here.

523
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,620
From now on,

524
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,620
you have to remember every word I say.

525
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,620
My surname is Xiao,

526
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620
I am from Jingshan.

527
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620
I am from Nengdhi, Nanyu.

528
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,620
My parents are ordinary people.

529
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,620
I was 21 years old.

530
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,620
I was born and raised in a family.

531
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,620
I was killed by the enemy.

532
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,620
I was a family member of the enemy.

533
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:40,620
So, I learned the way to revenge for my hatred.

534
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,620
But my disciple is so arrogant and always makes me feel bad.

535
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,620
I went to the mountain in the fourth year.

536
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,620
I have been practicing alone since then.

537
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,620
I have learned the way to kill myself.

538
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,620
I have been in the mountain for a long time.

539
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,620
I have been in the mountain for a long time.

540
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,620
What are you talking about?

541
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,620
You have to pay respect to me.

542
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,620
I will tell you my identity.

543
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,620
Who will pay respect to you?

544
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,620
I...

545
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,620
You are so stubborn.

546
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:21,620
Who is the one who went outside the dream?

547
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,620
I want to be a big man in the mountain.

548
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
I can also have a disciple.

549
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,620
I can also have a disciple.

550
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,620
I can't pay respect to you.

551
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,620
I will show you my true identity.

552
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:41,620
Let's take a moment to give a picture to the master first.

553
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,620
Okay, okay.

554
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,620
I am done.

555
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,620
I have decided to use this sword technique

556
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,620
to make the sword master's sword.

557
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,620
I can use it to make the sword master's sword.

558
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,620
I will make a sword master's sword.

559
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,620
I will make it.

560
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,620
I will make it.

561
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,620
I will make it.

562
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,620
I will make it.

563
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,620
I have decided to pass this sword technique to you.

564
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,620
After you have grown up,

565
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,620
you can leave Taiyi Palace.

566
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,620
Kid, I will only show you once.

567
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,620
You can see it clearly.

568
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,620
The wind blows through the fields.

569
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,620
The spirit power will be weakened.

570
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,620
The word is so powerful.

571
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,620
Taiyuan, Wind and Sun.

572
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,620
This...

573
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,620
Kid, did you see it clearly?

574
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,620
Your sword technique is very excellent.

575
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,620
What is your name?

576
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,620
I haven't thought about it yet.

577
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,620
Do you have any enemies?

578
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,620
I have one.

579
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,620
It's a good name.

580
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,620
Who?

581
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,620
The great city's master, Bai Jiu Si.

582
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,620
Okay.

583
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,620
That's called the Sword Master's Sword.

584
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,620
You...

585
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,620
What are you shouting?

586
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,620
I will pass the technique to you.

587
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,620
You have grown up.

588
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,620
Hurry.

589
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,620
Master, I have something to ask for.

590
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,620
The Xuan Jun has opened his mouth.

591
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,620
But the Longyuan County Army is the one who keeps people away.

592
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,620
But now, our lady is locked in the dungeon.

593
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,620
You go and let her go.

594
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,620
Yes.

595
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,620
You can't do that.

596
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,620
Get out.

597
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,620
I have a message for you.

598
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,620
You are not qualified to stay here.

599
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,620
An rabbit, you are my greatest weapon.

600
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,620
How can you fly, master?

601
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,620
speaking of a snake,

602
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,620
how is it unique?

603
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,620
the google translate says it's叫 The Box gone.

604
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,620
Buy him a new weapon.

605
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,620
It's a beautiful witch.

606
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,620
имеет ut la,

607
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,620
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

608
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,620
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

609
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,620
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

610
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,620
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

611
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,620
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

612
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,620
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

613
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,620
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

614
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,620
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

615
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,620
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

616
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,620
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

617
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,620

I'm not sure if I can get through this.

619
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,620
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

620
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,620
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

621
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:30,140
There aren't many explanation points behind a Nine Copper

622
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,140
materials.

623
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,740
Now that we have it.

624
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,980
There aren't many explanation points behind a Nine Copper

625
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,140

Now that we have it.

627
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,180
Now that we have it.

628
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,460
Let's take an obstacle.

629
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,340
Let's go.

630
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,620
Make sure you don't count it as an obstacle.

631
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,280
I can do something wrong.

632
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,700
I damaged you several times.

633
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,060
I'm sure he's going to have bad luck

634
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,720
if he does something again.

635
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,360
Please don't give engaging help

636
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,620
I'm not sure if I can make it.

637
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,620
