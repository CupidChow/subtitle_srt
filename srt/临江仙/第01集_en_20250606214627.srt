1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,080
Well, you can use the Poker's

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,500
before I go...

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,020
and also I need the

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,560
Yui for the Rï¿½ goodness

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:29,660
.

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,660
I'm not sure if I can make it.

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,660
I'll try to make it.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,660
I'll try to make it.

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,660
I'll try to make it.

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,660
I'll try to make it.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,660
I'll try to make it.

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,660
I'll try to make it.

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,660
I'll try to make it.

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,660
I'll try to make it.

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
I'll try to make it.

16
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,660
I'll try to make it.

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,660
I'll try to make it.

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,660
I'll try to make it.

19
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,660
I'll try to make it.

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,660
I'll try to make it.

21
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,660
I'll try to make it.

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,660
I'll try to make it.

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,660
I'll try to make it.

24
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,660
I'll try to make it.

25
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,660
I'll try to make it.

26
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,660
I'll try to make it.

27
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,660
I'll try to make it.

28
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,660
I'll try to make it.

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,660
I'll try to make it.

30
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,660
I'll try to make it.

31
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,660
I'll try to make it.

32
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,660
I'll try to make it.

33
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,660
I'll try to make it.

34
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,660
I'll try to make it.

35
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,660
I'll try to make it.

36
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,660
I'll try to make it.

37
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,660
I'll try to make it.

38
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,660
I'll try to make it.

39
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,660
I'll make it.

40
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,660
I'll try to make it.

41
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,660
I'll try to make it.

42
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,660
I'll try to make it.

43
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,660
I'll try to make it.

44
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,660
I'll try to make it.

45
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,660
I'll try to make it.

46
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,660
I'll try to make it.

47
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,540
The same 400 series, two hundred million super clear, real-life,

48
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,220
you should watch Lin Jiang Xian.

49
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,820
The 32nd year of cultivation,

50
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,460
the real subject is the old household business.

51
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,660
Nanfu battery, you should watch Lin Jiang Xian.

52
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,940
Find the state, buy the cave, come back.

53
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,580
Buy the cave, you should watch Lin Jiang Xian.

54
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,100
The master of the world is the master of the cultivators.

55
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,300
The Jingyun Sect is the hands of the ancestors of the cultivation.

56
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,900
And I, Li Qingyue, entered the sect for 11 years.

57
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,940
He is still a disciple of the martial arts master.

58
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,540
In the painting,

59
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,100
if you don't take the responsibility, you will be a great man.

60
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,100
I believe that I will become a master of the cultivators.

61
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,300
I will never do the green leaves in other people's stories.

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,100
Get up early tomorrow.

63
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,500
Okay.

64
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,100
You are my master.

65
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,500
You are the first disciple of the three thousand disciples.

66
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,780
You are the next master of the cultivators of the Jingyun Sect,

67
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,380
who is the first to cultivate in the sect.

68
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,140
You are not thinking of cultivating.

69
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,900
You are colluding with the evil people.

70
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,940
You are the evil people of the Yin Lian Sect.

71
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,540
Do you know your mistake?

72
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,820
I don't know.

73
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,180
Get up.

74
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,420
Senior.

75
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,980
The master colludes with the evil sect.

76
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,140
Let me go.

77
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,940
I will clean up the sect today.

78
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,060
Senior.

79
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,620
Do you think that the master of the cultivators really colludes with the evil women?

80
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,340
Don't look behind others.

81
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,060
Close the door.

82
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,500
Okay.

83
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,340
Who dares to break into the Jingyun Sect?

84
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,780
Qingyue.

85
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,220
Are you okay?

86
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,540
Yes.

87
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,140
I will go to the temple. You will be fine.

88
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,700
Okay.

89
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,060
Okay.

90
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,220
I am your master of the cultivators.

91
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,060
I will treat you as a human being.

92
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,140
But you are not good enough for the cultivators.

93
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,140
Then I will show you

94
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,140
what the real evil sect is.

95
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,140
A Man.

96
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,860
Stop.

97
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,660
Brother Long. I will take you now.

98
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,140
Follow me.

99
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,660
Be careful. Stay here.

100
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,180
Clear?

101
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,180
Senior.

102
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,220
Master Yun.

103
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,300
rut personally,

104
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,660
Qingyue!

105
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,660
Qingyue!

106
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
Qingyue!

107
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,660
Qingyue!

108
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,660
Qingyue!

109
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,660
Senior!

110
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,660
Senior!

111
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,660
Senior!

112
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,660
Qingyue!

113
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,660
Qingyue!

114
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,660
Wake up!

115
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,660
You're awake?

116
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,660
Senior Changpian...

117
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Come, come, come. Sit down. Sit down.

118
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,660
How is it? Is it better?

119
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,660
Alright, let's go to the door of the handkerchief.

120
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,660
It's your turn today.

121
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
What?

122
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,660
What? Why are you standing there?

123
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,660
Hurry up and leave.

124
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,660
Senior, I'm not that good at the door of the handkerchief.

125
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,660
What should I do?

126
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
If you don't go, I'll go for you.

127
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,660
Then I'll have to trouble you.

128
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Why am I so unlucky?

129
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,660
Didn't my master give you all the pills?

130
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,660
Why haven't you recovered yet?

131
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,660
Don't worry too much.

132
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
My master has already given birth.

133
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,660
Your wound will heal soon.

134
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,660
I won't delay the discussion.

135
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
I'll go.

136
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,660
Senior, can I trouble you?

137
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,660
I'm telling you.

138
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,660
The demon girl in the Demon Sect, right?

139
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,660
The demon girl in the Demon Sect was knocked out.

140
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,660
She was hit by the door.

141
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,660
She was hit by a group of crows.

142
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,660
She even dared to come to my gym to lie.

143
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,660
She didn't even try to light up her own weight.

144
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,660
But Senior Meng Chu is so miserable.

145
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,660
I'm afraid she'll be punished severely.

146
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,660
Do you know what the magic weapon that demon girl took in her hand that day?

147
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,660
The sword called Zi Yue Wan Sword.

148
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,660
It was the sword that Niulang Mountain's Huangye Prefecture, Fan Xiaojiao, personally used to use.

149
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,660
Do you know who Fan Xiaojiao is?

150
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,660
Two hundred years ago, he was trained to be a master of the flying world.

151
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,660
I heard from his disciples that

152
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,660
after he was trained to be a master,

153
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,660
he had a dream to tell his junior brother

154
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,660
that he has now lost his image of the Great Chen Xuan Sun.

155
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,660
Can you help me?

156
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,660
Let me tell you.

157
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,660
The Great Chen Xuan Sun is not a mortal.

158
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,660
I'm thirsty.

159
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,660
His magic power is so powerful.

160
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,660
I'm thirsty.

161
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,660
I'm thirsty.

162
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,660
You should rest well first.

163
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,660
I have something to do.

164
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
If you have anything, you can come to me.

165
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,660
I'm leaving now.

166
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,660
Don't go.

167
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,660
Senior Brother.

168
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,660
Senior Brother!

169
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,660
Senior Brother.

170
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,660
I'm Qingyang's disciple Li Qingyue.

171
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,660
I was hurt by the demon that was accidentally touched by the demon.

172
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,660
I was in a coma.

173
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,660
I went to the single room to get the medicine.

174
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,660
The senior brother said that

175
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
it was best if you sold the gold to me.

176
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
He asked me to come to see you.

177
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
I could only get it after I saw it.

178
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,660
Senior Brother.

179
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Senior Brother.

180
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,660
Senior Brother.

181
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,660
Senior Brother.

182
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
Senior Brother.

183
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Senior Brother.

184
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,660
Senior Brother.

185
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,660
Senior Brother.

186
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,660
Senior Brother.

187
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,660
Senior Brother.

188
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
Senior Brother.

189
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,660
I can only get the medicine after I see it.

190
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,660
Senior Brother.

191
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,660
Senior Brother.

192
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,660
Senior Brother.

193
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,660
What's the matter?

194
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,660
Yes.

195
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,660
I was hurt.

196
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
I came to see you.

197
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,660
You were hurt?

198
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,660
Yes.

199
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,660
Yes.

200
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,660
Senior Brother was trapped on the sacred stage.

201
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,660
He was in a coma.

202
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,660
He suffered so much.

203
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,660
I don't know if he had any old wounds.

204
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,660
The sect leader doesn't care about me anymore.

205
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,660
I'm not in a hurry to go to the market.

206
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,660
I'd rather go see him.

207
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,660
I'll go with him.

208
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,660
Senior Brother.

209
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,660
Senior Brother.

210
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,660
Senior Brother.

211
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,660
My master cured you.

212
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,660
If you're still upset,

213
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,660
go to the small village to find gold and grass.

214
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,660
Senior Brother.

215
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
Senior Brother.

216
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,660
I'll give you a hand.

217
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,660
Oh, my god.

218
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,660
Senior Brother.

219
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,660
It's none of my business.

220
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
I don't know.

221
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,660
No.

222
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,660
Qingyu is still ill.

223
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,660
Senior Brother.

224
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,660
Senior Brother.

225
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
Senior Brother.

226
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,660
Senior Brother.

227
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,660
Senior Brother.

228
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
Senior Brother.

229
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,660
Senior Brother.

230
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,660
Senior Brother.

231
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,660
Senior Brother.

232
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,660
Senior Brother.

233
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,660
Senior Brother.

234
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
Senior Brother.

235
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,660
Senior Brother.

236
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,660
Senior Brother.

237
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,660
Senior Brother.

238
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,660
Senior Brother.

239
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
Help! I don't want water!

240
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,660
No!

241
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,660
Senior Brother.

242
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,660
The light that saved me just now

243
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,660
was born first.

244
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,660
Watch out!

245
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,660
Senior Brother.

246
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,660
I'll give you a hand.

247
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,660
Are you okay?

248
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,660
That monkey is very dark.

249
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,660
He's very hurt.

250
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,660
You have to be careful.

251
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,660
The mortal body?

252
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,660
I really didn't mean to take advantage of you.

253
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,660
Who are you?

254
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,660
I'm Li Qingyue, the head of the Yufan Mountain.

255
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,660
I'm a famous person.

256
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,660
Bai.

257
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,660
Ninth.

258
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Fourth.

259
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,660
Thank you for your help today.

260
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,660
I was worried that the monkey would break into Xianyou.

261
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,660
Please forgive me.

262
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,660
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

263
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,660
What?

264
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,660
I'm sorry.

265
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,660
What did you say?

266
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,660
I know.

267
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,660
I'll take care of you.

268
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
Take care of you?

269
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
Wait a day.

270
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,660
I'll come to pick you up tomorrow.

271
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,660
I'll be back.

272
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,660
Li Qingyue.

273
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,660
Is this my Tianjiang chicken?

274
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
What are you eating?

275
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,660
The herbs I picked myself.

276
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,660
I'll eat it.

277
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,660
Don't look at the painting of Chi Nanyuan.

278
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,660
Senior.

279
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,660
What's the matter?

280
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,660
I have something to ask you.

281
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
Do you know how much I need?

282
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,660
Add here.

283
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
Aren't you a member of the harem?

284
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,660
What?

285
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
I'm a true lover.

286
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
sheetworks is a man's heart.

287
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,660
If there's no trust in the sheets,

288
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,660
she's not able to fix it all.

289
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,660
What about you?

290
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,660
No need.

291
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
I'm worried about this.

292
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,660
Bai Jiu Si!

293
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Are you here?

294
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,660
Bai Jiu Si!

295
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,660
Bai Jiu Si!

296
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,660
What is this?

297
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
This is all my family's stuff.

298
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,660
All the things I have in here.

299
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
What do you want?

300
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,660
To give you a gift.

301
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,660
There are a few things.

302
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,660
But I can swear to the heavens.

303
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,660
I really have all my family's stuff.

304
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,660
There's no hidden ones.

305
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,660
Why did you give it to me?

306
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,660
To be responsible for you.

307
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,660
Bai Jiu Si!

308
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
Ah Yun.

309
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,660
How many words can you say?

310
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,660
You're really close.

311
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,660
I admit that you're really pretty.

312
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
I have some complex feelings.

313
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,660
But the words are said that no matter what,

314
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,660
the truth is very important.

315
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,660
I'll kiss you.

316
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,660
Then I'll definitely be responsible for your family's stuff.

317
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,660
Who are you?

318
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,660
Look at my memory.

319
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,660
I forgot to introduce my family.

320
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
My family lives in the Yufan Mountain.

321
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,660
My parents passed away in the mess.

322
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,660
I was born in the Jinyun Sect.

323
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,660
I'm now 11 years old.

324
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,660
I'm currently a disciple of the Shou Shan Sect.

325
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,660
If you dislike my status as a lowly person,

326
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,660
and don't need me to be responsible,

327
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,660
I won't force you.

328
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,660
I'm just doing what I should do.

329
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,660
I'm all yours.

330
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,660
It's okay.

331
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,660
If you don't mind,

332
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,660
I'll go back first.

333
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,660
I've got the divorce.

334
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,660
Let's go.

335
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,660
You want to go back to the Jinyun Sect with me?

336
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,660
I've received your divorce.

337
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,660
Of course, it's yours.

338
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,660
What?

339
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,660
Are you unwilling to go back with me?

340
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,660
Our sect is not convenient to talk about foreigners.

341
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,660
Why don't you go home first and tell your parents first?

342
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,660
I have no parents.

343
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,660
I have no relatives.

344
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,660
It's okay.

345
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,660
You have me in the future.

346
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,660
I'm usually alone, so I don't have much to say.

347
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,660
Wait for me.

348
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,660
I'll pack up soon.

349
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,660
Qingyue.

350
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,660
Qingyue.

351
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,660
It's your turn today.

352
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,660
You're late.

353
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,660
I'm late, Senior.

354
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,660
You go first.

355
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,660
I'll go change.

356
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,660
I'm going.

357
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,660
He...

358
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,660
I can't see anyone like this?

359
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,660
No.

360
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,660
Now no one knows that I'm hiding someone in the house.

361
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,660
Why?

362
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,660
To be honest,

363
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,660
our sect leader recently received a letter from Senior Meng

364
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,660
from the demon girl.

365
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,660
At this time,

366
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,660
he can't let her know that you have me.

367
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,660
Since that,

368
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,660
why do you try to force me?

369
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,660
I'm not a demon.

370
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,660
Why do you try to force me?

371
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,660
I thought it was to be responsible for you.

372
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,660
To force you first, to express your feelings.

373
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,660
And to get married in two months.

374
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,660
I didn't expect you to come back today.

375
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,660
You have to be careful these days.

376
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,660
You can't let others see you.

377
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,660
Or else, they'll say that I only care about my love.

378
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,660
I can't stay here anymore.

379
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,660
So you want me to be free?

380
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,660
Don't worry.

381
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,660
I'll give you my name as soon as possible.

382
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,660
I just have to make you feel a little bit better.

383
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,660
Are you hungry?

384
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,660
Dianxi?

385
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,660
Then you eat first.

386
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,660
I'm going to the mountain gate.

387
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,660
Aren't you afraid that I'll be the demon

388
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,660
and make you step on Senior Meng's back?

389
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,660
I'm just a little disciple of a bitter and bitter man.

390
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,660
How can I compare with Senior Meng as a little disciple?

391
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,660
Besides, you saved me and that spirit monkey.

392
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,660
I know you're not a demon.

393
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,660
People, can you give me a taste of theì uncle?

394
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,660
Yes.

395
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,660
This is quite tasty.

396
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,660
I'm weakened by my stomachs recently.

397
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,660
This hook is really not good.

398
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,660
Because dumb, you have it to say.

399
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,460
I'm going to eat it.

400
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,260
I'm going to eat it.

401
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,960
Eat it.

402
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,060
Okay.

403
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,560
Senior Li.

404
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,760
Why don't you wear the old clothes?

405
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,060
What are you going to do?

406
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,460
Just give me if you have the chance.

407
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,260
I want to bring...

408
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,260
something to do.

409
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,760
Okay. I'll go back and look for you later.

410
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,360
Thank you, Senior.

411
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,560
Okay.

412
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,660
I'm not going to wear other people's clothes.

413
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,660
What?

414
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,960
I can't leave the Sect Sect without my disciple,

415
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,660
so I can't buy you new clothes for a while.

416
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,160
Do you have any doubts?

417
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,960
I'm not going to wear them.

418
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,560
Then why can't you only wear one of these everyday?

419
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,860
Okay. I won't say.

420
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,060
I'll find time to buy you new clothes in Liu Xia Mountain.

421
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,160
Then you can eat first.

422
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,960
It's hard to eat.

423
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,360
No way. I think it's quite delicious.

424
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,960
You should try it first.

425
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,760
I won't eat it.

426
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,360
Then what do you want to eat?

427
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,760
Little Qiu Fruit.

428
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,460
Little Qiu Fruit is not ripe yet.

429
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,960
You can't keep eating it.

430
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,560
Okay.

431
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,360
If you don't eat it, or wear it, it's fine.

432
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,560
Then you can sleep. I'll make you bed.

433
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,760
You're not going to bed?

434
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
I'm just following the rules.

435
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,560
We're still going to have a talk.

436
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,160
Although it's not a real marriage, we can't sleep together.

437
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
I'm not going to sleep.

438
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,960
I'm not going to sleep.

439
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,560
I'm not going to sleep.

440
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,960
I'm not going to sleep.

441
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,960
I'm not going to sleep.

442
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Ah Yun.

443
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Are you so sure I won't hurt you?

444
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Senior Brother.

445
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,760
Senior Brother, drink some water first.

446
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,560
Junior Sister, don't come to see me again.

447
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,960
Then you're willing to be killed for her?

448
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,360
So death is not a regret.

449
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,560
I'm still here to persuade you not to be so insincere.

450
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,360
Actually, I always do this.

451
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,760
Senior Brother, don't worry.

452
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,560
I will definitely save you from death.

453
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,760
Senior Brother, don't come to see me again.

454
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,760
I'm not going to sleep.

455
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,760
I'm not going to sleep.

456
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,760
Senior Brother, my stomach hurts.

457
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Can you help me with something?

458
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,760
I want to go back to rest.

459
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,160
Why are you suddenly feeling dizzy? Let me take a look at you.

460
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,560
It's okay.

461
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,560
I was just too tired yesterday.

462
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,760
I'm going back first.

463
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,360
Qing Yue.

464
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,760
Qing Yue.

465
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,760
Luckily, Tian Liang Qian is back.

466
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,760
Slow down, Senior Brother. Hold on.

467
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Senior Sister.

468
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,760
You're here to catch us?

469
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,760
No.

470
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,760
It's true. If you catch us, you won't be able to come.

471
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
Then you're here to help us.

472
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
Mom, I know you're the most suspicious person.

473
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,760
Sister Qing Qing.

474
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,760
This Qing Yue...

475
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,760
It doesn't matter. Senior Brother Meng won't come with me.

476
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,760
I only have to force Feng Zhu to take her away.

477
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Help me take her out.

478
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
I'll take care of everything after we leave.

479
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
You just have to take her away.

480
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
That's not good.

481
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
Don't worry.

482
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
You're in danger.

483
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,760
I should be the one to do it.

484
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,760
I'm not that kind of person.

485
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
It's too late, Sister Qing Qing.

486
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Let's go.

487
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,760
I'm Qing Yue.

488
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,760
You're a traitor.

489
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
It doesn't matter to me.

490
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
It doesn't matter to me.

491
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Feng Zhu.

492
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,760
Qing Yue, take Senior Brother away.

493
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,760
Are you trying to remember my name?

494
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Yes.

495
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
Qing Yue.

496
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Are you here?

497
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:51,760
The

498
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,760
Sect Leader, I am the one who is to save you.

499
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,760
It has nothing to do with you.

500
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
Sister Li...

501
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Then I...

502
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Sister Li, this has nothing to do with you.

503
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
You may leave first.

504
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Senior Brother.

505
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
I am guilty alone.

506
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,760
I shouldn't have hurt anyone else.

507
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Please punish me.

508
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,760
I am the one who killed my disciple.

509
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Your sister Li is now in the hands of this demon girl.

510
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,760
Now she is not in the mood to save you.

511
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Is this kind of ungratefulness not enough to make you wake up?

512
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
I... I didn't...

513
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
You don't have to say it.

514
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,760
It's a matter of time.

515
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
You have your own standards.

516
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
I have my own judgment.

517
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Before you were trapped in the sect,

518
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
I was willing to close my heart.

519
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,760
But I was too late to teach you.

520
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,760
I was so tired that I was so tired.

521
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,760
I was so happy.

522
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,760
I can't stand it anymore.

523
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,760
Today, I killed and I lost.

524
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,760
I don't have any words for you.

525
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Sect Leader, you are the demon girl.

526
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Please punish me.

527
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,760
I am very clear.

528
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
Senior Brother.

529
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,760
There is still such a serious love in this world.

530
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
Good.

531
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,760
You are really very popular.

532
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,760
Just treat me as a disciple who has never been a disciple of you.

533
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,760
Today, I will do it myself.

534
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,760
So that you can be a disciple of me in the future.

535
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
Sect Leader.

536
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
Sect Leader.

537
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,760
We are in the same time as Senior Brother.

538
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
If you want to punish him,

539
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,760
let's punish him together.

540
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Us?

541
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,760
This is a matter of time.

542
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
I am really just passing by.

543
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
This matter is indeed related to Junior Sister Li.

544
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
No, Sect Leader.

545
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,760
I saw her being rude and hiding from other men.

546
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,760
Maybe it's the help of the evil sect.

547
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Sect Leader.

548
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
I...

549
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,760
Junior Sister.

550
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
I am really sorry.

551
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
I have to thank you.

552
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
I will definitely ask Master to forgive me.

553
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,760
This matter is none of your business.

554
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,760
I have no regrets when I can work with Senior Brother.

555
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,760
Junior Sister Li.

556
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,760
You really took away the people outside.

557
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,760
Junior Sister Li.

558
