00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,089
You must be careful.

172
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,130
A mortal?

173
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,690
I swear I didn't mean
to take advantage of you.

174
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,940
Who are you?

175
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,350
I'm Li Qingyue
from the Jingyun Sect on Yufan Mountain.

176
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,380
May I ask for your name?

177
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,400
Bai Jiusi.

178
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,480
Mr. Bai, thank you for your help today.

179
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,590
Just now, I was worried

180
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,510
that monkey might hurt you.

181
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,160
Please forgive me.

182
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,950
Is that all you have to say to me?

183
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,430
What do you mean?

184
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,120
I get it.
I'll take responsibility for you.

185
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,040
Take responsibility?

186
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,650
Wait for one day.
I'll come find you tomorrow.

187
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,350
Li Qingyue.

188
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,770
Is he the one for me?

189
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,330
What are you eating?

190
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,350
Some herbs I gathered myself.

191
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,360
[Tears of Sorrow]

192
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,490
Stop reading
these ridiculous romance tales.

193
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,570
Senior.

194
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,680
What's it?

195
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,130
I want to ask you something.

196
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,950
Do you know how much
the betrothal gift usually costs?

197
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,410
Cultivation before marriage, okay?

198
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,220
Don't get me wrong.

199
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,140
I'm just curious.

200
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,670
The betrothal gift
is simply a man's token of sincerity.

201
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,800
There's no fixed amount one must give.

202
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,710
It's far too soon for you

203
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,820
to worry about things like that.

204
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,790
Bai Jiusi.

205
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,620
Are you here?

206
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,180
Bai Jiusi!

207
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,610
What is this?

208
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,430
Everything of value

209
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,600
I've saved over the years is in there.

210
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,100
What for?

211
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,260
It's my betrothal gift for you.

212
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,140
It's not much,

213
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,980
but I swear to the heavens

214
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,740
this is everything I own.

215
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Nothing more.

216
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,810
Why give it to me?

217
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,740
To take responsibility for you.

218
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,700
Yue.

219
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,780
Do you ever speak honestly?

220
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,410
You're calling me so sweetly.

221
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,230
I admit, you're very good-looking.

222
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,910
I am a little tempted.

223
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,670
But the storybooks say

224
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,300
chastity is equally important
for men and women.

225
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,460
Since I kissed you,

226
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,960
I must protect your good name.

227
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,400
Who are you really?

228
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,920
Ah! Look at me.

229
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,440
I forgot to introduce myself properly.

230
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,440
My home is at the foot of Yufan Mountain.

231
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,960
My parents died
during a great upheaval when I was young.

232
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,640
I joined the Jingyun Sect
at the age of eight.

233
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,300
It's been 11 years since then.

234
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,520
I'm just a gatekeeper now.

235
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,320
If you think my status is too low

236
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,970
and don't want to marry me,

237
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,860
I won't insist.

238
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,830
I'm only doing what I believe is right.

239
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,980
The choice is yours.

240
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,990
It's fine.

241
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,730
If you're unwilling, just forget it.

242
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,490
I'll head back then.

243
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,230
I've accepted it.

244
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,280
Let's go.

245
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,420
To the Jingyun Sect?

246
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,630
I took your betrothal gift.

247
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,940
Naturally, I'm yours now.

248
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,710
What's wrong?

249
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,060
You don't want me to go back with you?

250
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,770
The sect doesn't usually
take in outsiders.

251
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,070
How about you head home

252
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,510
and let your parents know about this?

253
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,510
I have no parents.

254
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,760
No family, no friends.

255
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,770
It's okay. From now on, you have me.

256
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,030
I live alone,

257
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,490
so it's a bit of a mess here.

258
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,070
Wait for me a moment.
I'll tidy up right away.

259
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,560
Qingyue.

260
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,100
Qingyue, it's your shift today.

261
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,330
You're already late.

262
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,660
Okay, Senior.

263
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,580
You go ahead.
I'll change and be right there.

264
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,250
He...

265
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,810
Are you so ashamed of me?

266
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,450
It's not like that.

267
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,490
I can't let anyone know

268
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,210
I'm hiding someone in my room.

269
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:12,240
Why not?

270
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,960
I'll be honest with you.

271
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,240
The sect leader

272
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,830
is distressed
over Senior Meng's collusion

273
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,930
with a demon girl.

274
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,510
We can't let him
know about us at this time.

275
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,810
If that's the case,

276
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,880
why did you give me the betrothal gift?

277
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,420
I wanted to take responsibility for you.

278
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,310
I planned to show my sincerity
with the betrothal gift

279
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,240
and then marry you in a month or two.

280
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,070
I didn't expect you
to come back with me today.

281
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,140
Anyway, you need to be careful these days.

282
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,540
Don't let anyone see you.

283
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,280
Or they'll say

284
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,920
I care only about romance

285
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,810
and neglect my fellow disciples.

286
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,620
Then I won't be able
to stay in this sect anymore.

287
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,290
So you want me to remain…

288
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,030
unacknowledged?

289
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,110
Don't worry.

290
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
I'll give you
a proper place by my side soon.

291
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,930
It's just that
you have to stay hidden for now.

292
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,130
You must be hungry.

293
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Have some snacks.

294
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,700
You eat. I'm going to guard the gate.

295
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,780
Aren't you afraid I'm a demon too,

296
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,380
and you'll end up like your Senior Meng?

297
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,030
I'm just an

298
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,350
insignificant gate-guarding disciple.

299
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:58,880
How could I

300
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,680
compare to someone
as outstanding as Senior Meng?

301
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,140
Besides,

302
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,920
you saved me and that spirit monkey.

303
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,730
I know you're not a demon.

304
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,150
Why are you eating so much?

305
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,270
My appetite has been really good lately.

306
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,000
Your cultivation is not so good,

307
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,130
but your appetite sure ranks top tier.

308
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,810
Senior.

309
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,670
Do you have any old clothes
you don't need anymore?

310
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,410
Why?

311
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,200
If you have some,
give them to me. I want to…

312
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,140
make something.

313
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,520
Alright, I'll check when I get back.

314
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,240
Thank you.

315
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,960
I don't wear others' clothes.

316
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,400
I'm not allowed

317
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,530
to leave the sect without permission.

318
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,310
I can't just head down

319
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,310
the mountain to buy you new clothes.

320
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,640
Please make do with these.

321
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,240
No.

322
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,530
You can't wear
the same clothes every day, can you?

323
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,950
Alright, forget it.

324
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,290
I'll sneak down the mountain
to buy you new clothes.

325
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,870
For now, eat something.

326
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,560
It's awful.

327
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,270
No way. I think it's pretty good.

328
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,310
Why don't you try it first?

329
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,220
No.

330
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,170
Then what do you want to eat?

331
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,030
Xiaoqiu Berries.

332
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,940
Xiaoqiu Berries
on Xiaoqiu Mountain aren't ripe yet.

333
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,870
You can't keep starving yourself.

334
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,670
Fine.

335
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,880
Anything you say.

336
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,860
Go to sleep. I've made the bed for you.

337
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,170
Aren't you sleeping on the bed?

338
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,890
I know how to behave.

339
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,120
We haven't had our wedding yet,

340
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,830
so we're not officially married.

341
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,230
We can't sleep together.

342
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,830
Yue.

343
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,020
Are you so sure I won't harm you?

344
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,500
Senior.

345
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,320
Senior, have some water.

346
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,160
Junior.

347
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,920
Don't come to see me again.

348
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,560
So you're willing
to be executed by the sect for her?

349
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,550
Even in death,

350
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,180
I have no regrets.

351
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,260
I'm here trying to persuade you to let go,

352
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,920
yet I'm no different myself.

353
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,570
Senior, don't worry.

354
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,540
I'll find a way to save you.

355
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,120
Senior, my stomach hurts a little.

356
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,240
Could you cover for me for a bit?

357
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,290
I'd like to head back and rest.

358
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,780
All of a sudden? Let me check on you.

359
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,440
I'm fine.

360
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,990
I just ate too much yesterday.

361
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,610
I'll head back first.

362
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,780
Qingyue.

363
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,740
Thank god I made it back before dawn.

364
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,990
Slow down, Senior. Hang in there.

365
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,710
Senior Lyu.

366
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,190
You're here to capture us?

367
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,190
No.

368
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,360
Indeed.

369
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,870
They wouldn't have sent you to catch us.

370
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,900
Then you're here to help us.

371
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,580
I knew I could count on you.

372
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,540
Junior Qingxin.

373
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,840
It's Qingyue.

374
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,500
Doesn't matter.

375
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,780
Senior Meng wouldn't leave with me,

376
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,320
so I had to seal his meridians by force

377
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,260
and bring him here.

378
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,720
Help me get him out of here.

379
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:13,860
Come on.

380
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,840
I'll clear the path and cover the rear.

381
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,360
You just need to take him away.

382
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,360
This doesn't seem right.

383
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,960
Don't worry. You're weak.

384
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,840
It's only right

385
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,100
that I handle the dangerous part.

386
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,000
That's not what I mean.

387
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,050
There's no time, Qingxin.

388
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:24,750
Let's go.

389
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,940
My name is Qingyue.

390
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,290
You ungrateful brat!

391
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,260
How dare you try to escape?

392
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,180
Wait.

393
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,320
This has nothing to do with me!

394
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,670
Hold him steady!

395
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,740
Qingyue, take Senior Meng and go.

396
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,110
Now you remember my name.

397
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,400
Qingyue, are you there?

398
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,150
Sect Leader, it was my decision
to save Senior Meng.

399
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,880
This has nothing to do with him.

400
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,870
Senior Lyu, then I...

401
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,320
Junior Lyu, this matter
doesn't concern you.

402
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,990
Step aside.

403
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:46,800
Senior.

404
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:53,660
It's all my fault. Do not involve others.

405
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,180
Master, please punish me.

406
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,550
Meng Chu.

407
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,670
Qu Xingman broke into our mountain
and injured our disciples.

408
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,630
Your Junior Li here

409
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,430
was nearly killed by that demon.

410
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,230
Yet now, she's set aside
the past to save you.

411
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,270
Is this fellowship not enough

412
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,100
to wake you from your delusions?

413
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,510
I didn't...

414
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,040
No need to say more, Master.

415
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,170
Whether it's good or evil,
you have your standard,

416
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,010
and I have my own judgment.

417
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,650
You're bound by the doctrines of the sect,

418
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,510
while I choose to follow my heart.

419
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,670
But you once guided me.

420
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,770
You taught me everything I knew.

421
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,130
I can never repay your kindness.

422
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:37,370
Whether you choose
to kill me or cripple me today,

423
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,320
I'll have no complaints.

424
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,030
Sect Leader, Senior Meng
was merely bewitched by that demon.

425
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,510
Please show him mercy.

426
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,960
I'm perfectly clear-headed.

427
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,690
Senior.

428
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,880
To think there's such
unwavering love in this world.

429
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,730
Very well.

430
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,350
You truly have a mind of your own.

431
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,350
Let's consider that
I never accepted you as my disciple.

432
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,130
Today, I shall personally kill you,

433
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:07,070
lest you fall to the demonic path
and hurt innocent people.

434
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,090
Sect Leader.

435
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,280
Sect Leader!

436
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:16,070
We've trained
alongside Senior Meng for over a decade.

437
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,330
If you must punish him,

438
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,110
punish us as well.

439
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,400
Us?

440
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,820
I have nothing to do with this.
I was just passing by.

441
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,230
This matter indeed
has nothing to do with Junior Li.

442
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,160
No, Sect Leader!

443
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,730
I saw her hiding a man

444
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,660
in her room!

445
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,180
Maybe he's from the demonic sect!

I'm truly sorry, junior sisters.

448
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,930
I've dragged you into this.

449
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,440
I'll tell Master

450
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,800
this has nothing to do with you.

451
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,740
To share hardship with you,
I have no regrets.

secretly take in an outsider?
