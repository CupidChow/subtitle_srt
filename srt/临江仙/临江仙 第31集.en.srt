[Episode 31]

3
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:51,140
I am in love with Senior Meng.

4
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,780
But don't you think you've belittled me?

5
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,340
My love is not that shallow.

6
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,840
Senior,

7
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,070
the people of the Yinlian Sect have all
been bewitched by the Blood Chime.

8
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,470
No medicine can fix them.

9
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,820
To save them

10
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,940
and return to the Jingyun Sect,

11
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,450
I had to pretend to collude with him

12
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,110
so as to seize the Blood Chime.

13
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,579
Now that he has destroyed the Blood Chime,

14
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,230
the disciples of the Yinlian Sect
will be fine.

15
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,700
You ungrateful wretches,

16
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,990
in this case,

17
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,240
I'll just wipe you all out

18
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,060
and then go find the Qiyue Sword.

19
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,750
Elder,

20
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,710
you leave with the Qiyue Sword first.

21
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,770
We'll hold him off.

22
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,300
In no case can we let him
seize the Qiyue Sword.

23
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,600
Chant to set up

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,860
the formation!

25
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,620
Elder?

26
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,790
Focus your energy.

27
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,240
This is our last stand!

28
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,060
Yes!

29
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,890
If you keep resisting,

30
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,230
none of you will survive.

31
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,840
I, Jingyun Sect disciple, Jiang Bian,
am willing to die for it!

32
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,440
I, Jingyun Sect disciple, Gong Liangyu,
am willing to die for it!

33
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,620
I, Jingyun Sect disciple, Fang Cai,
am willing to die for it!

34
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,829
I, Jingyun Sect disciple, Qin Guan,
am willing to die for it!

35
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,950
I, Qu Yunxu!

36
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,190
I, Duan Qinghong!

37
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,580
I, Tong Mingyue!

38
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,680
I, Zhou Tong!

39
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,980
I, Pei Wenjie!

40
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,130
I, Wang Haoyu!

41
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,130
I, Duan Qianqiu!

42
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,100
I, Chen Mu!

43
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,150
I, Du Yunchuan!

44
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,370
I, Wang Baoxing!

45
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,870
I, Liu Chushuo!

46
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,830
Willing to die for it!

47
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,840
Junior...

48
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,660
Are you alright?

49
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,720
Senior.

50
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,840
Don't be afraid.

51
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,830
What Qu Xingman

52
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,540
took was

53
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,870
a death-feigning potion.

54
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,190
I know.

55
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,620
I know, Junior.

56
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,000
Junior,

57
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,550
you will be fine.

58
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,659
Junior.

59
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,310
Junior!

60
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,520
Why bother making futile struggles?

61
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,330
You must have divined and learned

62
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,590
that you can't stop me.

63
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,380
So,

64
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,550
still not quit resisting?

65
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,880
Elder,

66
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,730
we can't give him the sword.

67
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,270
People

68
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,850
should yield to their fate

69
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
and not make pointless resistance.

70
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,610
Your sect could have

71
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,910
had a few more survivals.

72
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,630
These demonic beasts are trying to escape!

73
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,730
We must stop them!

74
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,090
Otherwise, the mortal realm will suffer!

75
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:09,980
Li Mo,

76
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,470
what are you going to do?

77
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,810
Senior, you're right.

78
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,400
We can't let these demonic beasts
leave Danxia Land.

79
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,080
Li Mo,

80
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,630
what are you planning to do?

81
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,890
Even if you self-destruct
your primordial spirit,

82
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,640
you still can't annihilate
those demonic beasts!

83
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,470
Don't!

84
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,020
My cultivation path
is different from yours.

85
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,580
With countless merits,

86
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,320
only I

87
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,750
can stop them.

88
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,260
You can't do this!

89
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,380
No!

90
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,170
If there's a next life,

91
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,150
I promise

92
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,880
to care for you only.

93
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,680
Li Mo.

94
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,140
Li Mo!

95
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,030
You vile beast.

96
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,710
You should have died long ago.

97
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,980
Who are you?

98
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,580
Your daughter is in danger.

99
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,260
Where is Ling'er?

100
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,880
Zhang Suan.

101
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,930
Is there really nothing we can do?

102
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,490
Then I'll go find Xiao Jingshan.

103
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,560
This is the magical artifact he forged.

104
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,020
He must know how to undo it.

105
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,990
Aren't you going to find the Divine Lord?

106
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,700
She has Bai Jiusi with her.

107
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,720
You're in graver danger than her.

108
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,940
Don't go.

109
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,600
For this last bit of time,

110
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,890
just stay with me for a while.

111
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,480
The people have all been evacuated.

112
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,040
Without souls to nourish the Joy Stele,

113
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,110
the illusion it created

114
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,140
will collapse.

115
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,250
The formation's eye will also
vanish with it.

116
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,950
Ling'er!

117
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,720
Ling'er!

118
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,090
Ling'er!

119
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,960
Ling'er.

120
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,200
Ling'er.

121
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,840
I was wrong.

122
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,550
Come out, okay?

123
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,610
Don't be stubborn.

124
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,810
Come out now.

125
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,650
You know what?

126
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,480
If I had spiritual energy,

127
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,340
I could still retain a fragment of my soul

128
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,980
to cultivate again
even with my body destroyed.

129
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,000
But now,

130
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,230
I'm just a powerless person.

131
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,590
This formation will reduce me into ashes.

132
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,680
I won't get reincarnation.

133
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,490
I will be totally wiped out

134
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,100
in the Three Realms.

135
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,440
Ling'er.

136
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,690
Ling'er!

137
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,670
Father,

138
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,830
you're partly responsible

139
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,550
for my death.

140
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,910
I was wrong.

141
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,970
I shouldn't have hurt you
in the name of protection.

142
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,060
I shouldn't have made decisions for you.

143
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,210
Come out.

144
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,780
Come out now, okay?

145
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,190
Zhang Suan.

146
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,080
I'm here.

147
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,290
You should leave

148
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,860
before it's too late.

149
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,480
Zhang Suan?

150
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,490
Yes!

151
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,240
Save Ling'er!

152
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,780
Hurry!

153
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,220
Save Ling'er!

154
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,210
Please save her now!

155
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:16,830
I...

156
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,240
The Thread of Destiny.

157
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,830
The Thread of Destiny!

158
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,260
Only you can save Ling'er.

159
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,750
Yu Ya,

160
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,500
just tell me

161
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,980
about my daughter's deadly tribulation
you mentioned

162
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,960
last time.

163
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,270
No,

164
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,360
I can't reveal it.

165
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,200
Here.

166
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,130
Take it.

167
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,000
Marriage destiny.

168
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,480
Marriage destiny

169
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,760
is the solution.

170
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,380
My daughter's marriage destiny? With whom?

171
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,590
Boy,

172
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,340
I know your name is Zhang Suan.

173
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,960
Don't be afraid.

174
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,570
I brought you here

175
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,140
because you can save my daughter.

176
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,400
You have good talent as well.

177
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,200
You're cut out for cultivation.

178
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,430
What on earth are you up to?

179
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,850
I'd like to set you up with someone.

180
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,340
I have a daughter

181
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,550
aged 206,

182
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,590
as beautiful as flowers,

183
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,150
adept in magic,

184
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,850
top-notch at artifact forging,

185
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,370
gentle, kind,

186
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,570
gorgeous, and considerate.

187
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I think she and you

188
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,970
can make a perfect match.

189
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,670
Is that so?

190
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,190
But my grandmother is only 60.

191
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,970
That sounds harsh, boy.

192
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,120
The mortal lifespan

193
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,480
and the immortal lifespan are different.

194
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,140
If mortals and immortals are different,

195
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,530
then why do you insist
on marrying your daughter off to me?

196
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,860
You... I... you...

197
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,370
It's hard to explain.

198

Come on.

199
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,890
Keep this jade pendant well.

200
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,390
This is your perfect marriage destiny.

201
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,580
I was too young then.

202
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,970
I can't remember.

203
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,200

-Please!
-Don't do this.

212

213
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,450
I don't know how to save her either!

Stop pressuring him.

215
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,910
He has no feelings for me.

216
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,360
Neither can he save me.

[Lord Qing Xu, Yuan Chenghua]

220
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,980
Yeah,

221
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,400
your name's carved on this stele,
receiving offerings from the Three Realms

222
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,200
and reverence for all eternity.

223
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,700
Of course you've been doing well.

224
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,510
But what about me?

225
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,900

They haven't made a decision yet.

229
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,610
Seems like I need to hold on a bit longer.

230
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,500
This is where the yin and yang
of all beings converge.

231
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,700
Only the balanced yin and yang energies

232
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,650
can keep the formation stable.

233
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,680
If one side becomes too strong,

234
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,790
the other will be completely consumed.

235
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,030
The formation will then break on its own.

236
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,440
So,

237
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,200
one of us must die.

238
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,480
That's right.

Time flows differently here
from the outside.

A moment passing here

241
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,480
might equal a day outside.

242
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,550
Ruyue,

243
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,070
Xiao Jingshan has now
reconstructed his body

244
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,390
and turned to the demonic path.

245
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,320
Those outside are no match for him.

Your hesitation

247

might put more people in danger.

248
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,050
If that's the case,

249
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,240
you should be the one
to survive and get out of here.

250
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,430
The Infinite Stele has the barrier
you set up on it.

251
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,660
Once you die,

252
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,210
Xiao Jingshan will wreck
the Infinite Stele.

253
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,180
Only you can fight him
if you make it out alive!

254
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,440
Don't be silly, Ruyue.

255

Still being severely injured,

256
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,050
I'm no match for him at all.

257

I'll channel
all my spiritual energy to you.

258

Ruyue!

259
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,280
It would only be a waste
of your spiritual energy.

260
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,680
Right now, only you stand a chance

261

to fight against him.

262

This is a deadly dilemma in and of itself.

00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,650
Luckily, Bai Jiusi is already dead.

342
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,740
Otherwise, I couldn't
stand a chance against you two.

343
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,920
Stop trying to provoke me.

344
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,510
Just me alone is more

345
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,210
than enough to take you down.

346
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,790
Nine Hells, Profound Mystery.

347
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,770
Six Lights, Demon Birth.

348
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,010
Eight Levels, Spirit Extinction.

349
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,070
Ten Directions, All Manifestation.

350
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,080
Purple Jade, Celestial Core.

351
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,410
Return to the Infinite.

352
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,350
Obliterate!

353
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,450
You're absorbing
the life force of all beings?

354
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,230
Forcibly enhancing your dark magic
will only annihilate your divine soul.

355
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,930
Are you really giving up on reincarnation?

356
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,660
As long as I can achieve my goal,

357
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,410
I'm willing to disappear forever
in this world.

358
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,890
Heaven is ruthless.

359
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,350
The god once killed humans.

360
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,480
Yet his name could be carved
on the Infinite Stele

361
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,010
to be worshipped by people.

362
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,400
Why do you want to stop me?

363
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,350
Yuan Chenghua did make mistakes,

364
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,000
but he died

365
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,440
in the god-demon war
to protect the peace of the Three Realms.

366
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,680
You're doing this

367
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,180
to satisfy yourself only.

368
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,120
Heaven may be ruthless,

369
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,140
but humans are different.

370
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,360
Love, family affection,

371
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,200
and fellowship all matter.

372
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:09,220
Everyone's life
should be theirs to decide,

373
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,900
not yours.

374
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,400
It's exactly these emotions you mentioned

375
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,110
that have held everyone down

376
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,300
and caused them bad endings.

377
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,270

If you guys joined forces,

422
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,010
I'd have a hard time
dealing with it, I'm afraid.

423
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,270
But people like you

424
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,350
always get caught up
in so-called righteousness and morality,

425
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,160
leading you astray step by step.

426
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,850
As I said before,

427
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,910
once you have a weakness,

428
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,400
you're bound to lose.

429
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,420
Xiao Jingshan,

430
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,460
haven't you realized that you're wrong?

431
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,510
On one hand,
you want to prove that heaven is ruthless,

432
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,410
yet on the other, you're furious
over the righteousness

433
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,670
and morality you said.

434
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,350
You're the one who's lying to yourself.

435
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,990
And also,

436
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,330
as I said before,

437
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,770
a weakness can also be armor.

438
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,730
Futile resistance.

439
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,690
Like an ant against a tree.

440
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,840
Qiyue, I need your help!

441
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:38,810
Come!

442
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,650
There's a trace of Bai Jiusi's soul
in this sword.

443
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,260
Even death can't stop him
from protecting you.

444
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,460
Bai Jiusi,

445
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,340
help me one last time!

446
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,970
Today,

447
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,690
you won't get away.

448
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,160
You've lost.

449
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Not necessarily.

450
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,370
It's useless.

451
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,620
If you weren't injured,

452
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,650
you might stand a chance to fix this.

453
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,150
But now, you can't stop it.

454
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:40,100
Having the Three Realms perish with me,

455
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,610
I'd say it's worth it.

456
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,000
Divine Lord,

457
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,930
don't give up.

458
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,410
Ling'er?

459
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,530
You...

460
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,150
You guys...

461
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,220
Stand up.

462
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,370
Follow me.

463
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,010
Let's go to the Ascension Terrace.

464
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,630
My master is still there.

465
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,450
Let's make one last attempt.

466
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,240
I've sensed an anomaly at Tianmu Peak.

467
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,190
Anyone who can go with me?

468
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,170
I'm willing to go with you!

469
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,630
I'll go with you!

470
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,000
Count me in as well.

471
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,340
That's Danxia Land where Li Mo once lived.

472
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,390
I want to protect it.

473
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,420
I'm sorry, Ling'er.

474
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,030
You don't need to feel guilty.

475
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,840
Actually,

476
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,490
I'm not that into you either.

477
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,760
What I really fall for

478
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,360
is your unwavering love

479
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,360
for the Divine Lord.

480
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,810
Because before that, I never knew that

481
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,260
some love

482
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,650
could make people willing
to risk their own lives.

483
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,160
I see!

484
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,340
I got it!

485
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,810
Ling'er is having nirvana.

486
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,470
She has passed her love tribulation.

487
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,890
I see now!

488
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,320
I'm okay.

489
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,300
Xiao Jingshan,

490
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,200
it's time for us to settle scores now!

491
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,260
Xiao Jingshan,

492
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,320
you could have wiped out

493
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,920
anyone in your way real fast,

494
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,960
yet you went out of your way

495
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:02,240
to set up troublesome
and time-consuming obstacles for everyone.

496
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,780
Just as I said earlier,

497
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,490
you've been lying to yourself all along.

498
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,850
The truth is,
this was never about testing others.

499
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,530
It was a test for yourself.

500
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,130
You wanted someone to prove

501
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,280
that you were wrong.

502
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,470
Are you

503
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,140
satisfied now?

504
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,760
Do you still remember

505
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,360
the last page
of the artifact record I gave you?

506
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,100
It's the Time-traveling Sundial.

507
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,410
Its forging has yet to be finished.

508
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,270
Because the final step
needs the creator to sacrifice

509
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,630
his life.

510
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,550
So what?

511
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,510
Siling,

512
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,340
I'm giving it to you.

513
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,430
Don't let me down.
