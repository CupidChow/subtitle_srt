1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
But...

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,900
Who's the SUBSCRIBEUMMING's give-away?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,120
Mach- וה

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,360
on T Bieauc.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,640
Immediately tudo

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,640
The shadow of the spring is soft and clear

7
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,640
I pretend that I don't want to listen

8
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,640
I don't want to look at your eyes

9
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,640
But tears are the essence of my life

10
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,640
I want to learn to be independent

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,640
And turn back to my heart

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Forget about the mistakes

13
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,640
And put on a smile to remember

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,640
The Shadow of the Spring

15
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
These are all precious jewelry

16
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Every piece is made by Xuan Sun

17
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
It's made by finding people

18
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
The material is very precious

19
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
108 pieces in total

20
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Look at this

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
It's a good match

22
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
Are you curious about

23
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,640
Whose jewelry are these?

24
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
You invited me here

25
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
To buy some items, right?

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
I want to ask you a story

27
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
A story?

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,640
A man who loves a woman who shouldn't

29
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
That's the immortal spirit

30
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
How is it?

31
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,640
Does it look like you?

32
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
What do you want?

33
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
What can I do?

34
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,640
I want you to see clearly

35
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Who you are

36
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
in your good days in Dansha

37
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,640
When the world is still in chaos

38
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
The red-brown pearl

39
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
has two kinds of pearls

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
One is clear, one is thick

41
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,640
One is silver, one is silver

42
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,640
One is cold, one is hot

43
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,640
That is the immortal spirit and Xuan Sun

44
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,640
They are the same age as the world

45
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
How long has the world existed?

46
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
How long have they been fighting?

47
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
In the past 10,000 years

48
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
They fought with each other

49
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
But

50
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Xuan Sun made a mistake

51
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,640
He loves the immortal spirit

52
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,640
How ridiculous

53
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,640
He fell in love with his own enemy

54
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Xuan Sun was happy

55
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,640
and wanted to be with him

56
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,640
But he broke the poisonous fire

57
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,640
and put it in Xuan Sun's body

58
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,640
It caused him to be heartbroken

59
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
He sealed Xuan Sun

60
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,640
and took away all the power of Xuan Sun

61
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,640
And then

62
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,640
he became the most powerful person in the world

63
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,640
From then on, he took the magic

64
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
and the magic of the Immortal Sect

65
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
and became a great person

66
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Xuan Sun was a good man

67
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
and he was able to save the world

68
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,640
and he was able to break the seal and go back to Dansha

69
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,640
He fought with his own spirit

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,640
and he was able to escape from the world

71
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,640
From then on,

72
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,640
he was able to escape from the world

73
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
and he was able to escape from the world

74
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,640
and he was able to escape from the world

75
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
and he was able to escape from the world

76
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,640
After hearing this story

77
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,640
What do you want to ask?

78
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Are you listening to Xuan Sun and me?

79
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,640
I can't make this story out of it

80
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,640
You can ask a person in the Canglei Hall

81
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,640
if you want to know the truth

82
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,640
Even if the story is true

83
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,640
it's also a challenge to tell the truth

84
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Xuan Sun and Si Ling's grudge

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,640
has nothing to do with me

86
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
I won't be the one to blame

87
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,640
for the past and the present and the future

88
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,640
I wish you to have a long life

89
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,640
and always be clear and rational

90
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,640
and not get lost in the past

91
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,640
and never get lost

92
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,640
I have something else to do

93
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,640
I'll leave it to you

94
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
By the way, madam

95
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
You found me?

96
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
I wanted to keep you for a few more days

97
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,640
but now you're looking for death

98
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Do you think I'll run after you like last time?

99
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,640
Go!

100
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Where are you going?

101
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Go!

102
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
It's been a long time

103
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
It's really a pity

104
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
It seems like we're in the wrong place

105
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
We can't be trapped here

106
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,640
We have to find a way to get out

107
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Let's go

108
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Where is the blood?

109
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,640
Who's crying?

110
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Who?

111
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Who are you?

112
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Why are you here?

113
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Why are you here?

114
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Sister, are you lost here?

115
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,640
Lost?

116
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,640
I'm going home with my brother

117
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
I don't know what to do

118
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
I'm going to the big house

119
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I'll be here in a day

120
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
My brother won't be here

121
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,640
My brother won't be here

122
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
You came from the mortal world?

123
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
My brother often says that

124
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,640
the innocent child will be taken away by the monster

125
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,640
and then killed by the forest

126
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Sister, am I also caught because I'm not obedient?

127
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Don't cry

128
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,640
This place is not a monster cave

129
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,640
It's a single-spirit mirror

130
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,640
It's a place where the great city is located

131
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
It's a place where the gods live

132
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Only people who have a spiritual connection can enter here

133
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
So you're not an innocent child

134
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
You're a fairy child

135
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,640
Is your sister a fairy too?

136
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
Can you take me to find a father?

137
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
Of course I can

138
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,640
If you don't cry, I'll take you out

139
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
Let's go

140
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,640
What's your name?

141
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Where do you live?

142
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
My name is Feng You

143
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,640
I live in the Yupai Village in Qingganshan

144
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,640
My father is the most famous hunter in the village

145
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
Yupai Village?

146
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,640
But I remember that Yupai Village was founded by the late Emperor Minghui

147
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,640
It was decades ago, and it was called Lu Pei Village

148
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
It's Lu Pei Meicun

149
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
But our village is poor

150
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,640
All the old people left here are used to Yupai Village

151
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
I don't like it anymore

152
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Really?

153
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,640
Sister

154
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Lu Pei Village is the name I just made

155
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,640
When will your demon coffin be installed?

156
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,640
I don't know what you're talking about

157
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Sister, you're hurting me

158
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
I'm not good at making a living

159
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,640
But I don't know why I'm not a monster

160
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
You're still lying, aren't you?

161
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Let's go

162
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,640
What a bad girl

163
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,640
I have to make it clear

164
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,640
You...

165
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,640
You have the smell of wine

166
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,640
What does it have to do with you?

167
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Are you a servant?

168
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
Or a lover?

169
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Brother

170
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Brother

171
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
I want to see Brother Meng Chu

172
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Good wine

173
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Why are you here?

174
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,640
Why are you getting so angry?

175
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
What happened?

176
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,640
Brother Meng Chu, what can I do for you?

177
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
For me?

178
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Yes

179
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,640
You don't like to take care of the idle people

180
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
What's wrong?

181
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Please

182
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,640
I want to go to the Sky of the Nine Heavens

183
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,640
Sky of the Nine Heavens?

184
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Sky of the Nine Heavens?

185
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
What are you doing there?

186
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Brother

187
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Brother

188
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Thank you for your little girl

189
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,640
For doing me a good deed

190
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
Where are you going?

191
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,640
Brother

192
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,640
Fan Jiao Jiao, you're doing me a good deed

193
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,640
Watch me

194
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Watch me

195
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Watch me

196
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
Watch me

197
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,640
You're going to kill me

198
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,640
You're going to kill me

199
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Yun, it's your turn

200
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,640
Fan Jian Jun, hurry

201
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Sky of the Nine Heavens

202
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Sky of the Nine Heavens

203
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Sky of the Nine Heavens

204
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
Something's wrong

205
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,640
Something's wrong

206
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
What's wrong?

207
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,640
My wife ran to the prison

208
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,640
Go to Fan Jiao Jiao

209
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Mr. Xuan is in the underground

210
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Mr. Xuan, what's wrong?

211
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,640
I heard the prison was in the quarrel

212
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
I only heard it when I heard it

213
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
It's my wife

214
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
She accidentally broke into the prison

215
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
It's so weird

216
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,640
I can't even write it

217
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,640
Fine, since I can't go

218
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
You stay with me

219
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Fan Jian Jun, don't bother me

220
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Go on

221
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
You're a little girl

222
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
What's wrong with you?

223
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Yun, come in

224
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,640
Xuan

225
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,640
You're so weak

226
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,640
How dare you sit with me?

227
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
I'm against you

228
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,640
I'm against you

229
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
Bai Jiu Si

230
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,640
You're so quick to get the body of the Four Seasons

231
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Everyone we play with the fire

232
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,760
Come, we will fight

233
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
With this experience

234
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,340
And with both you and me

235
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
And both with us

236
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
I killed him!

237
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
That's a split-up.

238
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,240
Master, I'll take him to catch him.

239
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
No need.

240
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,440
I can catch him if he can run away.

241
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,440
Lee Qingyue?

242
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,640
You've met him before.

243
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,440
He's been watching the mountain door with me these years.

244
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Lee Qingyue?

245
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
Lee Qingyue?

246
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
Lee Qingyue?

247
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Why are you looking at the same person

248
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,640
as Master Da Cheng?

249
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
My parents died.

250
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,640
I was a young man.

251
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
I was a young man.

252
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
I was a trainee.

253
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,640
I just wanted to get the credit.

254
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
That time,

255
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
I was the one who got the credit.

256
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,640
I was a disciple of the sect.

257
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
I was the one who didn't understand.

258
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
He's a normal person.

259
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,640
He's more ordinary.

260
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
But he has a kind of

261
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
good-looking temperament.

262
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
He's not mad or mad.

263
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
He's not a bad guy.

264
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
Sometimes, when I see him,

265
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
I suddenly feel that

266
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
I'm calm and calm.

267
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,640
It's not that important

268
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
to ask him the same question.

269
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
Why didn't you tell him?

270
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
Yes.

271
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
Why didn't I tell him?

272
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
During this time,

273
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
I've been asking myself this question every day.

274
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,640
Maybe

275
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,640
I'm afraid that Master will be unhappy.

276
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
Maybe

277
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
I'm afraid that he'll reject me.

278
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Maybe I feel

279
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
that I'm not in a good mood

280
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
at this moment.

281
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,640
Later,

282
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
I got hurt

283
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
and I lost my power.

284
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
I've been repair.

285
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
I don't dare to tell him.

286
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
I don't dare to tell him.

287
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
I'm not good at

288
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
drawing the shield of the Party.

289
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
So I'm going to use this umbrella

290
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
to make Senior feel sorry for me.

291
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Senior, don't be embarrassed.

292
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Don't care about others' eyes.

293
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
After all, your body is yours.

294
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Even if you don't cherish yourself,

295
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,640
you'll be the only one who's suffering.

296
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
I'm not good at drawing the shield of the Party.

297
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,640
People think

298
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
that I'm a disciple of Master

299
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
and that I'm a disciple of Master.

300
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,640
I'll be sad and sad.

301
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
I'm not good at drawing the shield of the Party.

302
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,640
But I don't know that

303
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
I've been the happiest person

304
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
since I joined the party.

305
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
It's my eyes.

306
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Now he's the reason

307
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
for becoming the leader of the Party.

308
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
No matter how good he is,

309
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,640
it's none of your business.

310
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,640
Even if you go to the Sky Kingdom,

311
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
and see him,

312
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
what can you do?

313
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
Even if he's as good as you said,

314
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
and is as good as a thief,

315
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
and is hurt and killed,

316
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,640
with your potential,

317
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
you can't save him

318
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
in the Sky Kingdom.

319
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
I'm not good at drawing the shield of the Party.

320
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
I'm...

321
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
I just want to do

322
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,640
the result.

323
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
It doesn't matter.

324
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,640
Master,

325
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
she wants to run away.

326
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
She wants me to take the road.

327
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
You're so smart.

328
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
Ling'er,

329
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,640
why don't you apologize to her?

330
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
It's a misunderstanding.

331
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
She wanted to kill me twice.

332
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
It's not a misunderstanding.

333
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
That's right.

334
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
You're the one I want to kill.

335
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
Liang,

336
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
for the past 200 years,

337
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
I've been worried about you

338
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
and I've been trying to fix your relationship.

339
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
But what did she do?

340
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,640
What did she do?

341
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
She just stopped her face

342
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
and became the wife of Master Xuan.

343
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,640
Is she worth it?

344
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
I know Ling'er is guilty.

345
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
But I want you to

346
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
forgive Ling'er

347
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,640
for what she did

348
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,640
and forgive her.

349
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
What do you want?

350
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,640
She just wanted to kill me.

351
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Shouldn't she have

352
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
decided on Master Xuan?

353
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,640
You're so smart.

354
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,640
You're talking about her again.

355
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
What am I talking about?

356
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
What is it?

357
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
I heard from Ling'er

358
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
that in this lonely city,

359
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
people who are most guilty

360
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
should be locked up in a place where they are guilty.

361
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
They should be punished.

362
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
A place where they are guilty?

363
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,640
What's the difference between

364
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,640
killing Ling'er and her?

365
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,640
It's not fair.

366
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,640
It's not good to be the daughter

367
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
of Master Xuan.

368
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Now, you want to stand up

369
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
and be responsible

370
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
for your daughter's crime?

371
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
Go back to your room.

372
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
Yes, sir.

373
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:49,640
Being released by the daredevil

374
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:59,640
at midnight

375
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,640
isn't thatぐ女有 tooth wrong?

376
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,640
However,

377
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,740
That's longer said.

378
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,860
〜 really?

379
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,560
I saw you're trapped inside the Euphoric House.

380
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,100
You must also be back to your own universe.

381
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,700
When I thought I never developed a talent to sing in the middle of music.

382
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,160
It was only because of this ceremonies.

383
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,600
Do not worry Jin Yue, you're not uneducated or talented.

384
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,600
I will definitely be able to handle this day.

385
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,600
I will be the one to take good care of you.

386
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Are you okay, madam?

387
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Are you hurt? Are you serious?

388
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Do you want to see the doctor first?

389
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
I prepared some water for you.

390
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
When you get in, put it on your body.

391
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Then you can remove the gas.

392
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
And keep it safe.

393
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,600
The late King of the Cangkou is here.

394
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
The late King of the Cangkou.

395
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,600
Can you let me talk to Ling'er?

396
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Thank you.

397
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,600
It's too far away from the place where you belong.

398
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,600
You are really good at carrying things.

399
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
The place where you belong is very heavy.

400
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
You are a body of fire.

401
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
You must be careful.

402
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Don't be fooled by the cold air.

403
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
It's good to eat some bitter food in the morning.

404
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Don't let your old pursuit be a burden to yourself.

405
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
You wasted your time.

406
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
The sky is dark and the sea is wide.

407
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
What kind of person is not there?

408
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Why do you have to be so stubborn?

409
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
I did what I had to do.

410
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
I didn't even have a thousand years to see you.

411
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Why did you come to me?

412
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,600
You have always been the one who cares about yourself.

413
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
You only took some of the price to pay for it.

414
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Now that you are so stubborn, you are really making me do it.

415
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Are you angry that I didn't take the blame with you?

416
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Ling'er, you must know that I only want to be with you when I am outside.

417
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
You don't have to.

418
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
You are not here when I need you.

419
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Now, I don't need a father anymore.

420
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Let's go.

421
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
Ling'er.

422
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
I have a message for you.

423
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,600
You must go to the place where you belong.

424
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
You must never leave.

425
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,600
I have been cultivating for you for many years.

426
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
I will never leave.

427
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
I will never leave.

428
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
I will never leave.

429
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
I will never leave.

430
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
I will never leave.

431
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
I will never leave.

432
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
I have been cultivating for you for many years.

433
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,600
I never thought that he would treat me like this for a mortal.

434
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,600
I have kept you alive because I want to see you as a father.

435
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,600
If not, you would have become the king of the sword of the lord.

436
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,600
The place where you belong is the Garden of the Great Han.

437
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,600
The three years of your life will be filled with cold air and calmness.

438
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
You will be a master of the sword.

439
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,600
Even if you can leave, you will be a mortal.

440
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,600
You will suffer the pain of being in a cold place.

441
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
The Great Han of the Garden of the Great Han.

442
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Take care.

443
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
The Great Han of the Garden of the Great Han.

444
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
The Great Han of the Garden of the Great Han.

445
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
The Great Han of the Garden of the Great Han.

446
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
The Great Han of the Garden of the Great Han.

447
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
The Great Han of the Garden of the Great Han.

448
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
You are drinking everyday.

449
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
Let's go.

450
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Don't come again.

451
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
I didn't give you anything.

452
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Why don't you let me drink?

453
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Your wife is begging me.

454
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,600
If I don't let you drink again, you can't look at me.

455
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
That bastard.

456
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,600
I've never seen him before.

457
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
He is crying.

458
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Give me some money.

459
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
I'm not crying.

460
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
I'm telling you.

461
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,600
I'll beat him up if I see him.

462
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
I can't drink there.

463
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,600
I'll drink outside.

464
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
That bastard.

465
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
The Great Han of the Garden of the Great Han.

466
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
The Great Han of the Garden of the Great Han.

467
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
The Great Han of the Garden of the Great Han.

468
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
My wife.

469
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Mr. Xuan.

470
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
I've checked the trace of Hong Lian.

471
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,600
He seems to have been hiding after he escaped.

472
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
He is in Songhe County now.

473
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
These are the traces of Hong Lian.

474
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,600
You're the one who is in charge of the secret place.

475
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Mr. Xuan just got out of the hospital.

476
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
He is in a critical condition now.

477
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
He shouldn't use the law again.

478
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
If you want to catch Hong Lian,

479
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
I'm willing to go.

480
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,600
You can guard the secret place.

481
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
The Great Han of the Garden of the Great Han.

482
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
The Great Han of the Garden of the Great Han.

483
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,600
Mr. Xuan.

484
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Don't go.

485
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
I have to go.

486
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Let's go.

487
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
I'll go.

488
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Let's go.

489
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Let's go.

490
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
Let's go.

491
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
I'll go.

492
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Just go.

493
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,600
I don't think it's necessary.

494
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Where are we going?

495
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
I'll know when we get there.

496
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Wait.

497
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
I'm going to change.

498
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Where is this?

499
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Don't you know?

500
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,600
Did you just get mad?

501
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,600
What do you mean?

502
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Is this the place where Xuan and Celin fell in love?

503
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
You're taking me to travel around the world?

504
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
What do you mean?

505
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
You can take your time.

506
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,600
I won't let you go.

507
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
You're taking your time.

508
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,600
You don't want to care?

509
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Boss Xie, why are you so shy?

510
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
It's not a good place to be on the street.

511
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Who dares to open the door?

512
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Stop talking. Go back.

513
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
It's so important.

514
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,600
I'm sorry.

515
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
We'll go first.

516
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Why is the street so empty?

517
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
Go back.

518
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
It seems he's already starved.

519
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
Xuan is a red lotus?

520
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
You can go and check it out.

521
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Thank you.

522
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Next.

523
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
This brother of yours.

524
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
Why is there no one on the street?

525
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Is he a foreigner?

526
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
Yes.

527
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
My husband and I...

528
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
came out to fight.

529
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,600
I suggest you leave.

530
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
A few days ago, a monster was bitten by a monster.

531
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Now, the whole Songhe County is in a mess.

532
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Monster?

533
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
Yes.

534
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,600
The monster that bites people.

535
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
It's a human.

536
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
What a coincidence.

537
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
We're the main cultivators.

538
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Where are the people who are bitten by the monster?

539
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Let's go and see if we can help.

540
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,600
The first person in the east is Xu Yang.

541
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
Xu Yang?

542
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
The first person in the east is Xu Yang.

543
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

544
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

545
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

546
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

547
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

548
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

549
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

550
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

551
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

552
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

553
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

554
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

555
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

556
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

557
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

558
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.

559
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Xu Yang is the first person in the east.
