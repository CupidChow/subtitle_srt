[Episode 16]

3
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,920
Even birds can roam freely,

4
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
yet I am confined to
this small plot of land.

5
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,590
Divine Lord, are you still worried about

6
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,650
the incident at Tianmu Peak that day?

7
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,370
How can I not be worried?

8
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,970
Dozens of disciples from Canglei Palace

9
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,240
have all left Danxia Land to
search for Master,

10
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,080
while I alone...

11
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,690
am trapped in this cherry blossom forest.

12
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,240
On the surface, it's for self-reflection,

13
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,960
but in reality, it's imprisonment.

14
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,740
Immortal Lord Long Yuan
misunderstood you.

15
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,760
You were unaware of
Divine Lord Siling's actions.

16
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,560
Misunderstanding?

17
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,710
My daughter colluded with
Divine Lord Siling,

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,530
and I knew nothing about it.

19
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,430
How can

20
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,770
this kind of misunderstanding
be explained?

21
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,590
Others may not be able to
discern the truth,

22
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,720
but His Lordship is an ancient true god

23
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,910
who has existed for thousands of years
and seen countless people.

24
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,150
When he returns,

25
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,880
he will surely clear your name.

26
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,710
In water, ink fades but darkens the water.

27
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,630
Both clear and murky,

28
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,590
it's not so easy to see through.

29
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,130
Father, you used magic
to enter my dream.

30
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,350
What brings you here?

31
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,150
Ling'er, are you still angry
with your father?

32
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,880
Father, you're overthinking.

33
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
It's not the first time

34
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,520
I've seen your selfishness and coldness.

35
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,850
How can I still be angry?

36
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,960
You always say I'm selfish,

37
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,640
but when have you ever
been honest with me?

38
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,750
I don't even know if the one before me

39
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,000
is that arrogant and domineering,

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,060
yet frank and unrestrained Ling'er,

41
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,240
or the celestial attendant who's been

42
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,630
acting for so long that she's
no longer sincere.

43
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,710
Is it that I've disguised myself too well,

44
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,910
or that you've cared too little about me

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,310
to notice my changes?

46
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,160
When did you join Divine Lord Siling?

47
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
I didn't join her.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,930
I've always been one of her people.

49
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,360
So when you told me you liked
Heavenly Lord Dacheng,

50
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,040
it was all a lie?

51
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,310
Yes.

52
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,600
The affection for Bai Jiusi

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,930
was just to facilitate my mission.

54
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,000
The guise of
admiring the Heavenly Lord

55
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,010
was to better serve as
Divine Lord Siling's assistant?

56
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,190
The first time I made a move against
the Divine Lord

57
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,870
was to ensure she could
safely reach the deep pool

58
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,620
to extract the primordial spirit
of the White Snake.

59
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,140
The second attack

60
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,920
was to help her join forces with Honglian

61
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,120
to severely injure Bai Jiusi

62
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,830
and reclaim the Fire-Parting Technique.

63
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,860
Incidentally, I could also
enter the Land of Ruins

64
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,540
to help the White Snake be reborn.

65
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,130
So, from the moment Divine Lord Siling
ascended to the Nine Heavens,

66
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,940
you two have been in cahoots.

67
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,130
No, that's not it.

68
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,270
It was even earlier.

69
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,270
Otherwise, your plan

70
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,200
wouldn't have been so meticulous.

71
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,110
When exactly did you meet her?

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,520
Three hundred years ago,

73
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,980
I took Mother to the Medicine King Valley
to seek treatment.

74
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,940
I accidentally fell off a cliff.

75
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
It was then

76
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,110
that I met Divine Lord Siling.

77
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,830
Am I dead?

78
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,420
No.

79
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,960
I saved you.

80
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,830
Who is it?

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,160
Who's speaking?

82
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,000
Zhuri is Siling's sword?

83
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,040
No wonder.

84
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,460
No wonder after that,

85
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,240
you showed your amazing talent
for artifact crafting

86
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,770
and quickly became one of
the best in the clan.

87
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,980
You gave Zhuri to me,

88
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,610
which led His Lordship to descend
and take me as a disciple.

89
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,510
All of this was orchestrated by

90
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,390
Divine Lord Siling behind the scenes.

91
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,790
Why exactly are you going

92
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,070
to such lengths for Divine Lord Siling?

93
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,360
Father, do you remember my mother?

94
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,170
Do you remember

95
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,310
which wife she was?

96
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,380
She was the eighth.

97
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,200
You were in love for only three months

98
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,840
before you married your ninth wife.

99
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,950
My mother was nothing more than

100
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,310
an ordinary mortal.

101
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,760
She had no impressive family background,

102
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,350
nor could she practice magic
or cultivation.

103
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,470
She was mistreated in the household.

104
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,570
But you, Father...

105
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,990
You never truly cared about her.

106
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,150
You're always like this,

107
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,910
passionate when in love,

108
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,720
casually discarding when the love fades.

109
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,430
To you,

110
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,390
my mother was just one

111
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,950
among your many wives,

112
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,680
no different from the other women
in the back courtyard.

113
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,950
But for Mother,

114
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,990
you were her only husband.

115
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,320
She was an ordinary woman.

116
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,570
Naturally, she was prone to
an ordinary woman's

117
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,750
jealousy and heartaches.

118
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,240
So,

119
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,870
when you married your 11th wife,

120
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,120
she fell ill from accumulated grief.

121
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,690
What does this have to do with
the matter at hand?

122
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,720
So,

123
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,880
to you, my mother's life

124
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,670
is reduced to

125
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,270
"What does this have to do with
the matter at hand?"

126
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,330
Ling'er, I'm doing this because
I'm worried about you.

127
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,630
Worried about me?

128
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,360
You're worried about being implicated
because of me, aren't you?

129
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,990
Just like your indifference
towards my mother.

130
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,590
In the end, it was the Divine Lord
who saved her.

131
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,740
That's just manipulation.
She's using you for revenge.

132
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,120
With your perceptiveness,
can't you see through this?

133
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,520
Isn't it a good thing to be

134
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,970
used by the Divine Lord?

135
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,320
You have many wives

136
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,320
and I have many siblings.

137
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,900
You are the head of the family.

138
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,010
I am as insignificant
as an ant in this family.

139
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,510
When I was little, my favorite thing

140
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,790
was to wait by the door every day,

141
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,670
hoping that you would occasionally pass by

142
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
and smile while calling out,

143
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,870
"Ling'er."

144
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,240
It would make me happy for days.

145
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,360
Ling'er.

146
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,030
I...

147
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,440
But now, I've had enough

148
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,900
of your occasional scraps
of fatherly love.

149
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,820
If it weren't for the Divine Lord,

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,730
Mother would have died
with resentment long ago.

151
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,560
To be used by the Divine Lord

152
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,200
is my good fortune.

153
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,080
Listen to me.

154
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,610
Canglei Palace is divine
in the Nine Heavens.

155
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,790
It's not something the small Jingyun Sect

156
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,030
can contend with.

157
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,170
So if you come back on your own,

158
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:47,670
I can still...

159
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,750
How I live my life

160
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,750
is my own choice.

161
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,180
Celestial Attendant Fan.

162
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,400
Celestial Attendant Fan, are you free?

163
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,780
Celestial Attendant Fan?

164
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,160
Celestial...

165
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,200
What do you want from me?

166
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,800
Do you know where Qingyue is?

167
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,520
I don't know.

168
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,740
Do you really not know?

169
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,080
You've allied yourself with Qingyue.

170
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
You're already being hunted
by Canglei Palace.

171
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,550
It's fair to say your life
is in Qingyue's hands.

172
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,670
But you seem unusually calm right now.

173
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,600
You don't seem worried about
her whereabouts at all.

174
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,240
I can only think of
two possibilities for this.

175
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,390
One, you've already figured out

176
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,550
how to deal with the trouble
from Canglei Palace.

177
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,120
Two,

178
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
you already know Qingyue's whereabouts.

179
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,920
Am I right?

180
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,700
Will my anxiety
make the Divine Lord return?

181
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,840
Why are you so concerned
about the Divine Lord?

182
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,810
Love and hate coexist.

183
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,800
Since I've known the Divine Lord,

184
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,080
there's only been one person in her heart.

185
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,870
Others

186
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,530
can't enter her heart,
even if they risk their lives.

187
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,480
What do you mean?

188
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,990
The sea of love is hard to cross.

189
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,790
I'm advising you to get out early.

190
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,650
Don't get in too deep,
hurting yourself and others.

191
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,270
Whether it's hard to cross or not,
I'll know after trying.

192
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,750
Shangguan?

193
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,810
Senior Meng.

194
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,060
What brings you here?

195
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,270
Sect Leader ordered me to let you out.

196
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,840
Let me out?

197
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,200
Why?

198
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,320
I don't know about that.

199
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,420
You should ask Sect Leader yourself.

200
00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:00,830
[Prosperity]

201
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,080
Master.

202
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,790
You're here.

203
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,670
Master, I have something to ask.

204
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,600
I know what you want to ask.

205
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,250
It's a long story, though.

206
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,360
Separating you two at that time

207
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,680
was not the sect's original intention.

208
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,860
We just urgently needed a plausible excuse

209
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,230
to put the Grandmaster's life in danger

210
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,270
and lure Heavenly Lord Dacheng
to the mortal realm.

211
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,550
The sect owes you an apology for this.

212
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,960
But from now on, you two
can be spiritual partners.

213
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,120
You can roam freely in this vast world.

214
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,360
Master.

215
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,330
You don't oppose us
being together anymore?

216
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,600
Why should I oppose?

217
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,970
Qu Xingman is kind-hearted and attractive.

218
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,500
She's the perfect match for you.

219
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,110
After you leave, quickly go find her.

220
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,930
Oh, go see your Master Dan Yang.

221
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,510
Ask him for some spiritual pills
and magical artifacts

222
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,080
to give her as gifts.

223
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,940
But she's from the demonic sect.

224
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,520
So what if she's from the demonic sect?

225
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,510
She couldn't choose her birth.

226
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,390
As long as she doesn't
kill indiscriminately or do evil,

227
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,700
and does good deeds, she is righteous.

228
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,090
Members of our sect

229
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,880
cannot judge a person's morality
based on their background,

230
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,040
nor can we harbor prejudice.

231
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,020
Do you understand?

232
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:55,910
Master,

233
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,550
I understand.

234
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,330
Go quickly.

235
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,360
Senior Meng,

236
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,880
you're back from the Sect Leader's place?

237
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,120
Surprised, aren't you?

238
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,810
How should I put it?

239
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,980
I suddenly feel empty inside.

240
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,070
You'll get used to it gradually.

241
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,900
What are you doing?

242
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,540
isn't it obvious?

243
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,480
I'm sweeping.

244
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,120
But you're a core disciple of the sect.

245
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,380
Why are you doing this?

246
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,960
The other disciples who
used to sweep and cook

247
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,550
are now at the Nascent Soul level,

248
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,109
half a step away from the
Deity Transformation level.

249
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,800
They're over 200 years old.

250
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,920
Their swordsmanship is divine

251
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,359
and they can beat 10 of us
with just one hand.

252
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,420
The other disciples have all gone
to find the Grandmaster now.

253
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,500
I mean, Junior Li.

254
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,310
The sect is short-handed at the moment.

255
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,430
You should go to the kitchen
and help Jiang Bian with cooking.

256
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,620
Assist him and such.

257
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,950
Just find something since you're free.

258
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,000
Make way.

259
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,680
Make way.

260
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,680
If you truly understood the Divine Lord,

261
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,270
you wouldn't worry about her.

262
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,830
She was never that

263
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,830
timid and cowardly

264
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,440
Li Qingyue from Jingyun Sect
who avoided conflicts.

265
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,720
Instead, she's Divine Lord Siling

266
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,180
who could stir up a storm
in the realm of gods.

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,310
The Divine Lord's
primordial spirit left her body

268
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,370
and survived wandering the
mortal realm for 300 years.

269
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,940
She can certainly resolve

270
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,400
such a trivial matter.

271
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,000
I believe she can resolve it.

272
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
It's just that the later we find her,

273
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,110
the more hardship she will endure.

274
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,160
Any hardship

275
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,240
is an opportunity for the Divine Lord.

276
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,300
What opportunity?

277
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,760
The opportunity to kill Bai Jiusi.

278
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,720
The Heaven-Turning Seal has fallen
and the void has shattered,

279
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,440
yet there's not a single trace of Master.

280
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,680
I've summoned you all here today

281
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,290
to assist me in performing a formation

282
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,460
to search for Master.

283
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,790
We will do our best to assist you, Senior.

284
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,920
All disciples, protect me
as I perform the ritual.

285
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,720
-Yes!
-Yes!

286
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,840
It's late and chilly.

287
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,760
Where are you going
instead of resting inside?

288
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,110
Ruyue,

289
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,370
I'm talking to you.

290
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,610
What do you want?

291
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,880
Nothing.

292
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,410
I just want to talk with you.

293
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,720
What is there left to say between us?

294
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,000
Past events, what's right
and what's wrong...

295
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,970
There's a lot we can talk about.

296
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,210
With such a grand display,

297
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,300
Heavenly Lord Dacheng,
what do you want to discuss?

298
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,240
Four hundred and ten years ago,

299
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,370
I sealed your spiritual energy

300
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,490
and cast you back to heaven.

301
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,240
Do you still hate me?

302
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,350
What do you think?

303
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,880
After you regained your spiritual energy,

304
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,340
you pretended to marry me,

305
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,330
and on our wedding day,

306
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,840
you stabbed my heart meridian
with the Hanlin Dagger,

307
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,500
suppressing me for a century.

308
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,920
Ruyue, isn't the century of suffering

309
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,270
enough to compensate for your
10 years of hardships in the mortal realm?

310
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,680
For pain, what matters

311
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,030
is intensity, not duration.

312
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,030
Fine. Then I'd like to know

313
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,360
just how deep your hatred is

314
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,150
that after sealing me,

315
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,110
you would plunder
magical artifacts and elixirs,

316
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,440
occupy immortal sects,

317
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,700
and act so recklessly,

318
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,310
angering the heavens and the people.

319
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,710
I've never seen the wrath
of heaven and men,

320
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,550
but there are plenty of immortals
who want to kill me.

321
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,240
You know,

322
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,050
I never wanted to kill you.

323
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,420
When I occupied Tianmu Peak,

324
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,220
all I wanted was an explanation.

325
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,720
You destroyed your own physical body

326
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,580
and your primordial spirit fled.

327
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,550
I never laid a hand on you.

328
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,210
Even if you never attacked me,

329
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,990
you still deserve to die.

330
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,930
I deserve to die?

331
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,960
Do you think everything you've done
in the past

332
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,750
was right?

333
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,960
All effects arise from causes.

334
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,770
All retributions are born from karma.

335
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,960
The great drought in the world
was caused by the Drought Dragon.

336
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,670
But why don't you think about

337
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,450
how there are millions of
acres of land in the world,

338
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,030
but the Drought Dragon

339
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,890
only chose Mount Wuju as its lair?

340
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,840
It's because Mount Wuju

341
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,990
was its place of origin.

342
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
It was born in and cultivated there.

343
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,960
But humans upended mountains and forests,
diverted water,

344
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,090
and slaughtered the creatures
on Mount Wuju.

345
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,900
Since then,

346
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,420
the plants on Mount Wuju withered,
and the living beings suffered.

347
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,450
It became a land of death.

348
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,270
The Drought Dragon had to leave this place

349
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,880
to find elsewhere to live.

350
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,870
You have a compassionate heart,

351
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,880
killing the Drought Dragon
to save the world.

352
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,080
But if human lives are lives,

353
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,370
aren't the lives of those creatures
on Mount Wuju

354
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,520
also lives as well?

355
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,810
Karma is a personal matter.

356
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,550
Even the closest blood relatives
cannot bear it for another.

357
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,590
The Drought Dragon cannot represent

358
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,250
the creatures that died
on Mount Wuju back then.

359
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,230
Those mortals who died
because of the drought

360
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,830
were not the ones who
caused harm back then.

361
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,920
You are a god.

362
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,920
You stand above the mortal world,
looking down on all living beings,

363
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,310
but you've never considered things
from their perspective.

364
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,030
The causes were planted by others,

365
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,230
yet they have to bear the consequences.

366
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,560
This is not karma for them

367
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,630
but an undeserved disaster.

368
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,610
The way of heaven has its cycles.
Good and evil have their consequences.

369
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,730
In ancient times,

370
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,080
people ate raw meat, drank blood,
and walked naked.

371
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,850
Leizu invented silk
and Shennong identified herbs.

372
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,730
Since then, people have had food to eat
and clothes to wear.

373
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Since you speak of cause and effect,

374
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,810
why do they only receive the good
and not bear the bad?

375
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,690
If you speak of heavenly retribution
and karmic consequences,

376
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,170
then let me discuss it with you.

377
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,550
You say that causes and effects
are predetermined.

378
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,010
You and I were born as gods.

379
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,160
Are we also bound by this
cycle of cause and effect?

380
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,650
Meng Qi worked for Qichi Hall for decades.

381
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,020
Meng Chi dedicated his life to me.

382
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,730
Meng Changqin was even my disciple.

383
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,920
I received offerings from mortals.
That was the cause.

384
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,330
I slew the Drought Dragon
and protected the people.

385
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,460
That was the effect.

386
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:46,420
You speak of the cycle of cause
and effect, and I follow this too.

387
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,380
Why are you right and I'm wrong?

388
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
You are a god.

389
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,910
Your causes and effects shouldn't
be entangled with humans.

390
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,640
You seem to have forgotten.

391
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,290
Eleven years ago,
at the foot of Yufan Mountain,

392
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,350
the real Li Qingyue had already died.

393
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,560
I entered her body
with my primordial spirit.

394
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,790
From that moment on,
I also became a mortal.

395
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,270
What about you, Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

396
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,130
Why are your causes and effects

397
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,530
still entangled with mine to this day?

398
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,240
I thought

399
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,160
you knew.

400
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,480
Bai Jiusi,

401
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,240
have you ever tasted
the bitterness of the mortal realm?

402
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,560
You have never experienced
the helplessness of mortals.

403
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,180
You have no right to discuss this with me.

404
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,850
You sealed my power for
10 years back then.

405
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,710
Today, I want to make another
10-year pact with you

406
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,040
to see who is right and who is wrong.

407
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,440
Do you dare?

408
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,450
Why wouldn't I dare?

409
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,840
Fine, but don't regret it later.

410
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,350
Senior!

411
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,280
Senior!

412
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,940
Senior!

413
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,600
-Senior!
-Senior!

414
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,250
Senior.

415
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,000
Senior, have you found Master?

416
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,550
The celestial phenomena have
changed, pointing to the east.

417
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,910
I tried to use the spirit escape technique
to rush to the east and investigate,

418
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,960
but I was blocked by a great flood.

419
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,390
Blocked by a great flood?

420
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,010
What does this mean?

421
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,350
The air was filled with
bone-chilling mist.

422
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,120
Master

423
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,480
must be in the water.

424
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,640
What should we do then?

425
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,380
Notify the dragon clans of the Four Seas.

426
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,440
Have them dispatch their naval forces

427
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,700
and search for Master.

428
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,570
We absolutely can't let
Divine Lord Siling get the upper hand.

429
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,800
Puyuan, notify all disciples
of Canglei Palace.

430
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,880
Head east and stop when
you encounter water.

431
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,340
You must search thoroughly.

432
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,200
Don't miss a single corner.

433
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,600
Rest assured. I'll go
arrange this right away.

434
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,160
Elder!

435
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,750
Elder, Canglei Palace has acted.

436
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,150
Where are they going?

437
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,350
They're heading east.

438
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,610
The exact destination is still unknown.

439
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,000
Notify all disciples to head east.

440
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,540
We must find Master
before Canglei Palace does.

441
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,030
Yes.

442
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,440
Master.

443
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,110
Qingyue was once my disciple.

444
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,310
She kept many things from me in the past,

445
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,170
but now,

446
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,920
I request to join the search for her.

447
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,120
Very well.

448
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,940
Be careful in everything.

449
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,440
Yes, Master.

450
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,700
[Simple Joy]

451
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,730
With your power sealed,

452
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,260
you must live here as a mortal
for 10 years.

453
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,660
No matter what happens
during these 10 years,

454
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,580
you must not use your power recklessly.

455
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,180
If you violate this restriction,
you will suffer consequences.

456
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,000
At the very least, your essence
and divine body will be damaged.

457
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,200
At worst, it'll be destroyed,
and you will never recover.

458
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,070
Okay.

459
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,780
I'll wait for you to show me the so-called
sufferings of the mortal realm.

460
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,060
[Simple Joy]

461
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,750
So,

462
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,310
am I considered a mortal now?

463
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,450
Where are these mortal
sufferings you speak of?

464
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,110
Time is long. Experience it yourself.

465
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,140
Since I am a mortal,

466
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,790
I should have an identity.

467
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,360
If someone asks about our relationship,

468
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,010
how should I answer?

469
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,200
Why don't we

470
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,920
address each other as husband and wife?

471
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,770
What do you think?

472
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,510
Whatever.

473
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,480
I don't understand mortals?

474
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,830
You're awake.

475
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,090
Come have some tea.

476
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,740
What are you doing?

477
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,030
I read a book last night

478
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,350
called "The Classic of Dwellings."

479
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,930
There's some truth in what it says.

480
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:38,030
It says a dwelling's layout
is its body,

481
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,280
springs are its blood vessels,

482
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,110
land is its flesh,
and plants are its hair.

483
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,590
Houses are its clothes,
and gates are its hat.

484
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,640
If all these align, it's most auspicious.

485
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,110
Look at the

486
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,520
fengshui layout of this place now.

487
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,070
It really can't be compared

488
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,600
to the Qichi Hall I built you

489
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,680
over 400 years ago.

490
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,630
What? Do you want to build
another Qichi Hall?

491
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,110
Not exactly.

492
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,640
Just some minor renovations.

493
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,520
Come here.

494
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,880
I plan

495
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,220
to add two more flower stands here

496
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,120
and grow some flowers and plants.

497
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,990
We'll raise some fish in this pond.

498
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,140
The entire courtyard

499
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,190
will be repainted and redecorated.

500
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,740
Don't you like cooking?

501
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,240
I also plan to renovate

502
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,710
this kitchen a little.

503
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,350
What do you think?

504
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,250
Hey, Lord,

505
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,400
what woman likes to spend
all her time in the kitchen?

506
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,350
If you really want to please your wife,

507
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,750
you should cook with her,

508
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,960
not just renovate a kitchen for her.

509
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,460
Let's pack up everything.

510
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,929
We're leaving.

511
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:36,670
Come down.

512
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,590
Sir.

513
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,250
It's already finished?

514
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,000
Lord, the remaining work

515
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,250
can be finished tomorrow,

516
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,850
so we'll head back for today.

517
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,050
Be careful.

518
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:46,590
Let's go.

519
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,489
Let's go.

520
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,790
You must be the new neighbor.

521
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,280
I'm Lin Fan. I live next door.

522
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,960
My wife just made some pastries.

523
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,560
I brought some for you to try.

524
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,230
Thank you,

525
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,900
but that's not necessary.

526
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,010
Don't be so polite with me.

527
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,920
Look how hungry you are.

528
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,400
Here.

529
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,360
Hungry?

530
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,480
We're neighbors now.

531
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,970
May I ask your name?

532
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,830
Bai Jiusi.

533
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,670
Bai Jiusi?

534
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,070
I'll leave these here for you.

535
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,550
No need.

536
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,530
Remember to eat them, Bai.

537
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,150
Goodbye.

538
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,090
Remember to eat them!

539
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:15,960
You're back.

540
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,330
What are you cooking today?

541
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,040
It smells delicious.

542
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,760
Let me help you.

543
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,330
I'll carry this over first.

544
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,470
Where's mine?

545
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,840
Didn't you say you wanted to experience
the hardships of the mortal realm?

546
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,030
Then be self-reliant.

547
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,550
I...

548
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,570
Take care, you two.

549
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,000
What would you like to eat, sir?

550
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,030
Anything will do.

551
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,120
Please wait a moment.
Your food will be ready soon.

552
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,900
Hey, Scholar Kong,

553
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,560
you look much more haggard than before.

554
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,230
You can't just eat plain bread
soaked in water.

555
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,250
You should treat yourself
to something better occasionally.

556
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,650
As long as it fills my stomach,
it's enough.

557
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,630
Indeed.

558
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,070
You're saving up for the exams.

559
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,090
With your hard work,

560
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,920
I'm sure you'll pass this year.

561
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,980
Thank you for your kind words.

562
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,850
We'll take our leave now. Goodbye.

563
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:29,880
See you.

564
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:30,610
Please.

565
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,880
Mr. Lin, Mrs. Lin, have you been well?

566
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,000
Enjoy your meal.

567
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,440
Enjoy your meal.

568
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,500
We'll be going now.

569
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,650
Here, take it easy.

570
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,760
Mr. Lin is here!

571
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,650
-Mr. Lin.
-Mr. Lin.

572
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,690
Enjoy your meal.

573
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,670
Mr. Lin.

574
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,810
You've come to dine out again?

575
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:51,000
Yes, the usual for us.

576
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,530
Alright!

577
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,360
-Please.
-Let’s go.

578
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,200
Mr. Kong is here too?

579
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,130
Mr. Lin has arrived.

580
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,670
Let's sit.

581
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,360
Bai?

582
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,000
My lady,

583
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,390
this is Bai, the neighbor

584
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,670
I often mention to you.

585
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,120
This is my wife.

586
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:12,910
Everyone,

587
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,450
this is our new neighbor.

588
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,320
Please take good care of him
in the neighborhood.

589
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,000
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

590
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,270
Thank you, thank you.

591
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,510
Bai, I heard you live with your wife.

592
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,030
Why are you eating out alone?

593
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,070
Did you have a fight?

594
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,670
That's not right of you.

595
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,740
As a real man,

596
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,600
you should always
give in to your wife a little.

597
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,070
How about I teach you a few tricks?

598
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,280
No matter how big a mistake you've made,

599
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,080
I guarantee you can immediately
pacify your wife.

600
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,000
Pacify?

601
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,050
Watch carefully.

602
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,190
Sit.

603
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:18,840
Come.

604
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:22,760
Come.

605
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:43,980
Bai.

606
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,410
Just like this.

607
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,670
If you always care for
and look after your wife,

608
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,670
how can she be angry with you?

609
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,910
Come.

610
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,600
I've brought some hot dishes back.

611
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:08,670
Eat up.
