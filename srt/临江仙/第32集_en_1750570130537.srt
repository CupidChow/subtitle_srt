00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
FINDING A HUSBAND FOR MYSELF

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
FINDING A HUSBAND FOR MYSELF

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
FINDING A HUSBAND FOR MYSELF

4
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Episode 1

5
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Master

6
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I heard that these people are left

7
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Thank you for your kindness

8
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I thank you again

9
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Master

10
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Jingyun Sect is badly injured

11
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The immortal needs help

12
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I have to go

13
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ok

14
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I will listen to you

15
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Go if you want

16
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Go

17
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Remember to go back to Cangli Hall

18
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
See your father

19
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
In the past, I was full of evil

20
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I only hurt people

21
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Now I want to be like him

22
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Take a look at the three realms

23
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Remember to be patient

24
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Master

25
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's true

26
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Think about it

27
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How can you go to this place

28
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Really going to leave

29
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There are always reasons for him to wait in the past

30
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
After this

31
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I also understand the reason for cherishing the person in front of me

32
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So I have to accompany A'Man to go back to the Immortal Sects

33
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Help him rebuild the sects

34
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Go to the right path

35
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Master has cried

36
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
If you stay

37
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It will be the next master

38
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You are more suitable than me

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I have no cultivation

40
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
How can I

41
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Who said that the master must choose with cultivation

42
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Your belief

43
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I am not inferior

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Junior brother, don't worry

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
In the future, there will be any need for the spirit

46
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I will be back at any time

47
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's go

48
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Have a good trip

49
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Reconciled with your father

50
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Not reconciled

51
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Just afraid of trouble

52
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
After all, hatred itself is a very tiring thing

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
More transparent than me

54
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Immortal

55
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why is Xiao Jing Shan dead

56
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The drought in the mortal world is getting worse

57
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Are the bad things still going on

58
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Xiao Jing Shan is not the bad thing itself

59
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He just provoked the bad things

60
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The evil spirit that was leaked by the cup of no quantity

61
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's even worse

62
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hold the bad air

63
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It seems that it can't be forced

64
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No, there is another way

65
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Immortal

66
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Are you going to do everything you can?

67
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I was able to kill the dragon and break the evil spirit

68
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now I can also turn into rain and rain

69
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
To kill the people

70
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But now

71
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I was born a god

72
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Enjoying the heaven and earth is already too much

73
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's time to do something

74
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Revenge this world

75
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Back then, the father of the red alliance spent all his power

76
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Open the red alliance

77
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Only now is the heaven and earth

78
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Although I can't compare with him

79
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But I want to be like him

80
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
To return happiness and harmony to the world

81
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You are

82
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The ancient god of time, Xi E

83
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It seems that the White-Jade Bureau mentioned me to you

84
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What are you doing here?

85
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I was affected by the huge time fluctuation

86
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So I came to see

87
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I didn't expect an ordinary person to be able to make such a powerful weapon

88
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's really impressive

89
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Xiao Jing Shan is not an ordinary person

90
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
When we were fighting with him before

91
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Why didn't you appear?

92
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Xiao Jing Shan is your cause and effect

93
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can't interfere

94
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I just want to remind you

95
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This weapon can turn back time

96
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Let you go back to the past

97
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Is this true?

98
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Of course

99
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But I have to remind you first

100
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Changing the past may not change the future

101
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Each cycle has a certain cause and effect

102
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
These two are a bit spiritual

103
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll take it away first

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Are you going with him?

105
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Not only can he save Ni Yan

106
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It can also turn into a food that can't be eaten

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes

108
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
See you again

109
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Uncle

110
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Husband

111
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Husband

112
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Mother

113
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Da Shan!

114
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Father!

115
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Are you okay?

116
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,720
A girl suddenly called us out.

117
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,720
It's good that you're okay.

118
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,320
It's good that you're okay.

119
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,560
Your mother-in-law is dead.

120
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,880
Why are you still...

121
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,080
So he did lie?

122
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,960
What's wrong with Xiao Jing Shan?

123
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,600
Isn't he dead?

124
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,480
Zi Yang, Li Mo, LÃ¼ Su Guan, Shang Guan, Ri Yuan and Cang Tu

125
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,520
And Bai Jiusi

126
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,960
Are they still alive?

127
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,120
What's wrong with you?

128
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,520
So that's what it means

129
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,320
What's wrong with you?

130
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,320
Nothing

131
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,600
It's just...

132
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Return to the West

133
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Return to the West

134
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,600
What is he doing?

135
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,240
He's writing a road for those old brothers

136
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Return to the West

137
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Return to the West

138
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,160
Return to the West

139
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Return to the West

140
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Would you like to be the leader of the Moon Tribe?

141
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,160
Qingyuan

142
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,000
Master, you are...

143
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Return to the West

144
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Return to the West

145
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,960
You should go back

146
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
I have something to tell you

147
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
Return to the West

148
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Yes

149
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Return to the West

150
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Return to the West

151
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Return to the West

152
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
Return to the West

153
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Return to the West

154
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,760
Master

155
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,960
I gave the contract sword to Xiao Jing Shan

156
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Don't you blame me?

157
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,960
You did nothing wrong for your fellow sect

158
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,280
Xuan Wei

159
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
I was selfish in the past

160
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
I asked you to go to the water to deal with Bai Jiu Temple

161
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Now I've figured it out

162
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
You should go your own way

163
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
I feel that you are full of cultivation

164
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
You can go to the Nine Heavens in one step

165
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Don't suppress yourself anymore

166
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,280
I am young and unfortunate

167
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
My mother died early

168
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Just in the year of the Great Han

169
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,280
My father died of famine

170
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
I am a small child

171
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
In this year of the Great Han

172
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
I am not bullied

173
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
I am not able to survive

174
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Fortunately

175
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
I met my master

176
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Master

177
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,280
He taught me great righteousness

178
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,280
He taught me great righteousness

179
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Master's great kindness

180
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
I have my parents

181
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
Xuan Wei

182
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
I have nothing to repay in this life

183
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Why do you say this?

184
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,280
I used to be confused

185
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,280
I can't figure out some things

186
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Now it's time

187
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,280
This is how I get rid of the anger

188
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
I have no great righteousness

189
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
What is your Tao?

190
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:59,420
The path of

191
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,280
What are you doing?

192
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
This is the first grass

193
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
I have been lying in the water

194
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
I have no harm to my body

195
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
I will only be trapped for half a day

196
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
What do you want?

197
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Master

198
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,280
The reason why I gave the Seven-Moon Sword to Xiao Jing Shan

199
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
Not entirely for the sake of the same family

200
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
But

201
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
I don't want to die in his hands

202
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
You went to find someone

203
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
These days

204
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
I have been confused

205
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I have been confused

206
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,280
I can't stop Xiao Jing Shan

207
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,280
I was going to fight

208
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,280
But I failed

209
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
I have to believe

210
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
I have been confused

211
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,280
I have to believe

212
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,280
I

213
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
I must die

214
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
I must die in the hands of Xiao Jing Shan

215
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
Or

216
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
Die for Master

217
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
I choose the latter

218
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
What are you talking about?

219
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
For thousands of years

220
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,280
There are many old and old

221
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,280
There are many old and old

222
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,280
There are many old and old

223
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
There are many old and old

224
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
There are many old and old

225
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
I have been thinking about it

226
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
I always feel that the road ahead is hard to live

227
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,280
I always feel that the road ahead is hard to live

228
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
And every time

229
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
As long as you insist

230
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Can stand it

231
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
This is not a request

232
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Not a request to worship the Buddha

233
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,280
But I insist on it

234
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
But I insist on it

235
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Master also said

236
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
I am a cultivator

237
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Not just for

238
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
Get the flying life

239
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
Should think about this land

240
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Should think about this land

241
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Can do something for this cloud

242
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Can do something for this cloud

243
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
I don't want to be a deity

244
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
I will wait for this opportunity

245
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,280
I will wait for this opportunity

246
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
You are a human

247
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Power is not enough to move the world

248
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Even if you follow the road

249
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,280
It doesn't work

250
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
Xuan Wei, don't be strong

251
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
You know I have no concern

252
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
You can't change my fate

253
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,280
Master

254
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Before Xiao Jinshan died

255
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Before Xiao Jinshan died

256
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Give this to Master

257
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
It means he is clear

258
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Many things are still answered by Master

259
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,280
The most fortunate thing in my life

260
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
The most fortunate thing in my life

261
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Can meet Master

262
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
Even if it's a second time

263
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,280
I will not regret

264
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Every thing you do

265
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Please

266
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Please give this fortune

267
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
Please give this fortune

268
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,280
To me

269
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Master

270
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,280
I

271
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,280
I am leaving

272
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
I am leaving

273
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
I hope

274
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
I hope

275
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Take care

276
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Take care

277
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Take care

278
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Take care

279
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Master's great grace

280
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Take care

281
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Master

282
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
Master

283
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
Master

284
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Master

285
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
Father

286
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Is here

287
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Master

288
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Master

289
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Master

290
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Master

291
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Master

292
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Master

293
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Master

294
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Master

295
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
Master

296
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,280
Master

297
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,280
Master

298
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,280
Master

299
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
Master

300
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Master

301
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,280
Master

302
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,280
Master

303
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Master

304
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Master

305
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Master

306
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Master

307
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
Xiang Yu...

308
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
and because of you...

309
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
It's Xue Wei.

310
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Now...

311
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,120
it's also his own choice.

312
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,760
Just like me.

313
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,280
From the moment we met until now,

314
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,560
we decided to follow you till the end of our lives.

315
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,920
chief

316
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,080
Master

317
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,680
pear

318
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,640
plastic

319
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,160
allied

320
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,440
real

321
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,040
artificial

322
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,840
flower

323
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,080
translates as

324
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,780
To 30'

325
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,580
To 40'

326
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
This...

327
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
This cycle...

328
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,680
We've gone too many wrong ways.

329
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,680
We've had too many regrets.

330
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,680
Since we have the chance,

331
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,680
we can let the other cycles

332
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,680
not make so many mistakes.

333
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,680
Before Xiao Jin Shan died,

334
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,680
he handed this to Master.

335
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,280
It means he knows

336
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,480
there are still things

337
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,480
that need Master to solve.

338
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,680
I think I know how to use this thing.

339
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,480
Use it...

340
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,880
God whatever God...

341
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Who's in disguise.

342
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,680
I'll leave right now.

343
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
I'll help you to get rid of the evil spirit.

344
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
You... What are you doing?

345
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
I can only help you to get here.

346
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
You can explain it by yourself.

347
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
Let's go.

348
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Hit him harder.

349
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Hit him harder.

350
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Let me go.

351
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
Hit him harder.

352
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
Hit him harder.

353
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Hit him harder.

354
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
Hit him harder.

355
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Hit him harder.

356
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
Hit him harder.

357
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Hit him harder.

358
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
Let's go.

359
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
You're annoying.

360
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Who are you?

361
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
I'm a deity in the heavens.

362
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
I saw you have some spirit energy.

363
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
So I came down to help you.

364
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Take this book.

365
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
You need to understand it.

366
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Because you need to understand it.

367
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
I'm a deity.

368
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,280
Because I need to understand it.

369
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
Because you need to understand it.

370
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
Because I need to understand it.

371
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,280
You need to practice it.

372
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,280
You will have a good luck.

373
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
Fairy sister.

374
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
What can I do for you?

375
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Practice it well.

376
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
You will have a great sect in the future.

377
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
It's the sacrifice.

378
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
By the way.

379
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,280
If you meet a girl who will give you flowers in the future.

380
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Remember to cherish it.

381
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
Give me flowers?

382
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
I eat.

383
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
I finally get it.

384
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
I'm sorry.

385
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
I'm sorry.

386
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
I'm sorry.

387
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
I'm sorry.

388
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
I'm sorry.

389
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
I'm sorry.

390
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,280
I'm sorry.

391
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
I'm sorry.

392
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
I'm sorry.

393
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
I'm sorry.

394
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
I'm sorry.

395
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
I'm sorry.

396
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
I'm sorry.

397
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,280
I'm sorry.

398
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
I'm sorry.

399
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
I'm sorry.

400
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
I'm sorry.

401
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
I'm sorry.

402
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
I'm sorry.

403
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
I'm sorry.

404
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,280
I'm sorry.

405
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
I'm sorry.

406
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Who are you?

407
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,280
Be careful, don't move your baby.

408
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
What did you say?

409
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,340
China

410
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,100
Japan

411
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,220
U Clone

412
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,280
You didn't listen to a word I said.

413
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,280
You promised me to save Meng Changqin only once.

414
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,280
That's why I agreed to spend time with you.

415
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
But you broke your promise.

416
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Now you broke the heaven's rules.

417
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,280
I can't tolerate you anymore.

418
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,280
The messenger of the heaven is not easy to deal with.

419
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,280
What did you say?

420
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,280
Okay, I know.

421
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,280
You stopped the messenger of the heaven.

422
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,280
And don't try to take the punishment for me.

423
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Even if I agree to let you take it,

424
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,280
I won't let the child in my belly.

425
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
What?

426
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Okay.

427
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
I'll leave the jade statue to you.

428
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,280
I'm relieved to have you.

429
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,280
Why can't I leave with you?

430
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,280
Because I'm going to find a person who has disappeared.

431
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,280
It may take tens of thousands of years.

432
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
You can live your own life.

433
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
Don't have to surround me.

434
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,280
Will you come back?

435
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,280
Maybe.

436
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,280
I'm sorry.

437
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
I'm sorry.

438
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
Bai Jiusi.

439
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,280
I'll be your companion.

440
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,280
I'm sorry.

441
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Bai Jiusi.

442
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,280
I'm sorry.

443
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
Bai Jiusi.

444
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Bai Jiusi.

445
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,280
I'm sorry.

446
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,280
A'Yu.

447
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
I'm sorry.

448
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
I'm sorry.

449
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,280
I'm sorry.

450
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,280
What are you looking at me for?

451
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,280
I'm responsible for you.

452
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,280
I'm sorry.

453
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,280
I'm sorry.

454
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,280
I'm sorry.

455
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,280
I'm sorry.

456
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,280
I'm sorry.

457
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,280
