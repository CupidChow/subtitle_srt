I don't want to listen to your heart

Miss A-Yun, why are you here alone?

34
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,100
Mr. Bai, did he go into the fire?

35
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,100
What's going on?

36
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,100

All right.

Without any

49
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,700
This is called the Heavenly Way.

50
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,700
No one can help him.

51
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,700
No one can help him.

52
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,700
It's the Heavenly Way again.

53
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
You said that the old man was a righteous man.

54
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,700
What about Lin Fan?

55
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,700
You just saw him die in peace and happiness.

56
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,700
It's hard to believe that fate is hard.

57
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,700
When fate comes, everything will be in vain.

58
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,700
You're so cold-blooded.

59
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,700
You're so unchanging.

60
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,700
It's the Heavenly Way that made him die.

61
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,700
It's not me.

62
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
If Lin Fan hears this,

63
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,700
will he regret that he treated you like a friend?

64
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Miss Yue, Mr. Bai.

65
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Are you fighting because of me?

66
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,700
The doctor said you need to rest.

67
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Miss Yue, don't blame Mr. Bai.

68
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,700
It's my husband who chose to save others.

69
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,700
He's not willing to be with others.

70
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,700
I'm his husband.

71
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,700
He's my husband.

72
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,700
He's so stupid.

73
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,700
He's so stupid.

74
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,700
He knows he can't do anything.

75
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,700
He knows he can't do anything.

76
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,700
He knows he can't do anything.

77
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
He knows he can't do anything.

78
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
He still needs to save others.

79
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,700
He said that after he was a man,

80
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
he could listen to his fate.

81
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,700
But he won't give up on his hope.

82
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,700
I also liked him back then.

83
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
My little Tao.

84
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
When he comes out,

85
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
he'll be his father.

86
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,700
My dear brother.

87
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Mr. Bai,

88
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
he's my best friend.

89
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,700
I don't want you to fight

90
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,700
because of him.

91
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Okay.

92
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,700
We don't fight.

93
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,700
I'll send you back to me.

94
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Let's go.

95
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,700
What's wrong?

96
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,700
What's wrong?

97
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,700
I...

98
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,700
I'm so sorry.

99
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,700
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,700
I'm so sorry.

101
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,700
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,700
I know you're sorry,

107
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,700
but you didn't do anything.

108
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
I can't open my eyes.

109
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
I can't open my eyes.

110
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
I can't open my eyes.

111
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
I've been in the palace for so long.

112
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
Why is there such a disaster?

113
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,700
Yes.

114
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
What's wrong with your mother?

115
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,700
How is she?

116
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,700
She's not well.

117
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,700
Zidane and Anchan can't go out.

118
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,700
Go find Dr. Xu.

119
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
If anything happens,

120
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
you can take care of her.

121
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,700
I'll go now.

122
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,700
How are you?

123
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
What are you doing?

124
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
My stomach is so bad.

125
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,700
You can't live.

126
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,700
You're a baby.

127
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
You must protect Ling.

128
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,700
You must protect yourself.

129
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,700
You said that I'm so cute.

130
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,700
How about we share a baby?

131
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
Bai,

132
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,700
can I be a good father?

133
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,700
I beg you.

134
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,700
That's God's will.

135
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
I want him to live.

136
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
It's my fault if I die.

137
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
I saved him.

138
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,700
It's the result.

139
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,700
Mr. Bai is my best friend.

140
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Zidane!

141
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
Oh, my god!

142
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
You are here.

143
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,700
Mr. Ji, I'm here!

144
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
You can't go out.

145
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,700
Go out.

146
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Come out.

147
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,700
Stop taking things.

148
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,700
Sir, please hold yourself together.

149
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,700
Oops, I coming here, maybe she'll just die.

150
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,060
Ma Bailey, my man.

151
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:55,920
Stop bendy.

152
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:03,600
Mr. Lu.

153
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,560
Ma Bailey.

154
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,860
Ma Bailey.

155
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,660
Ma Bailey, my man.

156
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,960
Ma Bailey, Ma Bailey.

157
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,520
And this is Hamlet

158
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,940
My favorite

159
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,320
Baishu possibility

160
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,820
I knew you were in there

161
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,300
disappear into巡

162
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
I'm right outside.

163
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,300
If anything happens, remember to call me.

164
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,300
The End

165
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
Good morning, my parents.

166
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,300
I've been to the house for two months.

167
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,300
I don't know if my parents are guilty.

168
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,300
My father sent me to the mountain to get the immortal.

169
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,300
I was trying to get away from the world.

170
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,300
But now, Jin Yunzong is still in the West.

171
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,300
Not long ago, my little sister Li Qingyue,

172
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,300
became a immortal.

173
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,300
She even fought with the Great Chen Xuan in Tianmu Fang.

174
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,300
She was so weak and broke.

175
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
I don't know where she went.

176
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Since then, our sects have been so weak.

177
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,300
They said Jin Yunzong is the first sect in the Six Realms.

178
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,300
They said they would attack the Celestial Tribe.

179
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,300
They said they would fight with the immortals.

180
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,300
They are so brave.

181
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,300
They taught me well.

182
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,300
So I hope my father can take me home.

183
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
And teach me well.

184
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,300
That way, I can relieve my worries.

185
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,300
I'm going to eat.

186
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,300
I'm so eager to eat.

187
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,300
I hope my parents can come to see me soon.

188
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,300
Jiang Bin.

189
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,300
Coming.

190
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
Coming.

191
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Brother Song, what can I do for you?

192
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,300
What else can I do?

193
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,300
I went to the Shoushan Sect.

194
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,300
I was the one who took the Shoushan Sect yesterday.

195
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Why did you take me there?

196
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,300
I went to the Shoushan Sect with a lot of elders and disciples.

197
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,300
Now, Jin Yunzong is just a few of us.

198
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Why don't you go to Shoushan Sect?

199
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,300
There's no one else in Jin Yunzong.

200
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
Didn't Senior Brother Meng Chu let you go?

201
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
He should go.

202
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,300
Senior Brother Meng Chu should go, too.

203
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300
Where can he go?

204
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,300
He's a father and a mother.

205
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
He even died with all the villagers.

206
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
Where else can he go?

207
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
Of course, he went to the Yinlian Sect.

208
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
What about Senior Brother Zhang Sun?

209
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Senior Brother Zhang...

210
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,300
The Shoushan Sect

211
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
It's already the third day.

212
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
Do you want to go there?

213
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,300
If you don't want to, don't follow me.

214
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
I don't.

215
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,300
I just think that you're like a bird in the sky.

216
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
You have no purpose.

217
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
It's not that.

218
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
It's that you're looking for a place to go.

219
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,300
I'm more curious about the past between you and the Fairy.

220
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,300
How can you be so selfish?

221
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Da Jian!

222
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,300
Give me all your money!

223
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,300
I dare not!

224
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,300
This wild road is where you buy bones.

225
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,300
What are you thinking about?

226
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,300
This year,

227
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,300
what kind of small wolf can come out and fight?

228
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,300
You go first.

229
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,300
We...

230
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
We're not going to fight.

231
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,300
We're going to fight.

232
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,300
We're going to fight.

233
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
We're going to fight.

234
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
We're not going to fight.

235
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
Young Master Wei!

236
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
Young Master Wei!

237
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
We know we're wrong.

238
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,300
We're really wrong.

239
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
Young Master Wei, please forgive us.

240
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,300
We can't.

241
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,300
We're not going to fight.

242
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,300
You little bandits,

243
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,300
dare you fight with me?

244
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,300
Wait.

245
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Give it to me.

246
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
You two,

247
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
do you know the way down the mountain?

248
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,300
I know.

249
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,300
We know each other the best.

250
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,300
There are three ways down the mountain.

251
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,300
The first one is the way that you two come.

252
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,300
The second one is the way that you two go to the north.

253
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,300
I think you two should not think about the third way.

254
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,300
Why?

255
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,300
Because the road is a bit dangerous.

256
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Right.

257
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
The place is so narrow.

258
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
There are so many people.

259
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,300
The soldiers were sealed up a while ago.

260
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
It's been a long time since they were killed.

261
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,300
I heard that the people who went there are all innocent.

262
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Young Master Wei, listen to me.

263
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,300
Don't go this way.

264
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Come on, come on.

265
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,300
Come on.

266
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
Come on.

267
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Come on.

268
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,300
Come on.

269
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
Dear guests,

270
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
this is the signature chicken with bamboo shoots.

271
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,300
You're all here.

272
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,300
Enjoy.

273
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,300
The dish of Guiyun Pavilion is called the best dish in Jinzhou.

274
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
If it's not for the government,

275
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,300
it will take 30 years to make it.

276
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,300
It's not the treasure of Guiyun Pavilion.

277
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,300
It's so delicious.

278
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,300
It's so tender.

279
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,300
Of course.

280
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,300
I heard that this dish must be made with the bamboo shoots

281
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
of the ancient and the bamboo shoots of the hundred-day season.

282
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,300
That's what it's called.

283
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
If it's bamboo shoots,

284
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,300
the bamboo shoots of the bamboo shoot

285
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
are not as good as the bamboo shoots of Songhe County.

286
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
Songhe County?

287
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,300
Where is it?

288
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
Songhe County's bamboo shoots of the Bizhou County.

289
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,300
The taste of the bamboo shoots of Wei Meifei is very rich.

290
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,300
This dish is praised for the taste of Songhe County's bamboo shoots.

291
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,300
It's even more delicious than the bamboo shoots of the fresh beef.

292
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,300
What's going on?

293
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,300
I've never heard of it.

294
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Young Master,

295
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
isn't this your shrimp?

296
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
What's wrong with you?

297
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,300
You're not educated.

298
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,300
You blame me for making trouble with your shrimp.

299
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,300
This is a big family.

300
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
Duan Weijun wrote it himself.

301
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300
He's writing it on the history book.

302
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,300
Duan Weijun?

303
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,300
I think it's been a long time since he died.

304
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,300
A long time ago?

305
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Is Songhe County still alive?

306
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,300
I don't know.

307
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
Since he died in the fall,

308
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,300
he should still be alive.

309
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
It's been a long time since Songhe County was established.

310
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
Songhe County is now in Yongdi.

311
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
You've been living in Yufan Mountain for a long time.

312
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,300
You've been living in Jingyun Village for eight years.

313
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,300
When did you go to Songhe County?

314
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,300
I don't remember.

315
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
What are you thinking about?

316
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,300
Nothing.

317
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,300
Don't tell me you're going to Songhe County.

318
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,300
I'll give you a chance to be a new person.

319
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,300
Otherwise...

320
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
I'll...

321
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,300
I'll be back.

322
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,300
Wait for me.

323
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,300
Songhe County

324
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
Your voice is good.

325
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,300
I didn't get hurt.

326
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,300
You stayed in the room for seven days.

327
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
I was tired.

328
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,300
I slept for seven days.

329
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
Help me wash the dishes.

330
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
I'll wash the dishes.

331
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
You're not feeling well.

332
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
Do you want to drink?

333
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,300
Songhe County

334
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Songhe County

335
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Dad.

336
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,300
Dad.

337
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,300
Dad.

338
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Dad, go!

339
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
Your dog.

340
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,300
My mom said you can speak in Chinese.

341
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,300
How can you not understand?

342
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,300
Uncle Bai, you're my godmother.

343
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300
I've just become a leader.

344
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,300
He's gone again.

345
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Uncle Bai, my uncle Tao is back.

346
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,300
He's so big and like a Westerner.

347
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,300
He's the eldest son of my family.

348
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
He's also the eldest son of the county.

349
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
He's always been in charge of my mom's cooking.

350
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
Are you going or not?

351
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
No.

352
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
Forget it.

353
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,300
I'll steal two of them for you.

354
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,300
I'll eat you anyway.

355
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,300
They said I'm a good cook.

356
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,300
I'll be a good cook.

357
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,300
My mom's cooking is so good.

358
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,300
My mom also thinks so.

359
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
She's also found me a good cook.

360
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,300
She gave me a new name.

361
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,300
It's called Li Shi'an.

362
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Is it good?

363
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,300
No.

364
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,300
I think it's good.

365
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,300
But I don't want to change my name.

366
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,300
I don't want to be a good cook.

367
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,300
I want to be a good cook.

368
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,300
I'm a good cook.

369
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,300
I think it's good.

370
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,300
Is it good?

371
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
Uncle Bai, is it good?

372
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
I'm sorry.

373
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,300
Uncle Bai, is it good?

374
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
Is it good?

375
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
Uncle Bai, wait for me.

376
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,300
Mr. Bai, are you still the same?

377
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,300
Sit down.

378
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,300
Mr. Bai, Mr. San.

379
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,300
Boss, I'm here for sugar and vinegar.

380
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,300
And I'm here for plum juice.

381
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
I'm not a sugar.

382
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
Why are you here to eat and drink?

383
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,300
I'm not talking.

384
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
My family is rich.

385
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,300
How can they steal your food?

386
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,300
Besides, I have uncle Bai.

387
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,300
My mom said he has a lot of money.

388
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
He doesn't do anything serious.

389
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,300
But how can he spend money?

390
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,300
Look, he's rich.

391
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,300
He's rich.

392
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
Isn't that money?

393
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,300
You're not that old.

394
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,300
You know a lot.

395
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
Go.

396
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,300
Are you done?

397
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,300
Yes.

398
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,300
Mr. Bai, here's your food.

399
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,300
Sugar and plum juice.

400
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Enjoy.

401
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,300
Uncle Bai, do you want to drink?

402
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,300
Say it.

403
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,300
What's wrong?

404
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,300
I'm not in a hurry.

405
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,300
I'm not in a hurry.

406
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:44,300
Uncle Bai, can you help me with the hair?

407
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,300
I'm not in a hurry.

408
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Just follow me.

409
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,300
You're the only one who can help me with this hair.

410
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,300
Uncle Bai, drink.

411
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,300
Uncle Bai, look.

412
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,300
Look, this is my dad.

413
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,300
Don't say that again.

414
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,300
I'm not a father anymore.

415
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,300
I'm a father.

416
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,300
He's different from you.

417
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,300
He's definitely not your dad.

418
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,300
I used to be like my dad.

419
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,300
I'm older than him.

420
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,300
I'm not your dad.

421
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,300
I'm not your dad.

422
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,300
I'm older than him.

423
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,300
I don't believe you.

424
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,300
Dad, tell them that you're my dad.

425
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Uncle Bai, I'm happy today.

426
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,300
My mom said you're my dad's best friend.

427
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
Can I marry your dad?

428
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Take it.

429
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,300
Uncle Bai, don't worry.

430
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
I'll secretly teach you.

431
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,300
Don't let others know.

432
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Don't worry.

433
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,300
I'm serious.

434
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,300
Can you do it, Uncle Bai?

435
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,300
Can you?

436
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,300
Can you?

437
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,300
Where did you take him?

438
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
I've asked him many times.

439
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,300
I'm a little bit greedy.

440
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,300
What's wrong?

441
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,300
Nothing.

442
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,300
I'll send him to the city first.

443
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,300
Come on.

444
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,300
I'm sorry.

445
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,300
Something wrong?

446
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,300
Did you tell me something?

447
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,300
No.

448
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,980
and congratulate our children of today.

449
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,760
As our daughter brought us hope,

450
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,920
thanks to mother,

451
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,920
we can live forever.

452
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,920
Last things comes?

453
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,420
Yes.

454
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,600
You must become better in school.

455
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,960
Butみんな anticipate,

456
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,180
dear,

457
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,160
you will never regret

458
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,920
theMusic you wrote.

459
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:58,000
Em, resources gonna come later

460
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,240
Ah, alas, someone bad

461
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,320
You are Tiara Yun Mein

462
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,320
I'm a good person. I'm not going to be a bad person.

463
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,320
You look so happy. But I'm a local.

464
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,320
I'm Xiao Yao Zi. I'm a retired.

465
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
This is my friend, Wang Shi from Jingzhou.

466
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
I'm a famous tourist.

467
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
Have you heard of him?

468
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
Yes.

469
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
I'm a famous tourist.

470
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
I'm telling you,

471
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,320
the director of Mo Chou has many films.

472
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,320
He's a famous tourist in the world.

473
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,320
He's so hardworking.

474
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
If you have time,

475
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
why don't you read something for him?

476
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,320
I'm a real writer.

477
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,320
I've never been out of the world.

478
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,320
How could I be a poet?

479
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,320
You're not sure?

480
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,320
He was born in a rural area.

481
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,320
But he loves the people.

482
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,320
He was a good person.

483
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,320
But he was a poor man.

484
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
His husband was a poor man.

485
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
He was a poor man.

486
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
He thought he was a poor man.

487
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,320
But he found a bone in his stomach.

488
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,320
So he raised the child alone.

489
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
Then he got sick.

490
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,320
He was six years old.

491
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,320
He was suffering all alone.

492
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,320
Who knows how long he's been living here.

493
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,320
His husband didn't return from the army.

494
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
He had a new wife.

495
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,320
He abandoned her.

496
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,320
He was a great man.

497
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,320
He tried his best.

498
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,320
He tried his best.

499
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
Why didn't he report to the government?

500
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,320
He was staying in Songhe County.

501
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,320
Songhe County is a remote place.

502
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,320
There are no wind and rain.

503
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,320
It's like a river.

504
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,320
I don't know what's going on outside.

505
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,320
There are many cold and cold areas in the Han region.

506
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,320
But there are many cold and cold areas in the Han region.

507
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,320
The government has been in the war.

508
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,320
Where should the people go?

509
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,320
It's always like this.

510
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,320
It's hard to live in the world.

511
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Women are God.

512
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,320
Especially women who lost their family.

513
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,320
If the fire in the dark night is not lit,

514
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,320
they will die.

515
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,320
The fire in the dark night is so strong.

516
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,320
It seems that we have to stay here for a few more days.

517
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,320
He's a good man.

518
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,320
He's so smart.

519
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
He's a good dog.

520
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,320
He's a good man.

521
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,320
He's a good dog.

522
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,320
He's a good man.

523
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,320
He's a good man.

524
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,320
He's a good man.

525
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,320
Every dog is so smart.

526
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,320
The fire in the dark night is so strong.

527
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,320
I think we will see each other again.

528
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Mr. Bai.

529
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,320
Let's not go there.

530
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Mr. Bai.

531
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,320
We will be safe and sound.

532
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,320
We will be safe and sound.

533
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,320
Go! Go!

534
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,320
Go!

535
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,320
Go!

536
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
Go!

537
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,320
Excuse me.

538
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,320
It's hard to survive when someone is single like this.

539
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Everything boils when a woman is born.

540
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,320
Especially one loss your family must eventually have.

541
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,320
In the midnight when the day is next,

542
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:36,320
the hellish night Saiying窄aurol can 커� ready.

543
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,860
Chapter 2

544
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,700
autor How could it go?

545
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,720
What are you doing?

546
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,220
I mentioned Christmas cake last night, right?

547
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,900
I wasn't there for dinner.

548
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,920
So I was thinking of buying it with you.

549
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,020
I'll stay.

550
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,020
Hey!

551
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,220
If you want to eat, just say it.

552
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,220
Don't be too polite.

553
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,420
I'll wait for you outside.

554
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,820
Come with me.

555
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,340
Come.

556
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,140
Is it good?

557
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,940
I'll give you whatever you want to eat.

558
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,020
Let go of me!

559
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,020
Let go of me!

560
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,020
Let go of me!

561
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,020
Let go of me!

562
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,020
Let go of me!

563
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,020
Let go of me!

564
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,020
Let go of me!

565
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,020
Let's go!

566
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,020
Let go of me!

567
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,020
Let go of me!

568
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,020
Enough.

569
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,020
Stop watching.

570
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,020
Let's go.

571
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,020
I dare to dig you two.

572
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,020
There are so many things to do.

573
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,020
What's the matter?

574
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,020
You don't know?

575
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,020
Last night,

576
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,020
there was a person's life.

577
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,020
A person's life?

578
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,020
Did he catch the murderer?

579
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,020
Where did he go?

580
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,020
I heard that

581
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,020
it was a evil spirit.

582
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,020
Really?

583
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,020
It's so flat.

584
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,020
How could there be evil spirits?

585
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,020
What evil spirits?

586
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,020
It's just a ghost.

587
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,020
If it's a evil spirit,

588
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
it's going to ruin the people's hearts.

589
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,020
You didn't see those two corpses.

590
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,020
They were all killed by human bodies.

591
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,020
It's not human bodies.

592
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,020
It's a mess.

593
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,020
You can't believe it.

594
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,020
You can't believe it.

595
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,020
Let's go.

596
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,020
Look at the blood.

597
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,020
It's real.

598
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,020
Go back first.

599
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,020
I'll go and make some soup.

600
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,020
Bai Jiu Si.

601
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,020
You're getting more and more like a person.

602
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,020
Mr. Bai.

603
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,020
Mr. Bai, you're back.

604
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,020
I'm so sorry.

605
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,020
My little girl

606
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,020
made you upset again yesterday.

607
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,020
I'm sorry.

608
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,020
These are all the cakes

609
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,020
that my sister likes.

610
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,020
Take them with you.

611
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,020
I'll take them.

612
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,020
I'll take them.

613
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,020
I'll take them.

614
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,020
I'll take them.

615
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,020
I'll take them.

616
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,020
I'll take them.

617
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,020
Take them with you.

618
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,020
I'll go in.

619
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,020
Thank you for your help.

620
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,020
Look.

621
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,020
A widow.

622
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,020
She's so close to other men.

623
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,020
She's so good at picking up the land.

624
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,020
Men like such a widow.

625
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,020
Mr. Chang.

626
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,020
I'm not good at it.

627
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,020
You're not good at it.

628
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,020
Go away.

629
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,020
I've never seen a man like him.

630
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,020
Look at his face.

631
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,020
Why?

632
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,020
I don't know how to teach you.

633
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,020
You can't be so rude.

634
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,020
You're bitten by a dog.

635
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,020
Can you still bite a dog?

636
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,020
I know.

637
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,020
Mom.

638
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,020
Go and pick up the ball.

639
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,020
Let's go home.

640
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,020
What's this?

641
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,020
What's this?

642
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,020
Uncle Bai.

643
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,020
You're sick, Uncle Bai.

644
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,020
Uncle Bai.

645
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,020
What did you use just now?

646
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,020
Can you teach me?

647
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,020
Uncle.

648
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,020
How is it?

649
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,020
You're sick, Uncle Bai.

650
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,020
You just saw me, right?

651
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,020
Uncle Bai is so brave.

652
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,020
How are you?

653
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,020
Young master.

654
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,020
Come with me.

655
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,420
Do you see it?

656
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,020
How can I see it?

657
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,020
I don't know.

658
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,020
Uncle Bai is a fairy.

659
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,420
Did you see it?

660
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,420
Mom, Uncle Bai is a fairy.

661
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,020
Did you see it?

662
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,020
I want to find it.

663
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,020
Uncle Bai is a fairy.

664
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,020
What do you want to say to the girl?

665
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,020
Nothing. Nothing.

666
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,020
Don't talk nonsense.

667
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,020
Go home.

668
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,020
Uncle Bai.

669
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,020
Go.

670
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,020
How are you?

671
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,020
I miss you so much.
