Don't let anyone know that this is aiende topic.

51

I will constantly talk about it.

But I will give you a hand

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
because I know you are an invITAble thief.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't want you to reach the place

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that I dare to care for you.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How to do it?

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I let you know today that

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000

кни там mentioned it,

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,880

64
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,440
this place is dark

65
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,280
Look,

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,200
i found a view

67
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,280

68
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:42,480

69
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,240
밟

70
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
Actually, you don't have to stay here with me.

71
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
You can go back to Yin Lian Sect first.

72
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,240
After I finish dealing with my matters here,

73
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,240
I will take the initiative to look for you.

74
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
When is that?

75
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,240
When can I wait for you to take the initiative to look for me?

76
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Man Man,

77
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,240
with this matter to end,

78
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,240
I will definitely go back with you.

79
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,240
You have the responsibility to let go.

80
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,240
You have the master and the copper door that you can't leave.

81
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,240
In my place, you only have one word.

82
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Wait, wait, wait.

83
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Meng Chu,

84
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
I can only ask you.

85
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Why can't you only have me?

86
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Let me ask you again.

87
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Are you going with me?

88
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
No.

89
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
Man Man,

90
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
don't be angry.

91
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Wait a little longer.

92
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
I will go with you.

93
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
My mother said

94
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
she won't take the initiative to look for you.

95
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Don't be angry.

96
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
I will give you two days to think about it.

97
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
I will go back to Yin Lian Sect the day after tomorrow.

98
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Will you go with me?

99
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Yes.

100
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Go with me.

101
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Mother.

102
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Shenzhen,

103
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
don't scare me.

104
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
I can't find my wife.

105
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
Shenzhen,

106
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
don't scare me.

107
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
I can't find my wife.

108
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
I can't find my wife.

109
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
I can't find my wife.

110
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
Where did she go?

111
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Can you take me to her?

112
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,240
I'm begging you.

113
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Bai Jiu Si,

114
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,240
you are so old and you still pretend to be a kid.

115
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,240
You are so shameless.

116
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Do you know where my wife is?

117
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240
Bai Jiu Si,

118
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
do you remember who I am?

119
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Yes.

120
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,240
How about you call me brother?

121
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
I will take you to your wife.

122
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Don't bully my Shenzhen.

123
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Shenzhen,

124
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,240
I will take you to my wife now.

125
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
My wife,

126
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
she is making a scene.

127
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240
She won't sleep.

128
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
I can't help it.

129
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
I brought her here.

130
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
My wife,

131
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
I will leave now.

132
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
You can call me if you have anything to do with Shenzhen.

133
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Is it fun?

134
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
It's fun to see your wife.

135
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
You are so stupid.

136
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Bai Jiu Si,

137
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
do you think you can get rid of

138
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
the past

139
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
if you pretend to forget everything?

140
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
I tell you,

141
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
it's impossible.

142
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,240
We are so short-tempered.

143
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
It's impossible to forget

144
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
and start over.

145
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
My wife,

146
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
am I doing something wrong?

147
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,240
If you are angry,

148
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
don't leave me again, okay?

149
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Bai Jiu Si,

150
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
what do you want to do?

151
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
I just want to be with you.

152
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
I just want to be with you.

153
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
I just want to be with you.

154
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
I just want to be with you.

155
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
I just want to be with you.

156
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,240
I just want to be with you.

157
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
I just want to be with you.

158
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
I just want to be with you.

159
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
I just want to be with you.

160
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
I just want to be with you.

161
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,240
I just want to be with you.

162
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
I just want to be with you.

163
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
I just want to be with you.

164
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,240
I just want to be with you.

165
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
I just want to be with you.

166
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
I just want to be with you.

167
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Master.

168
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Why are you here?

169
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,240
I heard that the Great Cheng Xuan Zun came to borrow a house.

170
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,240
He came to see you.

171
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,240
You're afraid that I'll hate him and kill him?

172
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Master is a famous disciple.

173
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Don't worry.

174
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,240
What I'm worried about is that you're upset.

175
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Have you ever been upset with someone?

176
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,240
I've been upset with someone once in my life.

177
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,240
Since I started to be upset with someone,

178
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,240
I've been into the cave with flowers.

179
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
I don't care.

180
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Until one day,

181
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
I'll be with you.

182
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
I'll be with you.

183
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
I'll be with you.

184
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
I'll be with you.

185
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
I'll be with you.

186
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
I'll be with you.

187
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
I'll be with you.

188
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
I'll be with you.

189
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
I'll be with you.

190
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
I'll be with you.

191
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
I'll be with you.

192
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
I'll be with you.

193
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
I'll be with you.

194
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,240
I'll be with you.

195
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
I'll be with you.

196
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,240
What's that?

197
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,240
I want to see it.

198
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,240
You're so timid.

199
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,240
I like someone,

200
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
but I don't dare to tell him.

201
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,240
I only dare to secretly

202
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
put a bunch of flowers

203
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
at his doorstep.

204
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,240
I picked up a flower

205
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,240
on the top of the jade.

206
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
Since then,

207
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,240
I've been wandering around.

208
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
I found a new flower

209
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
at his doorstep.

210
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,240
I only drink all day.

211
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
I want to drink a little,

212
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
but I'm afraid I can get bigger.

213
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Next time I see him,

214
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
I'll drink with him.

215
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
What a pity!

216
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
You're so talented.

217
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
I'm so good at drinking.

218
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
I can't help you

219
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,240
to get bigger.

220
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Did you open your eyes?

221
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
No.

222
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
I'm not sure.

223
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
There's something

224
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
I don't know.

225
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,240
I'm a servant.

226
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,240
I'm not good at doing things.

227
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Why bother to do things?

228
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,240
You know who sent you the flowers?

229
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
I know.

230
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
He asked me

231
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
what I like.

232
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Do you have any flowers?

233
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
I don't like flowers.

234
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,240
The sound of the waterfall is good.

235
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
I know.

236
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Sorry.

237
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,240
It's all my choice.

238
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
I came here today

239
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
to tell you

240
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
to act as you please.

241
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Don't leave any regrets.

242
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Master,

243
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
I have to go.

245
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
What's the matter?

247
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
What's the matter?

249
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Why did you come here?

250
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,240
I came to see you.

251
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
The water is still hot.

252
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
I didn't see you.

253
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,240
I'm so sorry.

254
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,240
Master, Immortal Feng is asking for an audience.

257
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Let them in.

258
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Xuan Sun was seriously injured.

259
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,240
I used my spirit energy to heal him.

260
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
His soul was broken.

261
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,240
I didn't do what I said.

262
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
He only remembers Immortal Feng.

263
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
But he is also a knight.

264
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,240
I think Immortal Feng is his obsession.

265
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Why are you here together?

266
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,240
I am not willing to be Immortal Feng's burden.

267
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,240
I have been studying the magic and the magic for the past few days.

268
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,240
I remember that the Great Huangbei is still in Immortal Feng's hands.

269
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,240
I heard about it a few days ago.

270
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,240
The Great Huangbei is the item that Immortal Feng gave to Immortal Feng.

271
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,240
I have checked it.

272
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
It is different from the normal magic.

273
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
It is not a single trick.

274
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,240
So I guess it must be the Great Huangbei for himself.

275
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
As long as it can repair the Great Huangbei,

276
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
it can be re-enact it.

277
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Maybe it can be found in the Zhu Sima Ji of Great Huangbei.

278
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
I remember you said that

279
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,240
many ways of using it can't be used to repair the Great Huangbei.

280
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
I can't use it.

281
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
But it can't be used.

282
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,240
All the skills that Immortal Feng has now are all from the Great Huangbei.

283
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,240
He has also entered the illusion of using the Great Huangbei to repair it.

284
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Based on my experience in the past,

285
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,240
now Immortal Feng is the real master of the Great Huangbei.

286
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Only he can be able to repair the Great Huangbei.

287
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
I can do it.

288
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Then come.

289
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
The scrolls that Immortal Feng gave to the map

290
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
are all on the way.

291
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Immortal Feng!

292
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Immortal Feng, look!

293
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
It's really repaired.

294
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,240
Ling'er, you said that after it was repaired,

295
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,240
it can still repeat the illusion that Great Huangbei had made.

296
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
You can still hold on?

297
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
It's nothing.

298
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,240
You just need to tell me how to do it.

299
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Just like before,

300
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,240
transfer the spiritual power to the Great Huangbei

301
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
and follow the spiritual power to the path.

302
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,240
Find the past you want to see and let it repeat.

303
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Immortal Feng,

304
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,240
I am now a spiritual master and cannot enter the Great Huangbei.

305
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,240
Even if I need to promote the formation, I cannot enter the illusion.

306
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,240
Are you ready to enter the Great Huangbei again?

307
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,240
The past is all behind Xiao Jingshan.

308
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,240
He is the head of our life.

309
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,240
This time, I will look at his life.

310
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
Let's start.

311
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
Miss.

312
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Miss, did you just want to leave me alone again?

313
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,240
No.

314
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,240
That's good.

315
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,240
Anyway, no matter where you go, I will follow you.

316
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
Where is this?

317
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Miss, I am back.

318
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
I am back.

319
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
Miss, where are you going?

320
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
How is Brother Hui's leg?

321
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,240
He may have lost his leg for three or four days.

322
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
I just saw him.

323
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
I don't need to send him off.

324
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
He is a good guy.

325
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Besides, he has only one family.

326
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
We should take more care of him.

327
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,240
Yes, you are right.

328
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
Let's eat.

329
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,240
Come, little bean.

330
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
Are you hungry?

331
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
Come.

332
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
Brother.

333
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Baby.

334
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
I am coming.

335
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Sit down.

336
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Little bean, please.

337
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,240
Miss, why do you keep looking at him?

338
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Look at me.

339
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Look at me.

340
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
Our little bean has grown up.

341
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
He will send a chopstick.

342
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
Okay.

343
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
Thank you.

344
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Which one?

345
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
Brother.

346
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,240
Mr. Gao, is Brother Hui's leg better?

347
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,240
Brother Hui's leg is better for three or four days.

348
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Come, let's eat.

349
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
Yang Zi.

350
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Come, come.

351
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Are you hungry?

352
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Come, eat more.

353
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
Come.

354
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
What are you eating?

355
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
Little bean, please.

356
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
I am talking to you.

357
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
Eat more meat.

358
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
That's weird.

359
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,240
They don't seem to see us.

360
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Is it good?

361
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Little bean.

362
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Look at me.

363
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Look at me.

364
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Dad, don't forget to promise me.

365
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
You will go to the lantern party with me tonight.

366
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
I will watch the fireworks and watch the fireworks.

367
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
You should come back early.

368
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
Okay, remember that.

369
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
Come.

370
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
Take care.

371
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
I am leaving.

372
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
Come back early.

373
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Bye, dad.

374
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Why is it different from what I thought?

375
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
I am leaving.

376
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
Yang Zi.

377
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
Why do you keep looking at her?

378
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
Why don't you talk to me?

379
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Why do you change so much?

380
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Yang Zi.

381
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Don't look at me.

382
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
Don't look at me.

383
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Look at me.

384
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Don't look at me.

385
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Good!

386
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Good!

387
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
One more!

388
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
He's coming out!

389
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Good!

390
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
Good!

391
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
One more!

392
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
Good!

393
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Three!

394
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Five!

395
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Good!

396
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,240
Good!

397
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,240
Good!

398
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Good!

399
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Good!

400
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
One more!

401
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Good!

402
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Good!

403
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
Good!

404
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Good!

405
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
Good!

406
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
Good!

407
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,240
Ma'am,

408
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
do you like this too?

409
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
I can change it too.

410
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Good!

411
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,240
I like it here.

412
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Good!

413
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,240
Let's go.

414
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
Good!

415
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
Good!

416
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,240
Good!

417
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,240
Good!

418
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Good!

419
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
Which one do you like?

420
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
This one!

421
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,240
You like this one?

422
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Good!

423
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Slow down!

424
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Slow down!

425
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
Careful!

426
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
It's safe.

427
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
Good!

428
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
Good!

429
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Let's take a look.

430
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,240
The flowers!

431
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
Ma'am.

432
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Look at you.

433
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
Xiao Jing Shan,

434
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
this illusion you created

435
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
is for what?

436
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
The flowers are so beautiful today.

437
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Do you like it?

438
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
I've been looking at it

439
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
while you were looking at the light.

440
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
So I changed it.

441
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
Do you like it?

442
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
I like it.

443
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Ma'am,

444
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
you're not going to say anything

445
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
to me.

446
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
Why don't you smile?

447
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Ma'am, you smiled.

448
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
My Ma'am, you smiled!

449
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
You smiled so beautifully.

450
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Smile one more time.

451
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
So beautiful!

452
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
Bai Jiu Si,

453
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
what should I do with you?

454
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
What's wrong?

455
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
What's wrong?

456
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,240
What's wrong?

457
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
What's wrong?

458
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
What's wrong?

459
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
What's wrong?

460
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
What's wrong?

461
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
What's wrong?

462
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
What did I miss?

463
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
Ma'am, I'm back.

464
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
You're back.

465
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
How is Brother Wei?

466
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
He might have lost his mind

467
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
after three or four days.

468
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
I just saw it.

469
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
I don't need to send you off.

470
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Here, I've given you a heart attack.

471
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Besides, there's only one doctor in his family.

472
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
We should take more care of him.

473
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
That's right.

474
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
Ma'am, take good care of him.

475
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
Have a meal.

476
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
Come on, Douzi, are you hungry?

477
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Why do they seem to say

478
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
the same thing?

479
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
Ma'am!

480
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
You're so generous.

481
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Ma'am, time to eat!

482
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
Here you are.

483
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Sit down, Douzi.

484
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Come on.

485
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,240
Sit down.

486
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
Our Douzi has grown up.

487
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
He's going to give us a discount.

488
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
You're not listening to me.

489
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Are you listening to me?

490
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
Of course.

491
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
Have a meal.

492
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
I'm not hungry.

493
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
Have more food.

494
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
Is this a hallucination?

495
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
It's just a repetition.

496
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Father, don't forget to promise me

497
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,240
that you'll go to the lantern festival with me tonight.

498
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
I also want to see the fireworks.

499
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,240
You have to come back early.

500
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Okay, don't forget.

501
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Come on.

502
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
Be careful.

503
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,240
I'm leaving.

504
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Come back early.

505
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
Father, goodbye.

506
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Goodbye.

507
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
It's time to go.

508
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Where are you going?

509
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Master, you're back so soon.

510
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
What did you find?

511
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
Only one day in that hallucination.

512
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
It's always repeating.

513
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,240
You mean

514
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
Xiao Jing Mountain created a one-day hallucination

515
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
with the Great Huang Cup?

516
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
And it's been the same day?

517
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
That's right.

518
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Is there anything special about that day?

519
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,240
I didn't find anything special.

520
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
It's just that Xiao Jing Mountain

521
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
and his family are together.

522
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
But I guess

523
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
maybe his heart is here.

524
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Xiao Jing Mountain has been spending a long time

525
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
understanding the relationship between the two.

526
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,240
He's the only one who can stand the advantage.

527
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Now he has no advantage.

528
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
I'm going to the Wenxuan Palace to find out.

529
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
I want to go too.

530
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
You need to rest now.

531
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
It's also Master's punishment to follow you.

532
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
I'm starting to believe

533
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
that Master Cheng Xuan's illness is true.

534
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
Otherwise, with his personality

535
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
how could he have put down his body

536
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
and killed Master?

537
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
This illness

538
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,240
is a chance for him to get a chance to get along with him.

539
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Chang San.

540
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
I'll remind you again.

541
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
Don't forget that they're husband and wife.

542
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,240
What's wrong with that?

543
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
I don't know if it's fate

544
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
or the past.

545
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
There are many things in the world.

546
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
There are good and evil.

547
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,240
There are行 and there are grass.

548
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,240
There are gods and there are demons.

549
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,240
The demons are born from the heart.

550
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
As long as there are many things,

551
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
the demons will never die.

552
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,240
When you think of this cup

553
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
you can see many things.

554
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,240
You can feel the evil from your heart.

555
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,240
You can't help but think about it.

556
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
Tan.

557
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Chen.

558
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
You're so stupid.

559
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,240
Who else is going to take revenge on you?

560
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
I don't have any revenge.

561
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
What are you doing?

562
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,240
I'll hit you first.

563
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Are you going to take revenge?

564
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
Shi.

565
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Son.

566
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
You can't go.

567
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
Don't blame me.

568
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,240
Son, go home.

569
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
You're a fool.

570
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
What?

571
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
What are you doing?

572
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Get up.

573
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Get up.

574
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
I said you're still here.

575
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,240
Brother.

576
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,240
My lady.

577
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
My lady, come and have a taste.

578
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,240
The cakes you bought are all your favorite.

579
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
I'm so sorry for that.

580
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
I'm sorry.

581
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
My lady.

582
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Come and have a taste.

583
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,240
I'm sorry.

584
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,240
You are too much.

585
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
I'm sorry.

586
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
I'm sorry.

587
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
I'm sorry.

589
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
I'm sorry.

590
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
I'm sorry.

591
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
I'm sorry.

592
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
I'm sorry.

593
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
Why is the knife so sharp?

594
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,240
I thought you were going to kill me.

595
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
I'm sorry.

596
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
I'm sorry.

597
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
I'm sorry.

598
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
Xuan Zun, Xuan Zun!

599
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Lady, you're also here to play with me!

600
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
Xuan Zun!

601
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
Haven't you found it yet?

602
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
I have!

603
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,240
The four of you are going to die in the same day.

604
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,240
Which day?

605
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,240
The day when the Qingxu Army killed the Thunder Bird.

606
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,240
The Qingxu Army again?

607
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
What happened in that battle?

608
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,240
600 years ago, the Qingxu Army led the Heavenly Army to the capital,

609
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,240
to pursue and destroy the Thunder Bird.

610
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,240
They were in the south without a village.

611
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
The battle was over.

612
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,240
The battle was over.

613
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,240
The Heavenly Fire was in the south without a village.

614
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
The battle was over.

615
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,240
12 immortals were killed.

616
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,240
Five of the mortal were killed by the Immortal.

617
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,240
They were buried in the fire.

618
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
You're a fool!

619
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
Where are you going to run away?

620
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,240
Brother Wei, your leg is not well. How did you come out?

621
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,240
Father!

622
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,240
Father, don't forget to promise me.

623
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,240
You'll go to the lantern festival with me tonight.

624
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,240
I also want to play lanterns and watch the fire.

625
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,240
You have to come back early.

626
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
Little Douzi! Little Douzi!

627
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
Mother!

628
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,240
Father! Mother!

629
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Little Douzi, wake up!

630
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
No.

631
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
I can't do it.

632
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,240
I can't do it.

633
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,240
When I first met Xiao Jingshan,

634
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,240
I heard that the practice was for the Heavenly Revenge.

635
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,240
But after the Nine Heavens,

636
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
I heard that the person was dead.

637
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
I heard that the person was dead.

638
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,240
I heard that the person was dead.

639
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
I heard that the person was dead.

640
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
That person was dead.

641
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,240
So you mean...

642
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,240
Bai Jiusi!

643
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Xiao Jingshan was about to destroy the Wuling Cup.

644
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,240
Did he want to remove the name on it?

645
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
It should be.

646
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,240
I heard that the Wuling Cup was all the sacred battle in the Demon Lord's War.

647
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,240
The Qingxu Army was also in it.

648
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,240
Just to destroy a name,

649
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,240
you want to make the whole Three Realms into a threat?

650
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,240
It's true that losing a family will make people lose their minds.

651
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,240
I also used to walk the wrong path in the middle of the road.

652
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,240
Xiao Jingshan lost all his family within a day.

653
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,240
I think that the Qingxu Army is his obsession.

654
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,240
The people who are in the Wuling Cup are not innocent.

655
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,240
We are all willing to follow.

656
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
Since you already know Xiao Jingshan's past,

657
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
then you only have to find him and stop him from doing so.

658
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
Yes.

659
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,240
Yes.

660
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
Xiao Jingshan.

661
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,240
The Wuling Cup is back to its original form.

662
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
Xiao Jingshan.

663
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,240
You must have made all these for yourself.

664
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
Who doesn't know how to be polite?

665
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
You are here at midnight.

666
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,240
I've heard that Yin Lianzong doesn't thank you for your manners.

667
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,240
Is it because of the rumors outside?

668
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
It's all wrong.

669
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,240
We can be polite to you,

670
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,240
but you can't be polite to us.

671
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,240
Yin Lianzong is getting more and more like me.

672
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
Who are you?

673
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
Who am I?

674
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
I am not important.

675
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,240
I came here today to discuss something with you.

676
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
What is it?

677
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,240
In the martial arts world, many sects are allowed to be righteous.

678
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,240
Yin Lianzong is called the evil sect.

679
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,240
Do you want to make those who can't see you

680
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,240
be your friends?

681
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
No.

682
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,240
It's not like that.

683
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,240
It's called the evil sect.

684
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,240
It's because we are not considered as a sect.

685
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,240
We are not a sect.

686
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
But it doesn't mean that we are evil.

687
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
It's not good to look at you.

688
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
Of course, we won't be your friends.

689
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
Fine.

690
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,240
I didn't come to discuss with you.

691
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,240
I will go to the temple.

692
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
I will go to the temple.

693
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,240
I will go to the temple.

694
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,240
I will go to the temple.

695
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
I will go to the temple.

696
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
I will go to the temple.

697
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,240
I will go to the temple.

698
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,240
I will go to the temple.

699
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
I will go to the temple.

700
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,240
I will go to the temple.

701
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,240
So ugly.

702
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
Don't come over.

703
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
I've said it many times.

704
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,240
Don't bully Xuan Zun.

705
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,240
Fine.

706
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
I know.

707
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
Help me to remove it.

708
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,240
It's too hard to tear it.

709
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,240
Who told you to listen to me?

710
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,240
The world is a city.

711
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
The reality is peaceful.

712
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
The city is important.

713
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
The four lands are broken.

714
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,240
The world is bad.

715
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
The night is a dream.

716
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,240
The world is a cry.

717
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,240
400 years ago, I killed Han Long.

718
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,240
I broke the diplomatic diplomatic order.

719
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
I didn't expect that I still can't escape today.

720
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
You are Ling Shou.

721
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,240
You are the leader of the world.

722
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
You know the face of the world.

723
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
You must know

724
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
the danger of this war.

725
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
Xie Jun, bad news.

726
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Something happened in the imperial court.

727
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,240
What's the matter?

728
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,240
What's wrong?

729
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
That little child is Ying Tong Zi.

730
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,240
What are you afraid of?

731
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
He said he would eat me.

732
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,240
Go play.

733
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
Grand master.

734
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,240
Go.

735
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,240
Why are you back?

736
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,240
Did you find the trace of Xiao Jing Shan?

737
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,240
I came here with other important news.

738
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,240
I searched the four places with Dan Yang and the disciples.

739
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,240
I found that there are many people who are missing.

740
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,240
I often find that the soul of the soul is gone.

741
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,240
The body is dead.

742
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,240
But recently, hundreds of people have been involved in the coma.

743
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,240
In the fifth day, they will die in their dreams.

744
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,240
Today is the third day.

745
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,240
The situation is urgent.

746
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,240
So I came here to ask for help from the master.

747
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,240
Is there any connection between the people who have been taken away by the soul?

748
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,240
Where did their soul go?

749
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,240
The soul of the missing people is not familiar.

750
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,240
Some of them are even separated.

751
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,240
I have already asked the disciples to arrange the people who are involved in the coma.

752
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,240
I have a big guess.

753
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,240
I'm afraid that Xiao Jing Shan is the leader.

754
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,240
The big yellow cup he used to practice can be used to take away the body.

755
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,240
Today, he must have practiced other magic weapons.

756
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,240
He can take away the soul of the missing people.

757
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,240
What does he want to do with such a big and strong soul of the missing people?

758
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,240
Ah Man. Ah Man.

759
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,240
Li Qing Yue.

760
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,240
You can't be rude to the missing people.

761
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,240
Do you still have any people in the Jinyun Sect?

762
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,240
Can you send some people to go back to the Jinyun Sect with me?

763
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,240
What's wrong with the Jinyun Sect?

764
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,240
My mother has sent a message to me.

765
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,240
She told me not to go back.

766
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,240
This is definitely not her personality.

767
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,240
We are definitely in trouble.

768
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,240
Li Qing Yue.

769
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,240
You can't be rude to each other.

770
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,240
When Jinyun Sect was born, I was also unreasonable.

771
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
Ah Man.

772
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,240
The situation is not clear now.

773
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,240
Don't be too anxious.

774
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,240
That's my mother.

775
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,240
How could I not be anxious?

776
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,240
들的.

777
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,240
We will try our best to help you back.

778
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,240
With due effort, we can't help them back.

779
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,240
Come in.

780
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,240
Our master, Li Qing Yue.

781
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,240
Don't bother with the Jiahan Sect.

782
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,240
Our master is back.

783
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,240
Just in time to pick up the pleasant feelings from the Young Lord.

784
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,240
Father, we will try our best to keep the blame.

785
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,240
It seems that it really is Xiao Jing Shan who is out of hand.

786
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,240
He has been planning for a long time.

787
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,240
He knows that he has no chance to win against him.

788
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,240
So he just wants to separate us.

789
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,240
I will watch Bai Jiu Si. He won't let anything happen.

790
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,240
You guys go back to the Canglei Hall.

791
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,240
Thank you, Immortal Lord.

792
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,240
Zi Yao, follow the Chuxing Man back to the Shadow Lotus Sect.

793
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,240
I will go to the Danyang to see how the mortal who has been captured by the Soul-Dragging Soul will be.

794
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,240
Yes, Immortal Lord.

795
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:30,240
Lady, you can't just act alone. I have to be with you.

796
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,240
I don't know if the curse of life and death is going to be removed.

797
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,240
If Xiao Jing Shan appears, don't hurt her life.

798
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,240
Let's not get hurt.

799
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,240
I will let Xuan Wei stay in the Shadow Lotus Sect.

800
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,240
If you can't handle it, then you must be crazy.

801
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,240
Let Xuan Wei go to the Garden of Hope.

802
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,240
If you don't stay, then we will separate.

803
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,240
I will go to the Garden of Hope.

804
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,240
I will go to the Garden of Hope.

805
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,240
