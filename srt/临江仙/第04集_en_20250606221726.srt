1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,720
deeply

2
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,720
I'm not sure if I can make it.

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,720
I'll try to make it.

4
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,720
I'll try to make it.

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,720
I'll try to make it.

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,720
I'll try to make it.

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,720
I'll try to make it.

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,720
I'll try to make it.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,720
I'll try to make it.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,720
I'll try to make it.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,720
I'll try to make it.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,720
I'll try to make it.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,720
I'll try to make it.

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,720
I'll try to make it.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,720
I'll try to make it.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,720
I'll try to make it.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,720
I'll try to make it.

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,720
I'll try to make it.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,720
I'll try to make it.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,720
I'll try to make it.

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,720
I'll try to make it.

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,720
I'll try to make it.

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,720
I'll try to make it.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,720
I'll try to make it.

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,720
I'll try to make it.

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
I'll try to make it.

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,720
I'll try to make it.

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,720
I'll try to make it.

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,720
I'll try to make it.

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,720
I'll try to make it.

31
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,720
I'll try to make it.

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,220
No need.

33
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,220
I'll try to make it.

34
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,220
I'll try to make it,

35
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,220
I'll try to make it.

36
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,220
If you make it myself,

37
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,320
It is time

38
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,980
Similarity

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:16,340
Sin

40
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,240
Dīn

41
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,980
I even gave her some good hair and makeup as compensation.

42
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,980
Her parents were all willing to accept it.

43
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,980
I don't know how Miss Liu could not think of it.

44
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,980
She ran away with the gift.

45
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,980
So you put your aunt back?

46
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,980
No.

47
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,980
I have never seen Miss Liu's family.

48
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,980
That night, she was standing in the wilderness.

49
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,980
I didn't see her.

50
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,980
Listen.

51
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,980
I'm not being selfish.

52
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,980
Or else, I'll give my aunt another compensation.

53
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,980
Master.

54
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,980
You're speaking the truth.

55
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,980
What a coincidence.

56
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,980
What?

57
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,980
Do you think you're mistaken about her?

58
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,980
Master, I'm really heartless.

59
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,980
Please investigate.

60
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,980
Are you heartless?

61
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,980
Xuan Zun.

62
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,980
Madam, Xuan Zun asked me to take you to Yuewu Courtyard to rest.

63
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,980
Yuewu Courtyard?

64
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,980
Of course, it's the yard of the Canglei Hall.

65
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,980
Xuan Zun said that you can live here from now on.

66
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,980
I'm not going back to Tianmu Palace anymore?

67
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,980
Yes. Xuan Zun said that you're in a dangerous situation.

68
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,980
It's dangerous to live alone.

69
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,980
So, you can live in Canglei Hall.

70
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,980
Where is Xuan Zun?

71
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,980
Xuan Zun is busy.

72
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,980
He asked me to come here.

73
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,980
Is he angry and doesn't want to see me?

74
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,980
Oh, right.

75
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,980
Today, Fan Jiaojiao was busy and hit Madam.

76
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,980
Later, I'll ask her to send her to the Hyacinth Drugstore.

77
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,980
Madam Ye Li can sleep better.

78
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,980
No need to bother. I'm fine.

79
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,980
But this man named Fan Jiaojiao is so stupid.

80
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,980
Even his bride can recognize him.

81
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,980
Xuan Zun must be angry.

82
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,980
I've lost my love for him.

83
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,980
It's not good. Fan Jiaojiao has to marry a bride every year.

84
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,980
Anyone else will get married.

85
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,980
He has to marry a bride every year?

86
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,980
Those bridegroomes are all he took away, right?

87
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,980
Madam, don't worry.

88
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,980
The Hyacinth Drugstore is under a lot of pressure.

89
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,980
But it's not a legal place.

90
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,980
You're willing to get married.

91
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,980
You won't have a long-term marriage.

92
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,980
Fan Jiaojiao is so charming.

93
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,980
She can make so many women marry her.

94
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,980
Fan Jiaojiao is one of the three great phoenixes.

95
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,980
He's the one who's in charge of the clinic.

96
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,980
He's in charge of the needle-picking.

97
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,980
He's been in a lot of trouble.

98
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,980
He's been in a lot of trouble.

99
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,980
He's been in a lot of trouble.

100
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,980
Fan Jiaojiao is a fairy.

101
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,980
He's made of white bones.

102
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,980
He's got a lot of blood and blood.

103
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,980
He's just come to needle-pick.

104
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,980
But he's been in a lot of trouble.

105
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,980
So...

106
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,980
So he has to marry her?

107
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,980
Yes.

108
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,980
He's been in a lot of trouble.

109
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,980
He's been in a lot of trouble.

110
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,980
He's been in a lot of trouble.

111
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,980
He's been in a lot of trouble.

112
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,980
He can make so many women marry him.

113
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,980
But the Hyacinth Drugstore has been in a lot of trouble.

114
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,980
This garden is called Tongyou Garden.

115
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,980
Tongyou is a famous place in the area.

116
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,980
It's the center of the Hyacinth Drugstore.

117
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,980
There are nine exits in the garden.

118
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,980
The connection is the old house and the old house.

119
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,980
The east side is the exit of the Hyacinth Drugstore.

120
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,980
The west side is the prison area of the Hyacinth Drugstore.

121
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,980
The north side is the pet shop of the Hyacinth Drugstore.

122
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,980
The left side is the place of the Three Great Kings.

123
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,980
Of course, you don't have to know about these things.

124
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,980
Then what should I know?

125
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,980
It's your place of the Hyacinth Drugstore and the Hyacinth Drugstore.

126
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,980
The direction we came from is the Lingyuan Pavilion.

127
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,980
It's a place where the Hyacinth Drugstore is held daily.

128
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,980
The place where you live is opposite to it.

129
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,980
It's ahead.

130
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,980
By the way, the Hyacinth Drugstore is a little bit remote.

131
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,980
It's very close to the Hyacinth Drugstore.

132
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,980
Don't run around at night.

133
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,980
You might encounter unexpected things.

134
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,980
Is it a monster?

135
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,980
It might be a female demon.

136
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,980
I've told you before that the Hyacinth Drugstore has three Great Kings.

137
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,980
I've only seen one of the Immortal Army.

138
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,980
Who else is it?

139
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,980
Is it also hidden in the shop?

140
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,980
The path is too short.

141
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,980
The story is too long.

142
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,980
The other two women will know if they see it.

143
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,980
Madam Qingyue, we're here.

144
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,980
You'll live in the Moonless Garden.

145
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,980
If you need anything, just ask me.

146
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
Thank you, Madam Cang.

147
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,980
What's wrong?

148
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,980
The river is dry.

149
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Why is there no cup with a drink?

150
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,980
Forget about the wrong tree.

151
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,980
Put on your little lily.

152
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,980
Who's that kid? Why is he in my room?

153
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,980
Do you know how to tell a story?

154
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
I don't know how to tell a story.

155
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,980
It's late.

156
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,980
Go home.

157
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,980
How about I tell you a story?

158
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,980
After that, you can leave.

159
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,980
You can leave.

160
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,980
There used to be a girl in the mortal world who didn't enter the sect.

161
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,980
There was a girl who didn't enter the sect.

162
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,980
But she was lucky.

163
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,980
She married a rich husband.

164
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,980
But she just entered the sect.

165
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,980
She was thrown by her husband on the hill.

166
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,980
She didn't ask him.

167
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,980
At last, this girl was in a deep sleep.

168
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,980
She finally met her husband.

169
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,980
But his husband is very cold.

170
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,980
Even if he was taken away by someone else,

171
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,980
he didn't care about her.

172
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,980
He didn't even want to see her.

173
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,980
You don't know how to tell a story.

174
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,980
Shut up.

175
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,980
That's not the case.

176
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,980
But she still loves her husband.

177
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,980
Then she was thrown by an old man.

178
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,980
She opened the door and found a little boy.

179
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,980
The little boy told her a story.

180
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,980
It's a story of a human head.

181
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,980
How many heads are in the house?

182
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,980
After that, the little boy ate her up.

183
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,980
One, two.

184
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,980
half and half

185
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:26,480
дом

186
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:35,480
Exam

187
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,980
to

188
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,980
No!

189
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,980
Madam, you are shocked.

190
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
Ning Ying.

191
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,980
Thank goodness you are here.

192
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,980
Don't be afraid, madam.

193
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
It's just a small demon.

194
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,980
Small demon?

195
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,980
That kid is a demon.

196
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,980
What demon is he?

197
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,980
He is called the Shadow Boy.

198
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,980
He is a demon who eats people's brains.

199
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,980
He was secretly thrown out of the store

200
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
by the Xuan Zongguan's hideout.

201
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,980
But he didn't eat his head yet.

202
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,980
He was caught again.

203
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,980
You can just hit him next time.

204
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,980
I can't hit him.

205
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,980
Then you can just listen to me.

206
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
So simple?

207
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,980
Didn't you say you were caught by the father and the son-in-law?

208
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,980
You can't be a mother-in-law?

209
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,980
How did you come to the hideout?

210
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,980
The Immortal Army brought me here.

211
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,980
He also said

212
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,980
you don't have to go back to the hideout anymore.

213
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,980
Just stay at the hideout.

214
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,980
I came to guard you.

215
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,980
It's late.

216
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,980
You should rest early.

217
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,980
Madam.

218
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,980
Madam.

219
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,980
Madam.

220
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
Is it pretty?

221
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,980
Why are you painting on your face?

222
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,980
This is a beauty.

223
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,980
It's not painting.

224
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,980
Then why is your mouth bleeding?

225
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,980
It's not bleeding.

226
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,980
It's my rabbit's mouth.

227
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,980
I have a pure body and blood.

228
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,980
I can't see anything.

229
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,980
I have a pure body and blood.

230
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,980
I have to make my mouth look more lively.

231
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,980
Do you want to try?

232
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
I don't need it.

233
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,980
Have you ever been on a diet?

234
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,980
No.

235
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,980
I have a free and advanced cultivation.

236
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,980
I have never been on a diet.

237
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,980
Then you must try it.

238
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,980
I promise you will fall in love with it.

239
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
You dress so beautifully.

240
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,980
I think you should go see it.

241
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,980
I think you should go see Xuan Zeng.

242
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
Yes.

243
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,980
Then you should be happy.

244
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,980
It's time now.

245
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,980
Xuan Zeng just finished his meeting.

246
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,980
If you go to eat again,

247
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,980
you won't be in time.

248
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,980
You are right.

249
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,980
Then I'll go first.

250
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,980
Time is so scary.

251
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,980
Come on, drink.

252
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,980
Li Qingyue.

253
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,980
Xuan Zeng's wife.

254
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,980
Is Xuan Zeng in there?

255
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,980
Yes.

256
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,980
That's good.

257
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,980
Please let me tell you.

258
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,980
Wait.

259
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,980
You are still young.

260
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,980
You are not steady enough.

261
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,980
I'll go.

262
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,980
You go.

263
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,980
You don't even look at your face.

264
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,980
You are 80 years old.

265
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,980
Don't scare Xuan Zeng.

266
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,980
What's wrong with me?

267
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
I haven't seen you for a long time.

268
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,980
I don't look down on you.

269
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,980
Do you know that?

270
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,980
How about that?

271
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,980
I am a genius.

272
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,980
I have been a gold medalist since I was eight.

273
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,980
I am not a young man.

274
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
I have a long face.

275
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,980
I am not a gold medalist since I was 80.

276
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,980
But I...

277
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,980
I have a strong and advanced cultivation.

278
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,980
Now my skill is more than three years.

279
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,980
Do you know that?

280
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,980
I will go.

281
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,980
Really?

282
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,980
Two old men.

283
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,980
Wait.

284
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,980
I warn you.

285
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,980
You should teach an old man again.

286
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,980
Old man.

287
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,980
Come on.

288
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,980
Xuan Zeng.

289
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,980
Those two guards are still fighting outside.

290
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,980
It's not good for them to see this.

291
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,980
Why don't we take them back

292
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,980
and keep the power of the hidden power?

293
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,980
No need.

294
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,980
They stay here for a day.

295
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,980
And she can't come in.

296
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,980
It's good that I can see

297
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,980
how much she wants to see me.

298
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,980
Well.

299
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,980
Don't fight.

300
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,980
I can't see Xuan Zeng.

301
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,980
You can't see Xuan Zeng.

302
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,980
I will find Xuan Zeng.

303
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,980
What are you looking at?

304
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,980
What's wrong with you?

305
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,980
Are you still unwell?

306
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,980
I am unwell.

307
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,980
I will kill you.

308
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,980
Old man.

309
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,980
What are you doing?

310
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,980
I am not unwell.

311
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,980
I am not unwell.

312
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,980
I will kill you.

313
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
Old man.

314
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,980
I will kill you.

315
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,980
Old man.

316
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,980
Old man.

317
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,980
Old man.

318
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,980
Son.

319
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,980
Son.

320
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,980
Madam.

321
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,980
You didn't see Xuan Zeng again?

322
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
Are you hungry?

323
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,980
Have some fruits.

324
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,980
I feel Xuan Zeng is angry with me.

325
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
No.

326
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,980
Xuan Zeng is angry with you.

327
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,980
I know.

328
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,980
It's normal for men to see their wives

329
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,980
and others in the hall.

330
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,980
They will not be angry with each other.

331
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,980
But now they don't even see me.

332
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,980
What should I do to make them angry?

333
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
Well...

334
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,980
I don't know how to be a man and a woman.

335
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,980
I can't make up my mind.

336
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,980
I am the first one to get angry.

337
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,980
I don't have any experience.

338
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,980
Go out.

339
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,980
I won't.

340
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,980
Will you tell me a story?

341
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,980
Then I will tell you a story.

342
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,980
There was a woman

343
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,980
who was rejected by her husband.

344
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,980
Ming Yan.

345
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
Ming Yan.

346
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,980
Ming Yan.

347
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,980
Ming Yan.

348
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,980
Ming Yan.

349
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,980
Ming Yan.

350
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,980
Ming Yan.

351
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,980
I hit my head.

352
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,980
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,980
I'm back.

354
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,980
I hit my head.

355
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,980
I'm sorry.

356
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,980
Mr. jerk.

357
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,980
Mr. jerk...

358
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,980
Wait a minute.

359
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,980
Boss is going to be screwed.

360
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,980
He is a cop.

361
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,980
That's right.

362
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,980
Actually,

363
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,980
the original designer is one of us.

364
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,420
And Mrs.羡,

365
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,200
is quite ar Businessa invitation?

366
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,700
They all have their own human characteristic,

367
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,320
they probably just love people.

368
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
What's this?

369
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,040
A child was locked in the yard.

370
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,160
He ate the fruits every day.

371
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,840
He ate the fruits every day.

372
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,640
Then the child told him his story.

373
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,840
There are several fruits on the table.

374
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,640
After that, the child told him to eat them all.

375
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:12,240
One, two, three, four, five, six.

376
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,320
What's wrong?

377
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
What do you want to hear?

378
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,320
Let me tell you.

379
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,320
The Li family has been training the Wei family's beautiful mother.

380
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,320
She is so beautiful and she is so good at it.

381
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,320
So she is sending her to the family.

382
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,320
The Wei family's mother is so good at it.

383
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
So...

384
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,320
What's wrong?

385
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
What's wrong?

386
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
What's wrong?

387
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Xuan Zun?

388
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Don't look at these dirty things.

389
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
Xuan Zun!

390
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
Xuan Zun!

391
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,320
Xuan Zun!

392
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,320
The painting of Madam is so useful.

393
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Xuan Zun came to see you personally.

394
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
That's not true.

395
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Xuan Zun just burned my painting because she was afraid of the evil school.

396
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
What should we do?

397
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,320
What should we do without the painting?

398
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
It's fine.

399
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,320
I have already remembered the painting's contents in my mind.

400
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,320
Next, I will continue to write it according to the painting.

401
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,320
I will write it according to the painting.

402
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Who let you break into the window?

403
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
I...

404
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
I...

405
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
I...

406
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
I...

407
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
I...

408
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
I...

409
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
I...

410
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
I...

411
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
I...

412
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
I...

413
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
I...

414
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,320
Who let you break into the window?

415
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,320
I...

416
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,320
I will ask for your help.

417
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,320
I thought you thought you couldn't hit me.

418
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
You came to scare me.

419
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,320
If Xuan Zun doesn't like it, I won't paint it again.

420
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Xuan Zun won't be angry, right?

421
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
I'm not angry.

422
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Xuan Zun doesn't need to be a heart-to-heart.

423
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Think about it.

424
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,320
If Xuan Zun and other women are in the painting,

425
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
I will also paint the painting.

426
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
This is the reason you came to me.

427
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Alright, Xuan Zun.

428
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
Don't be angry, okay?

429
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,320
Didn't I tell you to stop looking at these messy things?

430
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,320
The painting said that this is how you should be painted.

431
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
You...

432
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,320
Don't be angry.

433
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,320
I'm not angry.

434
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,320
The painting said that the most favorite thing to do is to use it.

435
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,320
You try to listen to those books again.

436
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Okay, okay, okay. I won't mention it.

437
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,320
Say it.

438
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,320
What else?

439
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,320
Actually, I want Xuan Zun to teach me how to paint.

440
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
I teach you?

441
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Why?

442
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Because I don't want to cause you any trouble.

443
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Xuan Zun is a matter of choice.

444
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
I don't want to be in danger every time I meet him.

445
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,320
I can only wait for Xuan Zun to save me.

446
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
I should be a heart-to-heart.

447
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
I can't just drag him away.

448
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Is there a reason for that?

449
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,320
I heard that Xuan Zun and I are in the same boat.

450
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
My technique is not good.

451
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
I'm afraid that I'll die of old age.

452
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
If I practice better,

453
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,320
maybe I can stay longer with Xuan Zun.

454
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Come here tomorrow. I'll teach you a technique.

455
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,320
Although Xuan Zun promised to teach me a technique,

456
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,320
I'm afraid that you still have the will to be with me and other people.

457
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
How about...

458
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
You kiss me.

459
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
I believe that you're not really angry.

460
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Look.

461
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
He's shy.

462
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,320
My life is in danger.

463
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,320
Let's break my lips.

464
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,320
I can't seem to give me time and time.

465
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,320
bisher

466
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,320
A crocodile is 추가ly learned to do it.

467
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,820
Yong Er.

468
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,820
I didn't expect you to be so low-key.

469
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,820
I'm going to find a way to get the letter.

470
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,820
Go!

471
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,820
Xuan Zun!

472
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,820
It's on fire!

473
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,820
Xuan Zun, look!

474
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,820
Xuan Zun!

475
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,820
Look!

476
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,820
It's gone.

477
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,820
It's gone.

478
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,820
It's on fire.

479
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,820
Xuan Zun, you're so good!

480
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,820
Xuan Zun!

481
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,820
Xuan Zun!

482
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,820
It's on fire.

483
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
Look!

484
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,820
It's gone!

485
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,820
I can't believe it!

486
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,820
I'm scared!

487
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,820
I'm scared!

488
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
Look at it!

489
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,820
It's gone!

490
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
Mr. Li!

491
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,820
Mr. Li!

492
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820
What's wrong?

493
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,820
Do you want to hear my story?

494
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,820
I don't want to.

495
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,820
No!

496
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,820
I can't hear it!

497
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,820
I can't hear it!

498
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,820
I've seen it clearly today.

499
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,820
The jade tree you've planted

500
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,820
is not the most common jade tree in the world.

501
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,820
I've taken its jade tree.

502
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,820
It's so new

503
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,820
that it's still so beautiful.

504
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,820
It's so beautiful.

505
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
It's gone!

506
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,820
It's gone!

507
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,820
Madam, have some fruits.

508
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,820
No.

509
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,820
I've only eaten fruits for a month.

510
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,820
Don't you feel disgusting?

511
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,820
No.

512
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,820
I've eaten this for hundreds of years.

513
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,820
Look,

514
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,820
she loves it too.

515
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,820
So how many fruits are there on the table?

516
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
I don't know.

517
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,820
I don't know.

518
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,820
I don't know.

519
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,820
How many fruits are there on the table?

520
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,820
There's no place

521
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,820
where you can cook.

522
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,820
There's no one to eat or cook in the storage.

523
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,820
How could there be a kitchen?

524
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,820
Shen Xian is not a common person.

525
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,820
Madam,

526
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,820
you know how good Xuan is.

527
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,820
If you ask for a kitchen,

528
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,820
he will definitely agree.

529
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,820
Really?

530
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,820
Definitely.

531
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,820
No.

532
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,820
Why?

533
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,820
There's no reason.

534
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,820
If I can win the game,

535
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,820
can you give me a kitchen?

536
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,820
You?

537
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,820
Save me?

538
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,820
Okay.

539
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,820
Xia Zhizhi.

540
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,820
Didn't you see

541
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,820
my wife is on the table?

542
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,820
Yes.

543
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,820
I'll change the place.

544
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
Is this okay?

545
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,820
What do you think?

546
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,820
I don't think so.

547
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,820
I'll think about it.

548
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,820
I don't think so.

549
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,820
I'll think about it.

550
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,820
Will you win the game?

551
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,820
I will.

552
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,820
I've never lost

553
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,820
the game between

554
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,820
Mr. Jin and Brother Zhang.

555
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,820
Why did you say that?

556
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,820
You're not a mortal.

557
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,820
No.

558
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,820
Of course, Mr. Xuan is the best.

559
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,820
Mr. Xuan.

560
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,820
In our world,

561
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,820
we can't eat or make anything.

562
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,820
I think

563
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,820
I'm so stupid.

564
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,820
It must be because I lack

565
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,820
a source of nutrition.

566
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,820
If there are some

567
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,820
sand, river, fish,

568
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,820
and grilled fish,

569
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,820
maybe there's some progress.

570
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,820
Then you eat.

571
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,820
Sand and river,

572
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,820
easy to find.

573
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,820
It's fish, river, fish,

574
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,820
and sand, river, fish,

575
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,820
even if there's food,

576
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,820
we have to deal with it

577
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,820
to make it.

578
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,820
You're right.

579
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,820
If I can

580
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,820
build a kitchen in this small yard

581
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,820
and have some food

582
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,820
in the sky,

583
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,820
then I can eat

584
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,820
and cook.

585
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,820
Then I can

586
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,820
give Mr. Xuan some food.

587
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,820
Whatever.

588
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,820
Mr. Xuan agreed.

589
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,820
You lost.

590
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,820
I lost.

591
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,820
What about my kitchen?

592
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,820
Mr. Xuan.

593
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,820
Miss Lin'er is back.

594
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,820
That's all for today.

595
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,820
You can go back.

596
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,820
What?

597
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,820
I have to see her myself.

598
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,820
I have to go.

599
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,820
It's better to

600
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,820
make up for all the traces of the bamboo sword.

601
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,820
I'll put the bamboo sword

602
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,820
in the Yang Sha.

603
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,820
It's only needed to be re-bred

604
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,820
for 81 days.

605
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,820
Then it can be restored.

606
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,820
It's a good thing.

607
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,820
Well done.

608
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,820
Miss Lin'er

609
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,820
you've been acting

610
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,820
so well.

611
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,820
You're a good girl.

612
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,820
Of course

613
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,820
it's my daughter.

614
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
I can't be wrong.

615
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,820
Miss Lin'er

616
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,820
you've been

617
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,820
so hard on me.

618
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,820
Mr. Xuan was

619
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,820
so angry

620
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,820
that he couldn't take care of you.

621
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,820
It's not easy

622
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,820
to come back

623
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,820
this time.

624
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,820
Then what should I do

625
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,820
to make up for it?

626
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,820
Then stay in the Canglei Palace

627
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,820
and have some rest.

628
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,820
You don't have to go out.

629
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,820
Thank you, Mr. Xuan.

630
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,820
Thank you, Mr. Xuan.

631
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,820
Mr. Xuan

632
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,820
are you there?

633
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,820
Madam is here.

634
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,820
You...

635
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,820
Introduce yourself.

636
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,820
This is

637
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,820
the new wife of Mr. Xuan

638
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,820
from Li Xingyue from Ji Yun Sect.

639
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,820
This is Fan Jiaojiao,

640
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,820
Fan Xianjun.

641
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,820
One of the three great kings.

642
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,820
You should be familiar with him.

643
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,820
This is his daughter.

644
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,820
You can call her Lin'er.

645
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,820
She has been with Mr. Xuan

646
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,820
for almost 200 years.

647
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,820
I see.

648
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,820
I'm worried that Mr. Xuan

649
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,820
will be thirsty

650
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,820
and specially prepared tea.

651
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,820
If you have something to discuss,

652
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,820
I won't go in.

653
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,820
I'll ask the manager

654
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,820
to send me in.

655
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,820
Let him in.

656
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,820
I'm sorry.

657
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,820
I'm sorry.

658
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,820
I'm sorry.

659
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,820
It's okay.

660
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
Come on.

661
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,820
Didn't you find me?

662
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,820
Why didn't you talk to me?

663
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,820
I came to give Mr. Xuan

664
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,820
some tea.

665
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,820
Enjoy your tea.

666
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,820
This is the tea house

667
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,820
of Lin Yuan Pavilion, right?

668
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,820
Yes.

669
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,820
Why is it cold?

670
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,820
Yes.

671
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,820
It's cold tea.

672
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,820
You came here

673
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,820
to see me.

674
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,820
What are you doing here?

675
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,820
I just want to see

676
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,820
what kind of girl

677
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,820
Mr. Xuan will welcome.

678
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,820
I didn't welcome her.

679
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,820
She came back

680
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,820
just to report to me.

681
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,820
This is a little matter.

682
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,820
Mr. Xuan doesn't need to see me.

683
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,820
I didn't explain.

684
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,820
I know.

685
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
Now, Mr. Xuan is a little awkward.

686
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,820
I'll go and get you some tea.

687
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,820
This is the surprise

688
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,820
you prepared for me.

689
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,820
Don't worry.

690
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,820
I have more.

691
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,820
Come here.

692
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,820
Come here.

693
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,820
Come here.

694
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,820
Come here.

695
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,820
Lin,

696
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,820
you are a girl.

697
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,820
You are always

698
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,820
fighting with your sword.

699
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,820
You are so bad.

700
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,820
You have to learn to be gentle and virtuous.

701
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,820
Look.

702
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,820
Wait a minute.

703
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,820
I have to go to the doctor.

704
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,820
I'll get my hair done.

705
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,820
I'll get some more hair.

706
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,820
Your father is a rich man.

707
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,820
He can't spend much time

708
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,820
in his daily life.

709
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,820
You should help me.

710
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,820
If father really has money,

711
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,820
why don't you buy more clothes

712
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,820
and give it to Mr. Xuan?

713
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,820
It's better to let him

714
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,820
talk to you

715
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,820
in front of Mr. Xuan.

716
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,820
You know that.

717
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,820
Why don't you tell me

718
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,820
what Mr. Xuan is up to?

719
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,820
I only knew

720
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,820
what Mr. Xuan is up to

721
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,820
after I married him.

722
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,820
Besides,

723
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,820
the jade hair is so famous

724
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,820
that it's so beautiful.

725
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,820
I forgot

726
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,820
when I was busy.

727
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,820
I forgot.

728
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,820
You really forgot?

729
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,820
Or you just kept it from me?

730
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,820
This is a deal.

731
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,820
Even if you know what to do,

732
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,820
Ling'er.

733
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,820
Ling'er.

734
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,820
I was in the hall today.

735
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,820
But I knew

736
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,820
why I should marry

737
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,820
that girl.

738
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,820
It's her ability

739
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,820
to be so filial.

740
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,820
I'm so sorry.

741
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,820
Go.

742
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,820
Kill him.

743
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,820
I'm sorry.

744
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,820
I'm so sorry.

745
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,820
I'm sorry.

746
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,820
I'm sorry.

747
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,820
I'm sorry.

748
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,820
I'm sorry.
