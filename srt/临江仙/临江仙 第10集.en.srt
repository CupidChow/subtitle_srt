[Episode 10]

3
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,070
Yue.

4
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,070
It's you.

5
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,570
Heavenly Lord.

6
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,610
Are you alright?

7
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,620
Long Yuan.

8
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,370
Wait!

9
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,720
What are you going to do now?

10
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,360
Your spiritual energy…

11
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,710
I've been sealed for centuries.

12
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,590
You think it's easy
to fight against you guys?

13
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,530
You're throwing your life away.

14
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,360
If it means sparing me from
the monthly torment of the evil energy,

15
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,030
I'd risk everything.

16
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,150
Li Mo, aren't you going to act?

17
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,180
If you hadn't been soft-hearted
and refused to kill her back then,

18
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,040
we wouldn't be in this mess now.

19
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,540
No need to do anything.

20
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Her spiritual energy is exhausted.

21
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,710
She's no threat anymore.

22
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,140
I've heard too many men say they love me.

23
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,390
But it turned out…

24
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,040
they all lied.

25
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,430
Living is just suffering for me.

26
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,720
The only thing I've ever truly wanted

27
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,780
was to see you again

28
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,680
and hear you say

29
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,310
you love me.

30
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,120
I've done the first.

31
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,050
As for the second…

32
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,580
it doesn't matter anymore.

33
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,900
Kill me.

34
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,750
I'm done living with
the torment of the evil energy!

35
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,900
She's your destined tribulation.

36
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,510
No matter what you do,
you can't escape it.

37
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,920
You say you study healing arts,

38
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,900
that you were born to help others,

39
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,480
but you couldn't even save me.

40
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,470
How can you save anyone else?

41
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,270
There are countless forms
of love in this world,

42
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,750
not just romantic love.

43
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,480
So,

44
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,170
this is truly my tribulation.

45
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,720
I told you, I'll free you

46
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,430
from the evil energy.

47
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,310
How did you do that?

48
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,120
I love you.

49
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,720
But not the way lovers do.

50
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,450
Mine is the kind of love
that seeks to save all beings.

51
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
Think carefully.

52
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,040
Not all the men you met

53
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,030
were pretending to care.

54
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,530
So… you're saying yes?

55
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,670
They truly cared for you.

56
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:10,830
Wonderful!

57
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,490
The one who pretended to care…

58
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,680
Honglian.

59
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,360
Was you.

60
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,800
I've come back to marry you.

61
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,000
You only wanted
to dispel the evil energy.

62
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,730
You never truly cared for them.

63
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,050
That's why their heart blood

64
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,680
couldn't dispel your evil energy.

65
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,770
The root of it lies in you,

66
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,630
not in them.

67
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,010
So,

68
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,810
it's not about being loved.

69
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,270
It's about learning to love.

70
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,530
Exactly.

71
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,740
As long as you have love in your heart,

72
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,360
no evil spirits or energy can touch you.

73
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,120
Actually, I should thank you.

74
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,770
You helped me understand my tribulation.

75
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,000
In the past, I only cared about
saving the world and helping others,

76
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,600
but I never truly understood

77
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,610
what it meant to help someone.

78
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,140
It means to feel their pain

79
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,200
so you can ease their suffering.

80
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,270
I see.

81
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,190
I see.

82
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,080
Now

83
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,300
I finally understand
what you meant by "sin."

84
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,150
I've heard
there's a Jade Pool in Empyrean.

85
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,630
Please, take me there

86
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,070
so I may begin cultivation anew.

87
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,510
I won't need long to regain my form.

88
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,260
This time, I won't go astray again.

89
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,670
Alright, I promise you.

90
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,640
Are you really okay?

91
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,360
Have you forgotten what I practice?

92
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,290
These minor injuries are nothing.

93
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,840
Good. Then let's get down to business.

94
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:04,150
Mountains in clouds; white clouds rise.

95
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:10,240
In the tranquil mountains, the Way
guides those destined to follow it.

96
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,960
Mountains in clouds; white clouds rise.

97
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:22,150
In the tranquil mountains, the Way
guides those destined to follow it.

98
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,080
Young man, are you getting on the boat?

99
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,510
Yes.

100
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,720
May I ask how much you charge?

101
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,720
I ferry people for pleasure alone.

102
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,670
I don't want
spiritual pills or magical tools.

103
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,600
I only ferry those destined to meet me.

104
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,740
In that case, I'll trouble you.

105
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,690
Come, get on the boat.

106
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,870
Hold on tight.

107
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,440
Mountains in clouds; white clouds rise.

108
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Young man.

109
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,020
I sense the yin and yang
in your body are in conflict.

110
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,770
Did you use the demon clan's
sacred object, the Sky-Reaching Ladder?

111
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:21,910
I did.

112
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,870
Do you understand
how dangerous that thing is?

113
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,240
I do.

114
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,030
And yet you dared
to come to the Nine Heavens

115
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,920
as a mortal?

116
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,150
From what I can see, you don't seem like
the type to do whatever it takes

117
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,770
just to become immortal.

118
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,480
So, what is it you seek

119
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,410
in the Nine Heavens?

120
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,210
I'm looking for someone I knew.

121
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,570
The Nine Heavens are vast and boundless.

122
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,790
There are countless
immortals and cultivators here.

123
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,990
Do you know where the person
you're looking for resides?

124
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,850
Canglei Palace, Danxia Land.

125
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,960
Canglei Palace?

126
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,550
Yes.

127
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,600
That place
belongs to Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

128
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,730
You've heard of it?

129
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,440
Who hasn't heard of Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

130
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,960
Come on, sit down.

131
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,790
Heavenly Lord Dacheng has powerful magic.

132
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,290
In the Nine Heavens,

133
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,440
he's one of the most powerful immortals.

134
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,200
If he was really that powerful,

135
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,460
he'd have ascended to Empyrean long ago.

136
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,240
Why is he still here?

137
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,870
Sounds like

138
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,320
you've got a bone to pick
with Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

139
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
You're not here in the Danxia Land

140
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,030
to cause him trouble, are you?

141
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,170
If I say I am,

142
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,490
will you believe me?

143
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,110
Fate and karma

144
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,390
are beyond my comprehension.

145
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,950
Hold on tight.

146
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,600
Mountains in clouds; white clouds rise.

147
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,270
In the tranquil mountains, the Way
guides those destined to follow it.

148
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,850
Immortal Lord Li Mo.

149
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,950
Is this Immortal Lord Long Yuan?

150
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,850
What are you doing?

151
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,570
Heavenly Lord, Immortal Lord Li Mo.

152
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,800
Say something.

153
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,300
Long time no see,

154
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,630
Siling.

155
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,630
How dare you show yourself
around Master again?

156
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,120
You...

157
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,080
You've got the wrong person.

158
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,150
I'm Li Qingyue,

159
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,250
not Siling.

160
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,270
I saw you use the Blazing Fire just now.

161
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,080
That was the magic once used

162
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,540
by Divine Lord Siling.

163
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,890
I... I don't know why.

164
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,030
It… it just happened
in the heat of the moment…

165
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,320
Siling and Master are of the same origin.

166
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,350
When one falls, the other rises.

167
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,870
Master is severely injured,

168
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,720
and you've gained new power.

169
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,350
Can you explain that?

170
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,790
We were pulled into the Vortex of Stars

171
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,670
and ended up in the Land of Ruins.

172
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,680
From here on, you have to travel alone.

173
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,720
I ended up here by chance.
If any immortal resides here,

174
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,380
could you give me directions?

175
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,610
Is anyone here?

176
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,790
You work for the Heavenly Lord?

177
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,650
Heavenly Lord?

178
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,190
You mean Heavenly Lord Dacheng, Bai Jiusi?

179
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,050
So you're not with him.

180
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,580
Who are you?

181
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,730
Give it back!

182
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,070
This is yours?

183
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,280
Give it to me!

184
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,870
Who exactly are you?

185
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,310
Jingyun Sect's

186
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,100
Zhang Suan.

187
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,070
Zhang Suan?

188
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,800
You're Li Qingyue's senior?

189
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,750
Oh no.

190
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,650
Why are you following me?

191
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,670
You still have my pendant.

192
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,580
Give it back.

193
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,990
Where did you get that?

194
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,570
A family heirloom?

195
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,380
You seem very interested in it.

196
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,150
You mentioned Qingyue just now.

197
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,080
You know her?

198
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,730
Where is she?

199
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,130
Why are you looking for her?

200
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,530
She's in danger.

201
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,160
Master, your old injury
has affected your heart meridian.

202
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,420
Now with your spiritual energy drained,

203
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,760
a full recovery will be very difficult.

204
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,030
I've searched through
ancient texts and found a possible method

205
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,970
that might help.

206
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,590
But the required ingredients
are extremely rare.

207
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,590
What do you need?

208
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,670
Use snake slough as the base,

209
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,510
and combine it with aconite, monkshood,
cinnamon twig, and asarum.

210
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,800
Refine it with
the Chaos Fire for 49 days and nights.

211
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,350
Most of those ingredients
can be found in Danxia Land.

212
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,000
There's still a wisp
of the Chaos Fire left in Empyrean.

213
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,830
Immortal Lord Long Yuan
can go and borrow it.

214
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,430
That shouldn't be a problem.

215
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,110
The Chaos Fire is easy to obtain.

216
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,790
But getting the snake slough
is the real challenge.

217
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,510
Ordinary snake slough

218
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,910
won't do anything for Master's condition.

219
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,770
It must be from a flying snake.

220
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,970
And it should be the skin

221
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,330
it sheds at the moment of transformation.

222
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,630
Flying snake?

223
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,270
Humans have primordial spirits;
beasts have golden cores.

224
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,800
But a flying snake
is neither human nor beast.

225
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,240
With a primordial spirit in its head,

226
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,080
it's a born divine being.

227
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,750
As the primordial spirit
in its head grows stronger,

228
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,790
when the time is right,
heavenly lightning will strike,

229
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,110
shattering its shell
and freeing it from the physical body.

230
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,920
At that moment,

231
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,920
its primordial spirit
will be released from its head.

232
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,160
The snake will shed its skin and gain
wings, becoming a true flying snake.

233
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,750
And what if it hasn't transformed yet?

234
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,070
A flying snake that hasn't transformed

235
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,470
looks no different from an ordinary snake.

236
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,960
Its slough is also no different.

237
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,440
Why didn't you mention any of this before?

238
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,830
Because you'd never
been injured to the extent of…

239
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,750
From what I've found,

240
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,780
Siling's old mount, the White Snake,

241
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,680
has indeed perished.

242
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,800
And its primordial spirit?

243
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,420
That remains unknown.

244
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
How is she now?

245
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,000
Her Ladyship…

246
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,590
Li Qingyue

247
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:38,520
was taken by Immortal Lord Long Yuan
to the dungeon in the mountain.

248
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,310
While you were severely injured,

249
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,440
he temporarily took over everything.

250
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,050
You're still injured!

251
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,970
Pass through this formation,

252
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,560
and you can leave the Ruins.

253
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,210
Alright.

254
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,610
You're not coming?

255
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,530
Since you know the way out,

256
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,840
why are you still trapped here?

257
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,550
I have my reasons for staying.

258
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,090
You just need to focus on your own path.

259
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,810
Don't ask about anything else.

260
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,510
Sorry.

261
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,070
Wait.

262
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,090
Head east.

263
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,960
Ride the wind for 1,000 miles,

264
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,560
and you'll reach the place
you're looking for.

265
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,870
Thank you.

266
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,040
You're welcome.

267
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,920
Zhang Suan?

268
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,050
[Xiao Jingshan]

269
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,270
So this is my fate.

270
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,300
So be it.

271
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,200
So be it.

272
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,450
I've hated birds my whole life.

273
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,750
Guess luck

274
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,690
just wasn't on your side today.

275
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,340
Who's there? Tell me your name.

276
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,170
As a human cultivator,

277
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
you dared to come to the Nine Heavens

278
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,100
but don't have the guts to meet me?

279
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,160
Boy.

280
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,750
Got any wine?

281
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,200
Brat, you actually tried
to fool me with water.

282
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,370
Don't leave yet.

283
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,920
Throw that dead bird somewhere far away.

284
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,310
You killed it?

285
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,030
So what if I did?

286
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,000
You killed it

287
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,720
but don't have the guts
to dispose of its body?

288
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,380
Just do as I say.

289
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,970
Spare me the lectures!

290
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,600
You… are hurt?

291
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,830
Nonsense.

292
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,150
Who could possibly hurt me?

293
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,770
You're severely injured.

294
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,240
I'm not injured.

295
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,790
Your spiritual platform is shattered,
and your power is fading.

296
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,270
You call that "not injured"?

297
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,800
You ask too many questions.

298
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,830
Get lost.

299
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,670
Someone just told me

300
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,790
if I ride the wind eastward
for 1,000 miles,

301
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,320
I'll reach Canglei Palace.

302
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,830
But I've flown for ages and seen nothing.

303
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,460
You've been
in the Nine Heavens for so long.

304
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,030
Do you know where Canglei Palace is?

305
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,310
That's Bai Jiusi's residence.

306
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,360
Why are you going there?

307
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,890
To find someone.

308
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,200
You mean Bai Jiusi?

309
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,440
I know a thing or two
about Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

310
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,070
He's an arrogant man—

311
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,830
temperamental

312
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,750
and ruthless.

313
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,440
You're just a lowly human cultivator.

314
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,790
Aren't you afraid
he'll kill you with a single strike?

315
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,220
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

316
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,030
Three, two, one.

317
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,240
Drop.

318
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,750
Brat.

319
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,270
You want to get out of here?

320
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,510
I can help you.

321
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,830
But you must promise me one thing.

322
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,620
Are you here to save me?

323
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,150
Do you also believe
I'm Divine Lord Siling?

324
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,060
When did you and Honglian
start plotting together?

325
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,680
In the illusion?

326
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,370
At Lanyue House?

327
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,440
Or had it all been arranged

328
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,170
when you were in the Hell Ruins?

329
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,350
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

330
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,950
I've played along with you
for long enough.

331
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,310
When are you going to stop pretending?

332
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,240
I'm not pretending.

333
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,500
Your power and mine shift in opposition.

334
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,350
I lost my fire magic
after the battle with Honglian.

335
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,410
But you became better
at controlling the Blazing Fire.

336
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,860
Clearly, you had joined forces with her.

337
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,570
You lured Li Mo out for her,

338
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,560
and she helped you wound me badly

339
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,360
so you could reclaim your power.

340
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,790
You say you're not Divine Lord Siling.

341
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,880
Then tell me—

342
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,360
where did you learn
to control fire like that?

343
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,420
Speak!

344
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,100
So when you called Yue,

345
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,720
you were never calling me.

346
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,550
I don't know how

347
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,110
I suddenly learned
the Fire-Parting Technique.

348
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,850
All I know is,
when I saw you frozen in ice,

349
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,220
there was only one thought in my mind—

350
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,980
to save you, no matter the cost.

351
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,560
I just didn't expect…

352
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,320
I didn't expect that in the end,

353
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,820
it would become my crime.

354
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,860
Heavenly Lord,

355
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,400
I wanted to save you.

356
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,890
Was that wrong?

357
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,590
So you've made up your mind

358
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,270
not to tell me the truth, huh?

359
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,090
If you've already
judged me guilty in your heart,

360
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,210
why bother questioning me at all?

361
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,260
For both of us,

362
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,470
it's just a waste of time.

363
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,270
A waste of time?

364
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,030
Indeed.

365
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,440
Tolerating you for so long

366
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,170
has indeed been a waste of time.

367
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,450
Yue, your magic and mine
counterbalance each other.

368
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,310
When one wanes, the other grows.

369
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,960
If one of us is badly wounded,

370
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,550
the other's magic surges.

371
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,890
I'll ask you one last time.

372
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,840
What exactly are you planning?

373
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,620
Confess,

374
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,920
and I'll stop.

375
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,750
Before I answer,

376
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,000
can you answer something for me first?

377
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,790
Go ahead.

378
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,720
All the kindness you showed me before—

379
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,240
was it because of me

380
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,800
or because of Yue?

381
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,200
Listen carefully.

382
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,240
My name is Li Qingyue.

383
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,800
I used to live
at the foot of Yufan Mountain.

384
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,100
My father's surname is Li,
and my mother's is Jiang.

385
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,270
I joined the Jingyun Sect
at the age of eight

386
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,130
and guarded the gate for 11 years.

387
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,720
At 19, I married into Canglei Palace

388
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,880
and became the wife
of Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

389
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,680
I have my own friends in the sect.

390
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,920
I have my own joys and sorrows.

391
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,570
I have my own life!

392
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,630
I am Li Qingyue.

393
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,240
Always,

394
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,350
just Li Qingyue.

395
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,480
You're still lying.

396
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,720
Must I verify it myself?

397
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,120
How dare I trouble
the Heavenly Lord to verify it personally?

398
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,610
You just want me to get hurt, right?

399
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,430
I'll do it myself.

Master.

415
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,800
Li Mo said you're badly injured.

416
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,880
This place is cold and damp.

417
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,660
You really didn't need to come in person.

418
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,660
Let me handle such trivial matters.

419
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,400
My Lord, has Her Ladyship
done anything wrong?

420
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,840
She's just recovered from a serious
illness. Her foundation is not yet stable.

421
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,960
The dungeon is cold and damp. Please…

422
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,400
Master, what's wrong?

423
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,190
Send her back to Yuewu House.

424
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,060
Thank you, My Lord.

425
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,940
-Let go of me!
-Don't move.

426
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,530
What are you doing?

427
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,760
Boy, fortune has smiled upon you.

428
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,840
From this moment on,

429
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,170
every word I say—

430
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,890
you must remember it by heart.

431
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,540
My name is Xiao Jingshan.

432
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,670
I'm from Nanwu in Ning.

433
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,150
My parents and brothers
were all ordinary folk.

434
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:10,030
At the age of 21,
I got married and had a son.

435
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,510
Unfortunately, I fell victim
to some scumbags.

436
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,510
My family was destroyed overnight.

437
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,960
So I started cultivation,

438
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,440
expecting to avenge their deaths one day.

439
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,230
But my fellow disciples were arrogant,

440
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,960
kept making things hard for me.

441
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,690
By my fourth year,
they expelled me from the sect.

442
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,500
From then on, I trained alone.

443
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,360
I drew power from nature
and learned wisdom from life.

444
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,590
I gave up on the Way to find the Way
and saw truth through illusions.

445
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,520
Abandoning the righteous path,
I gained true power.

446
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,280
Why are you telling me all this?

447
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,480
You are to become my disciple.

448
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,440
Of course I must tell you my story.

449
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,840
Who said I want to be your disciple?

450
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,400
I…

451
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,150
Too noisy.

452
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,320
Life is like a dream,

453
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,360
a dream hard to wake from.

454
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,820
I'm nearing the end of my life.

455
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,960
Yet a disciple showed up out of nowhere.

456
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,130
It seems the heavens haven't forsaken me.

457
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,510
Time is short.

458
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,320
Let's hurry up.

459
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,670
First, kowtow to me.

460
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:51,980
Good, good.

461
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,920
Enough.

462
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,510
I'm at death's door.

463
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,000
These past few days, I've mastered
an extremely profound sword technique.

464
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,230
I've decided to pass it on to you.

465
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,960
Once your power has greatly increased,

466
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,360
you can leave Taiyi Peak.

467
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,480
Boy, I'll only demonstrate this once.

468
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,490
Watch carefully.

469
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,230
Qi gathers in the upper dantian;

470
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,190
spirit spring flows to qihai;

471
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,740
purple flame settles at shenque;

472
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,610
the sword bridges yin and yang.

473
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,870
Boy, did you see it clearly?

474
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,230
This sword technique is exquisite.

475
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
What's it called?

476
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,360
I haven't decided yet.

477
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,670
Do you have any enemies?

478
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,240
There is one person.

479
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,280
I suppose you could call him that.

480
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,880
Who?

481
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,630
Heavenly Lord Dacheng, Bai Jiusi.

482
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,480
Good!

483
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,020
Then let's call it
the Immortal-Slaying Sword Technique.

484
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,630
Stop yelling, brat!

485
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,010
I'm passing my life's cultivation to you.

486
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,870
You've hit the jackpot!

487
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,420
My Lord, I need to tell you something.

488
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,800
Even though you've permitted it,

489
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,460
Immortal Lord Long Yuan
refuses to release her.

490
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,590
As of now, Her Ladyship

491
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,450
is still locked up in the dungeon.

492
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,230
Go and release her.

493
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,760
Yes.

494
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,410
Don't do that!

495
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,560
Go out.
I have something to report to Master.

496
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,250
You have no right to stay here.

497
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,150
What happened?

498
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,540
I heard from Li Mo about the flying snake,

499
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,690
so I used
the Spirit-Seeking Spell to look for it.

500
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,390
The White Snake is not in Hell.

501
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,290
Either it has perished
from the Three Realms,

502
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,400
or it simply didn't die.

503
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,040
Between the two,

504
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,840
I'm inclined to believe the latter.

505
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,400
Master, Li Qingyue conjured
the Blazing Fire that day.

506
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,060
We all saw it with our own eyes.

507
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,360
There's no way we could be mistaken.

508
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,820
Siling harmed you
more than once in the past.

509
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,320
Now that she has reappeared,

510
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,450
she definitely has ulterior motives.

511
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,360
Master, you mustn't go soft again.
