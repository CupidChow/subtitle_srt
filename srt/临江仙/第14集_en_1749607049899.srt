1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,380
Standing against the surround byAMG

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,600
Swift procession

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,300
look...

4
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,640
look at this

5
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,660
damn it

6
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,860
you two top

7
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,960
bloom

8
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,640
normally, we do have a headline

9
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,620
if it's a reliable headline, we can sell this

10
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,560
thanks for saving each other

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,200
I want to make someone come to me

12
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,780
if you guys can do something, I'll sell you

13
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,040
here, take that

14
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,800
you imbecile

15
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,960
such a dirty honorable tale

16
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Eun-gong!

17
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,360
Eun-gong, I know you're kind.

18
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,760
But we're also innocent.

19
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
If we don't have food,

20
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,760
I'll starve to death with these two kids.

21
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
They've sold me out.

22
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,760
They can live longer.

23
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
I know it's hard.

24
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
If there's a way,

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,760
and if there's a woman who wants to bear this pain,

26
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,760
I'll have to bear the pain of separation.

27
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Don't cry.

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Don't cry.

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,160
You're my sister.

30
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,160
You can buy something delicious with this money.

31
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
It's okay.

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,160
You can buy some tools to maintain your life.

33
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,160
But don't give this money to your father.

34
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Protect your mother.

35
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Don't let her be sold by your father.

36
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,160
Get up.

37
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,160
Thank you, Eun-gong.

38
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,960
Thank you, Eun-gong.

39
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Thank you, Eun-gong.

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Thank you, Eun-gong.

41
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,560
The world is in a difficult situation.

42
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
We have to live harder.

43
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Eun-gong, what's your name?

44
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Thank you, Eun-gong.

45
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,960
How is it?

46
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
I just asked if I'm fine.

47
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
But I have a price for this.

48
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,360
Look, our mountain and sea guards are changing to steamed buns.

49
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Xia Shi, Xia Shi, take care.

50
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
Xia Shi, take care.

51
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
I'm a good man.

52
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,360
I'm a good man.

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
I'm a good man.

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
I have a sword in my hand.

55
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
You can choose.

56
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
You can choose.

57
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
I've heard of it.

58
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,360
Yes, Xia Shi.

59
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
I have 500 pieces of it.

60
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,760
I think Xia Shi is a good man.

61
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
I can sell you 300 pieces.

62
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
I'll take this.

63
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
You're a good man.

64
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,760
How about this?

65
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,360
I'll take this with you.

66
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
I'll take this.

67
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
Xia Shi, take care.

68
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
I'm a good man.

69
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,360
I'll take this.

70
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,360
I'll take this.

71
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,360
I'll take this.

72
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,360
I don't think you're a good man.

73
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
What did you do?

74
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,360
I was in Huai An County as a guard.

75
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
I got the chief of the county.

76
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Then I got into trouble.

77
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
People were starving to death.

78
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
The government has a good conscience.

79
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
And the family has a good conscience.

80
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,360
But they don't want to give up.

81
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,360
I've been with the criminals

82
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,360
since I was a kid.

83
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,360
I've built a good conscience.

84
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
A good conscience?

85
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
I've given them up.

86
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Then I took the food from the county and my parents.

87
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
We've built a big, small conscience.

88
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Then we've given them up.

89
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
And we've saved the people.

90
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Do you think it's good for me?

91
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
It's not good for me.

92
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,360
It's just that

93
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
you don't look good.

94
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,360
You're a good man.

95
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Why are you not leaving?

96
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
Song He Xian is in front of me.

97
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
I can't go.

98
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Why?

99
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
You don't know?

100
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
My grandpa was in Song He Xian

101
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
as a housekeeper for a family.

102
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,360
He's a very strange person.

103
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
He's my father

104
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
and a famous teacher.

105
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
He can be a good man.

106
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,360
But he has to stay in Song He Xian

107
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,360
and be a good man forever.

108
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Now that I've done something,

109
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
I can't go to him anymore.

110
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
If he gets into trouble,

111
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
he'll be in trouble.

112
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Where are you going?

113
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
Where?

114
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,360
I don't know.

115
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
I'll send you my letter.

116
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,360
I'll return it to you when I'm free.

117
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,360
I'll leave you alone.

118
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
I'll see you later.

119
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Song He Xian

120
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Song He Xian

121
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Stop!

122
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Stop!

123
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
I'm sorry for the trouble.

124
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
I'm sorry for the trouble.

125
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
I'm sorry for the trouble.

126
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
If you want to kill me, kill me.

127
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,360
I'll be punished.

128
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
You're the one who's punished.

129
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,360
You're not the one who's punished.

130
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
I'm a man of justice.

131
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm a man of justice.

132
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,360
You're so mean.

133
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
If you dare to do anything,

134
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
come here.

135
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
I'll show you how I'm doing.

136
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,360
You're ordered to arrest Meng Chang Qin.

137
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,360
If you want to fight him, you'll have to kill him.

138
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Since you're so unfaithful,

139
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,360
we'll have to do it.

140
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Go!

141
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Why did you run away?

142
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Right away?

143
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Darling, don't go.

144
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,360
I'm already rich.

145
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,360
I'm sorry for the trouble.

146
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,360
I'll be the one who's punished.

147
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:33,420
Our

148
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,640
jis

149
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,520
now

150
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,720
believes

151
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
What do you think?

152
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,720
I'm just wondering if we were too small in the past.

153
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,720
But this is not enough to be the reason you're a mortal.

154
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Sometimes I feel that your heart is made of ice.

155
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm just wondering if you're a mortal.

156
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
I'm going.

157
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,720
If I tell you that I don't want you to go,

158
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
what should I do?

159
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
Stop!

160
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Stop!

161
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Drink some water and go back to your room.

162
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Drink some water and go back to your room.

163
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Give me some face.

164
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
I finally found the water.

165
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Why are you so upset?

166
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
I'm doing a bath.

167
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Can you be quiet?

168
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
I'm just worried about you.

169
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Besides,

170
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
are you that weak when you're a tall person?

171
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
You're so weak when you're a tall person.

172
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,720
If you use a magic that will make you die,

173
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
you'll have to...

174
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
die in a flash.

175
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,720
You're so weak when you're a tall person.

176
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
You're so weak when you're a tall person.

177
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
You're so weak when you're a tall person.

178
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
I understand.

179
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
When you're done,

180
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
let's move.

181
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Why are you so anxious?

182
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
You don't know.

183
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Those soldiers are like dogs.

184
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
They can bite you when you smell something.

185
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Put your heart in their stomach.

186
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,720
We're now in the north.

187
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,720
There's a thousand miles away from the South.

188
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
They're four horses and horses.

189
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
They can't catch up to you.

190
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
A thousand miles away?

191
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Master,

192
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
you're so smart.

193
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,720
When did I become your master?

194
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
Just now.

195
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
You drank my white wet water.

196
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
White wet water?

197
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
Yes, it is.

198
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
According to our family's white wet,

199
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
we'll drink the white wet water

200
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
in a few days

201
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
and serve tea for Master.

202
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Then we'll serve white wet water.

203
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
But we're in danger now.

204
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
We have limited conditions.

205
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
We can only save money.

206
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Tu Er,

207
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
we can only serve hot water for Master.

208
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
It's a new idea.

209
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
You never said that it's white wet water.

210
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
I...

211
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Never said that?

212
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Master should know that

213
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
you're a master.

214
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
I heard that

215
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
you can find someone's mind

216
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
when you get this new idea.

217
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Since you drank my water,

218
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
you're willing to be my disciple?

219
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
I don't think you're a master.

220
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
You're like a ghost.

221
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
I'm not.

222
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
I'm not.

223
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
I'm not.

224
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
I'm not.

225
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
I don't care.

226
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Since you drank my white wet water,

227
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
you're willing to be my disciple?

228
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
You can't turn back now.

229
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
I'll go find some food

230
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
to serve Master.

231
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Wait for me.

232
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Meng Chang Qin.

233
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Meng Chang Qin.

234
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
You're still here?

235
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
Master.

236
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Meng Chang Qin.

237
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Master.

238
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Why are you sitting there?

239
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Didn't you say you're looking for food?

240
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Where's the food?

241
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
I'm not.

242
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
I'm just here to eat.

243
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
I'm not.

244
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
I'm just here to eat.

245
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
I'm not.

246
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
I'm just here to eat.

247
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
I'm not.

248
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
I'm just here to eat.

249
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
I'm not.

250
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
What's wrong?

251
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Where's the food?

252
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
There's a disaster in this village.

253
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
There's no one alive.

254
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
I've searched the whole village.

255
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
There's even half a centimeter.

256
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Only a small number of people died.

257
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
They should have fled

258
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
after the disaster.

259
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Fled?

260
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,720
Even so,

261
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
where can they go?

262
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
They've just fled from one place

263
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
to another.

264
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Don't.

265
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
This village

266
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
is mostly

267
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
the people who have been living

268
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
in the old days.

269
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
The people of the modern world

270
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
are all dying.

271
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
They have no money and food.

272
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Even if they escape,

273
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
they'll be left behind.

274
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
They'll be left behind.

275
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Instead of dying,

276
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
they'd rather die at home.

277
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,720
They're just living in the old days.

278
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
They're just living in the old days.

279
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,720
They're just living in the old days.

280
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
They're just living in the old days.

281
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Master, let's go to the other village.

282
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
If they're lucky,

283
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
they can catch wild rabbits.

284
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Okay.

285
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Master,

286
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
let's go to the other village.

287
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Let's go.

288
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Let's go.

289
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
What are you doing?

290
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,720
The house is too dark.

291
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Let her sunbathe.

292
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
Take care of yourself.

293
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
I'm so lucky today.

294
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,720
I'm so lucky today.

295
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,720
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

296
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Master,

297
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
I have a question.

298
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
Do you think

299
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
you can make it

300
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
to the top

301
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
by practicing the immortal?

302
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Of course.

303
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
I can't.

304
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
I can't.

305
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I can't.

306
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
Of course.

307
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
As far as I know,

308
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
the people on the nine heavens

309
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
have to have at least hundreds of books.

310
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Hundreds?

311
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
So many?

312
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Where do they live?

313
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
In the six realms of the flying city,

314
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
they go to the immortal world,

315
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
the nine heavens.

316
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
The nine heavens?

317
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
What kind of world is that?

318
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
Is there a difference between the mortal world?

319
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,720
Do you think those gods

320
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
are the same as us?

321
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
I'm not good at it.

322
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
I'm just a little bit better.

323
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
The immortal has his own power.

324
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
He doesn't have to be bad at it.

325
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Most of the troubles of the immortal

326
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
are caused by the late night.

327
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
That's why he can get rid of the long time.

328
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
God is so unfair.

329
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
The immortal has a magical power.

330
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Even if he doesn't eat or drink, he won't die.

331
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,720
But the mortal is a blood-sucking area.

332
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
He'll be sick, hurt, and killed.

333
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
He'll be sick and dead.

334
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Do you know?

335
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
He's just trying to save us

336
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
to live a peaceful life.

337
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
But they...

338
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
Master, you're a noble man.

339
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
You said we burn so many incense every day,

340
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
but we have so many heads.

341
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Can you feel it?

342
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
The nine gods of heaven are all so unique.

343
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,720
If you try to do it, you'll feel it.

344
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
So that's how it is.

345
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Can they really feel it?

346
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
Why don't they care about us?

347
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Why do we have to suffer in this world?

348
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
It's hard to live with a wild dog.

349
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
What kind of a dog is this?

350
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
We're humans.

351
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
Why do we have to eat and drink and eat?

352
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
We live in the same way.

353
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
What kind of a god is this?

354
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
There must be a Hanlun, right?

355
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
Hanlun?

356
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Hanlun?

357
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Hanlun?

358
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
There must be a Hanlun, right?

359
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
If we can't save humans,

360
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,720
why do we have to die?

361
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
From today on,

362
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
I believe in myself.

363
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
Hanlun?

364
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Hanlun?

365
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Master.

366
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
You're up too early.

367
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
It's late.

368
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
I should go back.

369
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
I haven't slept yet.

370
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
I have to sleep for a while.

371
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
I won't send you off.

372
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Are you sure you won't go with me to Songhe County?

373
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
I won't go if I don't go.

374
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
Your grandfather's family is rich.

375
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
If you take the request,

376
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
maybe I'll take you in.

377
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
I won't go.

378
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
You've been separated from your grandfather for years.

379
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Don't you want to see him?

380
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
When my father passed away,

381
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,720
I couldn't see him for the last time

382
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
because of the imperial decree.

383
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
My grandfather was even more so.

384
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Since I was a sensible man,

385
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
I've never seen him before.

386
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,720
I can't be a filial son in this life.

387
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
I'm filial to my father.

388
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
But now,

389
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
I still have more important things to do.

390
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
I have to go.

391
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
I have to go.

392
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
Master, you're...

393
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Since you insist on doing this,

394
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
I won't force you to do it again.

395
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Take care of yourself.

396
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Master.

397
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Have you changed your mind?

398
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
I've changed my mind.

399
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
I've changed my mind.

400
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
I've changed my mind.

401
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
I've changed my mind.

402
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
I've changed my mind.

403
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
I've changed my mind.

404
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
I want to ask you something.

405
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,720
There's really a Han Dragon in this world, right?

406
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
Maybe.

407
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Master.

408
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
Master.

409
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Madam.

410
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
Madam.

411
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
You're finally back.

412
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Where's Bai Jiu Si?

413
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
He left a message for you.

414
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
He said something important was to be done.

415
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
If you don't want to do it,

416
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
he'll give it to someone else.

417
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
I don't understand.

418
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Did you guys have a fight?

419
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
Where is he?

420
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,720
I think he went to the north of the city.

421
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
Right.

422
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
It smells so good.

423
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
I think so, too.

424
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Let's drink more.

425
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Drink more.

426
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
What do you do for a living?

427
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
What do you do for a living?

428
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
How many women in the family

429
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,720
have been taken away by a few?

430
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
Is it a good idea or a good idea?

431
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
I've opened a shop.

432
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
My family lives in the city of Cheng Dong.

433
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
There aren't many people in the family.

434
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
I don't take them away.

435
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
Cheng Dong?

436
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
That place is too remote.

437
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
It's almost in Cheng Jiao.

438
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,720
I don't know what the house is like.

439
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Mrs. Wang,

440
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Mr. Bai is a good person.

441
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,720
That's why he chose Cheng Dong.

442
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Although it's a bit remote,

443
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
the scenery is really good.

444
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,720
And he's a good person.

445
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
Zuo, I'll go and take a look.

446
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,720
It's just a long way from the gate.

447
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
The view is so beautiful.

448
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
The view is so beautiful.

449
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
The view is so beautiful.

450
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
The view is so beautiful.

451
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
It's not as good as the house.

452
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
When the wind blows,

453
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
the lady in your house

454
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
is so beautiful.

455
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
And the spirit of the Buddha

456
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
is more beautiful than the house.

457
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Have you ever been to the world?

458
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
No.

459
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Mr. Bai is young and not into the world.

460
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
He's got such a big family.

461
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
He's so big.

462
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Mrs. Wang,

463
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
look.

464
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Mr. Bai is so good.

465
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
He's so good.

466
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
He's so good.

467
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
I think it's a good idea.

468
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
We should go to the capital.

469
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
We should go there.

470
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
We should go to the mountains.

471
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
We should go to the mountains.

472
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
We should go to the mountains.

473
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
It's a good idea.

474
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
It's a good idea.

475
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
It's a good idea.

476
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
Besides,

477
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
the young master of the capital

478
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
has three or five houses

479
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
that are the most likely to be built.

480
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
The houses are so close to each other.

481
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
It's not necessary to say much.

482
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
The main thing is that the location is good.

483
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
The location is good.

484
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
The main thing is that

485
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
the three generations of the capital

486
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
are all related to each other.

487
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
Such people

488
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
can't even give a good idea.

489
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
It's a good idea.

490
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,720
It's a good idea.

491
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Mr. Bai,

492
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
do you think so?

493
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
It's a good idea.

494
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,720
You're the one who saved my wish.

495
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
How did they get together?

496
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
They didn't.

497
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
This young master

498
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
is just like her.

499
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
This young master

500
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
is so handsome.

501
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Her mother

502
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
is so handsome.

503
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
She's handsome?

504
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,720
You can't say that.

505
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
I've been a maid for so many years.

506
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
She's always

507
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
the one who looks good

508
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
and looks good.

509
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
That's why

510
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
they're so close.

511
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
There's no way

512
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
that a high school girl

513
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
can be a maid

514
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
or a maid.

515
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
That's a nonsense.

516
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Madam,

517
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
please have a good talk.

518
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,720
It's a good idea.

519
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
She's more and more funny.

520
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
Miss,

521
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
are you sure?

522
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
What are you talking about?

523
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
How can you compare

524
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
between a woman and a man?

525
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
My daughter

526
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,720
is so good at making up.

527
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
She's so good at writing.

528
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
She's so good at writing.

529
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
She's so good at singing.

530
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
She's so good at

531
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
making up.

532
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
She's so good at making up.

533
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,720
If there's a family matter,

534
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,720
don't say that

535
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,720
the young master of the capital

536
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
is a royal family.

537
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
My daughter is also good at it.

538
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
Yes, she is.

539
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
She's good at it.

540
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
I thought

541
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
you were going out

542
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
for some serious business.

543
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
Miss,

544
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
I didn't expect you

545
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
to come here to get married.

546
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
You should

547
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
find a new bride

548
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
and tell me

549
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
what you think of me.

550
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Okay.

551
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
You two

552
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
are here to kiss.

553
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
You're asking me

554
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
to let my daughter

555
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
be her wife?

556
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
Mother.

557
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Misunderstanding?

558
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
It's a big misunderstanding.

559
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
I...

560
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
I just knew it.

561
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
Mr. Bai,

562
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
you didn't say anything

563
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
before you got married.

564
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
How can you

565
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,720
be a man

566
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
in the middle of your family?

567
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
You little white face.

568
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,720
You can't

569
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
make up a good scene.

570
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
White face.

571
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Let's go home.

572
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
I'll find a better bride for you.

573
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,720
Mrs. Wang.

574
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Mrs. Wang.

575
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
I...

576
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
I'm the first girl

577
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
in Songhe.

578
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
She's going to ruin you.

579
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
I'm sorry.

580
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
You didn't say

581
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,720
you're a womanizer.

582
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Can a womanizer

583
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
be the same as a married woman?

584
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
No.

585
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Then...

586
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
You should have told me earlier.

587
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,720
You're a man like this.

588
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
Shouldn't you

589
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
have asked

590
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
the girl's hospital

591
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
first?

592
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
Besides,

593
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,720
you haven't

594
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
made up your mind

595
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
and you're looking for a bride.

596
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
No wonder

597
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Mrs. Wang

598
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,720
is so mad at you.

599
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
Young Master,

600
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
can you

601
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,720
make up a good scene?

602
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
I can.

603
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
You can?

604
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Money?

605
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Young Master, don't worry.

606
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
I'll keep this

607
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
in my wife's body.

608
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
I'll find a

609
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
perfect bride for you.

610
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
I'll see you

611
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
at the bar tomorrow.

612
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
What are you looking at?

613
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
We've been together

614
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
for so many years.

615
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
I'll help you

616
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,720
to see her.

617
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Young Master,

618
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
please help me.

619
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
It's so tiring.

620
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
I can't find a place to sleep.

621
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
I can't think

622
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,720
about it

623
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
in my mind.

624
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Remember,

625
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
you're the

626
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
most precious lady

627
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
in the family.

628
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
You have to be a little bit more modest.

629
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Sit down.

630
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
This is...

631
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
This is a dress.

632
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
You have to change it.

633
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
I know.

634
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,720
Why are you

635
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720
more suspicious than my mom?

636
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,720
You...

637
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Tell me.

638
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
What's the name of that man?

639
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,720
Do you like

640
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
gentle and gentle

641
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
or bold and hot?

642
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,720
He's just a request.

643
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,720
He said he wanted

644
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,720
the most beautiful, kind,

645
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,720
and pure lady

646
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,720
in the world.

647
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
I know

648
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
what he meant

649
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
by being kind.

650
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
He said he wanted

651
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,720
the most beautiful,

652
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,720
pure and gentle lady.

653
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
What do you mean?

654
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
You don't need to know.

655
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,720
All the men

656
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
who come to the bar

657
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,720
are like this.

658
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
It seems

659
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
he must be

660
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
the most precious lady in the world.

661
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
Flowers are blooming.

662
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
The young master is here.

663
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
Come on.

664
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
Sit down.

665
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,720
We'll be there in a while.

666
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,720
Come on.

667
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
Miss, you're here too.

668
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,720
Miss,

669
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
please take a seat.

670
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Come on.

671
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Don't mind me.

672
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
I won't talk

673
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,720
if you're talking about yours.

674
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Okay.

675
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Here he comes.

676
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
I just went to get some wine.

677
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
I'll wait for you.

678
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,720
I'll drink with you.

679
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,720
Don't be mad.

680
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
I'll do it myself.

681
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
Come on.

682
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
Please, sir.

683
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Miss, are you okay?

684
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
Sir, I'm sorry.

685
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Miss.

686
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Miss.

687
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
You look so pale.

688
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
You're standing still.

689
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,720
Please take a seat.

690
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Come on.

691
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
Sit down.

692
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,720
Let's have a chat.

693
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,720
Come on.

694
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
Let's eat.

695
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,720
Come on.

696
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,720
Let's eat.

697
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
I'll do it myself.

698
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
Here you go.

699
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,720
But it's not fresh.

700
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
How about I get the firewood to change the stove?

701
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,720
No, thanks.

702
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
It's fresh.

703
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Then eat more.

704
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,720
Come on, sir.

705
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
Wan'er.

706
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
I'll go and have a look.

707
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,720
Wan'er.

708
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
Xiao'er.

709
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Xiao'er.

710
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
Here you go.

711
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,720
Is your dish not fresh?

712
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,720
My lady is sick.

713
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
Sir.

714
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
Don't talk nonsense.

715
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
My restaurant has been open for so many years.

716
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
It's impossible to get sick.

717
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,720
What nonsense?

718
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
You're eating meat alone.

719
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
You're not in trouble.

720
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
What's the problem?

721
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Fine.

722
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,720
You don't want to admit it, do you?

723
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
Then let's report it to the government.

724
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Let's see who's the winner.

725
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
No, no.

726
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
I'll go first.

727
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
What's the problem?

728
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,720
It's just a big problem.

729
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,720
Thank you.

730
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,720
Are you feeling guilty?

731
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
The guest house owner Xu Shi just came to Songhe County.

732
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
He doesn't know the money.

733
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
He wants to come to our restaurant every day.

734
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
He has a lot of food.

735
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Don't take out the money.

736
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Don't make it up.

737
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
The old man gave the money.

738
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,720
The government's secret service

739
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
won't keep the life.

740
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
What?

741
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,720
What did you say?

742
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,720
We eat food.

743
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,720
Songhe County is so poor.

744
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,720
We can't go out and have a fight.

745
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
I'm a poor person.

746
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
I'm not a poor person.

747
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,720
I'm not a poor person.

748
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,720
You should go and find a doctor.

749
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
If you're a bad person,

750
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,720
I'll make you pay for your food.

751
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
I'll go now.

752
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
You...

753
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Don't go.

754
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
It's okay.

755
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
Don't go.

756
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
Go.

757
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Okay.

758
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
The doctor must go today.

759
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
The government must report it.

760
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
Go.

761
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,720
You're still talking to me?

762
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,720
Do you know how important I am today?

763
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
You're a bad person.

764
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
You're a bad person.

765
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
I'm not a bad person.

766
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
You must report it today.

767
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,720
Do you want to report it?

768
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
Go.

769
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Go and report it.

770
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
You're a bad person.

771
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Go away.

772
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,720
Go away.

773
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Stop it.

774
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Don't care.

775
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
I said stop it.

776
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
There's no problem.

777
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,720
It's my problem.

778
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
What's your problem?

779
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,720
I'm pregnant.

780
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
What?

781
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Mr. Park.

782
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
Mr. Park.

783
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,720
Are you angry?

784
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
I don't know.

785
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
He's pregnant.

786
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,720
Besides,

787
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
I don't know if you're pregnant.

788
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,720
I don't know if you're pregnant.

789
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
I'm not angry.

790
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
I just don't want to cry

791
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,720
if I keep doing this.

792
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,720
What kind of girl do you want?

793
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Why don't you talk about it?

794
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Is this woman

795
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,720
a big-hearted woman?

796
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Or a small-hearted woman?

797
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,720
Do you like

798
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
a woman who is gentle?

799
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,720
Or a woman who is a little girl?

800
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,720
What about her family?

801
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,720
What about her body?

802
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
Do you mind if

803
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,720
she's a little girl?

804
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
I don't know.

805
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,720
I just think

806
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,720
if she's a little girl,

807
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
she'll be a little girl.

808
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,720
Mr. Park.

809
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,720
I'm telling the truth.

810
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
I'm telling the truth.

811
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
You have a real family.

812
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,720
You're the first wife

813
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,720
to marry a big-hearted woman.

814
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,720
There's no more than 100.

815
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,720
There's more than 10.

816
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,720
There's more than 10.

817
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,720
I've never seen

818
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
a woman like you

819
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,720
who is so naughty.

820
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
She's not a little girl.

821
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,720
She's not a big-hearted woman.

822
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,720
She has no parents

823
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
and no family.

824
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,720
She wants the most beautiful

825
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
and the best girl in the world.

826
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
I don't know.

827
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,720
How dare you?

828
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,720
I'll be sure to remove it.

829
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
Thank you.

830
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,220
Look.

831
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,720
Yummybrddo.

832
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
Boss.

833
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Uh.

834
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
What's onto this?

835
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
As I was thinking,

836
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
there are two girls

837
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,720
looking for you on the roof.

838
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,060
The kiss clip will get

839
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:06,720
empty.

840
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,720
No need to talk too much.

841
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,020
Although that lady

842
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,660
Although she's gentle and beautiful,

843
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,820
she has a mother who doesn't like to meet.

844
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,260
You can marry her.

845
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,260
You won't be able to have a wife.

846
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,660
Here you are.

847
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:23,980
Be careful.

848
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,260
Thank you, sir.

849
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,860
Let's continue playing.

850
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,060
Are you trying to save her?

851
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,060
Why can't I save Meng Changqin?

852
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,060
You can do it.

853
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,060
It's different.

854
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,220
What's different?

855
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,220
Meng Changqin will bring you danger.
