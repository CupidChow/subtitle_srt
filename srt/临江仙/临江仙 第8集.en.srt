[Episode 8]

3
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,590
We are demon hunters.

4
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,640
Is this the residence of Xu Ying?

5
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,210
My name is Sun Ya.

6
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,190
My husband Xu Ying and I
were childhood sweethearts.

7
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,970
We've been married for
over a decade now.

8
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,130
He'd always been fond of drinking.

9
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,250
He just wouldn't listen to me.

10
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,470
That night, he didn't come home at all.

11
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,800
I thought he had
passed out drunk somewhere.

12
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,730
But I never imagined...

13
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,190
At dawn, someone found

14
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,650
his body outside the city.

15
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,980
Was it done by Honglian?

16
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,840
Where did he usually drink?

17
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,710
Lanyue House.

18
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,250
Is it a restaurant?

19
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,710
Lanyue House is Songhe County's
largest brothel.

20
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,380
Since you two are demon hunters,

21
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,920
you must catch that heart-digging demon

22
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,630
and avenge my husband.

23
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,280
Madam Sun, please accept our condolences.

24
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,730
If there really is a demon harming people,

25
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,060
we will certainly eliminate this threat.

26
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,000
My husband,

27
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,520
did you hear that?

28
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,750
Come, come, this way, this way.

29
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,310
Sir,

30
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,240
your dishes are here.

31
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,070
Then let's have a few drinks together.

32
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,470
-Don't run.
-Oh, stop it.

33
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,270
Stop hiding.

34
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,390
You're hurting me.

35
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:34,780
Follow me.

36
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,090
Wasn't there talk of demon activity?

37
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,590
Why are the streets
so empty during the day,

38
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,900
while Lanyue House is so busy at night?

39
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,480
Naturally, there's something here

40
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,880
that makes people want to
come at all costs.

41
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,310
Bravo!

42
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,800
Do you think Xu Ying was

43
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,350
really killed by Honglian?

44
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,420
Why does she dig out people's hearts?

45
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Do you know Honglian's background?

46
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,070
I don't.

47
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,610
She was a lotus that grew
by the Naihe Bridge,

48
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,310
absorbing the grievances
of countless wandering souls.

49
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,240
So when she took human form,
she carried evil energy.

50
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,520
On every full moon,

51
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,820
the evil energy in her body surges,

52
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,070
bringing heart-piercing pain.

53
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,540
She can only suppress the pain
by eating human hearts.

54
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,090
Is there no way to dissolve
this evil energy?

55
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,520
There is a way but also no way.

56
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,250
What do you mean?

57
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,750
Bravo!

58
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,780
[Honglian]

59
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,600
Is it her?

60
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,980
What are we waiting for then?

61
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,970
This is a clone.
Catching it is useless.

62
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,620
Sit down.

63
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,950
A clone?

64
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,010
Then where is her real body?

65
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,040
She was suppressed for centuries.

66
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,060
When she escaped,
she was severely injured.

67
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,900
To control this puppet clone,

68
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,390
she must be nearby.

69
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,720
You can't detect where her
real body is either?

70
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,720
She has lived for nearly a thousand years.

71
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,980
Naturally, she has ways to hide herself.

72
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,510
So the Heavenly Lord isn't as
powerful as I thought.

73
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,510
Bravo!

74
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,940
-So beautiful!
-She danced so well.

75
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,090
Miss Lian,

76
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,680
this is my family's heirloom white jade.

77
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,390
Please see if it meets your standards.

78
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,070
Miss Lian,

79
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,600
this is a night-luminous pearl
I bought at a high price.

80
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,100
This is agarwood worth a fortune.

81
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,409
I don't want your jewels.

82
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,190
What I want is your love.

83
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,540
I've never been here before.

84
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,510
Is she really that beautiful?

85
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,060
I'm the one who truly likes Miss Lian.

86
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,260
Honglian is best at
bewitching people.

87
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,080
Have you ever been bewitched by her?

88
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,700
Miss Lian, Miss Lian!

89
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,110
Don't listen to their nonsense.

90
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,040
Don't listen to his lies.

91
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,190
They're all a bunch of lechers.

92
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,390
Miss Lian, Miss Lian!

93
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,370
Look at mine!

94
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,140
-Look at mine.
-Take a look.

95
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,800
Look, please!

96
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,230
Miss Lian, Miss Lian!

97
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,510
Cut it out.

98
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,940
I know what kind of person you are.

99
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,240
What are you holding there?

100
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,070
How can that compare to mine?

101
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,120
These two gentlemen look unfamiliar.

102
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,950
I've long heard of Miss Lian's reputation.

103
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,010
We've come here because of your fame.

104
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,960
This young gentleman

105
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,240
is so handsome.

106
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Among all these people...

107
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,870
Miss Lian!

108
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,040
You're the only one who catches my eye.

109
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,240
I wonder if you'd like

110
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,420
to join me upstairs for a drink?

111
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,920
But what about the gift
I spent so long to prepare?

112
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,930
Yeah.

113
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,880
Then I'll respectfully
accept your invitation.

114
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,890
Wait for me here.

115
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,110
Hey, this...

116
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,150
Miss Lian is leaving.

117
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,960
Miss Lian!

118
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,460
-Miss Lian!
-Miss Lian!

119
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,350
Look at us.

120
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,600
Miss Lian!

121
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,140
Miss Lian!

122
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,430
You're indeed popular.

123
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,310
Everything in this room is valuable.

124
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,240
These things

125
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,760
can't be taken with when I pass away.

126
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,720
Nothing is as precious as sincere hearts.

127
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,120
Come, let's have a drink.

128
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,730
It seems you are very interested
in human hearts.

129
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,360
It's not that I like it.

130
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,560
It's just so hard to find in this world.

131
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,950
That's why it seems even more precious.

132
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,270
You came here

133
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,440
just to find a sincere heart?

134
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm waiting for someone.

135
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,390
Who?

136
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,170
Waiting for someone who doesn't love me.

137
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,000
If you meet him,

138
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,920
could you ask him to come find me?

139
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,920
What did she tell you?

140
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
She said she's waiting for someone.

141
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,820
Do you know who she's waiting for?

142
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,000
I do.

143
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,550
Then let's bring him here.

144
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,880
Maybe it could help us catch Honglian.

145
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,070
He doesn't want to see her.

146
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,330
How can we force him
to do something he doesn't want to?

147
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,970
Then what should we do?

148
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,870
Are we just going to wait for Honglian
to make the first move?

149
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,000
What if she escapes?

150
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,560
I've already set up a barrier around
the entire Songhe County.

151
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,090
She won't be able to escape.

152
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,180
What should we do next?

153
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:23,720
Wait.

154
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,080
Wait?

155
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,080
She's unwilling to appear.

156
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,930
And we can't find her true form.

157
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,850
Let's see who gets restless first.

158
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,860
But come to think of it,

159
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,200
I'm curious.

160
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,320
What exactly did Honglian do back then

161
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,000
to get sealed in Hell Ruins?

162
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,360
Honglian,

163
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,300
you spread a plague
and took countless lives.

164
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,510
Surrender now!

165
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,690
Have him come see me.

166
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,550
Incorrigible.

167
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,080
It's your memories again.

168
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,650
You haven't told me yet

169
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,360
who the person is that Honglian mentioned.

170
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,600
Li Mo.

171
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,080
One of your Three Dharma Lords?

172
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,750
Good memory.

173
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,170
If that's the case,

174
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,640
then this matter began with him,

175
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,970
and should end with him.

176
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,880
Foolish girl, he doesn't love you at all.

177
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,510
Who?

178
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,170
You know clearly that he doesn't love you.

179
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,030
It's not like we're
meeting for the first time.

180
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,760
Why are you still so surprised?

181
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,440
Stop looking around.
This is an illusion I created.

182
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,600
Without my permission,

183
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,270
no one can enter or leave.

184
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,520
Why did you bring me here?

185
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,080
Why don't you guess?

186
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,410
You want to force Li Mo to show up.

187
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,660
You're quite clever.

188
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,100
Have a seat first.

189
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,490
I heard Li Mo has been
avoiding you for centuries.

190
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,020
Are you sure he will come?

191
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,720
That depends on how important
you are to Bai Jiusi.

192
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,810
Let's see if he will

193
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,270
force his disciple to meet me
for your sake.

194
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,190
If he refuses,

195
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,370
that's fine too.

196
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,480
At least I will have helped you
see his true colors.

197
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,030
He will.

198
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,280
Oh, you still don't understand men.

199
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,440
Even though he keeps saying he loves you,

200
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,790
it might not be true.

201
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,099
I have lived for a thousand years.

202
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,720
I've seen people's cold-heartedness

203
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,750
and false affections.

204
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
Not all men are like that.

205
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,410
Do you know what this is?

206
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,619
Evil energy.

207
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,270
It seems Bai Jiusi has
told you about this.

208
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,830
It's this evil energy

209
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,690
that torments me every full moon,

210
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,110
making me wish I were dead.

211
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,030
Meng Po on the Naihe Bridge told me

212
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,070
only the blood of someone
who truly loves me

213
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,640
can dissolve the evil energy in my body.

214
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,880
Unfortunately, I've waited
for a thousand years,

215
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
and this evil energy
still hasn't been removed.

216
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,200
Can you guess why?

217
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,550
Perhaps I should let you see for yourself.

218
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,880
Then you'll understand.

219
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,030
We grew up together.

220
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,070
We're also at the age for marriage.

221
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,470
I've already discussed it with my parents.

222
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,040
As long as you don't mind me,

223
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,890
tomorrow...

224
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,790
I'll go to your house tomorrow to propose.

225
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,200
Alright.

226
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:46,410
Lian, does this mean you've agreed?

227
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,240
That's wonderful!

228
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,170
Lian has agreed to marry me!

229
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,580
Lian has agreed to marry me!

230
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,200
That's wonderful!

231
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,150
What do you want me to see?

232
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,900
What is this now?

233
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,110
Naturally, it's still my past.

234
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,450
Who's there? Who's knocking?

235
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,140
Wake up, wake up.

236
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,060
Miss Honglian, thank you
for saving my life.

237
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,830
When I pass the imperial exam,
I will return to marry you.

238
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,830
I'll wait for you.

239
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,880
Lian!

240
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,080
Lian, I've come back to marry you.

241
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,560
Enough!

242
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,110
Do you see clearly now?

243
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,160
Whether it's childhood sweethearts
or life-saving grace,

244
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,590
sharing life and death,

245
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,170
or kindred spirits,

246
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,400
they're all fake.

247
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,480
They pride themselves on being passionate,

248
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
but in the end,

249
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,230
not one of them could dispel
the evil energy in me.

250
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,830
Isn't it laughable?

251
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,810
You killed them.

252
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,750
I didn't take their lives.

253
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,470
I only took the blood from their hearts.

254
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,240
Since you're convinced
that men are fickle,

255
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,100
why do you insist on finding Li Mo?

256
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,890
He's different.

257
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,870
How is he different?

258
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,920
He doesn't love me.

259
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,510
He's the only one who doesn't love me.

260
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,750
Then why do you still insist
on finding him?

261
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,510
It's me.

262
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,540
I'm holding onto a love I can't reach.

263
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I deserve an explanation, don't I?

264
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,160
Alright, someone's here to see me.

265
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,120
I will play with you no more.

266
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,240
My dear sister,

267
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,160
I'll help you test

268
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,550
Bai Jiusi's true feelings for you.

269
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,210
How's that?

270
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,280
What are you going to do? Let me out!

271
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,720
Don't go! Come back!

272
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,750
Let me out!

273
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,960
This is nothing but a puppet's shell.

274
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,400
You can't hurt me.

275
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,600
If you want to kill me,

276
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,490
then just do it.

277
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,240
Where is she?

278
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,490
Hand over Li Mo in exchange.

279
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,980
If you want to see him,

280
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,740
come and see me in person.

281
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,440
Do you think I'm stupid?

282
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,740
If it were my real body

283
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,340
standing in front of you,

284
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,030
how would I even have the right

285
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,030
to bargain with you here?

286
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,130
How about this?

287
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,870
I've heard that disciples must obey

288
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,920
Blood Spells from Canglei Palace.

289
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,240
As long as you issue an order to Li Mo,

290
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,590
I'll tell you Li Qingyue's location.

291
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,050
Well?

292
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,430
Location.

293
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,220
Li Qingyue is inside.

294
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,710
But let me kindly remind you.

295
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,470
It might be easy to enter,
but getting out might be difficult.

296
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,720
That's right, this is the trap I set.

297
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,920
Do you still dare to enter?

298
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,580
This is getting more and more interesting.

299
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,710
Heavenly Lord.

300
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,720
Heavenly Lord!

301
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,640
Heavenly Lord, I'm the real one!

302
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,500
Heavenly Lord!

303
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,030
Heavenly Lord.

304
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,280
Only one of them is real.

305
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,880
Bai Jiusi, you only have one chance.

306
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,000
They are all fake!

307
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,530
If you choose the wrong one,

308
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,160
this little girl...

309
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,400
will be sealed in ice forever.

310
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,160
By then, even the Heavenly Emissary

311
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,410
will not be able to save her.

312
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,750
-Heavenly Lord!
-Heavenly Lord!

313
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,590
Heavenly Lord, I'm the real one!

314
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,830
I'm the real one. Don't listen
to their nonsense.

315
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,790
I'm the real one!

316
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,650
Heavenly Lord!

317
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,790
I'm Qingyue, Heavenly Lord.

318
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,350
Heavenly Lord, I'm the real one.

319
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,080
Heavenly Lord! Heavenly Lord!

320
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,530
They are all fake!

321
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,750
Heavenly Lord, I'm the real one.

322
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,550
Heavenly Lord, I'm the real one!

323
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,500
Heavenly Lord!

324
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,590
Heavenly Lord, look at me!

325
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,350

00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:09,090
♪ Looking back, yesterday's moss still faintly remains ♪

339
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,950
I knew you cared for me the most.

340
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:15,810
♪ Our love and hate are no longer the same ♪

341
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:28,040
♪ Only the twin flowers in the pond remain ♪

342
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,840
Such profound and deeply touching affection.

343
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,900
If that's the case,

344
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,730
I won't disturb you two lovebirds any longer.

345
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,290
You must not leave!

346
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,770
You have to let us out!

347
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,960
Once I see Li Mo,

348
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,720
I'll naturally let you go.

349
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,290
What if he never comes?

350
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,790
Do you plan to keep us locked up forever?

351
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,540
Say something!

352
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,480
Heavenly Lord, do you have a way out?

353
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,360
No.

354
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,570
Then what should we do?

355
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,070
Just stay put.

356
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,200
Heavenly Lord, am I holding you back again?

357
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,560
It's fine.

358
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,240
Palm Flame Ignition, go!

359
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,460
Palm Flame Ignition, go!

360
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,380
Thank you, Heavenly Lord.

361
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
How do you know how to play this tune?

362
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,610
Are you a disciple of Jingyun Sect?

363
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,320
How is Mr. Meng doing?

364
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,520
I mean no harm.

365
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,500
I came here secretly because
I have a favor to ask.

366
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:33,190
Senior Meng said you would understand
after reading this letter.

367
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,530
[Xingman, Zhang Suan is my fellow junior disciple. He has always respected me deeply
and has stayed clear of disputes within the sect.]

368
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,680
You want to ascend to the Nine Heavens?

369
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,440
Yes.

370
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,790
Follow me.

371
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,920
Yinlian Mountain is the sacred ground
of our sect.

372
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,240
It's said to have originated at
the dawn of chaos,

373
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,240
connecting heaven and earth,
and can reach even Hell.

374
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,400
The first master of our sect

375
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,440
managed to be successful in his cultivation here

376
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,300
and ascended to the Nine Heavens.

377
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,270
This is the sacred object of our Yinlian Sect,

378
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,730
the Sky-Reaching Ladder.

379
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,400
No matter the aptitude of the cultivator,

380
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,360
climbing this Sky-Reaching Ladder

381
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,160
one is spared from the pain of
refining one's core during ascension to heaven.

382
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,890
They can rise straight above the clouds
and reach the Nine Heavens.

383
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,050
And the price to pay?

384
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,700
If something this good came without a price,

385
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,230
the Nine Heavens would be overcrowded by now.

386
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,160
Worthy of being an elite of Jingyun Sect.

387
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,420
You're indeed clever.

388
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,680
This Sky-Reaching Ladder is an object
that defies the natural order.

389
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,270
It harnesses the energy of heaven
and transforms the waters of earth.

390
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,600
It connects heaven and earth,
transcending all six realms.

391
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,830
However, you are a disciple of the immortal sect,

392
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,790
while this Sky-Reaching Ladder
is our clan's sacred object.

393
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,240
If you wish to achieve what others cannot,

394
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,750
you must endure suffering that others cannot bear.

395
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,350
Fierce winds will temper your body
while raging fires will burn your flesh.

396
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,120
The pain of having your tendons pulled
and bones shattered.

397
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,330
Can you withstand it?

398
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,830
Your spirit will be destroyed
while your heart is shattered.

399
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,270
This is the essence of a fate worse than death.

400
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,540
Are you scared now?

401
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,920
So you do have some guts.

402
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,170
However,

403
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,720
why should I let you pass so easily?

404
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,000
What do you want?

405
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,400
I want you to rescue Mr. Meng for me.

406
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,800
You should know him best.

407
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,020
If he wanted to leave,
he would have done so already.

408
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,950
You people from the Jingyun Sect

409
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,680
are all inflexible fools.

410
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,739
I'm helping you today,

411
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,219
so in the future, you must help me
deliver messages to Mr. Meng.

412
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,030
As long as it doesn't harm Jingyun Sect,

413
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,630
I'm fine.

414
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,510
Of course.

415
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,630
After all, it's Mr. Meng's sect too.

416
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,670
Alright, I promise you.

417
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,550
This is the Heart-Devouring Pill.

418
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,730
I'll only believe you if you take it.

419
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,030
From now on, every month,

420
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,030
you must come to me for the antidote.

421
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,739
Otherwise, the poison will consume
your internal organs.

422
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,370
Can you let me pass now?

423
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,800
Now I'm curious.

424
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,070
Who exactly is this person you'd sacrifice

425
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,610
everything for?

426
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:16,230
Heavenly Lord, did you bring any food?

427
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
What do you think?

428
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,510
Next time, I really need to
start practicing fasting.

429
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,110
If we keep waiting like this,

430
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,240
I'm afraid I'll starve to death first.

431
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,590
Heavenly Lord, chat with me for a while.

432
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,400
Let's divert our attention.

433
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,340
What do you want to talk about?

434
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,450
Between Immortal Lord Li Mo and Honglian...

435
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,710
what exactly happened

436
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,270
for her to be clinging on for centuries?

437
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,950
I don't know.

438
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,400
Aren't you the Master of Immortal Lord Li Mo?

439
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,660
How could you not know?

440
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,360
It was only after I sealed Honglian

441
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,020
that Li Mo became my disciple.

442
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,510
He didn't want to talk about it,

443
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,910
so I didn't probe either.

444
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,760
I thought I might find some clues
from their past

445
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,840
that could help us get out.

446
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,600
Look, Heavenly Lord.

447
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,590
Before you came,

448
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,510
Honglian showed me several scenes from her past

449
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,910
by simply crushing this.

450
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,350
Do you think all of these might be her memories?

451
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,190
Honglian's emotional baggage
is Immortal Lord Li Mo.

452
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,070
If we figure out what happened
between them in the past,

453
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,280
maybe we could find a way out of here?

454
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,420
We can give it a try.

455
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,600
Wait.

456
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,130
What's this?

457
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,740
The Twin Heart Seal.

458
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,100
From now on, wherever you are,

459
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,590
I'll be able to sense you.

460
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,130
Then I'll start.

461
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,710
Liar!

462
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,490
Every single one of them is a liar!

463
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:49,880
Stop!

464
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,480
Were the dozens of recent assault cases

465
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,690
all your doing?

466
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,610
So what if they were?

467
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,050
You are a demon that has
already assumed the human form.

468
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,780
You should focus on cultivation.

469
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,510
How can you practice these
evil and unorthodox techniques

470
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,240
and go as far as hurting people?

471
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,190
What has it got to do with you?

472
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,100
I'm just trying to advise you.

473
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,370
Your actions violate the laws of heaven,

474
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,070
you'll surely face heavenly retribution.

475
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,580
Have you ever tasted
the evil energy of wronged souls

476
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,360
raging through your body?

477
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,590
Have you ever experienced

478
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,410
every inch of your meridians under your skin

479
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:55,630
being torn apart and then healed again?

480
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,690
What do you mean?

481
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,520
I was cursed when I was assuming the human form.

482
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,320
So tell me.

483
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,360
When has the laws of heaven
ever been fair to me?

484
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,030
Looking at it this way,
Honglian seems somewhat pitiful.

485
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,840
All I ever wanted was to find one true heart

486
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,110
to protect me.

487
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,150
But all of this...

488
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,320
turned out to be fake!

489
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:47,030
If that's the case, let me help you.

490
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:11,070
These are indeed all Honglian's memories.

491
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,160
Heavenly Lord, shall we continue?

492
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,400
Continue.

493
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,230
These are all traps set by mortals.

494
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,770
There are so many injured animals.

495
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,280
Can you save them all?

496
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,720
I'll save as many as I can.

497
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,710
I must admit, the cycle of day and night here

498
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,110
takes some getting used to.

499
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,360
Heavenly Lord, don't you feel dizzy?

500
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,340
You came at the right time.

501
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,510
This rabbit is just roasted.

502
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,400
It smells so good. Want to eat together?

503
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,760
Heavenly Lord, I think...

504
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,960
We're in an illusion.

505
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,320
It's all fake.

506
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,360
What's wrong?

507
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,510
Are you angry?

508
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,070
Spiritual energy is abundant here.

509
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,730
If you cultivate here, your evil energy
can be slightly weakened.

510
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:13,550
These can dispel some of the
evil energy in your body.

511
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,550
Take these first.

512
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:20,030
You've made me drink hundreds of bowls
of medicine these days,

513
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,030
but I haven't seen any improvement.

514
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,600
Can you really cure me or not?

515
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,550
The evil energy has been accumulating
in your body for too long.

516
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,760
We can't rush it. We have to take it slow.

517
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,670
Actually...

518
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,120
I know of a method that allows me
to heal even faster.

519
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,110
Why don't...

520
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,920
you love me?

521
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,670
I'll use the blood from your heart...

522
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,610
to break the curse.

523
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,510
I'm sorry,

524
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,690
I practice cultivation solely to
save and help others.

525
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,690
I have no interest in romantic love.

526
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,570
Heavenly Lord.

527
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,300
Do you really think Immortal Lord Li Mo
would remain unmoved?

528
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,070
Do you always talk this much?
