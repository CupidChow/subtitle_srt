1
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,920
[FEUD]

2
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,979
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,140
You three should set off as well.

4
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,590
Yes.

5
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,150
Yes.

6
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,070
Wait!

7
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,590
I'd like to go
to Yinlian Sect with them.

8
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,000
Junior, you don't need…

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,790
Sect Leader,
you know I'm skilled in medicine.

10
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,200
Yinlian Sect
is shrouded in poisonous miasma.

11
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,990
If I go along,

12
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,330
I can help prevent unexpected injuries.

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,520
I don't have time

14
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,190
to listen to you argue about who's going.

15
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,320
When are we leaving?

16
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,420
Come with us.

17
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,250
This is Bai Jiusi's sword.

18
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,510
I'm entrusting it to you now.

19
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Only when Zhuri and Qiyue are combined

20
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,140
can the Infinite Stele be broken.

21
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,360
You and I will each keep one sword

22
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,220
to prevent Xiao
from obtaining both of them at once.

23
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Bai Jiusi's safety

24
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,530
is bound to
the barrier of the Infinite Stele.

25
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,730
I'll take him with me.

26
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,530
Be careful in the sect.

27
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,150
Yes, Master.

28
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,750
If you need anything,

29
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,330
just send word.

30
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,110
Wait a moment.

31
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,430
I've heard about what happened to Master.

32
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,560
I want to go with you.

33
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,210
If you refuse,

34
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,840
I'll follow you secretly.

35
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,730
You...

36
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,820
And me, Divine Lord.

37
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,600
You know I'm best at artifact forging.

38
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,630
Even without spiritual energy,

39
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,030
I can help you find

40
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,090
the soul-trapping artifact faster.

41
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,930
Alright.

42
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,610
Let's go.

43
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,120
Get lost!

44
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,860
So I couldn't avoid it after all.

45
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,930
You're a spiritual beast.

46
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,330
Your perception is keen.

47
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,250
You must've sensed that

48
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,640
a great disaster is coming.

49
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,540
Greetings, Grandmaster.

50
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,220
Greetings, Grandmaster.

51
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,600
Greetings, Grandmaster.

52
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,400
Grandmaster.

53
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,310
Grandmaster.

54
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,270
-Grandmaster.
-Greetings, Grandmaster.

55
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,000
You're here.

56
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,620
Where is Senior Zi Yang?

57
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,750
He's attending to other matters.

58
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,280
What's the situation here?

59
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,630
These people fell into a deep sleep
at the exact same time.

60
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,920
I've tried every
soul-calling spell and pill I know,

61
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,360
but none of them worked.

62
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,870
Nothing helps.

63
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,920
If this goes on another day,

64
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,070
they might…

65
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,810
Ling'er,

66
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,330
have you found anything?

67
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,800
Even if Xiao Jingshan is a genius
at forging soul-trapping artifacts,

68
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,870
making one

69
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,220
that could trap
so many souls in such a short time

70
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,880
should be nearly impossible.

71
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,430
He must've prepared it in advance.

72
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,040
Zhang Suan,

73
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,070
use your spiritual energy
to scan this area.

74
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,090
If the artifact is nearby,

75
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,620
it'll respond to your call.

76
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,160
Alright.

77
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,880
Dear.

78
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,050
I'm here.

79
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,610
I'll protect you.

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,750
Guys,

81
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,190
long time no see.

82
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,730
My dear disciple,

83
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,260
you tried to kill me on sight.

84
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,980
That doesn't seem right.

85
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,110
Who do you think you are?

86
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,220
You don't deserve to be my master.

87
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,070
Forget it.

88
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,370
You're just a young boy.

89
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,430
I'll let it slide.

90
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,200
Zhang Suan.

91
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,380
That's his illusory clone.

92
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,930
Attacking him is useless.

93
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,960
The dignified Heavenly Lord Dacheng

94
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,690
has been reduced to this state.

95
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,890
He'd be better off dead.

96
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,260
Xiao Jingshan,

97
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,000
you practiced dark magic
and used demonic artifacts.

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,630
In the end, it'll consume you.

99
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,950
Even with an immortal body,

100
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,480
you won't last much longer.

101
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,290
I'm not seeking immortality.

102
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,570
As long as I fulfill my wish
before I die, that's enough.

103
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,970
What is it you truly want?

104
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,940
I don't want you to waste your time.

105
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,700
So I'll kindly give you a hint.

106
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,810
I took the souls of these people.

107
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,690
The Joy Stele that traps them

108
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,230
is at the foot
of the mountain three miles away.

109
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,190
Joy Stele?

110
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:02,870
Yes.

111
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,780
You guessed right.

112
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,630
It's similar
to the Great Wilderness Stele.

113
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,560
As for why I named it that,

114
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,000
you'll understand when you get there.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,800
Grandmaster,

116
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,230
he clearly has ill intentions.

117
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,750
You must not fall into his trap!

118
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,650
Indeed.

119
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,360
I have set a trap.

120
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,450
Whether you walk into it or not,

121
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,110
it's on you.

122
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,420
Xiao Jingshan,

123
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,790
I've seen the illusion you created
with the Great Wilderness Stele.

124
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,190
I've learned
what happened to your family.

125
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,950
The Lei Bird
wreaked havoc on the world.

126
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,270
When Yuan Chenghua tried to slay it,

127
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,040
your family was caught in the crossfire.

128
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,640
I understand
why you hold a grudge against him,

129
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,330
but he's already perished.

130
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,300
Even if you destroy the Infinite Stele,

131
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,760
it won't change anything.

132
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,620
Easy for you to say.

133
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,360
It was Yuan Chenghua's sword strike

134
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,690
that caused the fire in my home.

135
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,680
And yet his name
is carved on the Infinite Stele,

136
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,080
worshipped by the world.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,720
He was such an evil man,

138
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
yet both the government and Empyrean

139
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,520
turned a blind eye to what he did.

140
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,270
So I have to
take matters into my own hands.

141
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,130
Empyrean didn't turn a blind eye.

142
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,110
After subduing the Lei Bird, Yuan Chenghua

143
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,600
accepted 50 years of heavenly punishment.

144
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,000
Then, to protect the Three Realms,

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,190
he died in the war against demons.

146
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,040
That's why his name

147
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,870
-is on the Infinite Stele.
-So what?

148
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,560
My family

149
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,830
and my closest friend—

150
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,070
five lives in total.

151
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,160
All I want

152
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,040
is to erase a single name.

153
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,000
Yet for that,
I was imprisoned for 500 years!

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,240
During that time,

155
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,580
I saw through everything.

156
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,780
That's why I turned to the demonic path.

157
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,560
The way of heaven is merciless.

158
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,559
I can't change it.

159
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,210
So I'll destroy it.

160
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,960
So you'll destroy

161
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,350
the Infinite Stele at all costs?

162
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,040
Divine Lord Siling,

163
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,370
think about the people around you.

164
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,870
After all, I've spent centuries

165
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,080
watching you and Bai Jiusi.

166
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,650
I know every one

167
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,190
of your weaknesses.

168
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:58,870
Dear.

169
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,680
What you see as a weakness

170
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,440
can become our strength.

171
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,300
Then let's wait and see.

172
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,900
Are you afraid?

173
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,250
Someone's coming.

174
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,970
We'll soon find out

175
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,350
which of us should be afraid.

176
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,050
Be careful.

177
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:27,800
Xingman.

178
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,070
What's wrong?

179
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,360
This forest is usually

180
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,220
guarded by disciples of our sect.

181
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,130
But all the way here,

182
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,680
I didn't see a single soul.

183
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,320
All the more reason

184
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,390
to be extra cautious.

185
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
Watch out!

186
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,090
What was that?

187
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,080
The snake vines we raised

188
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,680
to ward off intruders.

189
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,130
Normally, they won't attack

190
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,080
unless provoked.

191
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,380
It seems

192
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,390
someone has already prepared

193
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,440
for our arrival.

194
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,640
Everyone, be extra careful.

195
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,640
Yes, Master.

196
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,170
Will my mother be alright?

197
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,090
Xingman,

198
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,170
don't worry.

199
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,140
We'll get your mother out safely.

200
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,030
For now, it's all

201
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,350
just our speculation.

202
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,480
The situation might not be

203
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,920
as bad as we imagine.

204
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,530
Don't panic yet.

205
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,150
Let's go.

206
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,030
Kiddo,

207
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,210
which path should we take?

208
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,120
I don't know.

209
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,890
You don't know the way to Yinlian Sect?

210
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,790
It wasn't like this before.

211
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,150
These two paths

212
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,320
shift every so often.

213
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,390
The path with mist,

214
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,630
as long as you don't use spiritual energy,

215
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,230
you can pass through safely.

216
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,870
The path without mist

217
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,400
leads to a poisonous swamp—

218
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,870
danger at every turn.

219
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,240
I don't know why

220
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,640
both paths are misty now.

221
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,270
Looks like we'll have to

222
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,660
test them ourselves.

223
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,730
I'll go first.

224
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,090
You're my disciple.

225
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,750
How can I let you
venture into the unknown?

226
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,440
But Master...

227
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,570
You bring up the rear

228
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,040
and take care of them.

229
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,960
Yes.

230
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,000
What's going on?

231
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,360
Where is Long Yuan?

232
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,420
I'm not sure.

233
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,160
Someone broke the seal of the Hell Ruins.

234
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,180
All the sealed demonic beasts inside
have escaped.

235
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,610
Long Yuan is guarding Canglei Palace.

236
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,810
He sent me to watch over
the Infinite Stele at Tianmu Peak.

237
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,030
The Stele is protected by a barrier

238
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,690
His Lordship placed long ago.

239
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,390
As long as he's unharmed,

240
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,510
no one can touch it.

241
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,850
That may be true,

242
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,980
but with Master's condition lately,

243
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,860
accidents could still happen.

244
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,270
We'd best stay cautious.

245
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,970
You two keep watch here.

246
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,780
I'll go find Long Yuan.

247
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:23,930
Alright.

248
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,520
Grandmaster.

249
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,100
Are you really going?

250
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,260
Xiao Jingshan took hundreds of souls

251
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,470
just to lure me there.

252
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,080
I won't let so many innocent people

253
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,280
suffer because of me.

254
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,510
But if you take him with you…

255
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,130
As long as he's safe,

256
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,440
the barrier
of the Infinite Stele stays intact.

257
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,970
To prevent Xiao Jingshan
from targeting him,

258
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,600
I have to keep him close.

259
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,400
I know artifact forging.

260
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,910
To break that Joy Stele
Xiao Jingshan mentioned,

261
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,770
you'll need me.

262
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,720
Master Dan Yang,

263
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,060
my power came from Xiao Jingshan.

264
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,460
I can control the artifacts he created.

265
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,200
It seems

266
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,530
I'm the only useless one here, huh?

267
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,160
Useless.

268
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,270
You stay here
to watch over these unconscious people.

269
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,180
Protect them.

270
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,440
Wait until I bring their souls back.

271
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,840
Yes, Grandmaster.

272
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,320
Let's go.

273
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,010
Let's go.

274
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,080
So beautiful.

275
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,600
Xiao Jingshan is after something,

276
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,040
so he probably didn't lie.

277
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,300
Have you found any trace of the Joy Stele?

278
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,500
My spiritual energy is reacting.

279
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,470
Something's off here.

280
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,430
This must be the entrance.

281
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,040
Bai Jiusi.

282
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,490
Dear.

283
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,290
Let's go take a look.

284
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,840
Look at this. It's so sturdy.

285
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,600
-It looks good.
-Take it home and enjoy.

286
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,400
Alright then.

287
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,420
What is this place?

288
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,870
I really love it.

289
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,930
Look at my flowers.

290
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,600
Where are my flowers?

291
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,440
Busy, huh?

292
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,040
-You're early today.
-Yeah.

293
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
It looks great.

294
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,440
Of course.

295
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,120
Hurry up!

296
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,670
You're even slower than me.

297
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,540
Why are you walking so slowly?

298
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,390
For small deals like this,

299
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,850
make decisions yourself.

300
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,090
Sister.

301
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,660
How do you like this color?

302
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,030
It's really beautiful.

303
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,020
I want one too.

304
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,750
Wrap it up for me.

305
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,310
Okay.

306
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,790
Heavenly Lord is here!

307
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,050
Heavenly Lord is here!

308
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,720
-Heavenly Lord is here.
-Let's go.

309
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,369
Hurry!

310
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,160
Heavenly Lord is here! Hurry!

311
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,470
He's here, he's here!

312
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,680
-Hurry.
-Heavenly Lord is here. Hurry.

313
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:41,160
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

314
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,320
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

315
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,000
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

316
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,240
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

317
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,070
Divine Lord.

318
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,110
Why aren't you kneeling to Heavenly Lord?

319
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,780
You'll be punished!

320
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,590
Yes!

321
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,000
Why aren't you kneeling?

322
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,940
Kneel down now!

323
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,290
Kneel! Kneel!

324
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,330
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

325
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,840
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

326
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,530
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

327
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,090
Greetings, Heavenly Lord.

328
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,690
It's alright.

329
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,900
So?

330
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,980
What do you think of the name

331
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,300
"Joy Stele"?

332
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,030
Sect Leader,

333
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,760
Senior,

334
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,790
these are detoxifying pills.

335
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,590
Just in case,

336
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,070
you'd better take one now.

337
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,340
You should take one too.

338
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,240
I'm not taking your pills.

339
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,970
Who knows what they really are?

340
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,510
I grew up here.

341
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,920
I can handle the poison.

342
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,480
Alright then.

343
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,080
Let's go.

344
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,260
Watch out!

345
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,500
You must not use spiritual energy.

346
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,000
The mist here suppresses it.

347
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
If you use any,
you'll suffer a serious backlash.

348
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,330
Then come up with something!

349
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,000
I...

350
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,040
Xingman!

351
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,650
Senior!

352
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,460
Xingman, what are you doing?

353
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,320
I don't know if it'll work,
but let me try it.

354
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,280
Watch out!

355
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,190
My mother once fed
these snake vines with her blood.

356
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,050
As expected,
they still recognize our blood.

357
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,610
Let's go.

358
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,480
Lucky you.

359
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,060
Focus your mind.

360
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:00,970
Don't listen.

361
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,380
Something's wrong with that ringing.

362
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,920
Senior!

363
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,160
Where's my mother?

364
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,960
Don't go over.

365
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,090
Look at their eyes.

366
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Senior, look at me.

367
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,030
I'm Xingman!

368
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,730
Don't hurt him! He's my senior!

369
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:40,970
Senior!

370
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,440
Qu Xingman.

371
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,560
You won't let us kill them.

372
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,240
So are we supposed
to wait for them to kill us?

373
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,150
Master.

374
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,050
Stop using your spiritual energy!

375
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,590
Unbind the heart. Free the spirit.

376
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,370
Break!

377
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,350
Sect Leader.

378
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,820
Master!

379
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,260
Master!

380
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,860
Master!

381
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,290
Mr. Meng.

382
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,260
Don't worry.

383
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,440
I'll definitely help you find him.

384
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,960
My master's Canglei Palace

385
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,620
is no place for you to run wild!

386
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,830
Senior.

387
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,600
Senior.

388
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,750
Save your spiritual energy.

389
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,810
I don't need it yet.

390
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,520
Senior,

391
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,290
these beasts
have been locked up for centuries.

392
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,420
I'm afraid we're not

393
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,730
strong enough to…

394
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,090
I've sent Puyuan to spread the word.

395
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,820
We'll hold out as long as we can.

396
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,290
We can't let these demonic beasts escape.

397
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,750
Nor can we let them
destroy Master's palace.

398
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,770
[Everlasting Grace and Legacy]

399
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,230
[Prosperity]

400
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:02,840
How is it?

401
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,660
Is it good or bad?

402
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,370
I wanna play too! I wanna play!

403
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,310
Weren't you trying to divine

404
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,310
whether the team going after

405
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,030
Xiao Jingshan would succeed or not?

406
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,380
What's the result?

407
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,360
This is a bad sign.

408
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,630
All three throws were bad.

409
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,480
Are you saying

410
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,550
those who left the sect
to deal with Xiao Jingshan

411
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,550
are all in danger?

412
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,900
That won't do.

413
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,800
We can't let anything happen
to His Lordship or Her Ladyship.

414
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,630
Should we go help them?

415
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,480
Do they know you snatched their souls

416
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,770
and brought them here?

417
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,680
Snatched?

418
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,310
Don't make it sound so ugly.

419
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,720
They're living the lives they want

420
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,250
and are all grateful to me.

421
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,960
You built a fake world

422
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,410
and crowned yourself its fake god.

423
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,640
Is this what you want?

424
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,300
I don't care about any of this.

425
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,340
I went through all this trouble

426
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,550
for you.

427
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,480
For me?

428
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
I want to show you

429
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,640
what it means to win people's hearts

430
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,350
and what a flawless,
ideal world actually looks like.

431
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,750
It's not that self-righteous

432
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,310
redemption you cling to.

433
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,850
You're deceiving people with lies.

434
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,980
Who are you people?

435
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,240
How dare you speak
to Heavenly Lord like that?

436
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,890
Yeah.

437
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,020
Heavenly Lord is so good to us!

438
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,910
Exactly! Without him,

439
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,510
how could my legs have healed?

440
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,510
Stop slandering Heavenly Lord!

441
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,960
He gave me wealth

442
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,430
so I have shelter from the wind and rain

443
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,960
and don't have to
beg on the streets anymore.

444
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,550
How dare you slander Heavenly Lord!

445
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,270
-Who are you to slander him?
-Yeah, who are you?

446
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,590
Heavenly Lord is so good to us!

447
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,790
Who gave you the right to slander him?

448
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,160
You don't have spiritual energy now.

449
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,420
Don't act recklessly.

450
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,440
You're the ones telling lies!

451
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,300
Xiao Jingshan,

452
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,220
what is it you're really trying to do?

453
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,890
The way of heaven is merciless.

454
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,070
Whether mortal or immortal,

455
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,190
most people are selfish.

456
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,650
This is just a small experiment

457
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,370
to make the world

458
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,130
as flawless as a dream.

459
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,170
Isn't that good?

460
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,400
Siling,

461
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,480
you know the world is full of flaws.

462
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,920
Why don't you
have the courage to tear it all down

463
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,680
and rebuild

464
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,310
a new order

465
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,080
that pleases everyone?

466
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,570
You know very well that

467
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,920
we're on different paths,

468
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,920
but we long for the same ideal world.

469
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,490
You make it sound so easy.

470
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,160
How do you rebuild it?

471
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,680
With your power alone?

472
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,720
Of course not.

473
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,770
Everything,
once it reaches a certain point,

474
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,840
faces a destructive calamity.

475
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
It's destruction by heaven's will.

476
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,340
We can only accept it and let it happen.

477
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,120
Only destruction

478
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,560
is the beginning of rebirth.

479
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,770
So that's your real reason
for destroying the Infinite Stele?

480
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Stop trying to get answers out of me.

481
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,970
I'll give you one last chance.

482
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Will you join me?

483
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,640
If you say yes,

484
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,830
I'll spare the lives

485
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,830
of those around you

486
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,550
and your sect.

487
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,060
Xiao Jingshan,

488
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,180
you've started deceiving yourself too.

489
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,830
If your words alone could sway me,

490
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
why did you waste centuries in the shadows

491
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,590
trying to turn Bai Jiusi and me

492
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,720
against each other?

493
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
My disciples don't need your mercy.

494
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,010
They can protect themselves.

495
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,270
Everyone,

496
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,640
someone here
is challenging your Heavenly Lord.

497
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,640
Someone doesn't want you
to keep enjoying your lives.

498
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,860
What should you do?

499
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,790
They're trying to hurt us!

500
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,240
We have to fight back!

501
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,270
Yes, yes, yes.

502
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,070
That's right.

503
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,790
They slandered our Heavenly Lord.

504
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,920
They must be evil spirits!

505
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,880
Eliminate the evil spirits!

506
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,200
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

507
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,240
Siling,

508
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,050
you claim to be righteous.

509
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,590
I'd like to see

510
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,070
if you'll still
have compassion for the greedy

511
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,200
and the heartless.

512
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,380
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

513
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:17,890
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

514
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,660
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

515
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:27,510
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

516
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,590
Dabao, Xiaobao,

517
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,680
what are you doing?

518
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,160
Mr. Meng,

519
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,000
be careful not
to touch their blood or fangs.

520
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,480
They contain deadly poison
that kills on contact.

521
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,610
Even cultivators can't withstand it.

522
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,350
No wonder people call your sect
a demonic sect.

523
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,070
Your Yinlian Sect

524
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,560
is full of lethal things.

525
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,520
-Are you alright?
-Xiaobao.

526
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,270
Xingman.

527
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,740
You scoundrel!

528
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,070
Who allowed you
to sit in my mother's seat?

529
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,640
It was you who controlled those disciples

530
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,840
and vipers to kill us.

531
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,920
The Yinlian Sect Leader and my master,

532
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,180
are they in your hands?

533
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,790
Master.

534
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,540
Sect Leader.

535
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,950
Mother! Mother!

536
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,110
Mother!

537
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,380
What have you done to them?

538
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,220
Nothing much.

539
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,240
I just made them obedient.

540
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm simply

541
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,830
giving you all a chance,

542
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,570
a chance

543
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,350
to walk out of here alive.

544
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,890
Silly girl,

545
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,000
you really think I'd let my real body

546
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
show up here?

547
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,740
Xiao Jingshan,

548
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,800
what exactly do you want to do?

549
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,500
I'm giving you two choices.

550
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,500
The Jingyun Sect Leader
or the Yinlian Sect Leader,

551
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,720
which one do you want to live,

552
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,440
and which to die?

553
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,270
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

554
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,470
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

555
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,620
Hand over the food!

556
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,030
Food!

557
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,400
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

558
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,120
Burn her! Burn her! Burn her!

559
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,310
Burn her! Burn her! Burn her!

560
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,740
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

561
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,010
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

562
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,920
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

563
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,550
Qingyue!

564
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,400
Get out of here!

565
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,360
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

566
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,660
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

567
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,040
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

568
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,310
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

569
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,390
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

570
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,610
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

571
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,120
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

572
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:29,480
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

573
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,790
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

574
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,210
Are you alright, dear?

575
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:41,160
Eliminate the evil spirits!
Eliminate the evil spirits!

576
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,910
Let's go.

577
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,370
Where are they?

578
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,370
Where did they go?

579
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,180
Xingman!

580
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,270
-Master.
-Mother.

581
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,760
Sect Leader.

582
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,750
It's simple.

583
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,110
The Jingyun Sect Leader
treats you like a father.

584
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,320
And the Yinlian Sect Leader

585
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,110
is your beloved's mother.

586
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,690
I want to see who you'll choose.

587
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,750
If the three of you give the same answer,

588
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,110
that person lives.

589
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,150
If not, they die.

590
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,159
Why should we listen to you?

591
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,760
Stop! Stop it right now!

592
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,380
Don't worry.

593
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,960
I keep my word.

594
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,550
If I say one will walk free,
one walks free.

595
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,910
You can't kill me,

596
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,530
but I can kill them.

597
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,760
If you don't believe me,
go ahead and try.

598
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,800
No need.

599
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,030
Mother.

600
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,020
Stop crying!

601
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,990
Dry those tears.

602
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,130
Don't embarrass me
in front of so many people.

603
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,710
It's just death.

604
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,620
I'm not afraid!

605
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,760
Mother,

606
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,590
I don't want you to die.

607
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,280
Meng Chu.

608
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,830
I was careless

609
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,550
and fell into his trap.

610
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,020
Promise me

611
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,090
to take good care of them

612
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,210
from now on.

613
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,220
No.

614
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,970
Sect Leader.

615
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Stubborn old man.

616
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:50,260
Why do you get to
be the good guy every time?

617
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,370
I'm not afraid of death either, okay?

618
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,700
Well?

619
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,880
Who are you going to choose?

620
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,800
If you don't pick,

621
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,480
both of them have to die.

622
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,030
If no one wants to be the villain,

623
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,060
then I will.

624
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,180
I choose our Sect Leader.

625
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,480
Suguan!

626
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,330
Sect Leader, you can punish me

627
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,810
however you want later.

628
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,430
I just don't want anything
to happen to you.

629
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,250
What about you two?

630
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,760
Meng Chu.

631
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,330
Pick up your sword.

632
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,440
I don't want to die
at the hands of this scumbag.

633
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,480
You despicable coward,

634
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,560
you can't beat us,

635
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,850
so you resort to such dirty tricks.

636
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,670
We of Jingyun Sect

637
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,260
won't be manipulated by you.

638
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,430
Master.

639
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,500
Meng Chu.

640
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,440
Remember what I told you.

641
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,630
Master, no!

642
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,480
-Sect Leader!
-Master!

643
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,880
Fighting's so much fun.

644
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,540
Why didn't anyone invite me?

645
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,720
Exactly.

646
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,320
We heard the noise

647
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,930
and rushed over ourselves.

648
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,760
It's my first time seeing demonic beasts.

649
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,050
Interesting.

650
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,780
Where are they?

651
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,330
Senior.

652
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,320
All Four Venerables said
they were too busy.

653
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,580
What a waste of effort.

654
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,000
I knew we couldn't count on them.

655
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,930
Even a few rocks can be more useful.

656
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,680
Who are you talking about?

657
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,240
-Senior!
-Senior!

658
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:56,570
Senior.

659
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,620
It's just an arm.

660
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,400
Not a big deal.

661
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,600
I'll cover you.

662
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:10,740
You leave first.

663
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,150
You can't be of much help here anyway.

664
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,300
I can help.

665
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,590
Cut the crap!

666
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,290
I said leave, so leave.

667
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,790
Go find Master.

668
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,490
He needs at least
one of his men by his side.

669
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,460
Senior.

670
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,250
No.

671
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,220
Senior!

672
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:47,810
Senior!

673
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,040
Let me in!

674
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,630
Senior!

675
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,090
Are you afraid?

676
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,630
-No!
-No!

677
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,510
-No!
-No!

678
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,740
The wounds they inflict

679
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,770
feel like

680
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,230
nothing more than ant bites to me.

681
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,320
That's right.

682
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,190
To me,

683
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,710
they're more like mosquito stings.

684
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,970
We just got here.

685
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,130
We haven't even had our fun yet!

686
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:20,730
Alright then.

687
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,910
Let's fight them to the bitter end!

688
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,280
We can't let them

689
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,410
look down on Master's Canglei Palace!

690
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,230
Honglian.

691
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,090
Look.

692
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,720
I've just taken human form,

693
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,520
and I'm already
in the middle of something big.

694
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,630
I share the same origin as Long Yuan.

695
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,560
I can't break the barrier he set up.

696
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,920
Can you?

697
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,970
You need to ask?

698
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,520
I've lived for nearly 1,000 years.

699
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,570
This kind of barrier is nothing to me.

700
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,990
Then can you help me get in?

701
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,760
Long Yuan is badly hurt.

702
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,690
He won't last much longer.

703
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,110
Sure.

704
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,040
But first…

705
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,840
give me a kiss.

706
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,910
Then I'll take you in.

707
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,220
I'm just kidding.

708
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,170
The water of the Jade Pool

709
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,100
is too clean.

710
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,190
Right now, I don't have

711
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,320
a single messy thought in my head.

712
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:40,710
Come on.

713
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,270
Let's go help that senior of yours
who once tried to kill me.

714
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,740
Let's just say I'm returning your favor.

715
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,880
Thank you.
