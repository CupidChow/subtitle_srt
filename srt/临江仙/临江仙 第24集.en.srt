This woman is a sorceress of dark arts.

all our suffering!

Everything in this world
follows the laws of nature.

40
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,560
Can't believe there's such
a heaven-defying formation.

41
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,510
That wandering immortal said

42
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,430
he stumbled upon the book.

43
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,290
The book records various divine artifacts.

44
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,450
After witnessing
the Hanlin Dagger's power,

45
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,120
I pinned all my hopes on this formation.

46
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,630
Does the Heavenly Lord Dacheng
know about this?

47
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,950
He only cares about the way of heaven.

48
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,080
What I'm doing defies that very order.

49
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,840
If he knew,
he'd definitely try to stop me.

50
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,070
So once I regained my spiritual energy,

51
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,930
I pretended to make peace with him

52
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,560
and used the Heaven-Turning Seal
to trap him,

53
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,160
ensuring he wouldn't interfere
with my plans.

Divine Lord Siling sure is lucky.

100
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,360
Three hundred years ago,

101
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,390
she turned the Nine Heavens upside down,

102
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,160
causing chaos everywhere.

103
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,960
Back then, I was immersed in cultivation,

104
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,670
wandering across the lands,

105
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,130
far from the Nine Heavens.

106
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,130
Otherwise, how could I have possibly
let her run wild like that?

107
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,630
At that time, I was painting
The Twin Realms of Mountains and Rivers.

108
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,440
That painting captured all of nature
and the world's spiritual energy in one.

109
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,580
It was incredibly taxing.

110
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,760
It took me over a decade
to complete that painting.

111
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,720
By the time I came out of seclusion,

112
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,850
Siling had already been slain
by Heavenly Lord Dacheng,

113
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
and her primordial spirit had fled
to the mortal realm.

114
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,790
Had I been there,
I would've wiped her out completely.

115
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,790
Things would never have become
such a mess.

116
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,120
I was indeed in the Nine Heavens.

117
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,120
But Siling was
Heavenly Lord Dacheng's spiritual partner.

118
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,440
In the end, it was a matter
between the couple.

119
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,700
How could I interfere?

120
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,780
It seems that no matter
how powerful a god may be,

121
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,750
once they're entangled in love,
they lose all reason.

122
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,240
Lieyang, what were you doing back then?

123
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,510
It's a pity.

124
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,480
I was in seclusion at that time.

125
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,000
By the time I came out,

126
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,240
Heavenly Lord Dacheng had already

127
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,000
destroyed Siling's body.

128
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,400
I never got the chance to step in.

129
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,870
That incident is the reason

130
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,120
I haven't set foot in Canglei Palace
for the past 300 years.

131
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,600
After all, it was Bai Jiusi
who acted recklessly,

132
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,120
wasn't it?

133
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,670
How could he go ahead with
something that big without waiting for us?

134
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,870
He let that menace get away for nothing.

135
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,550
The Four Venerables are truly remarkable.

136
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,630
Not a single one showed up
when we needed them.

137
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,200
But now that Canglei Palace
has taken action,

138
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,240
suddenly they're all here.

139
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,900
As long as no one says it out loud,
we can still pretend to be allies.

140
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,510
Tomorrow, we'll descend
to the mortal realm to slay Siling.

141
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,910
I hope the Four Venerables
won't come up with another excuse.

142
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,360
Of course.

143
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,750
Of course.

144
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,360
Why are you staring at me?

Next, I need you
to keep an eye on Zhang Suan.

146

Are you going to look for
the Divine Lord again?

147
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,829
I told you,
she already has someone in her heart.

148

You don't stand a chance.

149
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,160
That's my business.

150
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,390
It has nothing to do with you.

151
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
Of course it does.

152
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,859
Did you steal my jade pendant?

153
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,880
Have some manners.

154
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,849
Isn't your jade pendant
hanging right there on your waist?

155
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,310
Do you remember

156
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,040
when you got this jade pendant?

157
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
I don't remember.

158
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,310
It's always been on me
for as long as I can remember.

159
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,370
My family said it's my protective charm.

160
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,240
Then it must be you.

I once asked Lord Yu Ya
who oversees the Book of Fate.

163
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,710
She said the one who holds
the other half of my jade pendant

00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,080
is my destined partner.

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,610
That guy can help me
survive my love tribulation.

166

Then go find someone else
to survive it with.

167
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,910
You're really just throwing away
something you've had since childhood?

168
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,830
Yes, I don't want it anymore.

169
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,330
What did you do to me?

170
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,230
This is my Thread of Destiny.

171
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,260
I just casted a spell
to make it visible to you.

172
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,310
Don't mess around with me.

173
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,510
Get rid of it quickly.

174
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,210
How can I possibly break it?

175
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,750
It's a union decreed by the heavens,

176
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,930
not something I can just undo on a whim.

177
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,160
Nonsense.

178
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,260
I'm telling the truth.

179
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,160
How's it going?

180
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,680
Master, the wheel's stuck.

181
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,410
The horse can't pull it out.

182
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,680
Then get more people to help pull.

183
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,210
Exactly.

184
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,000
Listen,

185
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,060
we must reach the Jingyun Sect today.

186
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,880
If we don't,
something terrible will happen.

187
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,400
Master,

188
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,880
it's pitch black out here
in the middle of nowhere.

189
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,160
Where am I supposed
to find anyone to help?

190
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,290
Aren't you a person?

191
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,960
Aren't you a person?

192
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,960
Stop standing there spouting sarcasm!

193
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,160
Hurry up and help him lift!

194
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,640
Go!

195
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,170
Bian is still at the Jingyun Sect.

196
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,010
He's just a child.

197
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,270
If anything happens to him,

198
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,640
I don't want to live anymore.

199
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,400
I shouldn't have sent him there
in the first place.

200
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,110
Master, the young master
is already 23 this year.

201
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,200
He's already come of age,

202
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,160
not a child anymore.

203
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,560
Why are you so talkative?

204
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,920
Put some effort into it!

205
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,590
Do you need any help?

206
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,940
Is it a person or a ghost?

207
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,080
I don't know.

208
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,790
Um, who was just speaking?

209
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,720
Me.

210
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,030
What did you say?

211
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,490
I asked if you needed help.

212
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,810
Of course we need help.

213
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,440
Do you live nearby?

214
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,970
Do you have any father
or brothers at home?

215
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,170
We don't live nearby.

216
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,440
And we don't have any father or brothers.

217
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,030
Well, then do you have...

218
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,000
any strong sisters?

219
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,680
Aunts or grandmas work too.

220
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,030
As long as someone can help me
pull the cart out,

221
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,240
I'll offer a generous reward—

222
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,040
candied haws.

223
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,030
No need to go to such trouble.

224
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,160
I can do it by myself.

225
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,030
By yourself?

226
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,310
Does your sister

227
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,640
brag like this at home too?

228
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,070
This isn't the time for jokes.

229
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,270
I'm really in a hurry.

230
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Watch me.

231
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,240
What a big hole!

232
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,270
I really didn't expect that.

233
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,780
Miss, you're so strong!

234
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,880
Thank you for your help.

235
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,140
No need to be so polite.

236
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,960
Are you also going to the Jingyun Sect?

237
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,480
That's great!
I'm also going to the Jingyun Sect.

238
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,880
Do you know the way there?

239
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,200
I want to go too!

240
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,010
-Let's go together—
-Master!

241
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,350
Master, the wheel is broken.

242
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,440
We can't move now.

243
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,240
We need to fix it before we can go.

244
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,350
What are you good for?

245
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,350
Hurry up and fix it!

246
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,880
Alright.

247
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,780
Gosh, everything's going wrong.

248
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,160
How about this, Miss?

249
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,000
After I fix the cart,

250
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,640
I'll take you both to the Jingyun Sect.

251
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,350
How's that?

252
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,720
That's too much trouble.

253
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,400
How about this? I'll fly you there.

254
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,440
Just point me in the right direction.

255
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,070
Fly?

256
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,480
Master, are we still fixing the cart?

257
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,830
Magic is banned here.

258
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,140
We can't fly anymore.

259
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
Let's walk there.

260
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,550
Glad to hear that.

261
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,210
Is there still no way
to wake up the Heavenly Lord?

262
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,900
His primordial spirit hasn't returned.

263
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,970
Naturally, he can't be awakened.

264
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Dawn is breaking.

265
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,110
If the Heavenly Lord doesn't wake up soon,

266
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,960
no one will be able to stop

267
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,590
Long Yuan from descending
and going on a killing spree.

268
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,000
Master's primordial spirit
doesn't seem to have been taken;

269
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,640
it feels more like...

270
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,290
he doesn't want to wake up.

271
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,270
My Lord,

272
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,400
please wake up.

273
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,240
If you don't wake up,

274
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,440
Lady Qingyue will be in trouble.

275
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,400
Greetings, Grandmaster.

276
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,170
Where are the Four Venerables?

277
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,310
We've sent people
to invite them several times.

278
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,770
They keep saying
they're coming right away.

279
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,450
We won't wait for them anymore.

280
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,720
Let's descend and face the battle.

281
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,110
Master.

282
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,880
Master.

283
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,670
Master, you're alright now.

284
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,360
Withdraw the troops.

285
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,920
Go back.

286
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,790
Master, Siling—

287
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,000
Listen up, all of you!

288
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,920
From this moment on,
if anyone from Canglei Palace

289
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,850
dares lay a hand on
a member of the Jingyun Sect again,

290
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,270
their immortal bones will be stripped,

291
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,920
and they'll be expelled
from Canglei Palace.

292
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,650
Understood.

293
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,350
Are we still fighting or not?

294
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,920
Yeah, why's it gone all quiet now?

295
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,240
Master, it seems something's happened
at Canglei Palace.

296
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,610
-My Lady!
-Li Qingyue!

297
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:36,920
My Lady.

298
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,030
I've finally found you, My Lady.

299
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,920
Li Qingyue!

300
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,480
Father?

301
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,590
Bian.

302
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,790
Father!

303
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,880
Bian.

304
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,720
Father!

305
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,440
My Lady!

306
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,240
I've finally found you.

307
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,960
Li Qingyue!

308
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,550
My Lady!

309
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,350
My Lady.

310
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,030
My Lady.

311
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,070
Li Qingyue, I'm so hungry.

312
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,240
Make me some food quickly.

313
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,170
Don't you dare touch Her Ladyship.

314
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,840
It seems the battle won't happen today.

315
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,960
Everyone, go back to your cultivation.

316
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,420
Don't let your guard down.

317
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,270
Yes, Grandmaster.

318
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,640
Bai Jiusi's primordial spirit
has left his body again?

319
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,160
Yes.

320
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,740
I knew it wasn't your doing.

321
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,550
But that Immortal Lord Long Yuan

322
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,930
insisted it was.

323
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,270
Not only did he mobilize
the forces of Danxia Land,

324
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,770
but he also summoned the Four Venerables.

325
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,370
[Prosperity]

326
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,440
Moreover, he used the Skyshade Mirror
to issue a challenge,

327
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,310
openly defying the Heavenly Lord's command

328
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,330
not to harm you.

329
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,490
He really gave such a command?

330
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,710
When did that happen?

331
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,160
Right after he woke from his last coma.

332
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,370
My Lady, the Heavenly Lord
surely holds you in his heart.

333
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,480
So even if you meant to kill him,

334
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,790
he still couldn't bring himself
to hurt you.

335
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,160
It's all because
Immortal Lord Long Yuan

336
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,240
acted on his own.

337
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,520
We all laugh at him behind his back,

338
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,310
saying if someone didn't know better,

339
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,910
they'd think he was the one
who'd been wronged.

340
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,500
My Lady, I'm not saying
you wronged the Heavenly Lord.

341
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,720
But with Long Yuan
going after the Divine Lord like that,

342
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,450
how did you manage
to escape from Canglei Palace?

343
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,380
I almost forgot
if you hadn't mentioned it.

344
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,000
On the day Immortal Lord Long Yuan issued
the challenge with the Skyshade Mirror,

345
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,400
I secretly slipped away.

346
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,680
Fortunately, I received help
from Immortal Lord Fan on the way.

347
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,510
That's how I was able to
successfully reach the mortal realm.

348
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,040
He entrusted me with a task.

349
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,550
It's to give you this box.

350
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,680
He also said
that although you're on different sides,

351
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,000
this is the last thing he can do for you

352
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,640
as your father.

353
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,640
What is this?

354
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,410
I don't know.
You'll have to see for yourself.

355
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,840
I don't want anything from him.

356
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,350
I'm just the deliveryman.

357
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,750
If you don't want it,
you tell him yourself.

358
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,950
You're from Canglei Palace.

359
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,790
Not only did you descend
to the mortal realm to find me,

360
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,390
but you also told me all this.

361
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,040
Aren't you afraid
Long Yuan will come after you?

362
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,000
I was just afraid you might
misunderstand the Heavenly Lord.

363
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,310
That's why I snuck out.

364
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,720
It's all my fault for not knowing the way.

365
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,120
I wasted quite a few days.

366
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,310
Fortunately,
you haven't started fighting yet.

367
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,510
I think the Heavenly Lord
must have woken up today

368
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,570
and stopped Immortal Lord Long Yuan.

369
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,470
Bai Jiusi actually
doesn't want to kill me?

370
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,390
Of course!
The Heavenly Lord loves you so much.

371
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,570
How could he ever think of killing you?

372
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,030
Now that you've come to Jingyun Sect,

373
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,880
I'm afraid you can't return
to Canglei Palace anymore.

374
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,810
That's not true.

375
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,020
When you make peace
with the Heavenly Lord,

376
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,280
I'll be able to return to Canglei Palace.

377
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,790
That's not possible.

378
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,710
[Prosperity]

379
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,460
Heavenly Lord, where are you going now?

380
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,910
There's something I need to look into.

381
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,240
But if you leave now,

382
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,510
I'm afraid Immortal Lord Long Yuan might—

383
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,200
This time,

384
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,070
he won't dare.

385
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,940
Lingshu is back?

386
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,270
Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

387
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,970
Lord Yu Ya,

388
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,560
help me check the Book of Fate
for two people.

389
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,790
What are their names?

390
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,630
I don't know.

391
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,510
If you don't know anything,

392
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
how do you expect me to check for you?

393
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
Can you check now?

394
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,240
Yes, I can.

395
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,140
Yes, I can.

396
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,590
[Temple of the Primordial God]

397
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Take all of these.

398
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,590
Take this too.

399
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,960
Bring it back for a drink later.

400
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,750
We can't stay at

401
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,750
Jingyun Sect any longer.

402
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,790
Let's head back.

403
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,110
Bian, are you leaving?

404
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,750
Who said I'm leaving?
I'm not going anywhere.

405
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,750
Watch your words.

406
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,510
How could Bian be the kind of person

407
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,310
who fears death
and abandons his fellow disciples?

408
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,910
Exactly.

409
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,310
You're right.

410
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,680
Canglei Palace

411
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,240
now fears the unity of the Jingyun Sect.

412
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,590
Even their prior challenge
has been withdrawn.

413
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,680
I refuse to believe

414
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,590
Bian would choose to walk away now.

415
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,160
Exactly.
How could I possibly leave Jingyun Sect?

416
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,790
No.

417
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:35,480
No.

418
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,070
Wait, Bian.

419
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,030
Didn't you write to me
asking me to take you back?

420
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,350
Father, I know.

421
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,000
You must have missed me so much

422
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,880
that you made up a lie just to see me.

423
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,750
I didn't make it up.

424
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,350
Once I'm a disciple of Jingyun Sect,

425
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,830
I'll always be one.

426
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,110
There's no way I'm leaving.

427
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,510
Father, please stop trying to persuade me.

428
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,110
Listen—

429
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,550
You must be thirsty.
Have some water, Father.

430
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,640
You must be thirsty.

431
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,830
It's been a long journey.

432
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,830
Drink more water.

433
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,350
Drink more.

434
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,270
You guys go practice martial arts first.

435
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,530
I'll be there shortly.

436
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,500
-Let's go.
-Okay. We'll wait for you.

437
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,830
Wait, you need to supervise his training.

438
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,750
Father.

439
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,750
Stop talking.

440
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,350
You really don't want to leave?

441
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:12,880
Father.

442
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,310
Now, Canglei Palace

443
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,030
doesn't even dare to attack Jingyun Sect.

444
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,480
Jingyun Sect is safe now.

445
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,550
I didn't leave when things were worse.

446
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,750
Why would I leave now?

447
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,270
If I stay

448
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,270
and weather the hardships
ith Jingyun Sect,

449
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,640
the rewards will come in time.

450
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,510
But, Bian,

451
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,970
people should know their own limitations.

452
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,980
Honestly,

453
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,000
I don't think you should keep going.

454
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,480
Father,

455
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
are you looking down on your own son?

456
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,640
Trust me.

457
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,920
One day,

458
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,550
I'll become

459
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,610
a leading figure of Jingyun Sect too.

460
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,070
Who is it?

461
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,220
Bian, is that you?

462
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,510
The last thing you can do for me?

463
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,420
I'd like to see what you've done.

464
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,630
You...

465
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,940
I... I told you to find someone else.

466
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,000
Don't come to me.

467
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,400
Divine Lord...

468
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,389
Find the Divine Lord.

469
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,150
Her last words were to tell me
to find you.

470
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,550
She didn't say what happened to her.

471
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,830
My Lady, were you looking for me?

472
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,070
You're a wood-element tree spirit.

473
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,070
Can you check what's wrong with her?

474
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,960
She's asleep.

475
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,390
What's wrong?

476
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,970
Isn't this what you brought for Ling'er?

477
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,300
I'm a tree spirit, so I'll be fine.

478
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
But My Lady, please stay back.
Don't let the scent reach you.

479
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
There's a scent of Nightmare Flower
in here.

480
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,380
Nightmare Flower?

481
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,440
The Nightmare Flower
is native to the Hell Ruins.

482
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,670
It grows from
the remains of demonic beasts,

483
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,550
needing tens of thousands

484
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,590
of corpses to bloom.

485
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,900
It's rare to see even one in 100 years.

486
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,190
Its scent causes both gods and mortals

487
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,520
to lose consciousness.

488
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,940
After seven days,
they will die in their dreams.

489
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,330
Only Immortal Lord Fan holds the cure.

490
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,780
A flower from the Hell Ruins?

491
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,290
It's strange. Immortal Lord Fan

492
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,930
asked me to give it to his daughter.

493
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,460
How could there
be a Nightmare Flower inside?

494
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,150
Could it be someone trying to use him

495
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,280
to kill Fan Ling'er?

496
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,230
No.

497
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,590
Fan Jiaojiao is forcing us

498
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,050
to hand over his daughter.

499
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,070
Otherwise, he'd rather let her die.

500
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,640
How is that even possible?

501
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,190
What kind of father
could do something so cruel

502
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,320
to his own daughter?

503
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,550
Do you know how to counter
the effects of this flower?

504
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,480
It takes great effort
for this flower to bloom.

505
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,230
I've only seen it once before

506
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,670
from afar in the Hell Ruins.

507
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,330
I don't know how to counter it.

508
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,560
If we were to return Fan Ling'er,

509
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,280
should we have her father
come to pick her up

510
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,610
or should we find someone
to send her back to Canglei Palace?

511
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,480
We still don't know

512
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,190
if this is a trap to lure you in.

513
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,610
So whatever happens,
you must not show yourself.

514
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,800
There's no one in Canglei Palace
who can defeat me.

515
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,030
One may be no match for you,

516
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,030
but what if ten come at you?
Or hundreds? Or thousands?

517
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,920
Moreover, we still don't know

518
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,550
what's happening with Bai Jiusi.

519
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,030
The Heavenly Lord won't harm Her Ladyship.

520
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,690
But we can't just stand by
and watch Ling'er die.

521
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,490
Don't we still have seven days?

522
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,320
Let's investigate the situation
at Canglei Palace further.

523
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,580
It's not too late to make a decision then.

524
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,230
Let's count how many buns
are in the plate.

525
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,360
When I finish counting,

526
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,920
I will eat them all.

527
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,000
One,

528
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,920
two,

529
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,190
three,

530
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,510
four...

531
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,960
The little one can eat quite a lot.

532
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,800
Five,

533
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:13,880
six,

eight...

536
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,710
Come on, call me Brother,

537
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,670
and I'll buy you more buns.

538
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,550
Sounds good?

539
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,110
Eight,

540
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,670
nine,

541
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,360
ten.

542
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,360
What a big mouth you have!

543
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,800
What a big mouth you have!

544
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,190
Uncle, Senior.

545
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,280
Weren't you supposed to be practicing?

546
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,360
Why are you drinking again?

547
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,280
No, you're looking for my disciple...

548
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,590
Why do you need to see the Grandmaster?

549
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,600
That's none of your concern.

550
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,880
She's also an elder of our sect.

551
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,360
She has the right to be involved
in these matters.

552
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,420
Let's go together.

553

[Everlasting Grace and Legacy]

554
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,630
When we see the Grandmaster later,

555
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,360
don't drink and speak less.

556
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
And don't doze off.

557
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,140
[Temple of the Primordial God]

558
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,550
Since Miss Ling'er
is now under Master's care,

559
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,740
[Prosperity]

560
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,950
we can't just stand by and do nothing.

561
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,710
Master should stay
to guard the Jingyun Sect.

562
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,670
As for me,

563
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,880
I might pay a visit to Canglei Palace.

564
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,170
It's a good chance to find out
why the battle halted yesterday.

565
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,880
I think there's no need to rush.

566
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,110
We still have seven days after all.

567
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,360
Senior is right.

568
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,280
Grandmaster, I can go back
and check the ancient records

569
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,840
to see if there's a way
to cure the Nightmare Flower poison.

570
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,280
If there really is no cure,

571
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,810
it's not too late
to go to Canglei Palace then.

572
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,630
Wait.

573
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,190
Have you considered

574
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,000
that you've all attacked
the Nine Heavens before

575
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,130
and have a grudge with Canglei Palace?

576
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,320
If you go,

577
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,670
wouldn't it cause more conflict?

578
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,880
So why not let me go instead?

579
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,030
Nonsense! Your power isn't skilled enough.
How could you go?

580
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,960
Well, any one of you could use your power

581
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,760
to help me get there, right?

582
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,590
I've never fought
with Canglei Palace before.

583
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,880
When they see me,

584
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,000
they surely won't be as hostile.

585
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,580
Besides, in a war between two countries,

586
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,670
isn't it the rule not to kill envoys?

587
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,950
The immortals
should follow the same rule, right?

588
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,490
We'll discuss this matter later.

589
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,630
Let's first look for a way
to cure the Nightmare Flower poison.

590
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,190
Yes.

591
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:42,960
Yes.

592
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,500
[Cultivate the Mind]

593
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,480
Is there a master in this world
as pitiful as I am?

594
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,470
Having to sneak around
just to see my own disciple.

595
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,420
What are you doing here again?

596
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,630
To drink with you, of course.

597
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,480
Do you know why I volunteered

598
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,140
to go to Canglei Palace today?

599
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:14,880
Why?

600
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,420
For you.

601
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,670
Me?

602
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,030
Last time you told me

603
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,320
about the grudge
between you and Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

604
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
After hearing it,

605
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,030
I think there might be room
for reconciliation.

606
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,890
After all, I am your master.

607
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,070
I plan to be a mediator
between you and Bai Jiusi.

608
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,070
We don't need a mediator between us.

609
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,400
That may not be the case.

610
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,820
You're too close to the situation
to see it clearly.

611
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,370
As an outsider,
I can see things more clearly.

612
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,050
As you said,

613
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,550
Heavenly Lord Dacheng
is cold-hearted and born without emotions.

614
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,110
So when he found you back then,

615
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,710
he should've captured you on the spot

616
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:02,170
instead of marrying you
and taking you back to Canglei Palace.

617
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,190
He was just too arrogant.

618
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,800
You're really dense.

619
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,030
No wonder you haven't passed
your love tribulation all these years.

620
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,130
Everything you've said
is just your assumption.

621
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,360
You've never asked Heavenly Lord Dacheng
how he feels.

622
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,970
Given how you treated him,

623
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,630
the very fact
that Canglei Palace hasn't struck yet

624
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,280
proves he's not completely heartless.

625
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,250
I'm also confused about
why he hasn't made a move yet.

626
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,880
Perhaps he's planning
an even bigger counterattack.

627
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,040
You're totally a lost cause.

628
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,630
Never mind.

629
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,320
I am your master after all.

630
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,840
I should teach you a thing or two.

631
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,440
Alright. Stop being so stiff.

632
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,340
You're like a wooden block.

633
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,150
Come on.

634
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
Come here.

635
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,800
Sit down.

636
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,550
Here.

637
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:11,000
Tonight, let's have a good drink together.

638
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:12,880
Come on.

639
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,510
For centuries, you have schemed

640
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,760
for the sole purpose of killing him.

641
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,160
I understand all of that.

642
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,360
Everything you've suffered,
all the pain you've endured,

643
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,670
started with him.

644
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,280
Especially the agony
of losing your own child.

645
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,280
Intentional or not,

646
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,320
the harm is done,

647
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,760
and he's to blame.

648
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,170
But does that really make him
deserving of death?

649
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,550
I know you'll probably say

650
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,590
that I haven't been through what you have,

651
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,720
so who am I to speak a few words
and forgive on your behalf?

652
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,600
But my dear disciple,

653
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,510
every time you try to hurt him,

654
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,750
you're only hurting yourself
again and again.

655
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,380
Because deep down,
you still can't let it go.

656
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,680
You've hated him for hundreds of years,

657
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,680
and that only proves
you've loved him for just as long.

658
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:23,000
Without love,
where would the hatred come from?
