00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,560
Come to think of it, we
haven't been away for long.

171
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,890
When we previously came here
to catch Honglian,

172
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,100
I thought you would
come clean with me then.

173
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,040
I just didn't expect that...

174
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,510
you deliberately revealed that you had
reclaimed the Fire-Parting Technique,

175
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,410
all for today's Heaven-Turning Seal.

176
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,350
You mean...

177
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,630
You've known all along?

178
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,650
Ruyue.

179
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,710
I've told you before.

180
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,600
I could never fail to recognize my wife.

181
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,390
I knew it was you all along.

182
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,020
It has always been you.

183
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,610
All those trials in the past...

184
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,210
were just...

185
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,830
me giving you chances to come clean.

186
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,430
You think I would believe you?

187
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,370
Your grave injuries brought me
into the mortal world,

188
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,970
then you proposed to marry me
just to get close to me.

189
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,260
You then saved the White Snake,
stole my powers,

190
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,310
provoked me into using
the Heaven-Turning Seal,

191
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,440
and then delivering the final blow
with the Seal itself.

192
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,440
Ruyue,

193
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,510
haven't you ever wondered...

194
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,960
why did everything go as smoothly
as you've planned?

195
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,320
That's because I was cooperating with you.

196
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,880
When you chose to use
the Heaven-Turning Seal on me,

197
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,490
were you not thinking of
sealing me completely?

198
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,470
If I can seal, I can also unseal.

199
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,630
What I wanted was for you
to drop your disguise.

200
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,360
This was the only way.

201
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,570
Whatever happens is written
by Heaven’s will.

202
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,300
It was the Heaven-Turning Seal
that brought us here.

203
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:40,900
Ruyue,

204
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,940
doesn’t it feel like

205
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,270
we're back to how things were
400 years ago?

206
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,820
[460 years ago]

207
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,500
[Meng Qi, Meng Chi]

208
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,350
Father, is this your new workplace?

209
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,760
It's beautiful!

210
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,920
Yes, this is it.

211
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,740
Chi, do you remember what I told you
before we came?

212
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,980
What did I say?

213
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,750
I must be diligent, not run around,

214
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
listen to you,

215
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,730
and stay close to you.

216
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,730
Such a good boy, Chi.

217
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,100
Let's go.

218
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,530
Who are you looking for?

219
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,870
I'm looking for Housekeeper Wu.

220
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,070
Please wait a moment.

221
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,480
[Qichi Hall]

222
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,930
Who are you?

223
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,110
Housekeeper Wu, my name is Meng Qi.

224
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,890
I'm here to paint lanterns for the household.

225
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,010
This...

226
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,310
is a letter of recommendation
from the accountant, Mr. Liu.

227
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,540
[To the housekeeper]

228
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,990
[Mr. Meng Qi, a familiar figure and personally known by Mr. Liu.
He is highly recommended by the renowned painter, Mr. Liang.]

229
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,160
Come in.

230
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,480
Thank you. Let's go.

231
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,920
Our master is kind
and has a good temperament.

232
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,620
He's never harsh to his servants.

233
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,820
You'll see for yourselves soon enough.

234
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,720
Yes.

235
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,600
It's truly your good fortune to work here.

236
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,300
Yes, yes.

237
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,000
Mr. Liu has told us all about it.

238
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,400
Just one thing.
My master likes peace and quiet.

239
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,470
Few people live here.

240
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,590
While you're working here,

241
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,440
just focus on doing your job well.

242
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,160
If you have no other business,
don't wander around.

243
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,440
Apart from your own duties,

244
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,000
don't ask about anything else.

245
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,530
Alright.

246
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,880
Above all, keep a close eye on your child.

247
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,680
Make sure he never enters
the master's courtyard.

248
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,510
Meng Chi, did you hear that?

249
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,320
Yes, I did.

250
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,200
Her Ladyship saved my granddaughter's life,

251
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,440
and I just want to express my gratitude
with a kowtow.

252
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,640
You'd better go back.

253
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,810
Housekeeper Wu.

254
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,920
Madam Yang.

255
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,750
What's the rush? What's up?

256
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,370
I'm here to kowtow to Her Ladyship.

257
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,240
The miraculous medicine she gave me

258
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,040
saved my granddaughter's life.

259
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,370
You have no idea.

260
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,720
Physician Zhu from Qianchun Clinic and

261
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Physician Zhang from Baoren Clinic
both said there was no hope,

262
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,620
but with just one pill from Her Ladyship,
it worked wonders.

263
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,480
My granddaughter's fever broke
in just a few days.

264
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,410
She can eat and drink

265
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,290
and is full of energy now.

266
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,260
Isn't that a miracle drug?

267
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,070
What miracle drug?

268
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,760
Don't go around spreading rumors.

269
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,840
If more people come begging for medicine

270
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,470
and the master finds out,
you might get kicked out.

271
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,110
I understand, I understand.

272
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,110
Her Ladyship's out visiting friends.

273
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,110
She's been gone for several days

274
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,720
and we don't know when she'll be back.

275
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,070
Besides, she doesn't like
this sort of courtesy.

276
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,590
If you really want to kowtow,

277
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,790
just do it towards the inner courtyard.

278
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,560
Yes, yes.

279
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,430
Thank you, Housekeeper Wu.

280
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,000
Let's go.

281
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,440
Her Ladyship is like a saint,
always helping those in need.

282
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,170
I'm so grateful to you, My Lady.

283
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,500
You saved my granddaughter.

284
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,000
Thank you, My Lady.

285
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,630
Meng Chi.

286
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,200
Meng Chi!

287
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:29,960
Come.

288
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,610
It's all thanks to you, My Lady.

289
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,030
Don't run around.

290
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,750
Okay.

291
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,640
Puppy.

292
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,570
Puppy!

293
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,590
Don't run, don't run!

294
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,110
Come here!

295
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,990
No, don't go!

296
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,720
Come here and I'll treat you to a bone.

297
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,350
I'll treat you to a bone!

298
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,650
Thank you, dear.

299
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,050
So you finally decided to come back.

300
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,680
We said we'd face the love tribulation
in the mortal realm as one.

301
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,160
Now, we've descended here to the mortal realm
and even got married,

302
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,760
but we've made no progress
in the tribulation.

303
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,900
Don't be impatient.

304
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,850
Once I'm done with the business,

305
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,110
I'll definitely come back to be with you.

306
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,810
All you do is open and run shops outside
just to make money.

307
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,830
I don't understand why
an immortal like you

308
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,880
is so obsessed with

309
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,680
the art of commerce in the mortal realm.

310
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,050
Since we came to the mortal realm
for the tribulation,

311
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,510
we must follow the rules of
the mortal realm.

312
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,400
We can't casually use magic

313
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,660
or meddle with the mortal world's karma.

314
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,130
If I don't go out to earn some money,

315
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,860
how will I support this family?

316
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,360
As you know, someone has been

317
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,960
giving silver ingots to beggars
on the street,

318
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,840
and pills to the servants at home.

319
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,370
If this continues,

320
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,250
I'm afraid our wealth will be
squandered away sooner or later.

321
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,640
So you know about it all.

322
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,820
With your little tricks,

323
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,720
who do you think you can fool?

324
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,060
You've seen Madam Yang's granddaughter.

325
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,980
She's clever, adorable, and pure as snow.

326
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,280
If she had really died from that illness,

327
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,140
wouldn't it have been such a pity?

328
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,820
But you need to understand,

329
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,550
all things come from nature,
each with its own karmic path.

330
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,350
Everyone has their own destiny.

331
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,240
Why do you have to put yourself

332
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,440

To put it bluntly,

335
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,990
you're just afraid of interfering
in mortal affairs

336
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,190
and attracting the Heavenly Emissary.

337
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,710
I'm glad you understand.

338
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,810
We're here in the mortal realm
to overcome our tribulations,

339
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,010
not to indulge in your acts of kindness.

340
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,180
Don't blame me for
not warning you upfront.

341
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,710
If you really attract
the Heavenly Emissary,

342
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,430
I won't be able to help you.

344
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,860
By the way, a new child arrived
at the mansion today.

345
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,420
He looks dazed and not very bright.

346
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,610
I even transformed into a puppy
and gave him a fright.

347
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,230
Don't you think children are adorable?

348
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,720
Why don't we have one of our own?

349
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,030
Who knows, having a child might just be

350
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,630
what we need to overcome
our love tribulation.

351
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
You really like children that much?

You don't like them?

353
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,600
I have no interest.

354

[Lord Yu Ya]

356
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,830
Heavenly Lord Dacheng, you came to see me

357
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,690
just to ask about having a child?

358
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,240
Yes.

359
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,930
Forgive me for being frank,

360
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,360
but I think...

361
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,360
you should forget about it.

362
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,720
Why?

363
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,020
When immortals conceive a child,

364
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,790
it must be nurtured with
their own vital energy.

365
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,840
You and Divine Lord Siling are
in the mortal realm for the tribulation.

366
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,870
If she were to conceive a child now,

367
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,430
the child would absorb her vital energy
and weaken her further.

368
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,710
In that case,

369
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,640
Divine Lord Siling's love tribulation

370
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,380
would probably become...

371
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,300
even more difficult to overcome.

372

00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,300

Here.

378
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,900
What kind of cricket is this?

379
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,400
It looks quite impressive.

380
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,420
My father said

381
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,060
it's a black iron cricket,

382
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,510
also known as the iron-skinned cricket.

383
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,090
It's dark and glossy,
with a large body and long wings.

384
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,690
It's quite fierce in fights.

That's nothing.

386
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,900
Let me tell you.

387
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,110
The golden crickets are best at fighting.

388
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,010
Golden ones?

389
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,930
That's right.

[Yunqi Hall]

391
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,020
Golden crickets are very rare.

392
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,270
They are usually found in the north.

393
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,270
They have a blue face, red fangs,
brownish-yellow necks,

394
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,160
and also yellow legs, bellies, whiskers,

395
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,760
complete with golden wings.

396
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,070
So it is golden all over?

397
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,480
Pretty much, except for
its emerald green wing covers.

398
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,340
It's not very noticeable though.

399
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,840
Golden crickets have a deep, rich chirp.

400
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,380
It's strong and powerful.

401

When the sunlight hits them,

402
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,710
they shimmer like golden armor.

It's quite impressive.

What do you do in this mansion?

405
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,000
I work as a servant in this mansion.

406
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,440
But the master here

407

doesn’t seem to like noisy places.

410
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,930

The paintings on the lanterns
within this mansion

414
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,760
were all painted by my father.

Aren't they beautiful?

416

Since your father is so skilled,

417
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,280
why didn't you learn how to
paint lanterns from him,

418

but became a servant instead?

419
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,050
I was born color-blind.

420
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,110
So I can't learn to paint.

421
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,719
Who says you must be able
to distinguish colors to paint?

422
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,670
Distinguishing colors
doesn't necessarily require vision.

423
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,150
It can also be done through smell.

Smell?

425

Yes.

426

Every living being in this world
has the ability

427

to connect with everything else

sight, hearing, smell, taste,
touch, and thought.

431

You've only lost one sense.

This faint, refreshing fragrance is
the scent of green.

Wild grass sprouts from rock crevices,

while bamboo stands firm
in the chilly wind.
