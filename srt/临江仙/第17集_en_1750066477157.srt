1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you attempt two parts, only taking parts is enough!

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,280
If you inform the internet, it will be set into one.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,000
We areγuntig on duty today.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,180
...

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

16
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

19
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

21
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

22
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

24
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

25
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

27
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

28
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

30
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

31
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

33
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

34
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

36
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

37
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

38
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

39
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

40
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

41
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

42
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

43
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

44
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

45
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

46
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,180
I'm so happy to see you again.

47
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,180
Ellis

48
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,180
Wise Sheep

49
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,180
brutal

50
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,180
For mom

51
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,100
Why did you born

52
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,180
without dinner 100%?

53
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,180
I can't get that much.

54
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,380
Get it?

55
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,420
I can't hold it in one's Graduation圈.

56
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,780
I have no appetite right now.

57
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,920
Can't eat it properly.

58
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,000
What?

59
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,000
If I were to say that,

60
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,800
madam is definitely in a bad mood.

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,840
Now you can only live happily ever after.

62
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,340
BaiXiong,

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,340
trust me,

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,040
just go on like that.

65
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,660
Madam will surely touch your ass.

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,000
BaiXiong,

67
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,380
BaiXiong, relax,

68
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,860
I'm not done yet.

69
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,180
I'm so happy to see you.

70
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,680
Didn't I tell you to come to me every month to get me a antidote?

71
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,180
Why did you delay it for so long?

72
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,680
If you die, I'll be the one to blame.

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,180
It's because of something.

74
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,180
That's why I came to get you a antidote.

75
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,180
I can give you the antidote, but don't forget that you promised me.

76
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,180
Senior Meng has been released.

77
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,180
You can go find him yourself.

78
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,180
Will Zi Yang's old version release Brother Meng?

79
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,180
You'd better say that the old rat from the Jin Yun Sect has broken through the hole

80
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,180
and let Brother Meng escape.

81
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,680
You can go and see it.

82
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,180
The gate is not going to stop you.

83
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,180
What nonsense are you talking about?

84
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,180
Zi Yang's old version always says that the Zhen Xie is weak.

85
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,180
How could she not stop us?

86
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,180
Do you mean that you want to lie to me and lie to me to go to the Jin Yun Sect

87
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,180
and then kill me?

88
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,180
You used to live in my house. I didn't need to lie to you.

89
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,180
Give me the antidote.

90
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,180
I have something important to do next.

91
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,180
Without that Xian Gong Fu Mei Bei Yue will learn to give you the antidote.

92
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,180
I don't believe you.

93
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,180
Unless you accompany me to the Jin Yun Sect,

94
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,180
I will see Brother Meng in person so that I can give you the antidote.

95
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,180
I don't have time to accompany you.

96
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,180
If you don't give me the antidote,

97
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,180
if I have any short and long ways to go,

98
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,180
I will treat you in a way that I can't.

99
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,180
Stop!

100
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,180
Can't I give you the antidote?

101
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,180
I will take it.

102
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,180
What are you doing with me?

103
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,180
I didn't expect that you, a mortal,

104
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,180
could do this for the sake of the Immortal Lord.

105
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,180
It's really an accident.

106
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,180
What do you want to do?

107
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,180
What about you?

108
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,180
What do you want to do when you leave the Jin Yun Sect?

109
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,180
I guess you are going to find the Immortal Lord, right?

110
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,180
You didn't listen to what I said last time.

111
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,180
Do you really think the Immortal Lord needs you?

112
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,180
Whether he needs it or not is his business.

113
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,180
Whether I can find it or not is my business.

114
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,180
Since that's the case, I'll take it.

115
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,180
Don't look at me like that.

116
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,180
The friendship between me and Immortal Lord is not less than yours.

117
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,180
What?

118
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,180
You are so ungrateful.

119
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,180
I really taught you nothing.

120
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,180
You'd better stay at home all the time.

121
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,180
Let that stinky brat come to you by himself.

122
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,180
Mother, but...

123
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,180
No, but if a man doesn't know how to find you,

124
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,180
what do you want him to do?

125
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,180
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,180
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,180
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,180
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,180
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,180
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,180
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,180
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,180
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,180
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,180
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,180
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,180
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,180
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,180
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,180
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,180
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,180
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,180
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,180
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,180
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,180
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,180
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,180
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,180
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,180
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,180
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,180
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,180
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,180
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,180
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,180
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,180
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,180
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,180
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,180
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,180
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,180
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,180
I'm sorry.

167
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,180
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,180
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,180
I'm sorry.

170
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,180
I'm sorry.

171
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,180
I'm sorry.

172
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,180
I'm sorry.

173
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,180
I'm sorry.

174
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,180
I'm sorry.

175
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,180
I'm sorry.

176
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
I'm sorry.

177
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,180
I'm sorry.

178
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,180
I'm sorry.

179
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,180
I'm sorry.

180
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,180
I'm sorry.

181
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,180
I'm sorry.

182
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,180
I'm sorry.

183
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,180
I'm sorry.

184
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,180
I'm sorry.

185
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,180

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,180
I'm sorry.

220
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,180

I'm sorry.

228
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,180
I'm sorry.

229
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,180
I'm sorry.

230
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,180
I'm sorry.

231
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,180

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,180
I'm sorry.

236
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,180
I'm sorry.

237
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,180
I'm sorry.

238
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,180
I'm sorry.

239
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,180
I'm sorry.

240
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,180
I'm sorry.

241
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,180
I'm sorry.

242
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,180
I'm sorry.

243
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,180
I'm sorry.

244
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,180
I'm sorry.

245
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,180
I'm sorry.

246
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,180
I'm sorry.

247
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,180
I'm sorry.

248
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,180
I'm sorry.

249
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,180
I'm sorry.

250
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,180
I'm sorry.

251
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,180
I'm sorry.

252
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,180
I'm sorry.

253
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,180
I'm sorry.

254
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,180
I'm sorry.

255
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,180
I'm sorry.

256
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,180
Sir.

257
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,180
Have you finished making the food?

258
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,180
Mr. Bai,

259
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,180
we have a separate guest For the milk capitalism.

260
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,180
Come.

261
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,180
Come.

262
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,180
Brother Bai, how big of a mistake did you do

263
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,180
to make Mrs. Cao angry for two months?

264
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,180
I'm right.

265
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,180
Second, put all the dishes that Bai Xing has thrown away.

266
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,180
Okay.

267
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,180
I'll take it.

268
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,180
Boss.

269
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,180
Mr. Kong.

270
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,180
Two bowls of noodles.

271
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,180
I'm still the same.

272
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,180
Okay.

273
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,180
Two bowls of noodles.

274
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,180
Two more bottles.

275
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,180
Okay.

276
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,180
This is your fault.

277
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,180
What's the point of your wife's cleverness?

278
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Is it wrong to admit it wrong?

279
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,180
Wang Yong.

280
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,180
If you don't mind,

281
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,180
I'll treat you two to noodles.

282
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,180
Mr. Kong, are you rich?

283
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,180
No.

284
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,180
Today is my birthday.

285
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,180
Look at my brain.

286
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,180
Mr. Kong, you're 53 this year.

287
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,180
Yes.

288
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,180
I have no family at home.

289
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,180
Think about it carefully.

290
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,180
Only you two are willing to eat with me.

291
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,180
Come.

292
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,180
Please.

293
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,180
I'll take this.

294
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,180
Brother Bai, eat.

295
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
Thank you.

296
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,180
But I'm not hungry.

297
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,180
Come on.

298
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,180
Wait for me.

299
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,180
I'll eat one bowl.

300
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,180
I have to eat two bowls.

301
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,180
Okay.

302
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,180
Mr. Kong, take care.

303
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,180
Thank you.

304
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,180
Mr. Bai, take care.

305
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,180
Mr. Bai, take care.

306
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,180
Mr. Bai, take care.

307
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,180
Mr. Bai, thank you.

308
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,180
What are you doing?

309
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,180
I'm just a man.

310
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,180
Mr. Kong has been studying for more than 30 years.

311
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,180
His family is already very close.

312
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,180
So he's been very busy.

313
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,180
I told Mr. Kong that he would pay for his studies.

314
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,180
I'll pay you back when he's rich.

315
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,180
Don't worry, Mr. Bai.

316
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,180
I'll pay you back for your money.

317
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,180
I'll pay you back.

318
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,180
Why do you ask me to pay you back?

319
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,180
I'm not asking you to pay me back.

320
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,180
I'm asking you to pay me back.

321
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,180
I'm asking you to pay me back.

322
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,180
Why do you ask me to pay you back?

323
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,180
I'll pay you back.

324
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,180
Mr. Kong is very poor.

325
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,180
He's also a poor man.

326
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,180
He asked us to eat noodles before he left.

327
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,180
He proved his love for us.

328
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,180
I'm worried that he'll feel sad because you didn't eat his noodles.

329
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,180
So he asked you to pay him back.

330
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,180
Please.

331
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,180
I don't need it.

332
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,180
What do you mean?

333
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,180
This is a human love.

334
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,180
The meaning of life is here.

335
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,180
Mr. Bai.

336
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,180
Mr. Bai.

337
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,180
Mr. Kong, come and have a look.

338
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
Mr. Bai.

339
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,180
Mrs. Kong has been moving here for two months.

340
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,180
She hasn't been out yet.

341
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,180
My wife also said that she wants to see Mrs. Kong at home.

342
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,180
She's afraid of the soil.

343
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,180
You'll let Mrs. Kong and my wife sit down and chat with her.

344
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,180
And do the female harem.

345
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,180
It's said that it's better to stay away from each other.

346
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,180
Besides, we're so close to each other.

347
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,180
We should be more active.

348
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,180
Mr. Bai, Mrs. Kong is happy.

349
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,180
I'll pay you back.

350
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,180
Thank you.

351
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,180
Come again.

352
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,180
Female harem?

353
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Mrs. Kong.

354
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,180
Mr. Kong.

355
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,180
Come and have a look.

356
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,180
I said, Mr. Huang.

357
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,180
Why are you here again?

358
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,180
Look, my wife is closing the door soon.

359
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,180
Why are you here every day?

360
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,180
Go away.

361
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,180
Go away.

362
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,180
Go away.

363
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,180
Mr. Huang, go away.

364
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,180
You...

365
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,180
Listen,

366
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,180
you've been here for a while.

367
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,180
You've eaten more than I've sold.

368
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,180
Come on.

369
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,180
Go ahead.

370
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,180
Mr. Bai.

371
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,180
Ladies and gentlemen,

372
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,180
give me four.

373
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,180
Give me eight.

374
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,180
Okay.

375
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,180
Okay.

376
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,180
Take this.

377
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,180
Okay.

378
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,180
Thank you.

379
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,180
Take it.

380
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,180
Why is your hand so cold?

381
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,180
Don't think that you're young and strong.

382
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,180
You'll be punished for your age.

383
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,180
Wear more when you go out.

384
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,180
It's hot.

385
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,180
It's okay.

386
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,180
It's okay.

387
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,180
Come on.

388
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,180
Okay.

389
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,180
Thank you.

390
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,180
Thank you.

391
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,180
Mr. Huang, hurry up.

392
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,180
Don't stay here.

393
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,180
Okay, Mr. Bai.

394
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,180
That's it.

395
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,180
Goodbye.

396
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,180
Mr. Lin.

397
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,180
Kong Xiong has paid the exam.

398
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,180
I'll go out with you.

399
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,180
I knew it.

400
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,180
It's just a question.

401
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
I'll go first.

402
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,180
I'll go first.

403
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,180
Okay.

404
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,180
Okay.

405
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,180
Okay.

406
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,180
Okay.

407
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,180
Okay.

408
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,180
Okay.

409
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,180
Okay.

410
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,180
Okay.

411
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,180
Okay.

412
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,180
Okay.

413
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,180
Okay.

414
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,180
Okay.

415
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,180
Okay.

416
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,180
Okay.

417
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,180
Okay.

418
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,180
Okay.

419
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,180
Okay.

420
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,180
Okay.

421
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,180
Okay.

422
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,180
Okay.

423
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,180
Okay.

424
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,180
Okay.

425
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,180
Okay.

426
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,180
Okay.

427
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,180
Okay.

428
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,180
Okay.

429
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,180
Okay.

430
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,180
Okay.

431
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,180
I brought you some burning pills.

432
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,180
I'll go in first.

433
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,180
I didn't expect you to be willing to help the mortal.

434
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,180
It's been so long.

435
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,180
You're still the first one to talk to me.

436
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,180
Why did you do that?

437
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,180
Like you said,

438
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,180
you're like a mortal.

439
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,180
I'm doing what the mortal is doing.

440
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,180
And I'm not using the law.

441
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,180
I'm not talking about the law.

442
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,180
What do you want to say?

443
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,180
You still don't understand.

444
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,180
I don't understand.

445
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,180
I don't understand.

446
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,180
Mrs. Bai, are you ready?

447
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,180
What are you going to do?

448
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,180
I'm going to Han Shuo for embroidery.

449
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,180
Mr. Bai said you like to be a woman.

450
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,180
I made an appointment with my husband.

451
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,180
We'll go to Han Shuo for a class today.

452
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,180
I can't wait to come here.

453
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,180
I...

454
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,180
I'm not going to Han Shuo.

455
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,180
Did I disturb you?

456
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,180
No.

457
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,180
I didn't find the right thread.

458
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,180
I delayed the time.

459
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,180
No need to find it.

460
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,180
I have a lot of threads at home.

461
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,180
I'm confused.

462
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,180
It's good that Mrs. Bai can choose it for me.

463
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,180
Mr. Bai,

464
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,180
you don't have to go to the restaurant to buy food.

465
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,180
I made some good food.

466
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,180
Let's eat together tonight.

467
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,180
Let's eat together.

468
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,180
Okay.

469
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,180
Let's go.

470
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,180
Mr. Bai, look.

471
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,180
This is all the books I've collected.

472
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,180
And some old paintings.

473
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,180
This one.

474
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,180
This is a painting of the original Danqiu's

475
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,180
Cui Zhu Shuang He.

476
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,180
When I first came to the Songhe County,

477
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,180
I found that this line has a lot of fate.

478
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,180
So I spent a lot of money.

479
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,180
I bought it at a shop.

480
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,180
Look.

481
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,180
This flower is hanging here.

482
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,180
Is it a good idea?

483
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,180
I'm not sure.

484
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,180
I don't know.

485
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,180
I don't know.

486
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,180
This flower is hanging here.

487
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,180
Is it a good match with this room?

488
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,180
You can take a look around.

489
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,180
Here.

490
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,180
I brought it.

491
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,180
This is it.

492
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,180
You're looking at this?

493
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,180
You think this is good, right?

494
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,180
I read this line in an old book.

495
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,180
The old people often say that

496
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,180
the words are all with power.

497
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,180
Until I read this poem,

498
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,180
I feel that the poem of the original Danqiu

499
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,180
is really heart-breaking.

500
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,180
Bai Xiao, what do you think?

501
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,180
Bai Xiao, what do you think?

502
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,180
The story is a theory.

503
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,180
You like this too?

504
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,180
I like this one very much.

505
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,180
It seems that we have reached the end of the river.

506
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,180
Brother Ling,

507
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,180
you should be thirsty after saying so much.

508
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,180
How about...

509
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,180
Let's go.

510
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,180
Please.

511
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,180
Brother Bai,

512
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,180
let me tell you.

513
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,180
My family is a generation of officials.

514
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,180
But most of them are now officials.

515
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,180
They are experienced in writing.

516
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,180
My grandfather was wrong.

517
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,180
So I left my family.

518
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,180
I didn't allow my descendants to be officials.

519
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,180
So my father went to the capital to do business.

520
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,180
He found out that he was a great businessman.

521
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,180
He earned a lot of money.

522
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,180
He started to study in the public.

523
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,180
I'm sorry.

524
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,180
I was very brave.

525
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,180
I made a wise decision.

526
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,180
My brother told me that if I could go to the science and technology department,

527
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,180
I would secretly draw a picture.

528
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,180
I could even become a sponsor.

529
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,180
But I don't think so.

530
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,180
I think that reading is like reading.

531
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,180
It has nothing to do with writing.

532
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,180
It's not that a book can be a good book.

533
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,180
It's that it can be a good book to prove your feelings.

534
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,180
Bai Xiao, what do you think?

535
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,180
It's really reasonable.

536
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,180
That's right.

537
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,180
Bai Xiao is my best friend.

538
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,180
Come, Bai Xiao.

539
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,180
Try it.

540
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,180
This tea is called Zhaoyan tea.

541
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,180
Although it's not a famous tea,

542
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,180
the water is very rich.

543
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,180
It must be soaked in water.

544
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,180
I go to the mountains every day.

545
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,180
I take the water from the south of the dragon tree.

546
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,180
You will find that this tea is very clean.

547
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,180
It smells like a strong grass scent.

548
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,180
How do you feel, Bai Xiao?

549
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,180
Bai Xiao, how do you feel?

550
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,180
It's good.

551
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,180
Bai Xiao, we are all educated people.

552
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,180
But we can't only know how to read.

553
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,180
We also need to train our relatives.

554
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,180
The ancient people said that the three-legged lantern fire is five-legged.

555
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,180
That's how Xiao Di is.

556
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,180
I go to the mountains every day.

557
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,180
So I can train my body.

558
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,180
Two thousand qi.

559
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,180
That's good.

560
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,180
You think it's good, too?

561
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,180
How about this?

562
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,180
You go to the mountains with me tomorrow.

563
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,180
I said you go to the mountains with me tomorrow.

564
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,180
That's not necessary.

565
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,180
Bai Xiao, I think you are very thin.

566
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,180
If you go to the mountains every day,

567
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,180
your body will definitely be a little heavier.

568
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,180
People say that women are like a lion.

569
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,180
Men are like a rock.

570
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,180
Women like to bring themselves to a safe man.

571
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,180
If you can be a little heavier,

572
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,180
maybe Mrs. Xiao won't be on your side every day.

573
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,180
Mrs. Xiao won't be on your side every day.

574
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,180
This tea is very good.

575
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,180
Husband.

576
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,180
Husband, look.

577
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,180
Bai Xiao's embroidery is really good.

578
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,180
I thought that the hands of my wife are already good enough.

579
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,180
I didn't expect that Mrs. Xiao would be even better.

580
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,180
It seems that Bai Xiao didn't say anything.

581
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,180
Mrs. Xiao really loves the palace.

582
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,180
Look. How cute.

583
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,180
This is your embroidery.

584
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,180
I embroider it casually.

585
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,180
When did you learn to embroider these things?

586
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,180
Mrs. Xiao.

587
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,180
I have an unkind request.

588
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,180
Please say it.

589
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,180
My mother really likes this kind of fox.

590
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,180
I wonder if Mrs. Xiao can give it to her.

591
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,180
But what do you want this to do?

592
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,180
I...

593
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,180
I want to give it to a child who is not born yet.

594
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,180
My wife has already been pregnant for four months.

595
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,180
She never told anyone.

596
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,180
Yes.

597
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,180
But today, she said it out.

598
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
She also gave it to everyone.

599
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,180
What are you doing?

600
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,180
I'm not doing it.

601
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,180
I'm just wearing the clothes.

602
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,180
When the child is born,

603
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,180
I think this peach tree will be the result.

604
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,180
Mrs. Xiao likes eating peaches.

605
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,180
Yes. She likes it.

606
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,180
She can't eat it now.

607
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,180
She needs to wait until she gets the result.

608
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,180
But it's okay.

609
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,180
When she gets the result,

610
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,180
I'll send it to you.

611
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,180
Do you want peaches?

612
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,180
Brother Li.

613
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,180
Your peach tree

614
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,180
must have been in the forest for a hundred years.

615
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,180
I don't know.

616
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,180
We moved here for less than a year.

617
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,180
The owner of this place said that

618
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,180
they lived here for three generations.

619
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,180
That time, this peach tree was here.

620
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,180
Maybe it's a bit old.

621
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,180
Actually, the tree has a spiritual nature.

622
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,180
It knows when to bloom and when to get the result.

623
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,180
Brother Bai, you said it.

624
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,180
The peach tree was not all three months of bloom.

625
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,180
It was six months of bloom.

626
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,180
That's not certain.

627
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,180
Since someone wants to eat,

628
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,180
they need to get the result.

629
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,180
If we can't solve it,

630
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,180
then what's the use of this peach tree?

631
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,180
The peach tree is not a tree.

632
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,180
It's a tree.

633
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,180
It's a tree.

634
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
It's a tree.

635
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,180
It's a tree.

636
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,180
It's a tree.

637
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,180
It's a tree.

638
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,180
It's a tree.

639
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,180
It's a tree.

640
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,180
It's a tree.

641
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,180
It's a tree.

642
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,180
It's a tree.

643
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,180
It's a tree.

644
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,180
It's a tree.

645
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,180
When did you come here?

646
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,180
I came to ask you.

647
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,180
I didn't come to see you.

648
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,180
I was here to meet you.

649
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,180
I came to see you.

650
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,180
I'm sorry I couldn't go.

651
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
I'm sorry I couldn't go.

652
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,180
I can't go.

653
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
I'm sorry.

654
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,180
I'm sorry.

655
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
I came to see you.

656
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,180
I'm sorry.

657
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
I'm sorry.

658
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,180
I'm going to put on my clothes.

659
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,180
Don't let the wind blow, okay?

660
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,180
Don't move.

661
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:55,180
I see you in the dark

662
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:03,180
warmly like a stranger

663
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:09,180
Tell me

664
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:16,180
I'm afraid I can't

665
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:23,180
keep the memories

666
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,180
I

667
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,180
I think Mrs. Lin often gives the portrait to the palace

668
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,180
That's how you want to steal it

669
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,180
So I

670
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,180
I'll go open the door

671
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,180
Mrs. Lin

672
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,180
What are you doing?

673
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,180
Mrs. Lin

674
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,180
Are you angry or not?

675
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,180
We just talked about eating peach yesterday

676
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,180
Today my tree is over

677
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,180
Look at this big one

678
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,180
It's called Xiaowui

679
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,180
It should be reported to the government

680
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,180
Maybe there is a reward

681
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,180
In my opinion

682
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,180
I don't know which god is in the fairy tale

683
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,180
I think it's not a fairy tale

684
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,180
Look at Kong Xiucai, Lin Xianggong and Mr. Bai

685
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,180
They are all scholars

686
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,180
This is the imperial family's

687
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,180
We are going to make a new one

688
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,180
Good idea

689
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,180
Kong Xiucai

690
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,180
I think the most hope is to become a new one

691
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,180
It's you

692
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,180
This piece of art is always

693
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,180
The most valuable time

694
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,180
Yu Yuelong's gate

695
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,180
No, no, no

696
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,180
This is all Lin Xianggong's peach

697
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,180
It has nothing to do with me

698
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,180
Kong Xiucai

699
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,180
I'm just in charge of teaching art

700
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,180
I'm not a painter

701
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,180
When you're really serious

702
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,180
I'll celebrate with you

703
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,180
Sit with me

704
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,180
Mr. Lin

705
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,180
Mr. Lin

706
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,180
Thank you

707
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,180
Thank you

708
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,180
Thank you

709
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:18,180
Do you know what scaldunk looking for looks like?

710
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,900
It's still made by you again.

711
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,620
What kind of an egg did you get?

712
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,620
I'm sure that old peach tree will soon be a result of its own development.

713
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,620
Bai Jiu Si, be careful not to lose.

714
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,620
Of course I won't.

715
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,620
The tree is more than a stone.

716
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,620
Bai Jiu Si, don't you forget that you're not human?

717
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,620
Why does it sound like it's scolding me?

718
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,620
Bai Jiu Si, I'm here to see you.

719
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,620
Mrs. Bai, I brought you some fruits.

720
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,620
I'm crying.

721
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,620
I'm going.

722
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,620
Hurry up.

723
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,620
Mr. Bai, this is for you.

724
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,620
For me?

725
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,620
Yes, this is for you.

726
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,620
And this.

727
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,620
I'm leaving, Mr. Bai.

728
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,620
Mr. Bai, I'm here to see you.

729
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,620
Kong Shu, I've written you a letter.

730
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:49,620
Mr. Bai, Kong Shu is six years old.

731
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:54,620
He's free and has to help the country.

732
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,620
But he's not a good lawyer.

733
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,620
Unfortunately, he's not a good lawyer.

734
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,620
He's only 53 years old.

735
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,620
He's not easy to get his name on the board.

736
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,620
But he's dead in the picture of his wife.

737
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,620
Why does God treat him so unfairly?

738
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,620
Life and death are just a matter of life and death.

739
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,620
It's not fair.

740
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,620
Why are you so cold-hearted?

741
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,620
Kong Shu is helping you as a person.

742
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,620
He's asking you to be his wife.

743
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:43,620
If I didn't pay him back,

744
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:48,620
he wouldn't have been so hard-working and dead in the picture.

745
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,620
He's dead.

746
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,620
Life and death are just a matter of life and death.

747
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,620
Even if he doesn't have the sense of honor,

748
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,620
he might not die.

749
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,620
That's different.

750
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,620
If Kong Shu was in front of me,

751
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,620
I would definitely try to save him.

752
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,620
I wouldn't have watched him die.

753
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,620
I wouldn't have died.

754
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,620
Let me ask you.

755
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620
If you knew his life was saved this year,

756
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,620
would you still save him?

757
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,620
I would.

758
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,620
But he was destined to die on that day.

759
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,620
That's God's death.

760
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,620
It wasn't me who asked him to die.

761
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,620
I wanted him to live.

762
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,620
It's my fault if I didn't save him.

763
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,620
I saved him and didn't save him.

764
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,620
It's the result's fault.

765
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:19,620
I will never forget you.

766
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,620
I said this is the cause.

767
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,620
I opened the door, but there's no end.

768
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,620
This is a mistake.

769
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,620
I'm going to return it to you.

770
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,620
I'm going to return it to you.

771
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,620
Your wine is in the yard.

772
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,620
Are you sad because of Kong Shu?

773
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,620
There are many difficulties in this world.

774
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,620
The power of the mortal is not as good as the power of the spirit.

775
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,620
There are many difficulties in this world.

776
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,620
I'm going to be sad because of the power of the mortal.

777
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,620
There are many difficulties in this world.

778
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,620
Kong Shu is the only one.

779
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,620
What do you want to say?

780
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,620
Nothing.

781
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,620
The wine is small, but it's heavy.

782
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,620
Drink it.

783
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,620
I'm going to drink it.

784
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,620
Drink it.

785
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,620
This is the wine with the fragrance of the wine in the village.

786
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,620
It's famous.

787
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:39,380
OK, if you don't mind, we'll call you.

788
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,900
I know you're soft on your heart.

789
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,180
Tell me what's so hard about Kong Shu.

790
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,580
I am not.

791
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:08,580
Actually, I'm still confused about other things other than the fear of losing.

792
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,580
Why are you looking at me?

793
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,580
As a friend, you shouldn't ask me what's wrong with me.

794
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,580
I'm not interested.

795
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,580
You're not interested?

796
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,580
You're a good person.

797
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,580
You're just a bit cold-hearted.

798
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,580
Who else would like to be friends with you besides me?

799
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,580
Would you like to be friends with someone else?

800
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,580
People are different, they have different opinions.

801
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,580
If you have a different opinion, you can also compete.

802
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,580
Fine, I'll be your friend.

803
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,580
Here.

804
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,580
I'll be your friend.

805
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,580
Tell me.

806
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,580
My wife is in a hurry.

807
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,580
She's just a father to me.

808
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
But I'm not ready yet.

809
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,580
I don't know how to treat her as a father.

810
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,580
You're free to do whatever you want.

811
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,580
Why bother yourself?

812
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,580
It's not that.

813
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,580
It's not something you can do.

814
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,580
But it's very important to me.

815
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
My parents died early.

816
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,580
They only left some property.

817
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,580
My wife married me, so it's a shame.

818
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:51,580
It was a big deal for my wife.

819
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,580
When she grew up,

820
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,580
she found out that she had a lot of elders.

821
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,580
She was the only one who didn't have one.

822
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,580
Will she feel lonely and sad?

823
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,580
When she asks me this,

824
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,580
how should I tell her?

825
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,580
How do you want to tell her?

826
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,580
I don't want my child to know these things

827
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
when he's six years old.

828
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,580
That's not possible.

829
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,580
This is true.

830
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,580
Yes.

831
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,580
There are many things that can't be changed in this world.

832
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,580
Why do you want to try it out?

833
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,580
You're not willing to do it.

834
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,580
Can you change your life if you're not willing to do it?

835
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,580
The power of the mortal is small.

836
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,580
If you can't change it, you'll be punished.

837
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,580
Otherwise, you'll be in pain all the time.

838
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,580
I don't agree with you.

839
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,580
You're not good at breaking things.

840
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,580
You don't even dare to fight.

841
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:00,580
How do you know if you're a family member or a family member?

842
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,580
You knew when you had a child.

843
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,580
As a father, you're willing to do anything for the child.

844
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,580
Even life.

845
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,580
I'm not close to you,

846
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,580
but I have a friend like you.

847
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:21,580
When I was born, you were his father.

848
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,580
When he was still young,

849
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,580
I would explain to him and give him more.

850
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,580
He wouldn't be lonely anymore.

851
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:37,580
Can I be a good father?

852
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,580
Yes.

853
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,580
Bai Xing,

854
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,580
you've known each other for so long.

855
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,580
You finally said something in the middle of the world.

856
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,580
Bai Xing,

857
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,580
I'll tell you a word of kindness.

858
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,580
I'm friends with you.

859
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,580
I think you're different from others.

860
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,580
Actually, I have a high taste.

861
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,580
I can be friends with anyone.

862
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,580
I've made three friends.

863
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,580
One is you,

864
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,580
the other is the sixth son of the shoe shop.

865
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,580
The father of the water-dryer.

866
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,580
But,

867
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,580
I think you're the most important one among these friends.

868
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,580
They all say you're a scholar,

869
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,580
and you're called Mr. Bai.

870
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,580
But I don't think so.

871
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:45,580
I think you're a group of two-dimensional people.

872
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,580
You're stubborn and stubborn.

873
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,580
You're straightforward.

874
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,580
You're not straightforward.

875
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,580
You don't like anyone at all.

876
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,580
But it's okay.

877
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,580
I like you.

878
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,580
You...

879
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,580
Don't be alone in the future.

880
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,580
If you have any difficulties,

881
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,580
please come to me.

882
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,580
What's the use of you?

883
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,580
I'll drink with you.

884
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,580
Hey!

885
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,580
Hey!

886
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,580
Hey!

887
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,580
Hey!

888
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,580
Hey!

889
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,580
Hey!

890
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,580
Fire!

891
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,580
Fire!

892
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,580
Hurry up!

893
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,580
Fire!

894
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,580
Fire!

895
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,580
Fire!

896
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,580
Fire!

897
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:31,580
I want to cry,

898
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:35,580
I still want to miss you.

899
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,580
I want to drunk this time,

900
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,580
to your arms.

901
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:48,580
I told you,

902
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:55,580
I hate you.

903
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,580
I hate you.
