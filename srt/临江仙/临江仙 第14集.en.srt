[Episode 14]

3
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,900
Hurry up, hit them—

4
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,240
Get lost! Don't let me see you again.

5
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,720
Thank you, Sir!

6
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,550
No worries.

7
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,800
Thank you, Sir.

8
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,060
Thank you, Sir, for coming to our rescue.

9
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,580
Any chance you'd want to buy my wife?

10
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,840
If you're interested,

11
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,260
I can... I can sell her—

12
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,560
Selling your own wife? Are you even human?

13
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,120
Sir!

14
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,280
Please spare me!

15
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,840
Sir!

16
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,570
Sir, I know you have a kind heart.

17
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,800
But we have no other choice.

18
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,980
If we don't get any food soon,

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,920
my two children will starve to death.

20
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,620
If they sell me,

21
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,340
at least they'll have
a few more days to live.

22
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,010
Times are tough.
If there were any other way,

23
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,560
what kind of mother would be willing

24
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,240
to suffer the pain
of being torn from her children,

25
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,480
of watching her family fall apart?

26
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,050
Hush now.

27
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,680
No more tears.

28
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,370
You're the older sister. Take this money.

29
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,550
Use it to buy some good food

30
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,080
and whatever you need to get by.

31
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,460
But promise me,
don't let your father get his hands on it.

32
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,690
Protect your mother.

33
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't let her be sold off again.

34
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,800
Get up.

35
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,520
Thank you, Sir!

36
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,440
Thank you, Sir!

37
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,720
It's precisely because times are tough

38
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,120
that we have to
work even harder to survive.

39
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,440
Sir, what's your name?

40
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,640
Thank you, Sir.

41
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,800
Wasn't I just awesome back there?

42
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,540
But being that cool has its price.

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,120
Now, our feast of delicacies

44
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,080
has turned into
steamed buns and pickles again.

45
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,120
Sir, please wait for a moment.

46
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,779
Sir, please wait for a moment.

47
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,519
From your righteous deeds, I can tell

48
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,040
you've got a noble spirit and a rare aura.

49
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,600
You're definitely cut out for cultivation.

50
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,120
Now, this blade

51
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,560
in my hand...

52
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,690
It's called Xuanze.

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,640
Legend has it that it can end droughts
and slay the Drought Dragon itself.

54
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,970
I've heard all about it.

55
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,480
Yes, Sir.

56
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,240
Normally, I'd let it go for 500 coppers.

57
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,440
But you're destined for greatness.

58
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,330
I'll give it to you for 300.

59
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,490
These are all I have.

60
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:52,960
Take them or leave them.

61
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,720
Wait, Sir.

62
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,080
Let's call this
a token of our first meeting.

63
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,060
These will do.

64
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,280
Take care, Sir.

65
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,860
Behold Xuanze, the legendary blade
that slays the Drought Dragon—

66
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,930
only 300 copper coins!

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,240
From what I just saw,

68
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
you don't seem like a bad person.

69
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
What crime did you actually commit?

70
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,290
I used to be
the sheriff of Huai'an County,

71
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,720
responsible for
catching criminals and thieves.

72
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,250
Later, a locust plague hit.

73
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,440
The common folks were starving.

74
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,320
The government
clearly had stockpiled grain,

75
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,400
and the wealthy households
had a surplus too.

76
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,260
But they kept it for themselves,
refusing to share.

77
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,440
In a fit of anger,

78
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,880
I made a deal with the prisoners—

79
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,380
we formed a grain distribution team.

80
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,940
Grain distribution team?

81
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,720
I let them all go.

82
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,960
Then we raided the Magistrate's office
and the wealthy households for grain.

83
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,020
We took over granaries big and small,

84
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,820
and handed out food to the people,
saving a lot of lives.

85
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Bet you see me in a new light now, huh?

86
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,700
I wouldn't put it quite like that.

87
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,600
But for someone
who seems pretty unreliable,

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,330
you've got a surprising sense of justice.

89
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,090
Why did you stop?

90
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,970
Songhe County is just ahead.
I can't go there.

91
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,350
Why not?

92
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,180
You don't know.

93
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,250
My grandfather works as a housekeeper
for a family in Songhe County.

94
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,280
He has a very peculiar personality.

95
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,720
Look, I've become an official,

96
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,800
and my father is a respected teacher.

97
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,950
He could have enjoyed retirement,

98
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,280
but he insists on staying in Songhe County

99
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,810
as a lifelong housekeeper.

100
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,070
Now that I'm in trouble and on the run,

101
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,680
I can't go to him at all.

102
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,860
If I cause any trouble for his master,

103
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,400
he'd probably beat me to death.

104
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,800
Then where are you going?

105
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,200
Where to go?

106
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,460
I don't know either.

107
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,800
I'll never forget
that you saved my life.

108
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,600
If fate brings us together again,
I will surely repay your kindness.

109
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
The mountains stand firm,
and the rivers run on.

110
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,520
Here, I take my leave.

111
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,880
Stop!

112
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,620
Stop!

113
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,419
Stop!

114
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,000
Fugitive Meng Changqin,
you'd better surrender now

115
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,320
and return to the capital for execution!

116
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,450
Kill me if you want, but I'm not guilty!

117
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
I absolutely won't go back with you!

118
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,110
His Majesty has already issued the edict.

119
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,330
It's not up to you to decide
whether you're guilty or not.

120
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,160
Now corrupt officials hold the reins,
twisting right into wrong.

121
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,000
You lackeys!

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,060
You can't even tell right from wrong.

123
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,000
If you've got the guts, come forward

124
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,120
and feel the edge of my blade!

125
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,660
[Order]

126
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,320
By order of the authorities,

127
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,120
we are to capture you,
the fugitive Meng Changqin.

128
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,650
If you resist,
you are to be killed on the spot.

129
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,910
Since Lord Meng is so uncooperative,

130
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,470
we have no choice
but to carry out our orders.

131
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,040
Attack!

132
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,600
You...

133
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,460
Have you had enough of meddling in

134
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,520
the trivial affairs of mortals?

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,460
Did you see the paintings
in Meng Chi's room?

136
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,250
Someone who can't even tell colors apart

137
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,730
managed to create such vivid masterpieces.

138
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,290
It's truly astonishing, even to the gods.

139
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,820
What does that have to do with you?

140
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,630
I'm just saying,

141
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,960
maybe we've underestimated mortals
all along.

142
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,960
But that's no reason for you

143
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,640
to interfere in their lives.

144
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,080
Sometimes I feel like
you have a heart of stone.

145
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,940
I want to go.

146
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,030
If I say I don't want you to go,

147
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,790
what will you choose?

148
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,440
-Where is he?
-Where is he?

149
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,260
Drink some water before you go on.

150
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Cut me some slack, will you?

151
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,290
I went through a lot to find this water.

152
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,960
Why can't you just
show a little appreciation?

153
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,880
I'm meditating to steady my breath.

154
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,200
Can you be quiet?

155
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,010
I'm just worried about you.

156
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,720
Besides,

157
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,400
are all enlightened ones
really as weak as you?

158
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,560
You look so frail
after just summoning a gust of wind.

159
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,160
If you used some kind of

160
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,420
life-reviving magic,

161
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,680
wouldn't you just...

162
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,490
pass out right away?

163
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,800
Summoning the wind and sand

164
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,920
is like stealing the power
of creation from the universe.

165
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,200
You're defying the heavens.

166
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,760
It's only natural
that your power is fading.

167
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,920
I... I understand.

168
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,590
Once you've almost recovered,
we'll set off.

169
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,860
Why are you in such a hurry?

170
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,620
You don't understand.

171
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,800
Those constables are like bloodhounds.

172
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,060
They'll latch onto any scent they catch.

173
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,880
You can put your mind at ease.

174
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,940
We're now in the northern territory,

175
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,740
300 miles away from Huai'an County
in the south.

176
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,650
Even if they rode four horses at once,
they couldn't catch up to you.

177
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,490
300 miles away?

178
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,010
Master,

179
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,600
you really are something, huh?

180
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,120
When did I become your master?

181
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,840
Just now,
when you drank the ceremonial water.

182
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,150
Ceremonial water?

183
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,170
Yup.

184
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,450
In my hometown, when we take on a master,

185
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,080
we pick a lucky day,
write a letter of apprenticeship,

186
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,010
serve tea to the master,
and go through the ceremony.

187
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,520
But we're in a tough spot right now,

188
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,360
and resources are tight.

189
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,880
We have to make do with what we've got.

190
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,490
I can only offer you
a bowl of hot water

191
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,840
to show my sincerity.

192
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,400
You never said it was ceremonial water.

193
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,970
I...

194
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,930
Didn't I?

195
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,080
Even if I hadn't said anything,

196
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,400
you should've known.

197
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,120
Aren't you an enlightened one?

198
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,080
I've heard that

199
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,000
you enlightened ones can read minds

200
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,840
with nothing more than
a single passing thought.

201
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,320
Since you drank the ceremonial water,

202
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,380
doesn't that mean
you've accepted me as your disciple?

203
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,460
You don't look like an official to me;

204
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,730
more like some street punk.

205
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,760
I don't care.
The moment you drank that water,

206
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,120
you took me in.

207
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
No take-backs.

208
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,400
I'll go find some food
to show my respect to you now.

209
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,060
Wait for me.

210
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,860
Meng Changqin.

211
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,320
Meng Changqin!

212
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,630
He hasn't returned yet?

213
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,160
Meng Changqin.

214
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,440
Master.

215
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,370
What are you doing just sitting there?

216
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,600
Didn't you say
you were going out to find food?

217
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,400
So where is it?

218
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
This village's been hit by drought.

219
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,810
There's not a single soul left.

220
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,940
I searched the whole place

221
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,880
and couldn't find
even a single grain of rice.

222
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,680
Just dead rats everywhere.

223
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,320
They must've all fled
because of the disaster.

224
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,640
Running from famine?

225
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,850
That's just how the world is.

226
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,080
But where can they really go?

227
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,120
They're just trading

228
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,680
one kind of misery for another.

229
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,560
Don't.

230
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,120
Most of the people in this village

231
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,610
are poor folks who live off hard labor.

232
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,320
Now with this severe drought,
the harvest has completely failed.

233
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,780
They have no money or food.

234
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
Even if they run away,

235
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,080
they'll still be without a home or food.

236
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,570
Better to starve at home

237
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,680
than to perish as strangers
in a foreign land.

238
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,480
At least their souls
can return to their homeland.

239
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,440
The dead are gone,
but the living must carry on.

240
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,300
Master, let's go somewhere else.

241
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,370
If we're lucky,
we might even catch a wild rabbit.

242
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,650
Alright.

243
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,380
What are you doing?

244
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,160
It's too stuffy inside,
so I'm letting it get some sun.

245
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,420
Take care of yourself.

246
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,380
We weren't very lucky today.

247
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,170
We only managed to gather some mushrooms.

248
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,600
One, two, three, four,

249
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,560
five, six, seven.

250
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,600
Master, I have a question.

251
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,040
Among the cultivators,

252
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,360
are there really people
who successfully become immortals?

253
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,280
Of course.

254
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,760
As far as I know,
there are at least hundreds

255
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,440
of human cultivators in the Nine Heavens.

256
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,560
Hundreds? That many?

257
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,300
Where do they all live?

258
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,920
They transcend the six realms
and leave the mortal world behind.

259
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,840
Naturally, they reside
in the immortal realm—

260
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
the Nine Heavens.

261
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,840
The Nine Heavens?

262
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,490
What kind of place is that?

263
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,810
Is it different from the mortal realm?

264
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,120
Do those immortals

265
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,720
struggle to

266
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,440
get by like us?

267
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,160
Immortals have spiritual energy
to protect them.

268
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,270
They don't need to
worry about daily survival.

269
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,600
For most immortals, their biggest concern

270
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,360
is probably just finding ways

271
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,610
to entertain themselves
through the endless years.

272
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,640
Heaven's really unfair.

273
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,380
Immortals have spiritual energy
protecting them.

274
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,780
They don't eat or drink,
yet they never die.

275
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,320
But we mortals are just flesh and blood.

276
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,200
We feel pain, get hurt,

277
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,210
fall sick, and eventually die.

278
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,600
You see, just to survive,

279
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,760
we have to give it everything we've got.

280
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,420
But they...

281
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,360
Master, you're an enlightened one.

282
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,080
Tell me, we burn so much incense
every day,

283
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,410
kowtow again and again—

284
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,760
can the immortals really feel any of it?

285
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,440
The deities of the Nine Heavens
each have their duties.

286
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,120
If your heart is sincere,
they will sense it.

287
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,000
I see.

288
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,560
So they really can feel it.

289
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,650
But if they can,

290
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,720
why do they choose not to help us?

291
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,820
Why leave us to suffer,

292
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,840
drifting through life
in hardship and pain?

293
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,200
What a screwed-up world we live in.

294
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,530
We're human, aren't we?

295
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,040
Then why are we scraping by
on weeds and scraps,

296
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,570
living worse than animals?

297
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,520
If gods really exist,

298
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,250
then so do monsters
like the Drought Dragon, don't they?

299
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,620
And if those gods can't even
help the people,

300
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,020
why should we put
our faith in them at all?

301
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,760
From today on,

302
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,160
I only believe in myself.

303
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,400
Master,

304
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,000
you're up so early.

305
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,490
It's getting late. We'd better get going.

306
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,560
I'm not fully awake yet.
I need to sleep a bit more.

307
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,090
I won't see you off, Master.

308
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,640
Are you sure you won't come back
to Songhe County with me?

309
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,880
I said I won't go, so I won't.

310
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,660
Your grandfather works for
a very well-off family.

311
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,240
If you sincerely ask them,

312
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,440
they might be kind enough to take you in.

313
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,690
I still won't go.

314
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,160
You've been separated
from your grandfather for many years.

315
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,560
Don't you want to see him?

316
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,610
When my father passed away,

317
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,610
I was busy dealing with a locust plague

318
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,080
and didn't make it back in time
to see him one last time.

319
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,720
As for my grandfather,

320
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,820
I've barely seen him
since I was old enough to remember.

321
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,970
I guess I'll never be
a truly filial son in this lifetime.

322
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,500
I've failed in my duty as a son.

323
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,800
But now,

324
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,890
I have more important things to do.

325
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,610
Master, what are you doing?

326
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,480
Since you insist,

327
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,600
I won't try to persuade you anymore.

328
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,660
The journey is long and arduous.
Take care of yourself.

329
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,400
Master.

330
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,950
Have you changed your mind?

331
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,330
Master, I wanted to ask you.

332
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,900
The Drought Dragon really exists
in this world,

333
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,940
doesn't it?

334
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,880
Perhaps.

335
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,120
My Lady!

336
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,400
My Lady.

337
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,180
You've finally returned.

338
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Where's Bai Jiusi?

339
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,100
Sir left a message for you.

340
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,240
He said there was something
very important.

341
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,160
If you're unwilling to do it,
he'll entrust it to someone else.

342
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,290
I don't understand.

343
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,810
Did you two have a fight?

344
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,280
Where is he?

345
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,120
I think he went north of the city.

346
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Smell this.

347
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,770
It's so fragrant.

348
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,400
This one smells good too.

349
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,520
Let's pick a few more.

350
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,050
Alright.

351
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,980
Excuse me, Sir, may I ask
what line of work you're in?

352
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,440
Where do you live?

353
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,040
How many servants and maids
do you have at home?

354
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,520
When you go out,
how many attendants accompany you?

355
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,240
Do you usually travel
by sedan chair or on horseback?

356
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,520
I currently run a shop.

357
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,150
I live in Wangshu Lane,
over on the east side of the city.

358
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,440
There aren't many servants at home,
and I usually go out alone.

359
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,380
Wangshu Lane in the east?

360
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,240
That place is too remote.

361
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,460
It's almost in the suburbs.

362
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,840
The property there can't be worth much,
can it?

363
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,760
Mrs. Wang,

364
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,510
Mr. Bai values peace and quiet.

365
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,930
That's why he chose that location.

366
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,850
It may be a bit out of the way,

367
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,360
but the scenery there is truly lovely.

368
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,160
Besides,

369
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,620
it's a large mansion
with seven courtyards.

370
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,730
I went to take a look yesterday.

371
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,120
Though I didn't go in,
just stood outside and glanced from afar,

372
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,610
the gardens, the greenery,
the rockeries, the flowing streams—

373
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,670
honestly, it's no less grand
than the squire's estate.

374
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,840
They say good feng shui
nurtures good people.

375
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,640
Your daughter has grown up
to be so fair and lovely.

376
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,970
With the spiritual energy
of this blessed land,

377
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,100
she's bound to become
even more beautiful and graceful.

378
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,410
Sir, have you been appointed
to an official post yet?

379
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,800
No, I haven't.

380
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,960
Mr. Bai is still so young,

381
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,040
yet even without an official title,

382
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,920
he's already made quite a fortune.

383
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,040
That alone speaks to his ability.

384
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,840
Madam, just look.

385
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,240
Mr. Bai is

386
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,640
handsome, poised,

387
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,700
and carries himself with such grace.

388
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,860
Not only in Songhe County,

389
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,650
but also in Shangjing City,

390
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,520
his looks, presence, and demeanor

391
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,080
would make him stand out among the best.

392
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,880
But can good looks feed you?

393
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,560
Those young masters in Shangjing

394
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,720
always have at least

395
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,360
three or five attendants
trailing behind them.

396
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,280
Their mansions span seven courtyards

397
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,520
in prime locations
with sky-high land prices.

398
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,040
And if you look back
three generations in their family trees,

399
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,300
every one of them held a government post.

400
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,440
Such people,

401
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,970
even if they're not particularly
good-looking,

402
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,280
are still considered outstanding.

403
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Mr. Bai, wouldn't you agree?

404
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,060
In matchmaking,
what matters most is mutual consent.

405
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,880
Why are they arguing?

406
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,920
They're not arguing. The young master

407
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,400
is on a blind date with that young lady.

408
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,230
He's so handsome.

409
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,040
That lady's mother must be blind.

410
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,560
Matchmaking?

411
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,500
You can't put it like that.

412
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,320
I've been a matchmaker for years.

413
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,680
I always pair people based on looks

414
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,120
and family background.

415
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,240
I would never make such absurd matches,
pairing a noble family with a poor one

416
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,640
or an upright official
with a mere butcher.

417
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,520
Madam, let's talk a little more.

418
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,360
When it comes to matchmaking,
the more you talk, the more sparks fly.

419
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,680
Miss, don't you agree?

420
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,370
What are you talking about?

421
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,540
How can men and women
be compared so lightly?

422
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,480
I've raised my daughter with great care—
she's not only beautiful and well-behaved,

423
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,000
but also well-versed
in the arts and literature.

424
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,240
She excels in
embroidery and household management too.

425
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,760
With all these qualities

426
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,520
and family background to match,

427
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,080
never mind the young masters in Shangjing,

428
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,680
even if it were royalty,
she'd still be a perfect match.

429
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,240
Yes, that's for sure.

430
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,900
I thought you went out
on some serious business.

431
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,440
Miss...

432
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,240
I never expected
you'd come here for matchmaking.

433
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,800
Even if you're looking for someone new,

434
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,640
shouldn't you at least
tell your wife first?

435
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,510
So you two are teaming up to trick me!

436
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,600
You actually want my daughter
to be his concubine?

437
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,160
Mother.

438
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,160
It's all a misunderstanding.

439
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,200
A huge one!

440
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,360
I... I just found out too!

441
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,120
Mr. Bai, you should've made things clear
before the matchmaking.

442
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,200
Now you've put me
in such an awkward position.

443
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,600
How am I supposed
to face anyone after this?

444
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,680
You scoundrel!

445
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,600
I knew you were no good!

446
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,620
You scoundrel!

447
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,330
Let's go! We're going home.

448
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,840
I'll find you someone even better.

449
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,160
Mrs. Wang!

450
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,240
Y-You're going to ruin my reputation

451
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,760
as the best matchmaker in all of Songhe!

452
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,920
You didn't say it was for
taking a concubine before you came.

453
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,050
How can taking a concubine
be the same as marrying a wife?

454
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,450
I'm not taking a concubine.

455
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,620
Then...

456
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,440
That's even more reason
to mention it beforehand.

457
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,840
For a marriage like this,

458
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,660
shouldn't you ask for
the young lady's consent?

459
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,970
Besides,

460
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,770
you’re turning to a matchmaker
before even sorting out your own affairs.

461
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,500
No wonder...

462
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,760
No wonder Mrs. Wang is furious with you.

463
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:34,760
Sir, your situation is really complicated.

464
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,920
So it can't be done?

465
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,800
It can.

466
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,240
But it'll cost extra.

467
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,400
Sir, don't worry.

468
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,440
Leave it to me.

469
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,640
I promise I'll find you
the perfect, fairy-like girl.

470
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,200
Be at Lanyue House tomorrow—don't miss it!

471
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,480
Why are you looking at me like that?

472
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,430
We've been friends for years, haven't we?

473
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,430
Of course I'll help you find a match.

474
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,760
At first glance,
everything seems just right.

475
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,220
But the more I look at it,

476
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,450
why does it still feel like
something's missing?

477
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,340
You must remember,

478
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,160
you're the young lady of a noble family.

479
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,180
Carry yourself with more grace.

480
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,440
Sit properly.

481
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,020
This... This outfit needs to
be changed too.

482
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,320
Alright.

483
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,239
Why are you even naggier than my mother?

484
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,360
Tell me,
what kind of woman does that man like?

485
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,800
Does he go for
the gentle, soft-spoken type,

486
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,480
or the bold, fiery kind?

487
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,880
He only had one request.

488
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,400
He said he wanted the most beautiful,

489
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,320
kindest, and purest woman in the world.

490
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,080
I get what kindest means,

491
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,480
but what do you think

492
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,639
beautiful and pure really mean?

493
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,639
You don't need to figure that out.

494
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,920
When men come to a brothel
looking for girls,

495
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,449
they all say the same thing.

496
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,440
Looks like he's already in the bag.

497
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,920
Fresh flowers!

498
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
Sir, you're here.

499
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,520
Come on in.

500
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,980
Please have a seat.

501
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,460
She'll be here any moment.

502
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,440
Here.

503
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,000
Miss, you've arrived too.

504
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,480
Miss,

505
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,460
please take the seat of honor.

506
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:13,680
Here.

507
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,680
Don't mind me. Go ahead and talk.

508
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,760
I won't interrupt.

509
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,250
Alright.

510
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,240
Here she is.

511
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,760
I just went to get some wine.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Sir.

512
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,120
Allow me to pour you a drink
to make up for it.

513
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,180
I hope you won't find me lacking, Sir.

514
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
I can do it myself.

515
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,960
Here you go, Sir.

516
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,400
Miss, are you alright?

517
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,480
I'm truly sorry, Sir.

518
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,240
Miss.

519
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,320
Miss, you look unwell.

520
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,240
You're struggling
just to stay on your feet.

521
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,840
You'd better sit down quickly.

522
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,960
Come on, sit down.

523
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,020
We can talk while having the meal.

524
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,900
Go on, dig in.

525
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,800
Here.

526
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,680
Here, Sir, try it.

527
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,880
I can manage on my own.

528
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,920
Go ahead.

529
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,240
Is the meat not fresh?

530
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,890
Should I ask the waiter
to replace it?

531
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,920
No need. It's fresh.

532
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,030
Then eat some more.

533
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,000
Come on, Sir.

534
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,480
Wan.

535
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,070
I... I'll go take a look.

536
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,480
Wan.

537
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,480
Waiter!

538
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,480
Coming.

539
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,080
Is the food at your restaurant not fresh?

540
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,720
She got sick after eating it!

541
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,120
Madam, please don't make
such reckless accusations.

542
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,720
Our restaurant has been
operating for years.

543
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,640
There's no way
our food would make anyone sick.

544
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,970
Reckless accusations?

545
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,240
She was perfectly fine before!

546
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,120
But after just one bite of meat,
she threw up.

547
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,380
If your food isn't to blame, then what is?

548
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,280
Fine, you don't want to admit it, huh?

549
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,840
Then let's take this to the authorities.

550
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,300
We'll settle this in court

551
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,020
and see who's really at fault.

552
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,720
Don't, Madam, I...

553
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,720
I'll be fine after a little rest.

554
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,960
What do you mean by that?

555
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,240
It's his food that's the problem!

556
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,520
A little rest?
Sounds like someone's feeling guilty.

557
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,280
You folks must be new to Songhe County,

558
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,320
so you don't know the rules around here.

559
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,640
Every day, people come to our restaurant,

560
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,170
trying to score a free meal.

561
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,920
Don't make fools of yourselves

562
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,600
with such petty tricks.

563
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,520
Just pay up honestly,

564
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,320
so your names don't end up
in the official records.

565
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,120
What?

566
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,290
What did you say?

567
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,720
You're saying
we're trying to get a free meal?

568
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,920
In all of Songhe County,

569
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,080
have you not heard of me,

570
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,540
Madam Li, the matchmaker?

571
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,880
Y-You think I'd come here
just to mooch a free meal?

572
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,830
Go find a physician to check on her.

573
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,500
If her stomach's upset

574
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,960
because of your food,

575
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,040
I'll make sure you pay
until you're bankrupt!

576
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,440
I'll go right away!

577
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:55,960
Go!

578
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,800
Waiter, don't bother.

579
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,400
It's nothing.

580
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,280
What do you mean by "don't bother?"

581
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,400
Go now!

582
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,730
Fine, we're calling a physician today

583
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,040
and reporting this to the authorities.

584
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,320
Let's go.

585
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,640
How dare you raise your voice at me?

586
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,440
Do you have any idea
how important my clients are today?

587
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,680
I'll make you pay for ruining my plans!

588
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,160
What are you doing?

589
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,760
You're bullying us
just because your business is big.

590
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,640
How dare you hit me!

591
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,100
We must report this today!

592
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,800
Didn't you say you wanted to report it?
Then go!

593
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,440
Go ahead!

594
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,680
Pot calling the kettle black, huh?

595
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,320
Let go of me!

596
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,450
-You...
-Cut it out.

597
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
Don't interfere.

598
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,080
I said stop it.

599
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,760
There's nothing wrong with the food.

600
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,560
It's me.

601
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,170
What do you mean?

602
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,840
I'm pregnant.

603
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:54,130
[Lanyue House]

604
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,660
Well...

605
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,040
Mr. Bai.

606
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:54,960
Mr. Bai,

607
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,660
please don't be angry.

608
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,960
I didn't know she

609
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,380
was already pregnant.

610
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,960
Besides, just like you...

611
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
I also didn't know

612
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,340
you were already married, right?

613
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
I'm not angry.

614
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,080
I just feel that if this keeps going,

615
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,760
I'll never find
the person I'm looking for.

616
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,440
Then, Sir,

617
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,850
what kind of woman are you looking for?

618
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,090
Why don't you tell me in detail?

619
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,680
Are you looking for someone
with a graceful and dignified appearance,

620
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,640
or more of a sweet, delicate charm?

621
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,280
Do you prefer
a gentle and kind personality,

622
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,370
or someone bold, spirited,
and playfully charming?

623
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,560
What about her family background?
Her figure?

624
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,760
Would it bother you
if she had a past relationship?

625
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,970
I don't know either.

626
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,020
I just feel that
when I meet the right person,

627
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,560
I'll know it the moment I see her.

628
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,680
Mr. Bai, I'll be honest with you.

629
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,320
I've been matchmaking for ten years.

630
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,960
Maybe not a hundred couples,

631
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
but I've matched

632
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,640
dozens at least.

633
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:08,960
And I've

634
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,560
never met someone as picky as you.

635
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,480
No one seems good enough.

636
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,200
You're not from an official family,

637
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,680
and you have no parents or siblings
to support you.

638
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,880
Yet you insist on
finding the most beautiful,

639
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,440
most perfect woman in the world.

640
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,770
Honestly, I have no idea

641
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,340
where you get the confidence.

642
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,600
This one looks good too.

643
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,400
Let's take this one.

644
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:53,920
Boss,

645
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,410
how much is this?

646
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,480
In my opinion,

647
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,440
the two girls the matchmaker found for you

648
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,500
are not that great.

649
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,240
That courtesan who faked a pregnancy
to trap you into marriage

650
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,900
needs no further discussion.

651
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,560
And as for Miss Wang from the teahouse—

652
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,490
sure, she's gentle and beautiful,

653
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,020
but her mother is a real piece of work.

654
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,440
Even if you did marry her,

655
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,970
you'd be in for no end of trouble
down the line.

656
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,580
Here you go.

657
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,060
Be careful.

658
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,200
Thank you, Sir.

659
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,200
Let's continue playing.

660
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,320
Pass it to me.

661
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,120
Weren't you saving someone too?

662
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,070
Why is it that you can save others,

663
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,320
but I can't save Meng Changqin?

664
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,250
It's different.

665
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,410
How is it different?

666
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,360
Meng Changqin will bring you danger.
