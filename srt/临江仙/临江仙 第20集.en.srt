[Episode 20]

3
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,120
Uncle Bai.

4
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,710
Uncle Bai. Uncle Bai!

5
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:02,120
Uncle Bai, our peach tree
has borne fruit again.

6
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,870
I brought two for you to try.

7
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,650
Here's one for you.

8
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,230
The city has been unsafe lately.

9
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,190
Don't come running here anymore,

10
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,920
understand?

11
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,380
Uncle Bai, you're an immortal.

12
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,910
I'm safest hiding here with you.

13
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,840
Did my mother tell you not to see me?

14
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,910
My mother just thinks that

15
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm constantly troubling you, Uncle Bai,

16
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,910
so she told me not to look for you too.

17
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,750
But I am not going to listen to her.

18
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,079
Uncle Bai, you are my favorite person.

19
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,960
Among all my friends,

20
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,470
you're the one I value the most.

21
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,000
It's enough that I like you.

22
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,520
Uncle Bai, you mustn't be angry
with my mother.

23
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,360
As you know,

24
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,960
she's raised me all by herself
since I was little.

25
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,820
The fact that I don't have a father

26
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,590
has caused her a lot of hardship.

27
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,310
Uncle Bai... I often wonder

28
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,690
how nice it would be
if you were my father.

29
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,660
Are you asleep?

30
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,240
Come in.

31
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,570
What are you doing?

32
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,070
Tao has grown up.

33
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,600
All the hats I had made for him
are too tight now.

34
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,190
I happened to have some free time today,

35
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,650
so I'm making him a new one.

36
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,830
The lines are crisp
and the stitches are tight.

37
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,670
You have excellent craftsmanship indeed.

38
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,380
You picked this up during
your 10 years in the mortal realm?

39
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,280
What did you come to see me about?

40
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,200
I want to have a chat with you.

41
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,850
About what?

42
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,240
My reflections after 6 years
in the mortal realm.

43
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,270
People always say heaven is heartless,

44
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,340
but are immortals heartless too?

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,600
I really didn't know before.

46
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,980
Perhaps this is merely the immortals' way
of protecting themselves.

47
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,030
After all, human life is
but a fleeting moment.

48
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,120
If one truly empathizes with them,

49
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,659
you'll only end up hurting yourself.

50
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,680
Just like your feelings for Lin Fan?

51
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,070
It's the same with your feelings
for the three generations

52
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,130
of the Meng family.

53
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,820
When it's time for goodbyes,
you’re the only one left hurting.

54
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,160
This is a very profound theory,
and I'd rather not say more.

55
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,020
We each have our own paths.

56
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,830
We can't convince each other.

57
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,510
I'm even less willing to listen to others.

58
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,000
I've always been following my own path.

59
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,630
And that is to protect you
and make you happy.

60
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,830
These 10 years we've spent
in the mortal realm,

61
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,780
for us, it's just a blink of an eye.

62
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,190
As you have the body of a true god,

63
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,510
I've always felt that

64
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,360
even though you have lost your power,

65
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,159
you would still be immortal,
never dying or aging.

66
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,270
But in these 6 years,

67
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,600
I've come to understand
the mortal realm clearly.

68
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,950
You now...

69
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,380
know how to do laundry,

70
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,560
and can sew and cook.

71
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,520
But you, who were once by my side,

72
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,800
knew nothing at all.

73
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,940
During the 10 years I sealed your powers,

74
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,640
what exactly did you endure?

75
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,980
A mortal life lasts just a hundred years,

76
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,800
filled with moments of joy and sorrow
through life, death, and illness.

77
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,750
In a brief hundred years,
moments of joy feel fleeting.

78
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,940
But in times of sorrow,

79
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,540
it feels like thousands of years.

80
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,360
Yue.

81
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,920
I know you're reluctant to
talk about the past.

82
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,630
Perhaps you think

83
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,390
I don’t understand the hardships
of the mortal realm.

84
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,320
But now, I've personally experienced it
for 6 years.

85
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,240
Can you tell me...

86
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,669
why do you hate me so much?

87
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,300
In the 10 years you abandoned me
in the mortal world,

88
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
I was suffering.

89
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,830
It was a lot...

90
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,240
a lot of hardship.

91
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,840
But that's all in the past now.

92
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,480
What's most pressing now is
the evil spirit in the city.

93
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,720
Once we've dealt with it,

94
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,870
I'll tell you about what I've experienced

95
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,070
over the past 10 years

96
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,600
in detail.

97
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,100
How's that?

98
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,960
Alright.

99
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,820
I'll wait for you.

100
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,600
It's getting late.
You should go back and rest.

101
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,560
We still need to search for
the evil spirit tomorrow.

102
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,810
Rest early yourself.

103
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,510
Hand over my Master!

104
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,000
Master?

105
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,080
How is Master?

106
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,700
It's not looking good.

107
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,610
Master has been severely injured.

108
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,250
Where is Senior Long Yuan?

109
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,760
He had already left.

110
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,790
Left? Where is he going?

111
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,000
To the mortal realm for Jingyun Sect.

112
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,960
He said he's going to retrieve
the Heavenly Lord's primordial spirit.

113
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,290
Why didn't you stop him?

114
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,480
He was sure it was Divine Lord Siling

115
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,390
who had captured
Heavenly Lord's primordial spirit.

116
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,030
He's determined to go to
Jingyun Sect for revenge.

117
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,160
I couldn't stop him.

118
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,600
Although our Master and Divine Lord Siling
shares a grudge,

119
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,280
the Divine Lord is still
the most important person in his heart.

120
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,680
If we harm Jingyun Sect,

121
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,440
there will be no chance
for reconciliation between them.

122
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,380
Such a woman is not worthy of Master.

123
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,310
It wouldn't be much of a pity
if they don't reconcile.

124
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,840
It's not for us to decide
if she's worthy or not.

125
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,780
As we are of service to Master,

126
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,770
even if we can't help him,
we shouldn't harm him.

127
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,940
What do you suggest, Senior?

128
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,400
Withdraw our forces.

129
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,720
Wait quietly for our Master's return
before making any decisions.

130
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,120
Immortal Lord Long Yuan is leading
this mission.

131
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,750
We'll stay behind to protect
the Heavenly Lord.

132
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,350
If you want to stop him,
go talk to him yourself.

133
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,650
Alright.

134
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,600
All of you should stay careful.

135
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,360
Is anyone home?

136
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Is anyone home?

137
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,630
Goldie.

138
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,360
What is it?

139
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,550
He is the evil spirit.

140
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,750
Nonsense!

141
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,550
We've been in Songhe County

142
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,010
much longer than you have.

143
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,280
Yet the moment you arrived,
the evil spirit showed up too.

144
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,440
When I fought with
the evil spirit previously,

145
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,630
I injured its neck.

146
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,360
Someone witnessed it too.

147
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,630
We can easily find out if Mr. Bai
is the evil spirit or not.

148
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,570
If Mr. Bai isn't the evil spirit,

149
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,600
then let us take a look.

150
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,750
Yes, let us see!

151
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,510
Yes, let us see!

152
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,360
What are you afraid of?

153
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,120
Fine, come in and see.

154
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,080
-Let's go!
-Go!

155
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,510
Go!

156
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:14,870
We'll go in too.

157
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,930
Let's go, let's go.

158
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,840
Let's see it personally.

159
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,110
-Let's go. Hurry.
-Let's go.

160
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,680
He's right here.

161
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,260
-W-What's wrong?
-What is this?

162
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,080
-What is this?
-What's going on?

163
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,300
This... this is...

164
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,040
Let's go.

165
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,890

-Kill the evil spirit!
-Kill him!

492
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,630
Kill this evil spirit!

493
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,800
We'll know if he's the evil spirit
once we test him.

494
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,970
The evil spirit has appeared
and has been killing the innocent.

495
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,590
Today, I've captured this evil spirit

496
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:20,250
so that I can rid Songhe County
of this calamity.

497
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,230
If heaven is just,
may it send a divine lightning

498
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:27,160
and incinerate this evil spirit
with karmic flames.

499
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,230
Look!

500
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:40,900
Don't look!

501
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,110
I can't believe this Mr. Bai
really is the evil spirit.

502
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,550
I humbly request Master Xiaoyaozi

503
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,840
to continue with
slaying this evil spirit for us.

504
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:59,380
-Slay the evil spirit!
-Slay the evil spirit!

505
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,840
-Slay the evil spirit!
-Slay the evil spirit!

506
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,230
Uncle Bai is not the evil spirit!
Uncle Bai is not the evil spirit!

507
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,290
-Uncle Bai is not evil!
-Tao, stop it.

508
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,000
-Uncle Bai is not evil!
-Tao.

509
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,590
You don't understand. He's a bad person.

510
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,110
-Uncle Bai is not evil!
-Tao.

511
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,920
Shi Hua, quickly take the child away.

512
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,550
-Tao.
-Uncle Bai is not evil!

513
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,670
Uncle Bai is not the evil spirit!

514
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,440
Lin Tao.

515
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,230
Uncle Bai is not the evil spirit!

516
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:29,190
Uncle Bai... Uncle Bai is not
the evil spirit!

517
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,230
Uncle Bai is not the evil spirit.

518
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,800
Kill him! Kill him!

519
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,110
Uncle Bai is not the evil spirit.

520
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,190
Tao!

521
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,670
-Uncle Bai!
-Tao, listen to me.

522
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,280
-Lin Tao! Lin Tao! Don't go there!
-Uncle Bai is not evil!

523
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,000
Lin Tao!

524
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:43,670
Tao!

525
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,870
-Uncle Bai!
-Don't go there. Come back!

526
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:45,670
-Don't come over!
-Lin Tao!

527
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:48,110
Uncle Bai, I'm here to save you.

528
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,810
Let the heavenly thunder descend
and vanquish the evil spirit!

529
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,280
-Uncle Bai!
-Tao! Tao!

530
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,610
Lin Tao!

531
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,030
-Tao!
-Tao!

532
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,590
Lin Tao!

533
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:07,670
Tao!

534
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:09,550
Tao!

535
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,400
-Tao!
-Tao!

536
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,760
Tao!

537
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,000
Tao!

538
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,480
Tao!

539
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,240
-Tao!
-Tao!

540
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,250
Tao, open your eyes and look at me!

541
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,070
Mr. Guo, what's happening to Tao?

542
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:27,800
Tao.

543
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,880
Tao!

544
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,110
Tao!

545
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,320
Tao!

546
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,400
Tao!

547
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,850
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

548
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,670
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

549
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,800
-Slay the evil spirit!
-Slay the evil spirit!

550
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,440
-Slay the evil spirit!
-Slay the evil spirit!

551
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,940
Kill him! Kill him!

552
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:00,540
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

553
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,300
Kill this evil spirit!

554
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,810
Kill this evil spirit!

555
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,190
Kill this evil spirit!

556
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:14,880
Kill this evil spirit! Kill him!

557
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,440
You've been hiding behind for so long.

558
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,960
It's time to come out, isn't it?

559
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,590
Kill him! Kill him!

560
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:28,030
You evil spirit, what nonsense
are you spouting now?

561
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:31,400
The evil spirit is now dead,
yet the barrier remains.

562
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,370
This proves it was never
the core of the formation,

563
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:36,700
nor was it the one
who set up the formation.

564
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,770
All these years,

565
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,940
who else could have
so meticulously plotted

566
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,960
to kill me?

567
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,630
-We can't let this evil spirit go!
-Kill him!

568
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,360
Kill him!
