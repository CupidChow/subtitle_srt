1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Will this being the end and the fruits of God's years statement?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,200
Karie, you died like a beauty.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,420
So hilarious.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,720
You won't just say he died

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,520
to kotatsu or arrive at home.

6
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,520
fish

7
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,800
Deng exhaustion

8
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,540
Forgetting the wrong

9
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Solve your kind

10
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,260
the flower

11
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
There is no love

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,240
There is hatred

13
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
I hate you.

14
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,440
I don't want to hear

15
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,640
your nonsense.

16
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,560
Get out.

17
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,280
Do you want to hear

18
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,360
your master's story?

19
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,240
I once liked a man.

20
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,960
He was very nice to me.

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,520
But I was young and didn't know love.

22
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,640
I always used the way to hurt him

23
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,840
to test his feelings for me.

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,320
I hurt him all over.

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,360
In the end,

26
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,880
he chose to leave.

27
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,440
Actually, he loves me very much.

28
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,480
I love him very much, too.

29
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,720
When I figured it out,

30
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,400
I went to him again.

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,440
But I found out

32
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,640
he had left the world long ago.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,480
I can't find

34
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,960
such a man in the world.

35
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,920
So,

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,520
you should sit down

37
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,680
and have a good talk.

38
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,920
The meaning of the meaning of

39
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,240
the female frog's story

40
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,240
is here.

41
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,760
If I remember correctly,

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,280
you said

43
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,160
you like a man,

44
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,800
but he is a heartless man.

45
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,120
He gave you everything

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
to someone else.

47
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,000
You left in a fit of anger.

48
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,040
Really?

49
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,240
Have I said that?

50
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,800
You must have mistaken.

51
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,120
Tuo'er. Tuo'er.

52
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,440
Do you know

53
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,680
why I like drinking?

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,360
You want to tell a story again?

55
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,360
Yes.

56
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,600
Your master and I

57
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,280
are timid.

58
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,160
I like someone,

59
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,280
but I dare not tell him.

60
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,720
I dare to secretly

61
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,600
put a bunch of flowers

62
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
at the door of his residence.

63
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,280
I picked up

64
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,400
all the flowers on the mountain.

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,240
From then on,

66
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,160
I went around

67
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,880
and found new flowers

68
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,360
and put them at his door.

69
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,080
I drink all day long

70
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,680
because I hope that

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,080
I can be bolder after drinking.

72
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,840
Next time I see him,

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,520
I'll tell him that I like him.

74
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,240
It's a pity.

75
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,680
Your master and I are talented.

76
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
The more we drink, the more sober we are.

77
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,960
You can't help me be bolder.

78
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,920
This time it's true.

79
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,360
This time it's also fake.

80
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,560
My good disciple.

81
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,160
Don't learn from your master

82
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,480
and just open your mouth.

83
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,520
You can't say what you want to say.

84
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,880
Wherever your jestem,

85
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,560
I'll always be there for you.

86
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,240
I didn't come to find you.

87
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,540
Su Xing,

88
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,240
айтel ​​ vitamins

89
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:26,860
L在

90
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,120
It still must be me.

91
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,780
If it's a bad person,

92
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,120
she definitely doesn't can just find you out.

93
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,960
I'm here.

94
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,960
This second master is a god.

95
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,440
He passed away 600 years ago.

96
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,560
Master Xuan,

97
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,840
why are you looking for them now?

98
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,840
600 years ago.

99
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,840
Yes.

100
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,560
It's the same day.

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,120
Do you know which day it is?

102
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,400
It's the day

103
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,840
when Lord Qing Xu surrounded the Thunder Bird.

104
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,760
They were injured a lot.

105
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
They are in it.

106
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,920
The Renhe Immortal who passed away 600 years ago

107
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,120
couldn't have appeared 400 years ago.

108
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,520
Of course.

109
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,120
The Immortal passed away

110
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,360
and disappeared completely in the world.

111
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,800
Even if mortals reincarnated,

112
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,120
they wouldn't be the first people to die.

113
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,720
Master,

114
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,880
the eye painting isn't from the mortal world.

115
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,680
I'm too ignorant

116
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,960
to find a way to detoxify it.

117
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,480
It's something I brought here.

118
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,000
How about I take Miss Ling Er

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,680
to the Hall of Hidden Thunder to find Lord Fan?

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,480
You escaped from there before.

121
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,400
Now you're back,

122
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,800
Long Yuan won't forgive you.

123
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,920
He'll punish me.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,320
He won't kill me.

125
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,000
Dad.

126
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,360
Where's Xuan Wei?

127
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,760
She seems to have been called away.

128
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,000
Does Master know you're going to the Hall of Hidden Thunder?

129
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,320
Master, it's an emergency.

130
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,840
I don't have time to ask for his permission.

131
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,480
Master, you don't want to see Qing...

132
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,280
No.

133
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,640
You don't want to see Master

134
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,280
in such a dangerous condition, right?

135
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,920
I'm here to see you

136
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,800
because I think

137
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,720
you know me well.

138
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,440
The other brothers

139
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,760
just think I'm fooling around.

140
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,040
But

141
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,720
your power can't resist the Hall of Hidden Thunder.

142
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,840
Master,

143
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,320
don't worry about my safety.

144
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,040
Didn't the Hall of Hidden Thunder

145
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,480
punish Jing Yun Zong

146
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,640
for five days?

147
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,040
That means

148
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,520
the immortal of the Empyrean Heaven

149
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,960
is not completely heartless.

150
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,040
Master,

151
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,240
you must know

152
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,960
the grudge between him and the Great God.

153
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,680
In that case,

154
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,960
you shouldn't go.

155
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,000
No.

156
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,920
I've told him

157
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,480
everything.

158
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,000
Everything.

159
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,520
Master,

160
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,200
you're a man.

161
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,440
You don't understand.

162
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,120
Sometimes,

163
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,440
a person can tell his own business

164
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,840
to a friend who is not important.

165
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,880
That means he's already taken a look.

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,880
At this time,

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,960
he doesn't need a person

168
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,320
who stands behind him.

169
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,120
He needs an intermediary

170
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,000
who helps him.

171
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,520
And

172
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,480
you all have had a conflict with the Hall of Hidden Thunder.

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm the most suitable one.

174
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,720
And

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,960
I think

176
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,640
there's no chance for him to

177
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,920
get back at the Great God.

178
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,000
The Great God

179
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,360
is not as cold and heartless as he said.

180
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,120
Master,

181
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,800
I know you care about his safety.

182
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,880
Then you have to promise me.

183
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,360
If I can deal with their grudges,

184
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,720
then the Hall of Hidden Thunder and the Cloud-clad Immortal

185
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,000
can be together peacefully.

186
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,320
Master,

187
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,520
please believe me.

188
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,080
Since Master has told you

189
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,560
everything about the past,

190
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,600
he trusts you.

191
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,240
I trust you, too.

192
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,920
Thank you, Master.

193
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,000
Before I come back,

194
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,560
don't tell Master.

195
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,160
Qingyang,

196
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,800
you must be careful.

197
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,720
Come back if you need anything.

198
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,040
Don't be too strong.

199
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,840
I know.

200
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,600
By the way,

201
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,200
Master,

202
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,240
do you have any favorite flowers?

203
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,240
I don't like flowers.

204
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,520
The Pugong Eagle is not bad.

205
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,000
If you are satisfied with it,

206
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,080
I'm glad to give you one.

207
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,840
I've got it.

208
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,540
Han Fei,

209
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,240
I swear I won'tnae do anything.

210
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,140
I swear.

211
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,680
I swear.

212
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,540
Have you finished showing me singing?

213
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,180
I've already shown you what you want.

214
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,640
Why do you call me here again?

215
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,640
I want to watch it again.

216
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:43,940
legs,

217
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,580
time motion.

218
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,120
and find the culprit for yourself.

219
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
I'm glad

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,520
that I haven't been there before.

221
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,800
Who is it?

222
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,400
It's a mortal.

223
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,640
In your immortal world,

224
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,200
you should be polite.

225
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,080
Stop it.

226
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,520
You should be polite.

227
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,440
How did you get here?

228
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,400
What are you doing here?

229
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,440
I'm the elder of the Cloud Sect.

230
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,960
I'm here to pay my respects to the Great Sage.

231
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,520
The Great Sage's...

232
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,720
The Cloud Sect?

233
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,760
The sect established by the Four Spiritualities.

234
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,360
Wait.

235
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,760
Who are you two?

236
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,400
The chief of the sect.

237
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,080
Chief of the sect?

238
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,040
He's my senior.

239
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,920
He's my junior.

240
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,820
You're a

241
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,840
Don't misunderstand.

242
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,880
I'm here to ask for a contract on behalf of the Cloud Sect.

243
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,240
Please inform the Great Sage.

244
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
I don't care.

245
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,200
At least say something for me.

246
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,880
No.

247
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,840
I'm Li Qingyue's master.

248
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,040
According to the relationship between the two sects,

249
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,040
the Great Sage should call me master.

250
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,360
He'll definitely see me.

251
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,680
The Great Sage

252
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,240
Wait.

253
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,040
The people of the Cloud Sect came here.

254
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,680
How dare you

255
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,440
to come here yourself?

256
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,720
The Great Sage hasn't returned yet.

257
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,880
I'll go meet him.

258
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,160
Remember.

259
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,440
Don't tell anyone

260
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,960
that the people of the Cloud Sect came here.

261
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,200
Yes, Senior.

262
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
I'll go.

263
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,960
You're from the Cloud Sect?

264
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,920
You're the Great Sage?

265
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,680
Why are you looking for my master?

266
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,040
The Great Sage is your master?

267
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,480
Here's the thing.

268
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,000
Your master, the Great Sage,

269
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,880
and my disciple Qingyue

270
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,640
have a slight misunderstanding.

271
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,800
I want to explain it to them.

272
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,000
Misunderstanding?

273
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,720
If that's the case,

274
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,120
then come with me.

275
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,640
Where are you going?

276
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,240
Wait for me.

277
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,080
Let's go.

278
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,160
Why didn't I see you this morning?

279
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Qingyang's martial arts are a bit confused.

280
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,760
I'm afraid that they will scold me

281
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,760
and come to me secretly.

282
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,440
I've been having a doubt these days.

283
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,640
When I came back,

284
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,680
I only asked my master to let the sects rest.

285
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,600
I didn't do anything.

286
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,000
Could it be that you have let go

287
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,200
and forgotten your past grudges?

288
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,200
Grudges are still there.

289
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,560
But there are some things

290
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,840
that I don't understand.

291
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,560
Master, why don't you tell me

292
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,200
so that I can help you solve the problem?

293
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,160
I just suddenly realized

294
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,640
that there was a pair of invisible hands

295
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,280
that kept pushing me and Bai Jiusi apart.

296
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,600
Master, why do you think so?

297
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,240
I was so obsessed with hatred that I couldn't control myself.

298
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
Now that I think about it,

299
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,040
this book was too coincidental.

300
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,600
It never appeared after I escaped

301
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,160
from the fairy who gave me this book.

302
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,440
Most of the magic weapons in here

303
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,840
can be used by me.

304
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,120
It's like making it for me.

305
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,920
You mean someone

306
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,120
deliberately gave you this book?

307
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
I'm just suspecting.

308
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,320
But I didn't kill Bai Jiusi this time.

309
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,920
I did get an unexpected reward.

310
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,520
I'm not the only one who wants to kill Bai Jiusi.

311
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,920
That's why this book appeared.

312
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,120
After all, the magic weapons in here

313
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,120
can help me deal with Bai Jiusi.

314
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,320
I didn't hear about this.

315
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,720
Who is going to make a wish with the Great Cheng Xuan Zun?

316
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,120
That's right.

317
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,520
It's because I couldn't think of other people

318
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,720
why I wanted to kill Bai Jiusi.

319
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,320
That's why I kept getting angry.

320
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,920
I don't mind other people joining hands with me to deal with Bai Jiusi.

321
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,520
But I don't want to be used either.

322
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,720
If there really is such a person,

323
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,920
then you must be careful.

324
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,320
I don't care what you did to get in here.

325
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,320
But you mustn't want to see my master.

326
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,920
I'm here to make peace.

327
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,320
I'm not here to make trouble.

328
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Make peace?

329
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,720
It's the new trick of the Four Spirituals again.

330
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,520
No one knows what's going on in the world.

331
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
But I'm here to make peace.

332
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,120
I'm here to make peace.

333
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,320
I'm here to make peace.

334
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
No one knows what's going on in the world.

335
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
The Four Spirituals want to kill my master.

336
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,120
How can they make peace?

337
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
I came here behind his back.

338
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,520
Stop it.

339
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,120
Master might be deceived by your tricks.

340
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
But I won't.

341
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
If you really want to make peace,

342
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,720
then let the Four Spirituals kneel down and come to the Nine Heavens.

343
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,120
Let me give you an advice.

344
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,520
If you're sensible, then leave now.

345
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,520
You don't deserve to see my master.

346
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,120
Then I must see Master Cheng Xuan today.

347
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,520
Then I won't have to show you mercy.

348
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,320
No one came here today.

349
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Forget everything you saw.

350
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,720
It's...

351
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Did you hear that?

352
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Yes, Lord Xian.

353
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,520
Master Cheng Xuan,

354
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
I'm sorry.

355
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
I'm sorry.

356
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
I'm sorry.

357
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Ah.

358
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Ah!

359
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
Someone!

360
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Someone!

361
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Someone!

362
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,520
I should have died.

363
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,520
I shouldn't have kept it from Qing Yang.

364
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Qing Yang went to the Thunder Hall.

365
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Master,

366
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Qing Yang was killed by the Thunder Hall.

367
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,520
The Five Regions and Six Halls have been destroyed.

368
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,520
They can't come back.

369
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,520
If I remember correctly,

370
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
the dragon abyss that hides the Thunder Hall

371
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,520
is the book of Thunder Hall.

372
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Yes.

373
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
Grand Master,

374
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
I'm sorry.

377
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Grand Master,

378
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
the Thunder Hall

379
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,520
has been too cruel.

380
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Qing Yang is gentle and gentle.

381
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,520
She went to the River of Hope.

382
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,520
She was killed by the Thunder Hall.

383
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
It's not clear yet.

384
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,520
Don't make a wrong judgment.

385
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
Master,

386
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,520
how should we deal with this?

387
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
I'll go with you.

388
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
I'll go with you.

389
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
I'll go with you.

390
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
I'll go with you.

391
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
I'll go with you.

392
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
I'll go with you.

393
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
I'll go with you.

394
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
I'll go with you.

395
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
I'll go with you.

396
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,520
I'll go with you.

397
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
I'll go with you.

398
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
I'll go with you.

399
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
I'll go with you.

400
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
I'll go with you.

401
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
I'll go with you.

402
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
I'll go with you.

403
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
I'll go with you.

404
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
I'll go with you.

405
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
I'll go with you.

406
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
I'll go with you.

407
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
I'll go with you.

408
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
I'll go with you.

409
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
I'll go with you.

410
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
I'll go with you.

411
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
I'll go with you.

412
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
I'll go with you.

413
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
I'll go with you.

414
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
I'll go with you.

415
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Let's bury him first.

416
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Yes.

417
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,520
Mother.

418
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,520
Mother.

419
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Mother.

420
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
Mother.

421
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Mother.

422
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Shi'an.

423
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Can you show me his tracks?

424
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,520
I'm showing you Hua Ruo Yue's past

425
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,520
because this is your cause.

426
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,520
And you have no right to see

427
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,520
other people's causes.

428
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
This person shouldn't exist.

429
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Whether it's a person or a thing,

430
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,520
there are reasons for it to exist.

431
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,520
It's just that you didn't see through

432
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,520
the reason.

433
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
There are reasons for it to exist?

434
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
But I do admire you a little.

435
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520
When you see the tragedy of the past,

436
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
you can still distract yourself

437
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
and pay attention to others.

438
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,520
I'm sorry.

439
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,520
I'm sorry.

440
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
I'm sorry.

441
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
I'm sorry.

442
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,520
I'm sorry.

443
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
I'm sorry.

444
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
I'm sorry.

445
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
I'm sorry.

446
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
I'm sorry.

447
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
I'm sorry.

448
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,520
I'm sorry.

449
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
I'm sorry.

450
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,520
I'm sorry.

451
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,520
I'm sorry.

452
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
I'm sorry.

453
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
I'm sorry.

454
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
I'm sorry.

455
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,520
Senior Brother Meng, do you know

456
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,520
why the Grand Master took us here?

457
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,720
He just left the sect.

458
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,640
Is he going to fight again?

459
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
Uncle Qingyang sacrificed his life for the sect.

460
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,760
We must seek justice for him.

461
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,760
We are sorry for our loss.

462
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,480
Those who are standing here today

463
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
are all willing to stay

464
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,240
and fight against Thunderbolt Hall.

465
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,000
I thank you for your help.

466
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,720
I'm sure you all know

467
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,480
that the Thunderbolt Hall

468
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,120
is doing this

469
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,640
to keep the Jingyun Sect under control.

470
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,000
Then we should let them know

471
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,800
that Jingyun Sect

472
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,960
is not a place for them to be.

473
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,160
Please give us orders.

474
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,320
We will follow you until death.

475
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,800
We will follow you until death.

476
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,360
This time,

477
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,360
we don't need them to rebel.

478
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,560
Let's go find them.

479
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,560
Go.

480
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,960
One.

481
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,560
Two.

482
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,320
Three.

483
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,840
Four.

484
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,560
Five.

485
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,280
Six.

486
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
Seven.

487
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Do you think

488
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,280
Qingyang was killed by Longyuan Deity?

489
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,160
One.

490
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,440
Two.

491
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,360
Three.

492
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,640
Four.

493
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,560
One.

494
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
Hurry up

495
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
You, come and help me

496
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
What's going on?

497
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Master

498
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,560
I'm so dizzy

499
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Master

500
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
Is it an earthquake?

501
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Are you okay?

502
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Master, look, look, mountains

503
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
How did the mountains fly up?

504
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,560
Why is it flying so high? Where else do you want to fly?

505
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
It seems to fly up to the sky

506
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
Fly up to the sky

507
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
Fly up

508
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
My sick is still up there

509
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
Young master

510
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Sick

511
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,560
Young master

512
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Help

513
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
Master, why are you drinking again?

514
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Let's go

515
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Everyone has their own way of doing things

516
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,560
My way is to be carefree

517
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,560
How can I be carefree without wine?

518
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Master is right

519
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,560
There is a white tiger on the mountain of the Great Rain Lake in the mortal world

520
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
Practicing the immortal

521
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,560
It has entered the territory of the mysterious and superior

522
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Waiting for the record to be recorded

523
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,560
I'll go and see it tomorrow

524
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,560
Lord Lv Ya

525
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,560
It seems that the human race has not become an immortal for a long time

526
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
Yes

527
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,560
The last time the women of the mortal world were born to become immortals

528
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,560
It's almost two hundred years

529
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,560
I heard that the cultivation of the human race is very active in the mortal world

530
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,560
How can it be more difficult to step on the road to becoming an immortal than the mountain and the tree?

531
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,560
The world is coming back

532
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,560
The mortal world is weak in spiritual power

533
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,560
The human race has built its own road

534
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,560
Far from the wilderness

535
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,560
Can't absorb the spirit of the world

536
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Sun and moon are smooth

537
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
Want to practice the immortal

538
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:56,560
The immortal god is much more difficult than those mountain and tree monsters

539
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Makes sense

540
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Makes sense

541
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
It's been hundreds of years

542
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,560
Finally, there are people who have cultivated and cultivated into a good person

543
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,560
Yes

544
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,560
But how can there be only the name and no rank?

545
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,560
The Xuanwei of the Jingyun tribe is definitely a great person in the cultivation

546
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Such a grand event

547
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,560
Should be recorded in the immortal power

548
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,560
Yes, it should be recorded

549
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,560
Ling Fu, bring the pen

550
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
What is this place in the Jingyun tribe?

551
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,560
There are actually two people who have cultivated and cultivated into immortals

552
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
So amazing

553
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Yes, I've never heard of it

554
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Never heard of it

555
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Did we gods and officials stay in Wenxuan Palace for too long?

556
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,560
I don't know that there are already such powerful sects in the world

557
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
What is this situation?

558
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Master, look

559
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
This is a good thing

560
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Great

561
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,560
Good things come and go

562
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
The first period

563
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Great

564
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
Isn't it?

565
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Good

566
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,560
The human race needs a great star

567
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,560
Good

568
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Report

569
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,560
Report to the dragon god, there is a strange movement in the clouds

570
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
Search again

571
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Yes

572
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
This is the Nine Heavens

573
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Master

574
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Master

575
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Master

576
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
Master

577
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,560
All the disciples of the Jingyun tribe are here

578
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,560
I am willing to obey the orders of the master

579
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,560
Since my sect came to the Nine Heavens

580
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,560
I must inform the Cang Lei Palace

581
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,560
I am willing to go

582
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
I am willing to die

583
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Jiang Bian, you go and see them off

584
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Master

585
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,560
I have low magical power and am a mortal

586
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,560
This is the first time I have come to the Middle Heaven

587
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
I even find it difficult to breathe

588
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,560
I can't fly, I can't fly

589
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,560
It's okay, I'll send you there

590
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Help

591
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Help

592
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Help

593
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
Where is this

594
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
You

595
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,560
I am Yu Fan Shan, a disciple of the Dan Yang Sect

596
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,560
I am here to send a letter to the immortal

597
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,560
Is anyone here?

598
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
Is anyone here?

599
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Is anyone here?

600
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
Listen to the people in the Cang Lei Palace

601
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,560
If you don't come out now

602
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
My master will be beaten

603
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Do you hear me

604
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
That person said

605
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
Is anyone here

606
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,560
He said that woman

607
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,560
She is here

608
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
She is here

609
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
She is here

610
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
She is here

611
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
She is here

612
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
She is here

613
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
She is here

614
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,560
She is here

615
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
She is here

616
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560
She is here

617
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,560
It's been 400 years

618
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,560
She is finally here

619
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,560
Let's go

620
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
Wait for me

621
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Why can't we get out

622
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
I don't believe

623
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Is there really a barrier

624
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
I'll go and see

625
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
Is the second one brought back again

626
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
possible

627
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
It's me

628
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
I was brought back again

629
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,560
Big brother

630
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Third brother really has a barrier

631
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
The barrier of the Bai Jiusi House

632
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
It's cheap for you

633
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
There is a sound

634
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
What is it

635
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Is it

636
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
Is it coming out

637
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,560
The immortal world is small

638
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,560
Half coward

639
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
Come out

640
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Come out

641
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
Are you coming out or not

642
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,560
It's still the immortal king of the nine heavens

643
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,560
How dare you laugh so

644
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
Longyan immortal king

645
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
Please let the two of us go out

646
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Ma Siqi is too smooth

647
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
Xuan Zun has been in the Cang Lei Hall for 300 years

648
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Who has ever been humiliated like this

649
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,560
Please go out

650
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,560
Don't forget the teacher said

651
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
As long as it hurts people of Jingyun Sect

652
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,560
All the immortal bones are destroyed

653
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Expel Cang Lei Hall

654
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
Do you allow them to be so cruel

655
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,560
Yes, just a mortal

656
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,560
I've already said it

657
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
Teacher shouldn't be soft on him

658
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Senior brother

659
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
Go away

660
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,560
I have already passed on the teacher's blood

661
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,560
He will be back soon

662
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
Senior brother

663
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
I advise you to endure it

664
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Don't forget the last time

665
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,560
It was the immortal king of Cangdu and I who spoke for you

666
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,560
You can only stay

667
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,560
If you make things worse

668
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,560
I'm afraid the teacher

669
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
Won't let you stay

670
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
Teacher

671
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,560
People inside dare not come out

672
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
There is a barrier at the entrance

673
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,560
I can't get through

674
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
He doesn't want to come out

675
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,560
Then send him in

676
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
Everyone has not seen for a long time

677
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,560
The old man came in

678
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,560
Why don't you go out to welcome

679
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,560
Also set up a barrier

680
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,560
It seems not a way to treat guests

681
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
Siling

682
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
You dare to take the mortal

683
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
Good at breaking into the place of the immortals

684
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Do you know your sin

685
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,560
You can go to the mortal to take the land

686
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,560
Why can't mortals go to the nine heavens

687
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Longyuan

688
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,560
Since you dare to kill my Qingyang Elder of Jingyun Sect

689
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,560
You should expect to have today

690
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,560
Don't pour dirty water on me

691
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,560
Teacher forgave you

692
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,560
You dare to go to the mortal

693
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,560
Then you dare to do it

694
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
It's just a pity

695
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,560
These hidden thunder disciples who were implicated by you

696
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,560
You gave five days to Jingyun Sect before

697
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,560
Today I also give you a day to hide in the thunder

698
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,560
If you can hand over the head of Longyuan to the mortal tomorrow

699
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,560
One life for one life

700
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560
We can forget about it

701
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Don't bother the hidden thunder

702
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,560
You want my head

703
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,560
It depends on whether you have this ability

704
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,560
Hidden thunder disciples listen

705
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
If you can't see the head of Longyuan tomorrow

706
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,560
We will kill the door

707
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
The rest of the people are willing to live

708
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
It's better to leave early

709
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,560
Siling

710
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,560
Now is the fifth day

711
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,560
My daughter

712
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,560
You should return it to me

713
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,560
Want to Siling

714
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
Come to the people of Jingyun Sect by yourself

715
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,560
Wow

716
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,560
There are old friends coming to see you

717
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,560
You go back first

718
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
Shi

719
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,560
Shi Zu

720
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,560
Shi Zu, how can I go back

721
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
This is too high

722
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,560
This is too high

723
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,560
If the messenger of the heaven comes for persuasion

724
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,560
Then there is no need to talk

725
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
Siling

726
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,560
You and the mortal fly for nine days

727
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,560
This trip is already illegal

728
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Longyuan used the zhe Tianjing to warn the mortal

729
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
Xuan Tian doesn't care

730
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
Now the mortal is in the sky

731
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,560
You are missing

732
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
how

733
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,560
Is it possible that the immortal is not a criminal

734
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
The mortal is a immortal, so he is a pig

735
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,560
I have been fighting with Bai Jiusi since the beginning of the heaven and earth

736
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,560
For so many years

737
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,560
Never interfered with the order of the world

738
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,560
Now that Longyuan has written a war book

739
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
I came to fight

740
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
It's also a way to maintain the law of heaven and earth

741
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,560
The immortal has a grudge

742
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
What is the fight between you

743
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
I really can't control

744
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,560
But you shouldn't involve innocent people or immortals

745
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,560
Longyuan left the people of Jingyun Sect before

746
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,560
Now I also gave the time to leave the hidden disciples

747
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,560
So the last person who voluntarily stayed or the immortal

748
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
Are all out of their own will

749
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,560
Also won't involve others

750
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,560
Siling

751
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,560
From the beginning, Xuan Tian only paid attention to two things

752
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,560
One is to maintain the law of heaven and earth

753
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,560
Two cups

754
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,560
Longyuan is the chief disciple of Bai Jiusi

755
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:31,560
You kill him, he will not sit still

756
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,560
I think you know

757
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,560
Although Bai Jiusi is not in the running of this heaven and earth

758
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,560
But the responsibility of guarding the five-cups

759
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,560
If you want to threaten the survival of the five-cups

760
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,560
Xuan Tian will not sit still

761
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,560
If the envoy is worried about this

762
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,560
I can assure you

763
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,560

768
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,560
The five-cups are not something you can take easy

769
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,560
No evidence, no fear

770
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,560
Why should I believe you

No matter what the result is

774

This matter is over

775
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,560
