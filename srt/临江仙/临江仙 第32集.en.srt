Now I've long since come to my senses.

173
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,610
You should also follow your own path.

174
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,120
I sense that your cultivation is complete.

175
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,270
You're just one step away from
ascending to the Nine Heavens.

176
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,200
Don't hold yourself back anymore.

177
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,960
When I was young, I was unfortunate.

178
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,200
My mother lost her life giving birth to me.

179
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,420
During the year of the great drought,

180
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,630
my father also passed away due to famine.

181
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,550
As a child of just a few years old,

182
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,550
during the year of the great famine,

183
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,150
I couldn't avoid being bullied.

184
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,390
It was hard to make a living.

185
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,510
Fortunately,

186
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,870
I met you, Grandmaster.

187
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:52,550
You taught me righteousness and
imparted the Dao to me.

188
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,240
Your great kindness is like that of
a second parent to me.

189
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,870
I have no way to repay you in this life.

190
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,390
Why are you...

191
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,350
saying all of this suddenly?

192
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:14,190
[Mercy Over All]

193
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,000
In the past, I was always trapped
within myself.

194
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,870
There were some things I couldn't
think through clearly.

195
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,720
Now the time has come.

196
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,910
Only now have I attained wisdom,

197
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,000
and understood the Dao.

198
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
What is your Dao?

199
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,960
To repay my debts,

200
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,070
like a crow feeding its parents,

201
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
is my way of repaying your kindness.

202
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,210
What are you doing?

203
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,020
This is the Spirit Dulling Herb.

204
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,030
I added some to the water.

205
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,730
It's harmless to the body.

206
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,580
It will incapacitate you for
just half a day.

207
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,840
[Prosperity]

208
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,670
What are you trying to do?

209
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,880
Grandmaster.

210
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,510
The reason I gave the Qiyue Sword
to Xiao Jingshan

211
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,270
was not entirely for the sake of
our fellow sect members.

212
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,200
But rather...

213
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,980
I didn't want to die by his hand.

214
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,480
In the past few days when you
went around looking for people,

215
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,750
I sought guidance through several readings.

216
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,350
According to the hexagrams,

217
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,170
our Jingyun Sect won't be able
to stop Xiao Jingshan.

218
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,730
I wanted to make a final fight,

219
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,600
but none of it worked out.

220
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,260
It forced me to believe what
the hexagrams showed.

221
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,000
I...

222
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,510
must die.

223
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,360
Either I die by Xiao Jingshan's hand,

224
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,080
or...

225
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,800
I could die for you, Grandmaster.

226
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,530
I am choosing the latter.

227
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,910
What nonsense are you talking about?

228
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,000
For tens of thousands of years,

229
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,910
whenever there were floods or famines,

230
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,599
plagues or insect infestations,

231
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,460
mortals who were in the thick of it

232
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,650
always felt hopeless about the future,

233
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,380
and struggled to make a living.

234
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,730
But every time,

235
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,240
as long as they gritted their teeth
and persevered,

236
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,099
they could always get through it.

237
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,880
All this didn't come from
praying to gods or Buddha,

238
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,580
but from their own
persistence and endurance.

239
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,120
Grandmaster, you once said

240
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:42,630
[May your spirit shine across all realms]

241
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,130
that we, as human cultivators,

242
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,640
shouldn't just aim for
enlightenment and ascension.

243
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,010
To achieve the right results of cultivation,

244
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,120
we should also think about this land,

245
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,690
and what we can do

246
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,000
for all these living beings.

247
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,650
I do not wish to become an immortal,

248
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,310
because I've been waiting
for this opportunity.

249
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,420
You have a mortal body.

250
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,920
Your strength is not enough to
shake the heavens.

251
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,160
Even if you sacrifice yourself,

252
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,820
it won't make any difference.

253
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,880
Xuan Wei,

254
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,070
there's no need to push yourself.

255
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,750
As you know,

256
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,000
there's nothing holding me back.

257
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,930
Don't sabotage this opportunity.

258
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,830
Grandmaster.

259
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,000
Before Xiao Jingshan died,

260
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,840
he gave this to you.

261
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,350
It means he knew

262
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,960
there were many things that
only you could answer.

263
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,560
The greatest blessing of this lifetime

264
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,600
is meeting you, Grandmaster.

265
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,400
Even if I could start over,

266
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,470
I would not regret

267
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,790
helping you with everything I've done.

268
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:47,900
[Prosperity]

269
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,510
Please, Grandmaster, bestow this destiny

270
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,350
upon your disciple.

271
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,290
[Mercy Over All]

272
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,920
Grandmaster,

273
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,270
I...

274
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,790
shall leave now.

275
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,640
Please take care of yourself.

276
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,940
Take meetings and partings lightly,

277
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,500
and let your heart guide your happiness.

278
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,510
Your great kindness, Grandmaster,

279
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,320
I'll repay in the next life.

280
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:52,040
[Mercy Over All]

281
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,220
[Mercy Over All]

282
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,500
This is the place, I suppose.

283
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,450
Divine Lord!

284
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,770
Divine Lord.

285
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,530
I'm so glad you're alright.

286
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,470
I saw the auspicious rain falling...

287
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,220
and thought you...

288
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,440
It's Xuan Wei.

289
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,430
Divine Lord.

290
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,170
This was his own choice,

291
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,750
just like mine.

292
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,920
From the moment we met you, Divine Lord,

293
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,610
we've decided to follow you till death.

294
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,370
The greatest blessing of this lifetime

295
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,780
is meeting you, Grandmaster.

296
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,350
Even if I could start over,

297
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,310
I would not regret

298
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,720
helping you with everything I've done.

299
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,960
All of you've taught me a lesson.

300
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,070
In this cycle,

301
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,750
we've made too many mistakes

302
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,750
and had too many regrets.

303
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,930
Since we have the chance,

304
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,950
we can help our other selves
in other cycles

305
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,910
experience fewer setbacks.

306
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,960
Before Xiao Jingshan died,

307
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
he gave this to you.

308
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,480
It means he knew

309
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,510
there were many things that
only you could answer.

310
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,860
I think I know how to use this now.

311
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:30,830
You...

312
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,890
Don't just hurt yourself.

313
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,150
I can help you eradicate the evil energy.

314
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,880
What... what are you doing?

315
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,200
This is all I can do for you now.

316
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,730
You'll have to explain the rest yourselves.

317
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,570
Hit him! Hit him!

318
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,440
Let me go!

319
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,270
Hit him hard!

320
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,350
Hit him where it hurts!

321
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,030
Let me go!

322
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,290
Hit him where it hurts!

323
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,690
Hit him! Hit him!

324
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,110
Let's beat him to death!

325
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,430
Beat him to death! Beat him to death!

326
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,840
Beat him to death! Beat him to death!

327
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,640
Punch him!

328
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,120
Hit him! Beat him to death!

329
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,440
Alright, let's go.

330
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
What a nuisance!

331
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,910
Who are you?

332
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,190
I am an immortal from the heavens.

333
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,000
I see that you have some spiritual energy.

334
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,660
So I've descended to help you.

335
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,060
Take this book.

336
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,400
Study and cultivate yourself diligently.

337
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,530
You will surely achieve great things.

338
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,750
Dear immortal,

339
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,640
what can I do for you?

340

Practice cultivation well.

341
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,110
One day, you will establish a great sect

342
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,310
that saves the world.

343
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,000
Oh, right.

344
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,830
In the future,

345
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,790
if you meet a girl who gives you flowers,

346
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,190
remember to cherish her.

347
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,380
A girl who gives me flowers?

348
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,160
I under—

349
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,070

Be careful not to disturb the fetus.

352
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,440
What did you say?

353
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,470
I just want to tell you something.

354
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,040
Take a seat.

355
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,100
Let me heal you.

356
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,510
Hua Ruyue,

357
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,510
you didn't heed

358
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,030
a single word I said.

359
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,410
You once promised me to save
Meng Changqin only once.

360
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:35,080
That's why I agreed to go through
the love tribulation with you.

361
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,550
But you broke your promise.

362
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,950
Now,

363
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,470
you've violated the heavenly rules again.

364
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,230
I can't be tolerant of you anymore.

365
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,050
The Heavenly Emissary was not easy
to deal with, was he?

366
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,520
What did you say?

367
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,240
Alright.

368
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,860
I know everything now.

369
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,760
You helped me stop
the Heavenly Emissary just now.

370
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,760
Also,

371
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,110
don't think about secretly taking
the heavenly punishment for me.

372
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,310
Even if I agreed to let you bear it alone,
