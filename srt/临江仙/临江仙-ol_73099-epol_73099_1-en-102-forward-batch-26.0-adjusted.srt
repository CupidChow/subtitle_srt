I'm Li Qingyue.
I joined this sect 11 years ago,

7
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,759

if you stay strong,

11
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,590
fate will one day smile upon you.

12

I believe one day
I'll rise as the pride of the sect

after he ascended,

109
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,480
he appeared in a dream
to his junior brother

110
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,440
and said he now serves
under Heavenly Lord Dacheng.

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,460
Let me tell you.

113
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,720
Heavenly Lord Dacheng
is no ordinary immortal.

115
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,750
His power is unfathomable.

116
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,500
Wait.

Get some proper rest.

119

by the demonic cultivator yesterday.

The wound affected my lungs.

128
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,830
I went to the pill room for medicine,

129
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,940
but the senior on duty said
you're the best at treating lung injuries

130
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,550
and told me to come see you

131
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,510
before I could get any medicine.

132
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,110
Senior Lyu.

133
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,330

I'm injured.

137
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,260

Yes.

140
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,720
Indeed.

Senior Meng is trapped
at the Ascension Terrace,

142
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,580
battered by the wind and sun,
suffering all that hardship.

143
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,000
I wonder if his old wounds
have flared up again.

144
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,950
Looks like Sect Leader won't see me.

145
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,350
Kneeling here is pointless.

146
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,640
I might as well go check on him

147
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,110
and keep him company.

148
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,400

If you're still feeling unwell,

go to Xiaoqiu Mountain
and look for Gold Marrow Grass.

153
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,940
I won't take it, okay?

154
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,430
Oh my goodness!

155
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,960
It's not my fault.
I know nothing about it.

156
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,500
It can't be Qingyue. She's still injured.

157

Sir, help me! I can't swim!

158

Mr. Bai, thank you for your help today.

179

Just now, I was worried

180

Please forgive me.

What do you mean?

184

I get it.
I'll take responsibility for you.

185

Take responsibility?

186
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,650
Wait for one day.
I'll come find you tomorrow.

187
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:13,350
Li Qingyue.

188
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,770
Is he the one for me?

189
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,330
What are you eating?

190
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,350
Some herbs I gathered myself.

191
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,360
[Tears of Sorrow]

192
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,490
Stop reading
these ridiculous romance tales.

193
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,570
Senior.

194
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,680
What's it?

195
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,130
I want to ask you something.

196
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,950
Do you know how much
the betrothal gift usually costs?

197
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,410
Cultivation before marriage, okay?

198
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,220
Don't get me wrong.

199
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,140
I'm just curious.

200
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,670
The betrothal gift
is simply a man's token of sincerity.

201
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,800
There's no fixed amount one must give.

202
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,710
It's far too soon for you

203
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,820
to worry about things like that.

204
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,790
Bai Jiusi.

205
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,620
Are you here?

206
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,180
Bai Jiusi!

207
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,610
What is this?

208
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,430
Everything of value

209
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,600
I've saved over the years is in there.

210
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,100
What for?

211
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,260
It's my betrothal gift for you.

212
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,140
It's not much,

213
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,980
but I swear to the heavens

214
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,740
this is everything I own.

215
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Nothing more.

216
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,810
Why give it to me?

217
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,740
To take responsibility for you.

218
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,700
Yue.

219
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,780
Do you ever speak honestly?

220
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,410
You're calling me so sweetly.

221
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,230
I admit, you're very good-looking.

222
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,910
I am a little tempted.

223
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,670
But the storybooks say

224
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,300
chastity is equally important
for men and women.

225
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,460
Since I kissed you,

226
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,960
I must protect your good name.

227
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,400
Who are you really?

228
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,920
Ah! Look at me.

229
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,440
I forgot to introduce myself properly.

230
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,440
My home is at the foot of Yufan Mountain.

231
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,960
My parents died
during a great upheaval when I was young.

232
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,640
I joined the Jingyun Sect
at the age of eight.

233
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,300
It's been 11 years since then.

234
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,520
I'm just a gatekeeper now.

235
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,320
If you think my status is too low

236
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,970
and don't want to marry me,

237
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,860
I won't insist.

238
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,830
I'm only doing what I believe is right.

239
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,980
The choice is yours.

240
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:03,990
It's fine.

241
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,730
If you're unwilling, just forget it.

242
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,490
I'll head back then.

243
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,230
I've accepted it.

244
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,280
Let's go.

245
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,420
To the Jingyun Sect?

246
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,630
I took your betrothal gift.

247
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,940
Naturally, I'm yours now.

248
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,710
What's wrong?

249
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,060
You don't want me to go back with you?

250
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,770
The sect doesn't usually
take in outsiders.

251
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,070
How about you head home

252
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,510
and let your parents know about this?

253
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,510
I have no parents.

254
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,760
No family, no friends.

255
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,770
It's okay. From now on, you have me.

256
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,030
I live alone,

257
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,490
so it's a bit of a mess here.

258
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,070
Wait for me a moment.
I'll tidy up right away.

259
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,560
Qingyue.

260
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,100
Qingyue, it's your shift today.

261
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,330
You're already late.

262
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,660
Okay, Senior.

263
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,580
You go ahead.
I'll change and be right there.

264
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,250
He...

265
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,810
Are you so ashamed of me?

266
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,450
It's not like that.

267
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,490
I can't let anyone know

268
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,210
I'm hiding someone in my room.

269
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,240
Why not?

270
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,960
I'll be honest with you.

271
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,240
The sect leader

272
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,830
is distressed
over Senior Meng's collusion

273
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,930
with a demon girl.

274
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,510
We can't let him
know about us at this time.

275
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,810
If that's the case,

276
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,880
why did you give me the betrothal gift?

277
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,420
I wanted to take responsibility for you.

278
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,310
I planned to show my sincerity
with the betrothal gift

279
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,240
and then marry you in a month or two.

280
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,070
I didn't expect you
to come back with me today.

281
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,140
Anyway, you need to be careful these days.

282
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,540
Don't let anyone see you.

283
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,280
Or they'll say

284
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,920
I care only about romance

285
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,810
and neglect my fellow disciples.

286
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,620
Then I won't be able
to stay in this sect anymore.

287
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,290
So you want me to remain…

288
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,030
unacknowledged?

289
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,110
Don't worry.

290
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,600
I'll give you
a proper place by my side soon.

291
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,930
It's just that
you have to stay hidden for now.

292
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,130
You must be hungry.

293
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,920
Have some snacks.

294
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,700
You eat. I'm going to guard the gate.

295
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,780
Aren't you afraid I'm a demon too,

296
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,380
and you'll end up like your Senior Meng?

297
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,030
I'm just an

298
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,350
insignificant gate-guarding disciple.

299
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,880
How could I

300
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,680
compare to someone
as outstanding as Senior Meng?

301
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,140
Besides,

302
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,920
you saved me and that spirit monkey.

303
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,730
I know you're not a demon.

304
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,150
Why are you eating so much?

305
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,270
My appetite has been really good lately.

306
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,000
Your cultivation is not so good,

307
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,130
but your appetite sure ranks top tier.

308
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,810
Senior.

309
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,670
Do you have any old clothes
you don't need anymore?

310
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,410
Why?

311
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,200
If you have some,
give them to me. I want to…

312
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,140
make something.

313
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,520
Alright, I'll check when I get back.

314
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,240
Thank you.

315
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,960
I don't wear others' clothes.

316
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,400
I'm not allowed

317
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,530
to leave the sect without permission.

318
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,310
I can't just head down

319
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,310
the mountain to buy you new clothes.

320
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,640
Please make do with these.

321
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,240
No.

322
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,530
You can't wear
the same clothes every day, can you?

323
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,950
Alright, forget it.

324
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,290
I'll sneak down the mountain
to buy you new clothes.

325
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,870
For now, eat something.

326
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,560
It's awful.

327
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,270
No way. I think it's pretty good.

328
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,310
Why don't you try it first?

329
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,220
No.

330
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,170
Then what do you want to eat?

331
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,030
Xiaoqiu Berries.

332
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,940
Xiaoqiu Berries
on Xiaoqiu Mountain aren't ripe yet.

333
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,870
You can't keep starving yourself.

334
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,670
Fine.

335
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,880
Anything you say.

336
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,860
Go to sleep. I've made the bed for you.

337
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,170
Aren't you sleeping on the bed?

338
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,890
I know how to behave.

339
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,120
We haven't had our wedding yet,

340
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,830
so we're not officially married.

341
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,230
We can't sleep together.

342
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,830
Yue.

343
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,020
Are you so sure I won't harm you?

344
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,500
Senior.

345
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,320
Senior, have some water.

346
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,160
Junior.

347
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,920
Don't come to see me again.

348
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,560
So you're willing
to be executed by the sect for her?

349
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,550
Even in death,

350
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,180
I have no regrets.

351
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,260
I'm here trying to persuade you to let go,

352
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,920
yet I'm no different myself.

353
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,570
Senior, don't worry.

354
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,540
I'll find a way to save you.

355
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,120
Senior, my stomach hurts a little.

356
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,240
Could you cover for me for a bit?

357
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,290
I'd like to head back and rest.

358
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,780
All of a sudden? Let me check on you.

359
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,440
I'm fine.

360
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,990
I just ate too much yesterday.

361
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,610
I'll head back first.

362
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,780
Qingyue.

363
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,740
Thank god I made it back before dawn.

364
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,990
Slow down, Senior. Hang in there.

365
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,710
Senior Lyu.

366
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,190
You're here to capture us?

367
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,190
No.

368
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,360
Indeed.

369
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,870
They wouldn't have sent you to catch us.

370
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,900
Then you're here to help us.

371
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,580
I knew I could count on you.

372
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,540
Junior Qingxin.

373
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,840
It's Qingyue.

374
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,500
Doesn't matter.

375
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,780
Senior Meng wouldn't leave with me,

376
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,320
so I had to seal his meridians by force

377
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,260
and bring him here.

378
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,720
Help me get him out of here.

379
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,860
Come on.

380
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,840
I'll clear the path and cover the rear.

381
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,360
You just need to take him away.

382
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,360
This doesn't seem right.

383
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,960
Don't worry. You're weak.

384
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,840
It's only right

385
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,100
that I handle the dangerous part.

386
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,000
That's not what I mean.

387
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,050
There's no time, Qingxin.

388
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,750
Let's go.

389
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,940
My name is Qingyue.

390
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,290
You ungrateful brat!

391
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,260
How dare you try to escape?

392
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,180
Wait.

393
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,320
This has nothing to do with me!

394
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,670
Hold him steady!

395
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,740
Qingyue, take Senior Meng and go.

396
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,110
Now you remember my name.

397
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,400
Qingyue, are you there?

398
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,150
Sect Leader, it was my decision
to save Senior Meng.

399
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,880
This has nothing to do with him.

400
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,870
Senior Lyu, then I...

401
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,320
Junior Lyu, this matter
doesn't concern you.

402
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:11,990
Step aside.

403
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:12,800
Senior.

404
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,660
It's all my fault. Do not involve others.

405
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,180
Master, please punish me.

406
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,550
Meng Chu.

407
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,670
Qu Xingman broke into our mountain
and injured our disciples.

408
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,630
Your Junior Li here

409
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,430
was nearly killed by that demon.

410
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,230
Yet now, she's set aside
the past to save you.

411
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,270
Is this fellowship not enough

412
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,100
to wake you from your delusions?

413
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,510
I didn't...

414
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,040
No need to say more, Master.

415
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,170
Whether it's good or evil,
you have your standard,

416
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,010
and I have my own judgment.

417
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,650
You're bound by the doctrines of the sect,

418
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,510
while I choose to follow my heart.

419
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,670
But you once guided me.

420
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,770
You taught me everything I knew.

421
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,130
I can never repay your kindness.

422
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,370
Whether you choose
to kill me or cripple me today,

423
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,320
I'll have no complaints.

424
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,030
Sect Leader, Senior Meng
was merely bewitched by that demon.

425
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,510
Please show him mercy.

426
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,960
I'm perfectly clear-headed.

427
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,690
Senior.

428
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,880
To think there's such
unwavering love in this world.

429
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,730
Very well.

430
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,350
You truly have a mind of your own.

431
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,350
Let's consider that
I never accepted you as my disciple.

432
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,130
Today, I shall personally kill you,

433
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,070
lest you fall to the demonic path
and hurt innocent people.

434
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,090
Sect Leader.

435
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,280
Sect Leader!

436
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:42,070
We've trained
alongside Senior Meng for over a decade.

437
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,330
If you must punish him,

438
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,110
punish us as well.

439
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,400
Us?

440
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,820
I have nothing to do with this.
I was just passing by.

441
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,230
This matter indeed
has nothing to do with Junior Li.

442
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,160
No, Sect Leader!

443
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,730
I saw her hiding a man

444
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,660
in her room!

445
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,180
Maybe he's from the demonic sect!

447
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,040
I'm truly sorry, junior sisters.

448
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,930
I've dragged you into this.

449
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,440
I'll tell Master

450
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,800
this has nothing to do with you.

451
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,740
To share hardship with you,
I have no regrets.

452
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,330
Junior Li.

453
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:30,360
Did you really
secretly take in an outsider?
