1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
Let's get a little closer

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,980
How was it?

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,260
It liked her

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,840
I'll focus back to the car

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,520
It's so notATTEEN

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,400
I won't stop, I'll continue to常常

7
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,800
Listen ago, I earn a lot in a year,

8
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:51,500
And I push myself into the noisy valleyufen.

9
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Then why I find out a thousand principles?

10
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,500
The first person to win the first prize is Lin Jiangxian.

11
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Find the state and sell the cave.

12
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Sell the cave and watch Lin Jiangxian.

13
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
What do you want to hear?

14
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm the lady of the Xuanzun.

15
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
If you kill me, the Crayon Shin will not let you go.

16
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Lin Yan.

17
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Lin Yan, wake up.

18
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Wake up, Lin Yan.

19
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Lin Yan.

20
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Help! Help!

21
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
What's going on?

22
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Xuanzun!

23
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
The Crayon Shin

24
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Father, what can I do for you?

25
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,500
It's a big night.

26
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
I'm afraid you'll catch a cold.

27
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
I want to give you a bed.

28
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Father, are you afraid I'll trouble you?

29
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
You promised me today,

30
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,500
but I still feel so anxious.

31
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,500
You've always wanted something.

32
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
You can get something.

33
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
You won't let it go when you can't get it.

34
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
When you were a trainee,

35
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,500
you could hold on to the room you considered.

36
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,500
You could stay there for 11 hours.

37
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
There's no one who can cook for you

38
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
without a man in the yard.

39
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Father knows you're kind,

40
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,500
and you know how to move and retreat.

41
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
But why...

42
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,500
You can't get over the world of the Crayon Shin.

43
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Where's the Crayon Shin?

44
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Okay.

45
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Let's go after you finish.

46
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Okay.

47
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Then you...

48
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Go to bed early.

49
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
Close the window.

50
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Don't catch a cold.

51
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Where's your shadow?

52
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
You used the shadow to kill the tree, right?

53
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
You...

54
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
You're not going to kill me?

55
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
What?

56
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
You're not going to kill me?

57
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Your Majesty.

58
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
At least let me be a ghost!

59
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Your Majesty.

60
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Your Majesty.

61
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Your Majesty.

62
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Your Majesty.

63
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Your Majesty.

64
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Xuan Xuan.

65
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Why are you here?

66
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,500
I was chased by a shadow.

67
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
A shadow?

68
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Yes.

69
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,500
He even took a dagger in his hand.

70
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
I was attacked by him in Xuan Ya.

71
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
I fell down.

72
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
You were chased by a shadow.

73
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Why didn't you kill yourself?

74
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
And you were forced to do so?

75
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
I...

76
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
I don't know.

77
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Ah Yu.

78
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Xuan Xuan.

79
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
How do you feel to see an old man?

80
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
What old man?

81
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
I thought you were going to pretend again.

82
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,500
I didn't expect you to pretend so soon.

83
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Xuan Xuan.

84
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
What do you mean?

85
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Hu Xie was hurt and I was shot.

86
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Then he tried to get close to me.

87
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Ah Yu.

88
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
What are you going to do?

89
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Are you going to kill me?

90
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Or are you going to seal me here?

91
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Why do you hate me so much?

92
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Do you think I'm a little bit selfish?

93
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
I'm sorry for you.

94
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
I shouldn't have been bullied by you.

95
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Master.

96
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Remember this.

97
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Yu Su will not be hurt.

98
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Thank you, master.

99
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm sorry.

100
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
You were a coward.

101
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,500
You are a talented disciple of my sect.

102
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
It's a pity that you are not good at it.

103
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
I don't believe in luck.

104
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
I only believe in my heart and my mind.

105
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
I'm sorry for being so hard on you.

106
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Okay.

107
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
You have such a good sense of humor.

108
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
I won't treat you badly.

109
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
I won't treat you badly.

110
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Do you know that Chi Yang Guo is about to be killed?

111
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Chi Yang Guo?

112
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Can Chi Yang Guo help me with his anger?

113
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Of course.

114
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Chi Yang Guo has been in the South for a hundred years.

115
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,500
As long as he's alive, you can keep up with him.

116
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
It's not a problem for him to be a coward.

117
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Chi Yang Guo is a man of the West.

118
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
He will be in trouble.

119
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Now, he is in the dungeon.

120
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
He doesn't want to be changed.

121
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,500
He is used to being in trouble.

122
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
He is in a bad mood.

123
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,500
I will let Shang Guan lead the disciples to the dungeon.

124
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,500
If you want to go, you can go with them.

125
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
I will go with them.

126
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
I will go with them.

127
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Master.

128
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
I have a question.

129
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,500
What is the origin of the Great Wall?

130
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,500
What makes us so proud?

131
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
The Great Wall is a sacred place.

132
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,500
It's a place where many people live.

133
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,500
The Great Wall is the most important place.

134
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
It's a place where you can go up and down.

135
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:58,500
In addition, the Great Wall is filled with the entrance of the Demon Clan.

136
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
So, people are not afraid of the Great Wall?

137
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Yes.

138
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,500
The entrance of the Demon Clan is filled with the Demon Clan.

139
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
That's right.

140
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,500
So, the Great Wall is here.

141
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,500
It protects the peace of the Three Realms.

142
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,500
So, no matter how much it is, it's not a big deal.

143
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
You don't mention the Demon Clan.

144
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
In the Nine Heavens,

145
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
no one can be as good as the Demon Clan?

146
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,500
That's why he is a unique person.

147
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
A few years ago,

148
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,500
there was a spirit named Si Ling.

149
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,500
He was able to fight against the Great Wall with the Great Wall.

150
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
He was so skilled in the swordplay and the cultivation.

151
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
He didn't want to give up.

152
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,500
But he used to hide in the Thunder Palace.

153
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Where is the Immortal Lord now?

154
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
He's gone.

155
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,500
300 years ago, the Great Wall was led by the disciples.

156
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
He was able to fight against the Thunder Palace.

157
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,500
He was able to take the White Snake.

158
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,500
He killed Si Ling completely.

159
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,500
He used the White Snake to make the name Si Ling.

160
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
He was like a female.

161
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,500
The Great Wall

162
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Ma'am,

163
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
drink some medicine before you get better.

164
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
I've asked the important disciples of the Hidden Hall.

165
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,500
No one knows that Ma'am was killed by the shadow.

166
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
As for the Ning Yan of the Moon Palace,

167
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
the cultivation and cultivation of the last night

168
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
was so hard that there were no signs of death.

169
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
They didn't know what the cause was.

170
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Ma'am didn't know for a long time

171
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
what the hidden hall was like.

172
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,500
She didn't know what the grudge was.

173
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
No one knows that Ma'am was killed.

174
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
It's strange.

175
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
How did the person who was in charge know

176
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
that Ma'am was practicing the Kung Fu?

177
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
How did he avoid so many disciples?

178
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
The Shadow Killing tree is not an ordinary skill.

179
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,500
There are not many people in the Hidden Hall.

180
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
I'm still on the same level.

181
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,500
Could it be that he didn't have any intention of killing Ma'am?

182
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
It's just that Ma'am didn't want to live in the Moon Palace.

183
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
That's why he sent this move.

184
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Or...

185
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Ma'am is interested in the Golden Land of the South.

186
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
So she's going to use this move as an excuse.

187
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Go on.

188
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Yes, Master Xuan.

189
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
How about you grab hold of it?

190
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Why should I?

191
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,500
What if master finds out it was you?

192
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
How am I going to survive in this Iron Lushed Temple?

193
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Or...

194
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
You'd better go to meet master.

195
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
It's just guilty.

196
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Ma'am, if you can't stop it...

197
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Or is it whatever you want?

198
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Your marriage in the Jade Mansion

199
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Can't you just aufone the possibility?

200
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,300
I'll use the power of Kong.

201
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,900
I'll always try my best to get out of the trouble for you.

202
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,580
I believe you can have the power to do it.

203
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,940
You are thenan,

204
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,040
look,

205
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,520
he is just an ordinary girl.

206
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,480
And then...

207
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,420
Feng Ling기는

208
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,980
But!

209
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,700
He didn't even seduce me in the first place and then...

210
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,600
the child,

211
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,100
Don't worry about How do you know what I'm Jamaicali

212
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,000
It's right right

213
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
Today's catch

214
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,340
Do not make noise

215
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,000
Where are you?

216
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,220
I'm in retrieve

217
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,860

Go

219
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,480
You take care

220
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,080
choice

221
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,960
Who is he

222
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,960

223
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,220
It is a化.

224
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,300
Examination

225
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,420
efter

226
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,440
manif

227
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,060
L

228
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,500
What?

229
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,300
.

230
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
This medicine is too much.

231
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,300
I should take the medicine that I didn't use for nothing.

232
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
Oh, right.

233
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
Take some hot water.

234
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,300
It won't work if it's cold.

235
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,300
This medicine is so bitter.

236
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,300
Madam, you're already hurt.

237
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Is it bitter to take medicine?

238
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,300
Did the Xuan Sun come?

239
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
No.

240
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
Xuan Sun is busy with the investigation.

241
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
She's the murderer who hurt Madam.

242
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,300
Yes, she's been very busy all the time.

243
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,300
Madam, I'll go and get Xuan Sun over here.

244
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:04,300
Ning Yan, did Xuan Sun ever like me?

245
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,300
How could she?

246
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,300
If Xuan Sun doesn't like you, why did you marry her?

247
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Yes.

248
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,300
Why did she ask me to marry her?

249
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,300
Ning Yan.

250
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Do you know where the white snake in the soup is?

251
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,300
White snake?

252
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,300
What white snake?

253
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,300
When I fell into the water, I found a huge white snake.

254
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
The white snake is the forbidden place in the hidden place.

255
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,300
No one dares to come near Xuan Sun.

256
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,300
Moreover, I've been here for decades.

257
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,300
I've never heard of white snake.

258
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
The forbidden place?

259
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,300
Visit in the second shop

260
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Master Xuan, another seal of the jade flower is now sent.

261
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
In the first shop

262
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,300
On Fortunately Punishment

263
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,420
Not gonna get a break

264
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,540

266
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,380
You finally get the chance

267
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,820
to live roughly

268
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,880
Chun eldest

269
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,600
I was puppy

270
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,700
I am Eun sorcerer

271
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,040
Through death

272
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,180
I will be chosen as Ji Nast

273
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,420
You can't take a good role

274
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,160
I can't watch you

275
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:50,040
I don't really know

276
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,520
What?

277
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,020
Tio

278
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
What are you doing?

279
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,020
I'm here to guard the yard.

280
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,020
What do you mean?

281
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,020
Why don't you let me out?

282
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,020
You're right.

283
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,020
Before you enter the room, please don't leave the yard.

284
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,020
I don't think she'll believe me.

285
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,020
My lady, go back.

286
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,020
I won't ever leave the yard.

287
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,020
Are you hungry today?

288
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,020
Do you want some fruits?

289
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,020
Bye.

290
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,060
Did you call her?

291
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,020
She said that my hostess Mer集리 would do well.

292
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,020
So I jump to her.

293
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,800
Don't worry, books.

294
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,700
Let me call her.

295
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,020
You see.

296
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,080
This is a예요-Chen Qi marriage

297
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,620
fer ey the one!

298
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,940
Three stars and one star!

299
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,820
Three stars and one star!

300
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,640
Three stars and one star?

301
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,020
That's right. This is the key to the magic.

302
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,020
It's not about how you can absorb the power of the earth.

303
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,020
You're right. But I can't even speak.

304
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,020
Yes.

305
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
How about I give you a little bit of it?

306
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
It's in your house.

307
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
Good idea.

308
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,020
I'll give you a little bit of it.

309
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,020
It's under your feet.

310
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,020
Shun...

311
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,020
What are you doing?

312
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,020
They're both really good at it.

313
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,020
They're not afraid of the power of the earth.

314
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
They're just practicing the magic.

315
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,020
Bae Jiusi, why did you come here?

316
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,020
I heard that you've been running away from Yue Wuyuan these days.

317
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,020
What's wrong with that?

318
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,020
It hurts.

319
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,020
You locked me up in the storage room.

320
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,020
What happened to me?

321
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,020
Were you at Yue Wuyuan the day before?

322
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,020
I was.

323
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,020
Did you see anything?

324
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,020
I saw everything.

325
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,020
Tell me.

326
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,020
I don't know.

327
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,020
You want me to tell you what you can give me?

328
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,020
What do you want?

329
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,020
I want you to let me out.

330
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
Okay.

331
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,020
Really?

332
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
I'll tell you what I want.

333
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,020
Listen to me.

334
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,020
A few days ago, I saw a black shadow.

335
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,020
It was holding a brush in my hand.

336
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,020
It was in the room of Li Qingyue.

337
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,020
Bae Jiusi.

338
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,020
I regret it.

339
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,020
What do you mean?

340
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,020
I let you go.

341
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,020
But I didn't say I'd catch you.

342
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,020
I let you out just now.

343
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,020
Now,

344
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,020
give me your answer.

345
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,020
Bae Jiusi, you...

346
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,020
Bae Jiusi, what are you doing?

347
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,020
You're not going to leave me, Bae Jiusi.

348
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,020
Did Xuan's spirit power get damaged?

349
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,020
I found out in the prison yesterday.

350
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,020
Xuan's magic is not good.

351
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,020
Who said it's not good?

352
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,020
Help me do something.

353
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,020
Yes.

354
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,020
Madam, you're awake.

355
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
What's wrong?

356
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,020
Go and take a look outside.

357
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,020
Go over there.

358
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,020
Okay.

359
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,020
Madam, look.

360
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,020
There's something outside.

361
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,020
Move in quickly.

362
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,020
Okay.

363
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,020
Madam, look.

364
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,020
There's something outside.

365
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,020
Move in quickly.

366
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,020
Okay.

367
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,020
Madam, look.

368
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
There's something outside.

369
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,020
Move in quickly.

370
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,020
Go.

371
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,020
Yes.

372
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,020
Where did these craftsmen come from?

373
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,020
They look so familiar.

374
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,020
There are no craftsmen in the hide-and-seek.

375
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,020
These people were transferred from Fan Jiaojiao.

376
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,020
Fan Xianjun?

377
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
Yes.

378
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
Why did they come here?

379
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
There's no way.

380
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,020
There are no craftsmen in the hide-and-seek shop.

381
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
They're the ones who came here.

382
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,020
Xuan's spirit power is down.

383
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,020
I'm going to repair a kitchen for Madam.

384
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,020
If I need any tools or salt,

385
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,020
I'll definitely send someone here.

386
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,020
A kitchen for me?

387
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,020
Yes.

388
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,020
Madam said she wanted a kitchen.

389
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020
Xuan has been thinking about it.

390
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,020
Xuan is so nice to Madam.

391
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,020
Where are the chief and the general?

392
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
Xuan has ordered them to keep their shop.

393
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,020
Xuan knows that.

394
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,020
He's wronged me.

395
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,020
I'm not sure either.

396
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,020
How about I ask Madam personally?

397
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,020
I thought she wanted a kitchen.

398
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,020
I can forgive her.

399
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,020
I can't do anything.

400
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
Xuan.

401
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,020
Madam is still mad at me.

402
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,020
Madam just recovered.

403
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,020
Do you want to see Madam?

404
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,020
No need.

405
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
Don't sit!

406
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,020
Your workplace is here.

407
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,020
I'm sorry.

408
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,020
I was supposed to check your workplace.

409
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,020
What's wrong with you today?

410
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,020
Do you mind if I officially sign your business card?

411
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,020
Don't sit!

412
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,020
This is my seat.

413
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,020
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

414
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,020
You're always looking at the stars every day.

415
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,020
Don't you feel bored?

416
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,020
It's just mine.

417
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,020
I know it's yours.

418
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,020
I'm not a thief.

419
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,020
I'm just very confused.

420
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,020
I want to find someone to talk to.

421
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020
Where do you live?

422
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,020
Do you have a parents?

423
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,020
What do you all want to tell your family?

424
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,020
Do you have a girlfriend you like?

425
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,020
Will the girl you like beat you up?

426
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,020
Like this,

427
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,020
holding your neck,

428
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,020
not only don't believe you,

429
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,020
but also suspecting you for being a bad girl.

430
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
Will you be angry?

431
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,020
You're noisy.

432
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
Why don't you tell me a story?

433
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,020
Are you sure?

434
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,020
Tell me.

435
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,020
There was a girl

436
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
who married into a hidden shop.

437
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,020
But her husband

438
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,020
threw her on a remote mountain.

439
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,020
No matter what,

440
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,020
she was so hardworking

441
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,020
to find her husband.

442
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,020
But she was thrown into a remote hospital

443
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,020
again.

444
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,020
No matter how she wanted to get close to her husband,

445
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,020
her husband

446
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,020
was so cold to her.

447
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,020
She was so distant.

448
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,020
Later, the girl was killed by someone

449
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,020
and was killed by someone.

450
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,020
But her husband

451
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,020
was not only concerned about her,

452
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,020
but also thought

453
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,020
she was lying.

454
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,020
Later,

455
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,020
the girl started to suspect

456
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,020
her husband for her love.

457
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,020
She thought

458
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,020
her husband didn't love her at all.

459
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,020
But she didn't know

460
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,020
her husband

461
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,020
often came back to see her.

462
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,020
Her husband

463
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,020
was very complex to her.

464
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,020
She was so close to her husband.

465
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,020
She was so close to her husband.

466
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,020
Her husband

467
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,020
was very complex to her.

468
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,020
She was so close to her husband.

469
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,020
But she didn't have any regrets.

470
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,020
What are you doing?

471
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,020
So

472
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,020
she still loves her wife, right?

473
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
Yes.

474
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,020
She loves her.

475
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,020
But now,

476
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,020
she wants to tell her story.

477
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,020
It's about Shui Ren-to.

478
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,020
What?

479
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,020
What?

480
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,020
What's the story of Shui Ren-to?

481
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,020

Who will have to sleep next to me because I'm not going to go to sleep?

524
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,480
I thought you've seen them all.

00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,000
Kim with breaking timing

Her image is getting better.

558
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,120
We and the same ancestors JS were together.

559
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,120
Now there is femalebone characteristic.

560
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,120
This is her natural enemy.

561
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,120
This is female bone characteristic.

562
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,120
Where is femalebone máthus?

563
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,120
We decide somehow.

564
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,120
We decide somehow.

565
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,120
Only she spent more space to marry.

566
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,120
There is more time left.

567
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,120
We can't cancelled.

568
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,120
This, this.

569
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:57,120
Master, why don't you and your mother make a wedding?

570
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,120
Xuan Sun, Madam went to Lingyuan Pavilion to look for you.

571
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,120
You're so fast.

572
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,120
Xuan Sun gave me a big kitchen.

573
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,120
I made some home-cooked dishes.

574
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,120
I want to try it for you.

575
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,120
Don't be angry.

576
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,120
I'll cook for you tonight.

577
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,120
You can cook?

578
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,120
This dish is called Si Xiu Wanzi.

579
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,120
This is ribs soup and this is lamb leg meat.

580
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,120
I've already had the ribs soup.

581
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
It's not fishy.

582
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,120
And this.

583
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,120
I didn't even want to make them for you.

584
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,120
The filial piety smells good.

585
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Try it.

586
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,120
These are all home-cooked dishes.

587
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,120
I don't know if it's your taste.

588
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,120
I'll help you peel the filial piety.

589
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,120
Here.

590
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Is it good?

591
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
Not bad.

592
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,120
That's good.

593
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
That's good.

594
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,120
Didn't you eat?

595
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,120
I've been eaten by Mr. Yin and Ning Yan.

596
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,120
I'll go back and cook later.

597
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,120
I just need to send some food to the warehouse.

598
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,120
The warehouse manager, Cao Leidian, is a small business.

599
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,120
How can he manage you?

600
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
I...

601
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,120
Sit down.

602
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,120
Let's eat together.

603
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,120
Thank you, Mr. Yin.

604
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,120
Why don't you eat?

605
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,120
I only brought a pair of chopsticks.

606
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,120
It's okay.

607
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
I can use a lot.

608
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
It's the same.

609
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,120
Why are you laughing?

610
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
It's sweet.

611
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
It's so good.

612
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,120
It's sweet because it's salty.

613
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,120
Yes, it's sweet.

614
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,120
Let's eat together.

615
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,120
I'm hungry.

616
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Although you don't need to eat,

617
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,120
if you like it,

618
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,120
I'll make some for you every day.

619
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,120
Okay.

620
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
I'll be here tomorrow.

621
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,120
Don't you remember the white snake in the pond?

622
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,120
Why do you ask so much?

623
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,120
I just ask casually.

624
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,120
You don't know it.

625
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,120
I know it.

626
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,120
It was suppressed in the Han Dynasty for 11 years.

627
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,120
It was destroyed by the Jinzhen.

628
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,120
Now, it's in the warehouse.

629
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,120
Today is the last day.

630
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,120
Tomorrow is the 50th.

631
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,120
Jinzhen will be completely destroyed.

632
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,120
Even if the god of the valley is gone,

633
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,120
even if it's destroyed,

634
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,120
it can't be fixed.

635
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,120
Marvin

636
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
Reg gardens

637
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,120
I'm sorry.

638
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,120
I'm sorry.

639
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,120
I'm sorry.

640
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,120
I'm sorry.

641
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,120
I'm sorry.

642
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,120
I'm sorry.

643
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,120
I'm sorry.

644
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,120
I'm sorry.

645
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,120
I'm sorry.

646
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,120
I'm sorry.

647
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,120
I'm sorry.

648
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,120
I'm sorry.

649
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,120
I'm sorry.

650
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,120
I'm sorry.

651
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,120
I'm sorry.

652
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,120
I'm sorry.

653
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,120
I'm sorry.

654
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,120
I'm sorry.

655
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,120
I'm sorry.

656
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,120
I'm sorry.

657
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,120
I'm sorry.

658
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,120
I'm sorry.

659
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,120
I'm sorry.

660
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,120
I'm sorry.

661
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,120
I'm sorry.

662
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,120
I'm sorry.

663
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,120
I'm sorry.

664
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,120
I'm sorry.

665
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,120
I'm sorry.
