The Secret of Yanxi

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Episode 15

3
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,040
Mother, are you alright?

4
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,840
Let him come to us.

5
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,640
Master.

6
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,840
I will find a way

7
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,440
to avenge you.

8
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Xiao Jingshan.

9
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
I will kill you.

10
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,040
I said

11
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,040
only those who are chosen can live.

12
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,840
You can't.

13
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,640
Mother.

14
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
You all have to die.

15
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,640
Mother.

16
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Call him.

17
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,840
Mother.

18
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,040
Come.

19
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,640
Mother.

20
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,240
Mother.

21
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:53,640
Mother.

22
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Don't scare me.

23
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,440
Mother.

24
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,040
I won't run away again.

25
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,840
Mother.

26
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,240
I won't run away again.

27
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,840
Mother.

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,040
I won't run away again.

29
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,640
Don't leave me.

30
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,640
Mother.

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,240
Mother.

32
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,040
Even if this place is discovered,

33
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
they can't get in.

34
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,040
Let's take a break here

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,440
and see what we should do next.

36
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,840
What's wrong?

38
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,840
Master.

39
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,040
To be honest,

40
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
I found the eye of the formation

41
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,440
on the street just now.

42
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,440
It's on the brick we entered.

43
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,240
As long as we can enter the eye of the formation,

44
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,640
we can manipulate the joy cup

45
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,840
and break through an exit

46
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
to let everyone leave.

47
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
Isn't that a good thing?

48
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,840
Why are you still so worried?

49
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,240
Nothing.

50
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
I just think

51
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,040
it's too easy to find the eye of the formation.

52
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Will there be a trap?

53
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
It's too late.

54
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,240
When tomorrow comes,

55
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,440
the people here

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
will die

57
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,640
if they stay outside the environment.

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,440
We can only try.

59
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,640
Tell me how to enter the eye of the formation

60
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,840
and manipulate the joy cup.

61
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,240
We must open our mouth tomorrow

62
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,440
and let the people leave first.

63
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,240
No.

64
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,440
You can lend me some spiritual power tomorrow.

65
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
I'll break the formation.

66
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Tell me how to do it.

67
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,240
I'll do it.

68
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,640
The formation is a bit complicated.

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,840
I can't explain it to you.

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Let me do it.

71
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,640
You guys protect me then.

72
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,040
Don't let anyone disturb me.

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
I'll do it.

74
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
I'll do it.

75
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
I'll do it.

76
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
I'll do it.

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,240
I'll do it.

78
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
I'll do it.

79
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
I'll do it.

80
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
I'll do it.

81
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
I'll do it.

82
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
Your Grace.

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,240
Actually, it's easy to break the illusion.

84
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,040
The illusion of a joy cup

85
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,440
is very mysterious.

86
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,240
Only those inside

87
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
are willing to leave.

88
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,640
I can't force them to leave.

89
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,440
Today, they are very happy

90
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
with Xiao Jingshan,

91
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,440
and even treat us as their evil spirits.

92
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
It's not a big deal to leave.

93
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
He's quite a playboy.

94
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
To be honest, these people

95
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
saw the illusion with their own eyes.

96
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
If they don't leave, they'll lose their lives.

97
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
They shouldn't stay.

98
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
How can you be so simple?

99
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Enter the human world and listen to the divine order.

100
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Then act accordingly.

101
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Have you finished talking?

102
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,440
You two, go inside for a while.

103
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,440
I have something to tell my wife.

104
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,440
You two, avoid it for a while.

105
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Go inside!

106
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Go inside! You're not allowed to come out!

107
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
You're not allowed to come out without an order!

108
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
What are you going to say?

109
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Why is it all sticky?

110
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
My wife,

111
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
I wanted to give this to you.

112
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,440
When did you take it off?

113
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
When I was at the foot of the mountain,

114
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
I could have picked more flowers.

115
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
But you were too anxious to leave.

116
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
So I only picked these.

117
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
What's going on?

118
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,440
I really treat him like a child.

119
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
My wife,

120
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
don't you like it?

121
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,440
I like it.

122
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
That's good.

123
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,440
Come.

124
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
My wife, you're so pretty.

125
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Bai Jiusi,

126
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,440
if I can be like you,

127
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
forget about everything in the past,

128
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
how great would that be?

129
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
It's the critical moment.

130
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Xuan Zun is now a child.

131
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
He can't think of any solution now.

132
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Just let him be.

133
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Let him be.

134
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
I'm not afraid of him.

135
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
I'm just worried that

136
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,440
he might not be able to get used to it.

137
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
He'll be fine.

138
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
Don't worry.

139
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
I'm thinking about it.

140
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
I'll be with you.

141
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
I'll be here.

142
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,440
I'll be here.

143
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
I'll be here.

144
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
I'll be here.

145
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,440
I'm really curious

146
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
what it feels like

147
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,440
to be liked.

148
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,440
It's okay.

150
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
I was just asking.

151
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Man.

153
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
It's all my fault.

154
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,440
I wasn't able to protect everyone.

155
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
But you have to believe me.

162
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
This revenge

163
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
will pay off.

164
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
Are you jealous?

165
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,440
No need to look for it.

166
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Only you can hear it.

167
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,440
I can make Chief Wang

168
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,440
only like you.

169
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Actually, I don't have any enemies

170
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
against you.

171
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
I just don't want you to

172
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
participate in the fight between me and the Four Spirituals.

173
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
That's why I brought you here.

174
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
I've seen it all along.

175
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,440
It's obviously you and your senior

176
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,440
grew up together.

177
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,440
But the person who was in danger, neglected, and abandoned

178
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
is only you.

179
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Don't you hate it?

180
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Don't you want Qu Xingman to disappear?

181
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
I can make a deal with you.

182
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Kill Qu Xingman.

183
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,440
I'll let your senior only like you in the future.

184
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
You think I'm stupid?

185
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
If I kill Qu Xingman,

186
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
my senior will hate me.

187
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
How can he only like me?

188
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
This is the magic qi blood spirit I made.

189
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Whether it's a human or a beast,

190
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
as long as you drop the blood on it,

191
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
you can listen to all your orders.

192
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Take any step.

193
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
You know his power.

194
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
You know his power.

195
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
Why do you want to kill Qu Xingman?

196
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Actually, I don't have any hatred against him.

197
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,440
I just can't stand people who are sincere.

198
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
I'm always being betrayed.

199
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
I want to help you.

200
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Junior.

201
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Have you finished feeding them the pills?

202
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
Junior.

203
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,440
Have you finished feeding them the pills?

204
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
I've fed them all.

205
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Your blood spirit

206
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
can really control people's mind.

207
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Try it.

208
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
Let's start.

209
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
I'll start.

210
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,440
I'll start.

211
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
I'll start.

212
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
I'll start.

213
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
I'll start.

214
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Xingzi, you can start now.

215
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Come.

216
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Stay here. Don't move.

217
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Be careful.

218
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Nine demons of the imperial palace,

219
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
summon the soul shadow.

220
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Nine demons of the imperial palace,

221
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
summon the soul shadow.

222
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Come.

223
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
Come.

224
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Come.

225
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Come.

226
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
Come.

227
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
Come.

228
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Come.

229
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Come.

230
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Come.

231
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Come.

232
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Come.

233
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Come.

234
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Come.

235
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Why is it here?

236
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
What happened?

237
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
I'm still doing my makeup.

238
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Why am I here?

239
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
It's them.

240
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
They pulled us here.

241
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
It's them.

242
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
What did they do?

243
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
We must be them.

244
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Everyone, listen to me.

245
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,080
is that the so-called God

246
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,720
trapped your soul here.

247
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,080
Once today passes,

248
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,160
your body will die.

249
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,960
Your soul can never come back.

250
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,600
What soul?

251
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,480
What illusion?

252
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,480
Stop lying to us.

253
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,240
It's true.

254
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,840
You'll know it when you see it.

255
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,480
We just want you to live safely.

256
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,840
Ling'er.

257
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Ling'er is lying to us.

258
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,080
Yeah.

259
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
Why did you mention him?

260
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,880
He's lying to us.

261
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,840
This is soldiers slaying our army in the presence.

262
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,520
How dare they 一

263
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,440
don't lie to us?

264
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,080
Why do we not go back to the capital?

265
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,080
Godorous Zhu also did not care about us?

266
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,120
Does�

267
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:30,140
You

268
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,140
I don't understand.

269
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,140
Hurry up.

270
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,140
You still want to be a demon?

271
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,140
This is a demon's house.

272
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,140
Where is this place?

273
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,140
This is impossible.

274
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,140
This must be the demon's house.

275
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,140
Did you see it?

276
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,140
Impossible.

277
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,140
This is the real world you live in.

278
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,140
Everything here is a demon's house.

279
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,140
It's all because he used magic to fake it.

280
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,140
Goddess, are they lying?

281
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,140
Goddess, are they slandering you?

282
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
This is indeed a fantasy.

283
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,140
Impossible.

284
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,140
Impossible.

285
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
How is this possible?

286
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,140
How is this possible?

287
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,140
This can't be a fantasy.

288
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,140
Impossible.

289
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,140
Do you still want to continue lying on the bed

290
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,140
and being called a useless person?

291
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,140
I don't want to.

292
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,140
I don't want to.

293
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,140
Do you want to continue to be a red-haired man

294
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,140
and be called a ugly man?

295
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,140
No.

296
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,140
I don't want to.

297
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,140
I don't want to.

298
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,140
Do you want to continue praying

299
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,140
and being scolded?

300
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
I don't want to.

301
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,140
I don't want to pray anymore.

302
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,140
I don't want to be scolded anymore.

303
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,140
No.

304
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,140
No.

305
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,140
I don't want to.

306
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,140
I don't want to.

307
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,140
I don't want to.

308
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,140
I don't want to.

309
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,140
So,

310
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,140
even if this is a fantasy,

311
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,140
are you willing to leave?

312
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,140
Yes.

313
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,140
We don't want to.

314
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,140
We don't want to.

315
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,140
We don't want to.

316
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,140
We don't want to.

317
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,140
We don't want to.

318
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,140
Look.

319
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,140
This is humanity.

320
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,140
You are clearly using their suffering.

321
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,140
No.

322
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,140
My lady.

323
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,140
Si Ling.

324
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,140
What right do you have to scold me?

325
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,140
Didn't you also give up on her?

326
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,140
What do you mean?

327
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,140
What do you mean?

328
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,140
If you want to destroy this formation,

329
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,140
you have to sacrifice someone

330
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,140
to become a new formation.

331
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,140
Don't pretend you don't know.

332
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,140
I'm sorry.

333
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,140

I'm sorry.

345
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,140
I'm sorry.

346
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,140
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,140
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,140
I'm sorry.

349
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,140
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,140
I'm sorry.

351
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,140
I'm sorry.

352
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,140
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,140
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,140
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,140
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,140
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

358
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,140
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,140
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,140
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,140
I'm sorry.

362
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,140
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,140
I'm sorry.

364
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,140
I'm sorry.

365
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,140

I'm sorry.

373
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,140
I'm sorry.

374
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,140
I'm sorry.

375
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,140
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,140
I'm sorry.

377
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,140

386
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,140
I'm sorry.

387
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,140
I'm sorry.

388
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,140
I'm sorry.

389
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,140
I'm sorry.

390
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,740
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,740
Are you strange?

392
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,740
I am strange.

393
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,540
Fairy bring this韩 Pilgrim here to that woke up.

394
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,140

399
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,860
Ma'am,

400
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,100
what's wrong?

401
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,100
Senior.

402
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,980
This is a cure for blood hat성.

403
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,100
We were unable to eat it when we came,

404
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,580
have another bite.

405
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,900
Have another bite of it.

406
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,660
I don't need it.

407
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,580
I don't need it.

408
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,700
Man, you're injured.

409
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,900
It'll be better if you take a pill.

410
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,820
Hurry!

411
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,420
Laura.

412
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,180
My dear!

413
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,020
Are you alright?

414
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,260
I'm alright.

415
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,260
Why didn't you tell me?

416
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Immortal Immortal,

417
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,940
with my own life,

418
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,860
I can exchange hundreds of lives.

419
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,500
It's not a loss.

420
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,700
How is that possible?

421
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,380
How can someone exchange their own life

422
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,060
for ours?

423
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,060
Your life is also your life.

424
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,060
It's not a loss.

425
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,340
This is my own choice.

426
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,140
I am a useless person.

427
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,220
I can do the most for Immortal Immortal.

428
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,860
The last thing I do

429
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,940
is enough.

430
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,780
I won't let you die.

431
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,460
Ling'er.

432
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,820
Are you really blind?

433
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,180
She is already the eye of the joy.

434
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,380
If you want to destroy the eye of the joy,

435
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,860
you can destroy her too.

436
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,740
Immortal Immortal,

437
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,780
leave me alone.

438
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,220
Save me first.

439
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,460
This is the land of joy.

440
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,140
No one needs your help.

441
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,580
Don't be the self-righteous savior.

442
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,940
No one will be grateful to you.

443
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,780
Could it be that

444
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,140
you think of people

445
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,420
for Holmes,

446
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,300
and dressed in yellow?

447
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,660
I already tried to help him,

448
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,260
and I was able to save him.

449
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,660
I'm the same.

450
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,580
Your singing

451
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,540
someday will come out.

452
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,180
I'm a coward.

453
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,180
I'm a beggar who's more dangerous than a grasshopper.

454
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,180
When I realized that there was something wrong with this place,

455
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,180
I chose to live here,

456
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,180
but now it's different.

457
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,180
Someone is willing to sacrifice his life

458
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,180
for a beggar who doesn't even know his name

459
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,180
to save me.

460
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,180
I'm willing to sacrifice my life

461
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,180
for a beggar who doesn't even know his name

462
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,180
for a beggar who doesn't even know his name

463
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,180
for a beggar who doesn't even know his name

464
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,180
for a beggar who doesn't even know his name

465
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,180
I can't let them down anymore.

466
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,180
Thank you.

467
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,180
What is he doing?

468
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,180
What is he doing?

469
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,180
What is he doing?

470
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,180
What is he doing?

471
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,180
What is he doing?

472
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,180
What is he doing?

473
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,180
What is he doing?

474
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,180
Well said.

475
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
So what if he looks ugly?

476
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,180
He can drive away those bad men who are trying to take advantage of others.

477
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,180
I know.

478
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,180
Thank you.

479
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,180
I'm going back, too.

480
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,180
Thank you.

481
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,180
Thank you.

Thank you.

484
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,180
Thank you.

485
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,120
Okay.

486
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,820
I didn't let you drop you weapon forcefully.

487
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,660
OK.

488
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,680

Okay?

491
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,060
I didn't show my got weapons.

492
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,880
I was the one who got hurt.

493
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,700
Let's move forward.

494
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,980
That's right.

495
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,580
I will try to middle edge them.

496
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,360
Thank you, Master.

Let's go.

Thank you.

501
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,320
Thanks.

502
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,200
Let's go.

503
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,020
Go.

504
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,000

Xiao Jing Shan.

509
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,140
You are a true woman.

510
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,900
What did you give him?

511
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,660
Poison.

512
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,660
Poison.

513
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,940
Why haven't you responded yet?

514
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,220
Are you lying to me?

515
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,420
Of course not.

516
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,140
I took away the snake gourd

517
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,980
and gave you the blood spirit in advance.

518
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,300
If you break your promise,

519
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,660
all three of you will not go out.

520
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,380
Just wait and see.

521
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,540
An Man.

522
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,780
An Man.

523
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,340
What's wrong with you?

524
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,140
Junior sister.

525
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,180
Look at An Man.

526
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,340
An Man.

What did you put in the poison

528
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,620
you gave me just now?

529
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,460
Just the kind you want.

530
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,020
What do you mean?

531
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,340
An Man.

532
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,620
An Man.

533
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,460

Junior sister.

536
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,940
Stop it.

537
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,580
Give me the antidote.

538
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,260
There is no antidote.

539
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,180
He must die.

540

I'll ask you one last time.

546
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,940
Is there any antidote?

547
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,340
No.

548
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
No.

551
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:02,740
In my opinion, your senior brother might not be able to kill you.

552

Let's go. Take him with us. Let's go back to the Immortal Sect.

Little junior, I played a few tricks with you, but you really think you can defeat me?

00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,940
Junior Aliya, you have left.

577
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,340
You asked the Vision grip power but failed.

578
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,940
Senior Master Han, don't let me go instead.

579
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,940
I'll kill you.

580
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,740
You actually used up

581
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,340
the magic power I passed on to you.

582
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,740
You said you'd only get this result

583
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,140
if you were a puppet.

584
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,140
But I'm leaving.

585
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,140
I don't want half of it.

586
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,340
You really have too many children.

587
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,940
It seems you haven't had enough

588
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,940
of being a useless person.

589
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,740
Zhang Sun!

590
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,540
You lost your magic power

591
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,140
and you're still like a moth

592
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,340
that wants to see me.

593
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
What are you laughing at?

594
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,140
I'm laughing at your poor condition.

595
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,940
I've been with you since the last time we met.

596
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,940
What about you?

597
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,540
You're like a dog that's lost its home.

598
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,940
You're like a dog that's lost its home.

599
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,140
I'm afraid that no one will be able to

600
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,140
take care of you after you've lost your magic power.

601
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,940
Your actions

602
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,540
will only make you feel sad.

603
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:37,940
Sad?

604
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,740
Okay.

605
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,940
Then I'll let you see

606
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,140
who wins and who loses in the end.

607
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:13,840
Hucian!

608
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,740
Senior Brother Xu.

609
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,340
Seaiai.

610
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,900
The fighting power will be accelerated

611
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,220
Senior Brother

612
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,220
Guan

613
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,860
What is the mu line most powerful at this time of the year?

614
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,340
It's nothing.

615
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,340
Hand over the contract sword.

616
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,180
Don't even think about it.

617
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,940
It's powerful.

618
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,940
It's just a demon.

619
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,940
It's a dirty thing.

620
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,380
You're already in such a situation.

621
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,140
How dare you say that?

622
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,420
Aren't you afraid of death?

623
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,180
I, the clan of Jingyun,

624
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,740
have been practicing the righteous path of the Heaven and Earth.

625
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,820
Why would I be afraid of a demon?

626
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,500
Master!

627
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,660
Jingyun!

628
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,340
Jingyun!

629
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,260
I'll kill you!

630
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,140
Let me go!

631
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,340
Let me go!

632
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,140
Let me go!

633
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,740
Let me go!

634
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,020
Father, don't forget to promise me

635
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,740
that you'll go to the lantern show with me tonight.

636
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,740
Great!

637
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,740
One more!

638
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,260
Let me go!

639
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,260
Let me go!

640
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,260
Let me go!

641
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,260
I'll say it again.

642
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,660
Hand over the contract sword.

643
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,060
I can spare your lives.

644
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,260
You're a villain!

645
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,260
Let my master go!

646
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,780
Then I'll kill you.

647
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,660
Master!

648
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,660
Yan Yuan!

649
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,620
You're back.

650
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,220
Where's Sect Leader Zi Yang?

651
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,060
He killed him.

652
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,080
No!

653
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,660
Do something!

654
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:44,880
His

655
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,680
My position is so other than...

656
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,680
I'm not afraid of you.

657
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,880
What?

658
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,080
You know you did something ugly

659
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,880
and want to kill me?

660
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,880
Give it back to me!

661
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,680
You used my cultivation to deal with me.

662
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,080
Should I call you ugly

663
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
or stupid?

664
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,680
Go to Chongdan

665
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,680
and betray my evil spirit.

666
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,680
Idiot!

667
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Xiao Jingshan,

668
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,480
you're not that smart.

669
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,680
I've fooled you.

670
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,680
Push her away.

671
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
How is it?

672
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
Does it hurt here?

673
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,880
Bai Jiusi.

674
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
It's okay.

675
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,680
Don't be afraid.

676
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,880
Just tell me where you feel uncomfortable.

677
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,280
You're better.

678
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,080
Yu.

679
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
I'm sorry.

680
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,680
I'm sorry.

681
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,280
I'm sorry.

682
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,080
I'm sorry.

683
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Yu.

684
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,280
You gave me the soul-dead pearl.

685
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,280
It's the love that broke me.

686
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,880
I didn't know it would make you recover.

687
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,880
You just got hurt by the cold spirit flute.

688
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,680
You can't move your spirit energy so easily.

689
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,080
This is Yin-Yang Formation.

690
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,080
We are the ones who form the formation.

691
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,280
We'll hold each other's hands.

692
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,080
If we fall down in one's life,

693
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,480
we'll be in danger.

694
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,080
I'm sorry.

695
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
I'm sorry.

696
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,080
I'm sorry.

697
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,080
I'm sorry.

698
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,080
I'm sorry.

699
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,080
I'm sorry.

700
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,080
I'm sorry.

701
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,080
I'm sorry.

702
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,080
I'm sorry.

703
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,080
I'm sorry.

704
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,080
I'm sorry.

705
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,080
I'm sorry.

706
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,080
Yang Shuai,

707
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,080
you'll live in the dark.

708
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,080
Is there a way to break it?

709
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,880
Yes.

710
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
How?

711
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,680
Kill me.

712
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,080
I'm sorry.

713
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,080
I'm sorry.

714
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,080
I'm sorry.

715
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,080
I'm sorry.

716
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,080
I'm sorry.

717
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,080
I'm sorry.

718
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,080
I'm sorry.

719
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,080
I'm sorry.

720
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,080
I'm sorry.

721
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,080
I'm sorry.

722
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,080
I'm sorry.

723
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,080
I'm sorry.

724
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,080
I'm sorry.

725
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,080
I'm sorry.

726
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,080
I'm sorry.

727
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,080
I'm sorry.

728
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,080
I'm sorry.

729
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,080
I'm sorry.

730
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,080
I'm sorry.

731
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,080
I'm sorry.

732
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,080
I'm sorry.

733
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,080
I'm sorry.

734
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,080
I'm sorry.

735
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,080
I'm sorry.

736
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,080
I'm sorry.

737
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,080
I'm sorry.

738
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,080
I'm sorry.

739
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,080
I'm sorry.

740
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,080
I'm sorry.

741
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,080
I'm sorry.

742
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,080
I'm sorry.

743
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,080
I'm sorry.

744
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,080
I'm sorry.

745
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,080
I'm sorry.

746
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,080
I'm sorry.

747
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,080
I'm sorry.

748
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,080
I'm sorry.

749
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,080
I'm sorry.

750
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,080
I'm sorry.

751
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,080
I'm sorry.

752
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,080
I'm sorry.

753
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,080
I'm sorry.

754
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,080
I'm sorry.

755
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,080
I'm sorry.

756
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,080
I'm sorry.

757
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,080
I'm sorry.

758
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,080
I'm sorry.

759
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,080
I'm sorry.

760
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,080
I'm sorry.

761
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,080
I'm sorry.

762
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,080
I'm sorry.

763
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,080
I'm sorry.

764
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,080
I'm sorry.

765
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,080
I'm sorry.

766
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,080
