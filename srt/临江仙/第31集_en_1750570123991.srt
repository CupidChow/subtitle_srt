1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
minutes double

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,720
did

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,020
she

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,500
need

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,540
to

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,020
still

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,440
the

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,700
dialogue

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,480
with

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,100
tonight

11
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,100
The Legend of Qingcheng

12
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,100
Episode 16

13
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,100
I am Senior Brother Xingyue Meng.

14
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,100
But you underestimated me.

15
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,100
My love is not that shallow.

16
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
Senior Brother,

17
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,100
the people of the Yin Lian Sect

18
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,100
were all bewitched by the Blood Spirit.

19
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,100
They were all bewitched by the Yin Lian Sect

20
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,100
and couldn't be saved.

21
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,100
In order to save them,

22
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,100
in order to return to the Jing Yun Sect,

23
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,100
I had to fake our alliance

24
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
and lie to the Blood Spirit.

25
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Now the Blood Spirit has been taken by him.

26
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,100
The disciples of the Yin Lian Sect

27
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,100
will be fine.

28
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
You are all ungrateful.

29
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,100
If that is the case,

30
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,100
then I will kill you all

31
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,100
and find the contract room again.

32
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,100
Elder,

33
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,100
take the contract room away first.

34
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,100
We will hold it back.

35
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,100
We can't let the contract room fall into his hands.

36
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,100
Song Jing,

37
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
set up the formation.

38
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,100
Elder,

39
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,100
I will make the last move.

40
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
Yes.

41
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,100
Go.

42
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,100
If you hold on anymore,

43
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
you won't survive.

44
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
The disciples of the Jing Yun Sect

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,100
will not be leiath琉.

46
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:49,800
All those who punish have been lierded with

47
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Chen Mu

48
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Duoyun Chuan

49
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Wang Bao Xiang

50
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Liu Chu Shu

51
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
We are here to protect you

52
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Shen Yi

53
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Shun Mei

54
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
What are you hiding?

55
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Brother

56
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Don't be afraid

57
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Go to the hospital

58
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Eat

59
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
It's a fake death medicine

60
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
I know

61
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
I know, sister

62
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Shun Mei

63
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
You won't be fine

64
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Shun Mei

65
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Shun Mei

66
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Shun Mei

67
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Shun Mei

68
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Why do you still have to do this?

69
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
You should compensate me

70
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
You can't stop me

71
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
I'm sorry

72
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I ask you

73
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Do you want to continue?

74
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Shun Mei

75
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Liu Chang

76
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Don't give her the money

77
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,800
You should accept your fate.

78
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Don't fight for nothing.

79
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Otherwise, your tribe

80
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
will have to live a few more lives.

81
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
These monsters are trying to escape from the Elixir Mirror.

82
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
We can't let them leave.

83
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Otherwise, the room will be in danger.

84
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Li Mu!

85
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
What are you doing?

86
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Senior, you're right.

87
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
We can't let these monsters leave the Elixir Mirror.

88
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Li Mu!

89
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
What are you doing?

90
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
You said you'd kill those monsters by yourself.

91
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
No!

92
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
I can't be like you.

93
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
I have countless merits.

94
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
I can't be like you.

95
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I can't be like you.

96
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
I can't be like you.

97
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
I can't be like you.

98
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
I can't be like you.

99
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
I have countless merits.

100
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Only I can stop them.

101
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
You can't do this!

102
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
No!

103
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
If there's another life,

104
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
I promise you

105
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
that I'll only let you go.

106
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Li Mu!

107
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Li Mu!

108
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Li Mu!

109
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Li Mu!

110
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Li Mu!

111
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
You should have died long ago.

112
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Who are you?

113
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Your daughter is in danger.

114
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Where is Ling'er?

115
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Master Zhang.

116
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
Is there really no other way?

117
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
I'll go to Xiao Jiu Shan.

118
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
This is his magic weapon.

119
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
There must be a way to break it.

120
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Aren't you going to see the deity?

121
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
He has Bai Jiu Zi by his side.

122
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
You're in more danger than him.

123
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Don't go.

124
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
For the last time,

125
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
stay with me.

126
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
The people have left.

127
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,800
The magic blood has been destroyed.

128
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
The illusion he created

129
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
will also be destroyed.

130
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
This eye will also disappear with it.

131
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Ling'er!

132
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Ling'er!

133
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Ling'er!

134
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Ling'er!

135
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Ling'er!

136
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
You're wrong.

137
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Come out, okay?

138
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
Don't be stubborn.

139
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Come out quickly.

140
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Do you know

141
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,800
if I have the power of spirit,

142
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
even if my body is destroyed,

143
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
I can still have a soul

144
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
to repair it.

145
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
But now,

146
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
I'm just a useless person.

147
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
This formation

148
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
will destroy me.

149
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
I'd rather die

150
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
than be buried

151
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
in the three realms.

152
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Ling'er!

153
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Ling'er!

154
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Ling'er!

155
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Ling'er!

156
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Ling'er!

157
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Ling'er!

158
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Father,

159
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
your father

160
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
killed me.

161
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
I'm wrong.

162
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
I shouldn't have

163
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
killed you

164
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
You come out, okay?

165
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
Zhangsun.

166
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
I'm here.

167
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
You go.

168
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,720
If you don't go, it's too late.

169
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Zhangsun.

170
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Jiu Ling.

171
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
Jiu Ling.

172
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Hurry up.

173
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Save Jiu Ling.

174
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,560
Hurry up and save her.

175
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Yin Yuan Xian.

176
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,960
Yin Yuan Xian.

177
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
You are Jiu Ling.

178
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
Yu Ya.

179
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
Just tell me.

180
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,680
Last time you said my daughter's...

181
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,920
Fourth Sister.

182
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,920
What's going on?

183
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,200
Can't say.

184
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Can't say either.

185
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,560
Come.

186
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
Come.

187
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Yin Yuan.

188
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Yin Yuan.

189
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Can save.

190
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Who is my daughter has a marriage with?

191
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Little brother.

192
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
I know.

193
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I know.

194
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
I know.

195
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
I know.

196
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,960
I know.

197
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
I know.

198
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
I know.

199
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,960
I know.

200
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
I know your name is Zhangsun.

201
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,320
Don't be afraid.

202
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
I got you here

203
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,320
because you can save my daughter.

204
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Good foundation.

205
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
A good cultivator.

206
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
What do you want to do?

207
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
I want to introduce a marriage.

208
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
I have a daughter.

209
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Her birth date is 206.

210
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
She is like a flower.

211
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
High skill.

212
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
Her cultivation is top class.

213
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,080
Gentle and gentle.

214
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Beautiful and considerate.

215
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,080
I think she is a good match with you.

216
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,080
Match?

217
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
My grandmother is only 60.

218
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
You are so sharp.

219
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Can a mortal's birth date compare with an immortal?

220
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Since mortals can't compare with an immortal,

221
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
why do you have to call your daughter?

222
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
You...

223
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
I can't explain it to you.

224
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
Come on.

225
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
This jade pendant is ready.

226
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,640
This is your great Yin Yuan.

227
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
I was too young.

228
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
I don't remember.

229
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
I don't remember.

230
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,200
There must be a way.

231
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
I beg you.

232
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
I beg you.

233
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I beg you, Ling.

234
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
I kowtow to you.

235
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
I kowtow to you.

236
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
I kowtow to you.

237
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Get up.

238
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
I don't know how to save her.

239
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Don't force her.

240
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,200
She can't save me even if she trusts me.

241
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
It's been 600 years.

242
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
You are living a good life.

243
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Yes.

244
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
You are living in this stone tomb

245
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
under the fire of the three realms.

246
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
You are surprised by everything.

247
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
How can you be not impressed?

248
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
But what about me?

249
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,200
What about me, the one you killed and ruined my family?

250
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,200
You haven't made a decision yet.

251
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,200
I have to hold on for a while.

252
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
But there is no Yin and Yang teaching.

253
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Yin and Yang are balanced.

254
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Only then can we maintain the truth.

255
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
If you don't want to die,

256
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
you can't die.

257
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
You can't die.

258
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
You can't die.

259
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Only then can we maintain the truth.

260
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
If one side is strong,

261
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,760
the other side will be exhausted.

262
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
The truth will be unbalanced.

263
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,760
So,

264
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,760
there must be a person between us who wants to die.

265
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
That's right.

266
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
The time here is different from outside.

267
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
The moment here

268
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,320
is probably already over.

269
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Yun,

270
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Xiao Jing Shan is now re-examining

271
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
and reforming the Demon's Way.

272
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
The people outside are not his opponents.

273
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
If you keep hesitating,

274
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
it will only put more people in danger.

275
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
If that's the case,

276
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
you should be the one to leave.

277
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
Wu Liang Bei has your sister.

278
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Once you die,

279
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Xiao Jing Shan will kill Wu Liang Bei.

280
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Only you can deal with him.

281
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
Don't kill me, Yun.

282
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
I'm still injured.

283
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,880
I'm not his opponent.

284
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,880
I'll give you all my spiritual power.

285
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Yun.

286
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
It's a waste to give me your spiritual power.

287
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Only you

288
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,880
can deal with him now.

289
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
This is a death sentence.

290
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Only death can be broken.

291
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
An Jiu Si, what are you doing?

292
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,880
You must be careful.

293
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
You can't die like this.

294
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
I don't want to die.

295
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,440
Yun,

296
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,440
don't cry.

297
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
I know you love me.

298
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
We once loved each other.

299
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,440
We once hated each other.

300
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
The sweetness of being with you,

301
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
the pain of leaving you,

302
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
we all have experienced it.

303
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,440
It's time to

304
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,440
end Ying Guo.

305
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,440
I'm seriously injured.

306
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,440
I'm grateful

307
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,440
that you didn't take care of me.

308
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
I don't want you to forgive me.

309
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
I just want you to let yourself go.

310
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
We just reunited.

311
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,440
I didn't say anything

312
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,440
to you.

313
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Don't cry.

314
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
Don't cry.

315
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
I'm here.

316
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I'm here.

317
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
I'm here.

318
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
I'm here.

319
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
I'm here.

320
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Don't cry.

321
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
I'm sorry.

322
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
I'm going to let you face it alone.

323
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,440
From now on,

324
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,440
don't let yourself

325
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
fall into the abyss.

326
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
The sky is high, the sea is wide.

327
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,440
The years are deep.

328
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,440
Just take me with you.

329
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,440
Thank you, Master of the 민� Pollination.

330
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,440
Senior.

331
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
I'm leaving.

332
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
A'Yu.

333
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

334
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

335
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

336
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

337
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

338
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

339
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

340
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

341
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

342
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

343
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

344
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

345
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

346
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

347
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

348
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

349
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

350
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

351
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

352
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

353
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

354
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

355
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

356
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

357
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

358
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

359
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

360
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

361
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
I...

362
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,440
I love you.

363
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,440
I love you too.

364
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,440
Bai Jiu Ci!

365
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,440
He's the only one who can save me!

366
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,440
He's still dead.

367
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,440
He's still dead.

368
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
What?

369
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
I've fulfilled the wish that you've always wanted to fulfill.

370
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,440
I'm unhappy.

371
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,440
Zhuo Yue!

372
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,440
Even the sword is smarter than you.

373
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,440
You know how to choose.

374
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
It's fine.

375
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Nu policy,

376
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
no buts.

377
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
Hekate,

378
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,440
a new imperial非常ist fellow.

379
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,440
It's one time a slots.

380
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,440
I have to love him in this issue of mine.

381
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,520
Create Fiery shower of seven slinning.

382
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
需要不需要

383
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,400
Perfect kitten

384
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,100
Jimmy

385
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,000
Rush in

386
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,680
Met teamed

387
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,980

389
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,800
Two

390
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,800
Yum

391
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,200
You

392
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,000
Yes

393
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,800
Yes

394
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,720
I don't want

395
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,640
בתai

396
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,600
just like the hearsay

397
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,840
reasonless

398
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560

00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,120
You are прир Menting

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,600
Legislation of Immortal Soul

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,540
it only will 앦 you

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,680
you really do not wanna to relates

403
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,040
As long as achieve�

404
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,560
I'm not the only one in this world.

405
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,880
The Heavens are ruthless.

406
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,240
God has killed people.

407
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,400
But his name can be engraved on the weightless tombstone

408
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,520
and be respected.

409
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,200
Why do you stop me?

410
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,880
Yuan Chehua is guilty.

411
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,960
But he died in the battle of the Three Realms of Peace.

412
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,560
You're just satisfied

413
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,000
with your own satisfaction.

414
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,920
The Heavens are ruthless.

415
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,880
But people are ruthless.

416
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,640
The love between a son and a daughter,

417
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,280
the blood of a relative,

418
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,240
the love between a classmate,

419
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,040
they're all love.

420
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,440
Anyone's life

421
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,080
should be their own.

422
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,760
Not yours.

423
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,800
It's your love

424
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,480
that has led to the death of everyone.

425
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,760
Elder.

426
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,600
You've sacrificed so many people.

427
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,160
A loving one like me.

428
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,760
Why do you need to love her?

429
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,600
I've no choice.

430
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,320
Imelda.

431
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,600
The promise of life and death

432
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,600
We'll talk about it later

433
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,600
After a few months, you and I

434
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Still afraid that I

435
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,600
Will say that this is the end

436
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Leaving behind in the dream

437
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,360
This dream is like a

438
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Love is like a dream

439
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,360
The promise of life and death

440
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,360
We'll talk about it later

441
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,360
After a few months, you and I

442
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,360
Still afraid that I

443
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,120
Will say that this is the end

444
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Leaving behind in the dream

445
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,120
This is the end

446
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,120
Leaving behind in the dream

447
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,120
The promise of life and death

448
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,120
We'll talk about it later

449
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,880
Leaving behind in the dream

450
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,880
This is the end

451
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,880
Leaving behind in the dream

452
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,880
This is the end

453
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Leaving behind in the dream

454
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,640
This is the end

455
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,640
If you join hands

456
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,640
I'm afraid I'll be in a lot of pain

457
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,640
But you people

458
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Are always surrounded by so-called moral values

459
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,640
And you've come to the wrong path step by step

460
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,640
I said that if you have weakness

461
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,640
You will definitely lose

462
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Xiao Jing Shan

463
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,400
You didn't realize that you were wrong

464
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,400
You want to prove that there is no love in nature

465
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,400
And you are angry because of your moral values

466
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,400
You are the one who is lying

467
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,400
And I said

468
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Weakness is also a loss

469
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,360
Feeling a bit painful

470
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,440
Can't take a step

471
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,640
Lan Yin

472
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:41,440
Are you tired of left or right?

473
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,640
You'll get used to it

474
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,680
How many drops?

475
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,280
Qi Yue, help me.

476
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,360
Diaoyu!

477
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,000
Here,

478
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,960
you got some of Ba Street Priest's soul,

479
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,640
how about protecting you through death!

480
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,600
Ba Street Priest!

481
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,920
Xi'an,

482
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:16,840
rather than a chせdica ofía

483
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,340
it will braking

484
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:40,400
and

485
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,960
you Rabbit

486
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
you have lost

487
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,020
maybe

488
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
If you're not hurt,

489
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,960
there are still a few chances to save you.

490
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,360
You can't stop me.

491
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
There are three realms,

492
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,160
and you want to die with me.

493
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
I'm worth it.

494
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
My lord, don't give up.

495
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,960
Ting'er, you...

496
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
Ye Men.

497
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
Stand up.

498
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,960
Look at me.

499
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,960
I'm here.

500
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,960
I'm here.

501
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,960
I'm here.

502
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,960
I'm here.

503
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Go to the immortal stage.

504
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
With you,

505
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,960
we can take the last step.

506
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,960
I feel something is wrong with Tian Mu Feng.

507
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,960
Who can accompany me to the front?

508
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,960
I'm willing to go with you.

509
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,960
I'm willing to go with you.

510
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
I'm going too.

511
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,960
That is the Danxia Mirror that Lin Mo brought.

512
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,960
I want to protect it.

513
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,960
I'm sorry, Lin Mo.

514
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
Don't feel guilty.

515
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Actually,

516
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,960
I don't like you that much.

517
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,960
I don't like you.

518
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
I don't like you.

519
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
I don't like you.

520
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
I don't like you.

521
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
I don't like you.

522
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
I don't like you.

523
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
I like you.

524
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,960
It's just your obsession with the immortal.

525
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Because I never knew

526
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
that there was love

527
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,960
that could make people abandon their lives.

528
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Brother!

529
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,960
Brother!

530
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
I understand.

531
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,960
Lin Mo is just like a child.

532
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
He has gone through his love.

533
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
I understand.

534
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,960
I understand.

535
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,960
It's okay.

536
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
Xiao Jing Shan!

537
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,960
Now it's time to settle our old scores!

538
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,960
Xiao Jing Shan,

539
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,960
you could have gotten rid of all the people who were in your way sooner.

540
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,960
But you chose to set up a barrier for everyone.

541
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,960
Just like what I said earlier,

542
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,960
you've been lying to yourself.

543
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,960
You're not testing anyone.

544
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,960
You're testing yourself.

545
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,960
You want someone to prove that you're wrong.

546
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,960
Are you satisfied now?

547
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,960
Do you remember the last night I spent with you?

548
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,960
It was called the return of the Su Ghost.

549
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,960
I haven't been able to make it up.

550
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,960
Because the last step is to make the owner's

551
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,960
immortal.

552
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
So what?

553
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,960
Si Ling,

554
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
I'm giving it to you.

555
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
Don't let me down.

556
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,960
I'm sorry.

557
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,960
I'm sorry.

558
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:40,960
The night entangles the fire

559
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:56,960
Looking back at yesterday, the love and hate are no longer in the past

560
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:09,960
The flowers and the sea are still in the air

561
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,960
I look at you with a smile

562
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,960
The corner of my eyes is filled with a line

563
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:36,960
Tell me, where are you?

564
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,960
I want to cry and I still want to think of you

565
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,960
I want to be drunk in your arms

566
00:45:51,960 --> 00:46:05,960
Tell you, I love you very much
