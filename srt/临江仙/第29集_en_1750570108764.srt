9
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Ok, let's go

10
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I didn't expect that I could not escape today

11
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I didn't expect that I could not escape today

12
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You are a spirit beast, you know the power of the soul

13
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You must know that the big trouble is coming

14
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Master

15
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Master

16
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Master

17
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Master

18
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why don't you see the master?

19
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I have other things to do

20
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's going on here?

21
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
They are all in a coma at the same time

22
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I used all kinds of spells and pills

23
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I can't wake them up

24
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I can't wake them up

25
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm afraid they will be...

26
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Zhang San

27
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Ling'er

28
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Any other發現?

29
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Even if Xiao Jing Shan is a genius of talents

30
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's not easy to practice such some letzt Filter

31
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Even if Xiao Jing Shan is a genius of talents

32
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
it's not easy to practice such somesonaro of Nature

33
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Zhang San

34
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,200
If there are weapons around, you will definitely summon them.

35
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Okay.

36
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
My dear, I'm here.

37
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,600
I'll protect you.

38
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,400
Everyone, long time no see.

39
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Master.

40
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,200
Good disciple.

41
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,800
It's not easy to kill a master with one blow.

42
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,200
What are you?

43
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,400
You're not worthy of being called my master.

44
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,600
Forget it.

45
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,200
Since you're a junior,

46
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,800
I won't bother you.

47
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,800
Zhangsun.

48
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,800
That's his fake body. It's useless to attack him.

49
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,800
You're a great master.

50
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,400
You're in such a state.

51
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,000
Why don't you just die?

52
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,400
Xiao Jingshan.

53
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,400
You're a demon master. You only know how to control the demon aura.

54
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Even if you're a senior, you won't last long.

55
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,600
I don't want to live forever.

56
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,400
I want to achieve my dream before I die.

57
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,200
What do you want to do?

58
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,800
I just don't want to waste your time.

59
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,600
I want to give you a hint.

60
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,800
I took their souls.

61
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,000
The joy cup that trapped them is just 10 miles away.

62
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,200
Joy cup?

63
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes. You guessed it right.

64
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,400
It's similar to the Great Yellow Cup.

65
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,800
As for why I gave it such a short name, you can go and find out.

66
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,000
Master, he's not kind at all.

67
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
You can't fall for it.

68
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,400
Yes, I set a trap.

69
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,200
As for whether you want to come in or not,

70
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,000
you're in.

71
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,600
Xiao Jingshan.

72
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,600
I saw your illusion made with the Great Yellow Cup.

73
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,200
I know about your family.

74
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,800
Thunder birds are in trouble.

75
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,800
When Yuan Chenghua was eliminating the demon, he didn't want to gather your family.

76
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,600
I can understand that you're angry with the True Lord of the Green Mountain.

77
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,400
Now he's already in the clouds.

78
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Even if you destroy the cup, you can't make up for it.

79
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,600
You're talking too much.

80
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,400
It's Yuan Chenghua's sword light that caused the fire in my family.

81
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,800
Why would he still be able to sit on the cup and be admired by the world?

82
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,600
The government doesn't care about this kind of evil person.

83
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,000
The Heaven doesn't care.

84
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll take care of it myself.

85
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,200
The Heaven doesn't care.

86
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,400
After Yuan Chenghua was able to subdue the Thunder Bird, he committed 50 years of Heaven punishment.

87
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,000
After that, he protected the peace of the Three Realms and died in the battle of the Demon.

88
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,600
This is the reason why he's stuck on the Great Yellow Cup.

89
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,200
My family and my friends, all five of them,

90
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,800
I just wanted to erase the name of one person.

91
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I was punished and imprisoned for 500 years.

92
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,400
During this time of being imprisoned, I saw through everything.

93
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,800
That's why I changed my path.

94
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,000
The Heaven doesn't care. I can't change it.

95
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Only the evil people.

96
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,600
So this Great Yellow Cup must be returned.

97
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,200
Immortal Commander, you should think about the people around you.

98
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,200
After all, I've been your guest for hundreds of years.

99
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,200
The weakness of you people is beyond my knowledge.

100
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
I...

101
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Your so-called weakness can also become our burden.

102
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,200
Then let's wait and see.

103
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,000
· Order ·

104
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,600
· Orders against Fuyao ·

105
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,400
Are you afraid of him?

106
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,680
It's better than nothing at all.

107
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,040
And I'm not afraid of being a pickup journey.

108
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,960
A

109
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,360
Someone's come.

110
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,440
We will know

111
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,160
who's во fifth

112
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Be careful.

113
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
An Man, what's wrong?

114
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
In the past, our disciples from the Immortal Sects

115
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
would guard the secret forest.

116
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But after I came here,

117
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I didn't see anyone.

118
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If that's the case,

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
you should be more careful.

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Watch out!

121
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Watch out!

122
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Watch out!

123
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Watch out!

124
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Watch out!

125
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Watch out!

126
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Watch out!

127
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Watch out!

128
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Watch out!

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Watch out!

130
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Watch out!

131
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What's this?

132
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is the snake's tongue of our Immortal Sects.

133
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
In order to stop the invaders,

134
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
they said they didn't get attacked.

135
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
They won't attack us.

136
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It seems that someone has already prepared

137
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
for us.

138
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Everyone should be extra careful.

139
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, Master.

140
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
My mother will be fine, right?

141
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
An Man, don't worry.

142
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We will definitely save your mother.

143
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Everything now is just our speculation.

144
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The situation may not be as bad as we imagined.

145
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't worry.

146
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's go.

147
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Little girl,

148
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
which way do you want to go?

149
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't know.

150
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You don't know the way to the Immortal Sect?

151
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It wasn't like this before.

152
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
These two paths

153
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
will automatically change every now and then.

154
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The path with smoke

155
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
can be passed without using any power.

156
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The path without smoke

157
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
leads to the Poison Fist.

158
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The path will lead to the Four Seasons.

159
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The path is blocked.

160
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The path is blocked.

161
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The path is blocked.

162
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The Four Seasons.

163
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't know why

164
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
there are smoke everywhere.

165
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It seems that

166
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
we have to try it ourselves.

167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'll go first.

168
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There is no master.

169
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The disciple is walking on the path ahead.

170
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But Master.

171
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You take care of them shortly.

172
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes.

173
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What's going on?

174
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Where is Senior Long Yuan?

175
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't know.

176
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't know who destroyed the seal of the jade room.

177
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The beasts inside

178
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
have escaped.

179
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Long Yuan is guarding the Cang Lei Hall.

180
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He asked me to come and watch

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Wu Liangbei of the Heavenly Wooden Spear.

182
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Wu Liangbei has the seal

183
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
of the barrier that the Xuanjun used to set.

184
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
As long as he is fine,

185
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
no one can touch Wu Liangbei.

186
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Even so,

187
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
the seal that you set

188
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
a while ago

189
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
was broken.

190
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's not broken.

191
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's broken.

192
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If it were so,

193
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
according to the situation of Master a while ago,

194
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
there would be no accident.

195
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Be careful.

196
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You go first.

197
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll go find Senior.

198
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Master.

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Are you really leaving?

200
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
There are hundreds of souls

201
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
in the mountain of Xiaojing.

202
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
To lure me to go,

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I won't let so many innocent people

204
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
suffer because of me.

205
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But you took him with you.

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
He is safe.

207
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The barrier of Wu Liangbei will not be broken.

208
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
In order to prevent Xiao Jingshan

209
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
from taking the opportunity to attack him,

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I must take him with me.

211
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I know the skill of training.

212
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
If you want to break the seal of the happiness

213
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Xiao Jingshan said,

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
you can't leave me.

215
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Master.

216
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
My magic power

217
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
was passed on to me by Xiao Jingshan.

218
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I can control his magic power.

219
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It seems that

220
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm useless.

221
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Useless.

222
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You stay here

223
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and watch these people who are in a coma.

224
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Protect them.

225
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Wait for me to bring back their souls.

226
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
As you command.

227
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Go.

228
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Go.

229
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's so beautiful.

230
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Xiao Jingshan has a plan.

231
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He won't lie.

232
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Have you found the trail of the happy cup?

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I've been looking for you all day.

234
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm here to see you.

235
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You're here to see me.

236
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm here to see you.

237
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm here to see you.

238
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm here to see you.

239
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm here to see you.

240
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm here to see you.

241
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I can feel the magic power in my body.

242
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Something is wrong here.

243
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This must be the entrance.

244
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The white wine.

245
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
My wife.

246
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Let's go and have a look.

247
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's so good.

248
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Take it back and play.

249
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay.

250
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Where is this?

251
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I really like it.

252
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Look at my hair.

253
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Why is my poster gone?

254
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's so early today.

255
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're so good.

256
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Go.

257
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You're not as fast as me.

258
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Why are you so slow?

259
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You can do it yourself in the future.

260
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm so happy.

261
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Sister, how about this color?

262
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's so beautiful.

263
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I want it too.

264
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Help me wrap it up.

265
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Okay.

266
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Master is here.

268
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Master is here.

269
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Fi0n, catch him.

270
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He is coming.

271
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Look everyone.

272
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh my head.

273
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Hurry up!

274
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Hurry up!

275
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Hurry up!

276
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Hurry up!

277
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Hurry up!

278
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
SUPPなんか?

279
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
SUPP daqui goofy Rubbish

280
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:19,700
white Т��

281
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
Why don't you kneel down?

282
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
You will be punished

283
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Why don't you kneel down?

284
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Crown prince, please kneel down

285
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
God

286
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
God

287
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,700
It's ok

288
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,700
How is it?

289
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
How is the name of the happiness cup?

290
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,700
Master, senior

291
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,700
This is the antidote

292
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
In case of emergency, it's better to eat it in advance

293
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,700
You also take some

294
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,700
I don't want to take your medicine

295
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Who knows what's inside

296
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
I grew up here since I was a child

297
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
I can't get out

298
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
Ok, let's go

299
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
Be careful

300
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,700
Be careful

301
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
Don't use your power

302
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
The mist here can control your power

303
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Whoever uses his power will be seriously injured

304
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Then you should think of something

305
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
A Man

306
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
A Man

307
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
Senior

308
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
A Man

309
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
What are you doing?

310
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,700
I don't know if it works or not, let's try it first

311
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Be careful

312
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,700
My mother used to use blood to deal with these snakes

313
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
They still recognize our blood

314
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Go

315
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
A man

316
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
A man

317
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Ming Shun, don't listen

318
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
There's something wrong with the spiritual mountain

319
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Senior, where's my mother?

320
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
Don't go there, look at their eyes

321
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
A Man

322
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Senior, look at me, I'm A Man

323
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Don't look at him, he's my senior

324
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,700
Senior

325
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
Xu Xinguan

326
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
You don't let us kill them

327
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
You can't wait for them to kill us

328
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
Master, don't take my power

329
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Who are you?

330
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Master

331
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
Master

332
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
Master

333
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
Master

334
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
Brother Meng, don't worry

335
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
I will help you find your master

336
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Senior

337
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
Senior, you can't do this

338
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Senior

339
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,700
Senior

340
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,700
Senior

341
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
You can't use your power

342
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
You can't use your power

343
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,700
With this whip

344
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,700
Hee, I made you lose

345
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,700
Brother

346
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,700
These were són for many hundred years

347
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,700
With our power

348
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,700
We can't just let juniors go

349
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,700
Going everywhere

350
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Can never let out these monsters

351
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:23,000
흐

352
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,700
Let's go.

353
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,060
I want to play too.

354
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,180
You said you want to make up.

355
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,900
Can the person who went out catch Xiao Jingshan?

356
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,140
What's the result?

357
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,260
This is anger,

358
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,420
and the third time is fierce.

359
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,220
That means those who left the tribe

360
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,420
and dealt with Xiao Jingshan are in danger.

361
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,020
That's not good.

362
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,020
You and your wife can't be in danger.

363
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,540
Do we have to go over there and help them?

364
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,140
Do they know that their soul

365
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,620
was taken by you?

366
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,740
A little.

367
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,420
Don't be so mean.

368
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,660
They live the life they want.

369
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,260
I don't have time to be grateful.

370
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,340
To see a fake world

371
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,380
and be a fake god.

372
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,460
This is what you want?

373
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,220
I don't care about that.

374
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,420
I'm so busy

375
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,660
because of you.

376
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,660
Because of me?

377
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,380
I want you to know

378
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,940
what is the true goal of a star.

379
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,220
What is the ideal activity of perfect and flawless.

380
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,260
It's not the so-called self-righteous.

381
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,060
You're all rumors.

382
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,980
Who are you?

383
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,100
How dare you talk to the god like that?

384
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,820
That's right.

385
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,020
How can you be so good?

386
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,980
That's right.

387
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,900
Without the god,

388
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,460
how can my life be good?

389
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,380
Don't slander the god.

390
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,940
The god gave me wealth.

391
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,420
He told me not to be a whore.

392
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,140
He told me not to pray.

393
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,460
How dare you slander the god?

394
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,060
Why should we slander the god?

395
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,700
Yes.

396
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,460
Why should we slander the god?

397
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,020
Why should we slander the god?

398
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,020
Why should we slander the god?

399
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,340
What are you doing?

400
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,460
What are you doing?

401
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,140
You don't have the power now.

402
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,020
Don't be too reckless.

403
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,340
What are you doing?

404
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,740
What are you doing?

405
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,260
You're the rumors.

406
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,060
Xiao Jingshan.

407
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,380
What do you want to do?

408
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,060
There's no love in the heaven.

409
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,300
Regardless of the god,

410
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,900
there are many selfishness.

411
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,860
This is just a small experiment.

412
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,180
Isn't it good to make the current heaven and earth

413
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,740
perfect and flawless like a dream?

414
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,220
Siling.

415
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,220
You know there are many bad things in the world.

416
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,860
Why don't you try to rebuild it?

417
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,660
Rebuild a heaven and earth

418
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,660
that makes everyone satisfied?

419
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,140
You know that

420
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,780
the ideal world we want

421
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,820
is a perfect match.

422
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,140
It's easy to say.

423
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,620
How to rebuild it?

424
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,780
With your power?

425
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,140
Of course not.

426
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,980
Everything develops to a certain stage.

427
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,500
There are destructive results.

428
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,860
This is called the destruction of the heaven and earth.

429
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,060
We can only follow it and let it happen.

430
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,900
Only destruction

431
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,260
is the beginning of rebirth.

432
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,500
This is the real purpose of you destroying the Empty Cup.

433
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,980
You don't have to talk to me anymore.

434
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,060
I'll give you one last chance.

435
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,100
Do you want to be with me?

436
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,780
If you promise me to let the people around you

437
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,780
and your clan

438
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
to keep their lives.

439
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,060
Xiao Jing Shan.

440
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,420
You're starting to deceive yourself.

441
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,700
If you can only persuade me with your words,

442
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,900
why did you waste hundreds of years

443
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,860
to design my death

444
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,460
and the death of Bai Jiu?

445
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,140
You don't have to keep my clan.

446
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,700
They will protect themselves.

447
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,180
Everyone.

448
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,060
There are people who oppose your god.

449
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,820
There are people who don't want you to live a good life.

450
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,660
What should we do?

451
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,660
They want to harm us.

452
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,060
We must resist them.

453
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,260
Yes.

454
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:14,860
That's right.

455
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,860
It's the end of the world to slander our god.

456
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,700
Kill the evil.

457
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,900
Kill the evil.

458
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,900
Kill the evil.

459
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,100
Kill the evil.

460
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,260
Kill the evil.

461
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:23,900
Siling.

462
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,700
You're self-righteous.

463
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,380
I want to see

464
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,420
if you can save

465
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,820
someone in need to save their time.

466
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,060
Kill the evil.

467
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,420
Kill the evil.

468
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,900
Kill the evil.

469
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,580
Kill the evil.

470
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,340
Kill the evil.

471
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,660
Kill the evil.

472
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,180
Kill the evil.

473
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,660
Kill the evil.

474
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,460
Kill the evil.

475
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,860
Kill the evil.

476
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,260
Kill the evil.

477
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,020
Kill the evil.

478
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,340
Who knows whatever this place is,

479
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,980
I still would be there touching her lips.

480
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,460
Why are there so many bad people here?

481
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,340
What's that woman looking for?

482
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,520
You are going to attack her try your best to your voids,

483
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,540
But honestly, you have no chance to win this battle.

484
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,300
What about Wen Ling?

485
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,300
She took her first place in Explosive layout......

486
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:32,360
She is now winning all Purple�

487
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,920
Who knows a non-dwheelhole like you will be normal.

488
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,660
Do you mean

489
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,520
The pot should be in its right color?

490
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,660
You are greasy shit.

491
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,820
Are you go back there straight away?

492
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,740
Only you and me,

493
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,960
Why my soul leaves here...

494
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,060
Principal designate me as you.

495
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,360
You bastard! Who let you be my mother?

496
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,360
You controlled those disciples and the snake to kill us.

497
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,360
Is the Yin-Ling Sect leader and my master in your hands?

498
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360
Master!

499
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Sect Leader!

500
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Mother! Mother!

501
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
Mother!

502
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,360
What did you do?

503
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,360
Nothing. I just let them listen.

504
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,360
I just give you a chance.

505
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,360
I give you a chance to leave here alive.

506
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,360
Silly girl, how could I let my own body appear here?

507
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,360
Xiao Jing Shan, what exactly do you want?

508
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
I give you a choice.

509
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,360
The sect leader and the leader of the Yin-Ling Sect,

510
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,360
who do you want to live?

511
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,360
Who do you want to die?

512
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,360
Kill the evil spirits! Kill the evil spirits!

513
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,360
Kill the evil spirits! Kill the evil spirits!

514
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,360
Call the rascals!

515
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,360
Call the rascals!

516
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,360
Call the rascals!

517
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,360
Call the rascals!

518
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,160
Call the rascals!

519
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
Go to hell!

520
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,360
Kill the rascals!

521
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,360
Kill the rascals!

522
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,360
Kill the rascals!

523
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,280
Kill filiej hier備

524
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,180
OK, you just go

525
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:27,240
Kill filiej hier年前

526
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:40,200
Kill filiej hier películas

527
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,460
Killing RED caterpillars!

528
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,880
Are you ok, golf?

529
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Where are you going?

530
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Where are you going?

531
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
Where are you going?

532
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Where are you going?

533
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Mom

534
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,200
Master

535
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Mom

536
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Master

537
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,200
It's easy

538
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Master of the Cloud Sect treats you like a reborn parent

539
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,200
The master of the Cloud Sect is also the mother of your beloved

540
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
I want to see how you will choose

541
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
As long as you three have the same mouth

542
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
The one who chooses is me

543
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
In contrast, it is death

544
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Why should we listen to you?

545
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Stop, stop

546
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Don't worry

547
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
I'm a man of my word

548
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
I'll let go if you say

549
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
You can't kill me

550
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
But I can kill them

551
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
If you don't believe me, you can try

552
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
No need

553
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Mom

554
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
Why are you crying?

555
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
Turn your tears back to me

556
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Don't embarrass me outside

557
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
My country is death

558
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
What are you afraid of?

559
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Mom

560
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
I don't want you to die

561
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Long Chong

562
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
I was not careful enough

563
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,200
So I took his knife

564
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
I promise you

565
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Next

566
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,200
I will take good care of them

567
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,200
No

568
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,200
Master

569
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Old Gu Bai

570
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Why should you be a good person?

571
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
I'm not afraid of death, okay?

572
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
How about it?

573
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
Who do you three choose to live?

574
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,200
If you don't choose, both of you will die

575
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
If you don't want to be a bad person

576
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,200
I will do it

577
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
I choose our master

578
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Song Guan

579
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
I will accept your punishment

580
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
I just don't want to hurt you

581
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
What about you?

582
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Meng Chu

583
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Take your sword

584
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
I don't want to die in the hands of this bastard

585
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
Shameless

586
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
You can't beat us

587
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,200
You only dare to use this kind of evil

588
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I will not let you stop the people of the Cloud Sect

589
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Master

590
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
Meng Chu

591
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
You are the fire of the Cloud Sect

592
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
Master

593
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,200
No

594
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Let him go

595
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,200
Master

596
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Master

597
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Master

598
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
Such a fun fight

599
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
Why no one comes to inform me?

600
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
Right

601
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,200
I heard it myself

602
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
He came to me

603
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
The monster of the Cloud Sect

604
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Interesting

605
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Where is he?

606
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Brother

607
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
The four-lifed man is suffering from the five-lifed man

608
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
It's a waste of time

609
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
I knew I couldn't rely on it

610
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
I can't even hold the stone

611
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,200
Who are you talking about?

612
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,200
Senior

613
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Senior

614
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Senior

615
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
I'll protect you.

616
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
Leave first.

617
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
You can't protect me here.

618
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
I can.

619
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Stop talking nonsense.

620
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
If I tell you to leave, you'll leave.

621
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
Go find Master.

622
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,200
There must be a living person by Master's side.

623
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Master.

624
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,200
Master.

625
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Master.

626
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
Master.

627
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,200
Master.

628
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Master.

629
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Master.

630
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Master.

631
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Master.

632
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Master.

633
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
Master.

634
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Brother, how was that?

635
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Brother.

636
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,200
Brother.

637
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Let me in.

638
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
Brother.

639
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,200
There's nothing to fear.

640
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
I'm not afraid of you.

641
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
I'm not afraid of you.

642
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
I'm not afraid of you.

643
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
I'm not afraid of you.

644
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
They are so little.

645
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
To me,

646
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
they are like ants biting me.

647
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
Yes, to me,

648
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
they are like ants biting me.

649
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
We just arrived.

650
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
We are not afraid of you.

651
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Great.

652
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
We fight them with our own fire.

653
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,200
We can't let them

654
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
underestimate the Tang Lijian.

655
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
Hong Lian.

656
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Look.

657
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
I just woke up.

658
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
I met such a big problem.

659
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,200
I'm the same race as you.

660
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
I can't break the barrier

661
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
he set.

662
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
Can you?

663
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Why do you say that?

664
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,200
After all, I've been married for thousands of years.

665
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,200
What is this kind of barrier?

666
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Can you help me get in?

667
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
I'm injured.

668
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,200
I can't hold on for too long.

669
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Sure.

670
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
Then you

671
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,200
kiss me.

672
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
I'll take you in.

673
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
I'm just kidding.

674
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
The water in this pond is too clean.

675
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,200
I don't have

676
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,200
any thoughts of mess now.

677
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Let's go.

678
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,200
To help

679
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,200
my senior who wanted to kill me.

680
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
I'll return your favor.

681
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Thank you.

682
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,200
The End

683
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,200
The End

684
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
The End

685
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,200
The End

686
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,200
The End
