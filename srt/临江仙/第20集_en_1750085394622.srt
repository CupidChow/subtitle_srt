1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
The aşστε

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,400
SECRET AND specimen

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:20,600
Sharks斯 special!

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,100
I'mors are born of flowers, I'mors are born of fire

12
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,500
my friends say it's tough

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,000
In my family I'm not insane

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,100
I'm not jealous of your eyes

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,000
But tears are still fine

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The feeling of North Africa

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to learn to understand

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
the adding sweetheart

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,840
Kill the wrong ś Shopping, time will pencil

20
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,200
You are looking right

21
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,900
No problem

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Uncle Bai!

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Uncle Bai!

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Uncle Bai!

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Uncle Bai!

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Uncle Bai!

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Uncle Bai!

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Uncle Bai, my peach tree is on fire again!

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll give you two to taste!

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You!

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Recently, the city is not stable.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't come here again, okay?

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't come here again, okay?

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Uncle Bai, you're a fairy.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm the safest hiding in your place.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Did my mother say she won't let you see me?

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Did my mother say she won't let me see you?

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My mother always thinks I'm causing you trouble.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So she said she won't let me see you.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But I won't listen to her.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Uncle Bai is my favorite person.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You're the one I care the most among these friends.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll give you my favorite.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Uncle Bai, you can't go with my mother.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You know that she's the only one who takes care of me.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't have a father to take care of me.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
She's also been through a lot.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Uncle Bai,

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I sometimes think

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
that's good for you to be my father.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Did he fall asleep?

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Come in.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What are you doing?

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I've grown up.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I've made a small hat for him.

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I got some free time today.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll make him a new one.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The thread is fast.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's really delicate.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Your craft is really good.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You've learned all of this in ten years.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm not afraid of you.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You won't be able to see him here.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So what?

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I want to keep talking to you.

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What to talk about?

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Talking about how I've trained in these sixty- Dynamic.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Mr. Ren always keeps saying

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There is no love in the world.

71
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
But is God also without love?

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I really didn't know that before.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Maybe...

74
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
This is also God's self-preservation.

75
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
After all, when people's lives are in danger,

76
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
if they really love each other,

77
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
in the end, there is only one person who is hurt.

78
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,520
For example, you are against Lin Fan.

79
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
You and the Meng family have the same feelings in the three generations.

80
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,320
The separation is only about yourself.

81
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
This is too big a reason.

82
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
I don't want to say more.

83
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
We all have our own ways.

84
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
We are not comfortable together.

85
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
I don't want to hear other people's words.

86
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,760
I have always followed my own path.

87
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
That is to protect you and keep you safe.

88
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
To make you happy.

89
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
In the ten years we have been in this world,

90
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
we have been talking about us for a while.

91
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,200
I always felt that you are the real God of Shanggu.

92
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Even if you lose your power, you will still live forever.

93
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
But in these six years,

94
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,440
it has made me see the world clearly.

95
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,440
Now, you are going to wash your clothes and wear your clothes.

96
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
You will go to the female palace to cook.

97
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Have you ever been by my side?

98
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
But you will not do anything.

99
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
In the ten years I have been sealed by the law,

100
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
you have been in my arms.

101
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,440
You are the one who has been in my arms.

102
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,440
I have been in your arms.

103
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
I have been in your arms.

104
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
The mortal life is not more than a hundred years.

105
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
But you will live and die.

106
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
You will be buried and buried.

107
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
In the short and short hundred years,

108
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
you will be happy and you will be happy.

109
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,440
The one who is in pain will die.

110
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,440
A'Yun, I know that you are not willing to mention the past.

111
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Maybe you think that I am not a person who understands the past.

112
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
But now I have been in the same body for six years.

113
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Can you tell me why you hate me?

114
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
You have been thrown into the ten years in the mortal world.

115
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
I have been in the same body for ten years.

116
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,440
I have been in many, many, many bodies.

117
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
But all of these have passed.

118
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Now the level of the matter is the blood in the city.

119
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,440
When it is solved,

120
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,440
I will tell you all the past ten years.

121
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Is that okay?

122
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
Okay.

123
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
Then I will wait for you.

124
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
It's late.

125
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Go back and rest.

126
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
You have to find a new one tomorrow.

127
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
You should rest too.

128
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,440
I will tell you all the past ten years.

129
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
I will tell you all the past ten years.

130
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Duan.

131
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Duan.

132
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Give me my master.

133
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Master?

134
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Master.

135
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
How is my master?

136
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
He is not easy to get used to.

137
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
Master is badly injured.

138
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Where is the Dragon King?

139
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
He has left.

140
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,440
He has left?

141
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Where is he?

142
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
The mortal world, Jingyun Sect,

143
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
said to take back the original god of the Xuan Lord.

144
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Why didn't you stop him?

145
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
He said that the Xuan Lord of the Four Spiritual Masters

146
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
would take the original god of the Xuan Lord.

147
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
He wanted to avenge Jingyun Sect.

148
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
I couldn't stop him.

149
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Although the master and the Xuan Lord have a grudge,

150
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,440
the Xuan Lord is the most important person in his heart.

151
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
If he is hurt by Jingyun Sect,

152
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
then they will be no good.

153
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
If a woman like him doesn't deserve the Xuan Lord,

154
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
it's a pity that he won't be good.

155
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
It's not that we are not good.

156
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
We are not good.

157
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
We are the master and the Xuan Lord.

158
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Even if we can't help him,

159
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
we can't harm him.

160
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
What do you want?

161
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
Retreat.

162
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Everything will be settled when the Xuan Lord returns.

163
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
This is the first time that the Xuan Lord of the Dragon King is in the past.

164
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
If you want to stop him,

165
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
you can go and talk to him.

166
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Okay.

167
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Take care.

168
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Is anyone home?

169
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
Is anyone home?

170
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Your Majesty.

171
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
What's the matter?

172
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
He is the evil spirit.

173
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Nonsense.

174
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
The evil spirit is the evil spirit.

175
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Nonsense.

176
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
The time we came to Suhe County is far from you.

177
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
You followed us when you came here.

178
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
When I was with the evil spirit,

179
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
I hurt his neck.

180
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Someone saw it with their own eyes.

181
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,440
Mr. Bai is not the evil spirit.

182
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
He is the evil spirit.

183
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
If Mr. Bai is not the evil spirit,

184
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
let us see.

185
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Yes.

186
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Let us see.

187
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
Yes.

188
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Let us see.

189
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
What are you looking at?

190
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Okay.

191
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Let us come in and see.

192
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Go.

193
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Go.

194
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Let's go in.

195
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
Let's go.

196
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Let's go.

197
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Let's go.

198
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,440
Let's go.

199
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
What's going on?

200
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
What's going on?

201
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Let's go.

202
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Let's go.

203
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Let's go.

204
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Master, this...

205
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Please forgive me.

206
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
What should we do, Master?

207
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
Let's go.

208
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
What should we do?

209
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Master, what should we do?

210
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,440
You're not recovered.

211
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
You should stay here for a few days.

212
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
That little demon is just a mortal.

213
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,440
It seems that the evil spirit behind you

214
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,440
has cured your ability.

215
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,440
So I want to use the mortal's hand

216
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,440
to lure you into this.

217
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Why are you looking at me like this?

218
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,440
This is the first time we've met.

219
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,440
You're still in the mood to leave?

220
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
I want to know

221
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
who is the one

222
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,440
who can't let go of the past between us.

223
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
It seems that you don't care about

224
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,440
the fact that you're misunderstood

225
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
as a bloodthirsty woman.

226
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,440
I was worried

227
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
that the Emperor wouldn't be too angry.

228
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Ah...

229
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
Master,

230
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
I'm sorry.

231
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
I'm sorry.

232
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
I'm sorry.

234
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
I'm sorry.

235
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
I'm sorry.

236
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
I'm sorry.

237
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
I'm sorry.

238
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
I'm sorry.

239
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
I'm sorry.

240
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
I'm sorry.

242
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
I'm sorry.

243
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Don't cry.

244
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
Don't cry.

245
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
I knew

246
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
that you still had me in your heart.

247
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
You're lying to me again.

248
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
I'm...

249
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Since someone is caught, I'll take him away.

250
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
Then...

251
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
I'll...

252
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
Since my order...

253
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,440
Since Fan Xian Jun has been killed,

254
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
of course, you don't have to be imprisoned.

255
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,440
You can come and free yourself from this.

256
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
How could I have a father like you?

257
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Ling'er,

258
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,440
I'm protecting you.

259
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,440
The master of the Four Rings has already been killed.

260
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
He's unconscious.

261
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Long Yuan has already taken the soldiers to the Jinyun Sect.

262
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
I'm afraid that he'll hurt you.

263
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
That's why I came here.

264
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Take him away.

265
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Yes.

266
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
Be gentle.

267
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
Be gentle.

268
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Master of the Four Rings is here.

269
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,440
Senior.

270
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
Senior.

271
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,440
Hey.

272
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
peut Workshopder!

273
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
Don't move.

274
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
Master!

275
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
Master!

276
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Mr and Mrs,

277
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,440
there is an unknown criminal here.

278
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
that's the assassin's whereabouts.

279
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,240
The Canglei Hall is also a new house.

280
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,720
How can it not be a regular house?

281
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
I don't have time to talk to you.

282
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,840
Where is my master?

283
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,840
How can we know where Master Xuanzun is?

284
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,240
You don't want to say?

285
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,440
Then I'll go down the mountain to search for him.

286
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,640
Search!

287
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,840
I've been in the Jinyun Sect for 300 years.

288
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
I've been through many things.

289
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840
It's the most famous sect in the world.

290
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
You can't just go anywhere.

291
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
You little sects

292
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,240
can only talk about me with a great power.

293
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,240
I'm the chief of the Jinyun Sect.

294
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,240
I'm the first disciple of the Ziyang Sect.

295
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Master.

296
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
You young people like me

297
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,240
are rarely known to the world.

298
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
I want you to know

299
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,240
what Heaven's order is.

300
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
What is it?

301
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,240
God's power is invincible.

302
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Master!

303
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Canglei Hall's chief disciple, listen!

304
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
Brother Longyan!

305
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
You can't do that.

306
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Master, there's still one thing missing.

307
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
You've been in the Jinyun Sect for a long time.

308
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
You're not in the right place.

309
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
No one can be as good as you.

310
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
I think that's what Master Si Ling is like.

311
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,240
He's been missing with Master for a long time.

312
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,240
I think the two of them

313
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,240
have been through a lot on the way.

314
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
That woman is so cruel.

315
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
She's so vicious.

316
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,240
She's been doing a lot of dirty things for so many years.

317
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
But...

318
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Enough!

319
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Don't look at me like that.

320
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,240
Master Si Ling is the chief disciple of the Jinyun Sect.

321
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
He must be the woman who killed her.

322
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Master Si Ling is the chief disciple of the Jinyun Sect.

323

He's the chief disciple of the Jinyun Sect.

366
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
He's the chief disciple of the Jinyun Sect.

367
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
He's the chief disciple of the Jinyun Sect.

368
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,240
He's the chief disciple of the Jinyun Sect.

369
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,240
He's the chief disciple of the Jinyun Sect.

370
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,240
They're the chief disciple of the Jinyun Sect.

371
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
They've become close friends after the fight.

372
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:08,380
They've taken up the 9th war in

373
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,680
Handle continuously this weapons,

374
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,800
With this skill,

375
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:24,280
Please try toleenline this technique.

376
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,420
Only the skill left.

377
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,420
Hm, hm, hm.

378
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,420
Little Wawa, no need.

379
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,420
Your weapon can't protect me.

380
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,420
As long as Song Tuo County is still in the yard,

381
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,420
I will be here to raise the dragon and make my living.

382
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,420
Little Wawa,

383
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,420
I can't even count the amount of energy you've got when I learned to use my sword.

384
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,420
But luckily, I got some spells,

385
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,420
yet I dare to do it.

386
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,420
I will open your eyes today.

387
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,420
Heavenly Emperor, you are invincible.

388
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,420
The beast of the mountains,

389
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,420
don't you want to live?

390
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,420
You want to live with me?

391
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,420
Ah Yun, no!

392
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,420
Ah Yun, let go.

393
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,420
Didn't you also want to kill him?

394
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,420
It's the best time now.

395
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,420
He can't even use your life to die.

396
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,420
Ah Yun.

397
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,420
Let's go.

398
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,420
Ah Yun.

399
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,420
Ah Yun, how are you?

400
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,420
Don't be so hard on me.

401
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,420
The magical power of the phoenix is so powerful.

402
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,420
It's like a ghost that has been killed by me.

403
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,420
It's like a ghost that has been killed by me.

404
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,420
Even if you are so powerful,

405
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,420
you are so strong.

406
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,420
Ah Yun.

407
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Don't be so hard on me.

408
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,420
Ah Yun.

409
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,420
I know you have a lot of things to do.

410
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:31,420
Back then, I was so weak.

411
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,420
I was so tired of living in the world.

412
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,420
Later, I was killed in the water.

413
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,420
As a spirit, I was so tired of living in the world.

414
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,420
Even though I was so tired of living in the world,

415
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,420
I was so weak that I had to suffer.

416
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,420
And now, I am so weak.

417
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:02,420
I am so weak that I have to suffer.

418
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,420
You are trying to kill someone for this place.

419
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,420
Don't you want to compensate yourself?

420
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,420
It's not for him.

421
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,420
It's for you.

422
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,420
I...

423
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,700
Wait for me.

424
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:37,420
Only you have to spare my poor heart.

425
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:42,420
The matter in my我们's heart is already left.

426
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,420
When the time comes,

427
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:50,420
we will be acceptable.

428
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,180
I didn't expect the��ika to be so special.

429
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,940
When we pressed all three in a row,

430
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,240
when Xu MiaoGuo did this,

431
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,220
will he's truly dedicate尺al没英

432
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,960
soガエル

433
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,840
常逃库那么高陸来

434
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,880
When will freedom free me from the past?

435
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,880
In the name of my beloved autokuidas

436
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:33,940
Remembered by

437
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:40,860
our young stories

438
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,460
Apologies for Data

439
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,300
Me

440
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,300
You know...

441
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,300
I hate people who don't know how to be sincere.

442
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:00,300
You and I have been together for 700 years.

443
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,300
You hurt me.

444
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,300
I killed you too.

445
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,300
But...

446
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,300
It's not true.

447
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
No one can say it.

448
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,300
I was too obsessed with it.

449
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,300
I couldn't let go of the hatred in my heart.

450
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,300
Actually, I can understand it earlier.

451
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,300
I completely broke your heart.

452
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,300
I can't...

453
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
I can't be so honest.

454
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,300
Yu.

455
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
Yu.

456
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,300
Yu.

457
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,300
What are you talking about?

458
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,300
I'll help you get back to the Palace.

459
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,300
No.

460
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,300
I can't bear to lose to you.

461
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,300
You and I are both innocent.

462
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,300
No one would have thought that

463
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,300
I would be buried in a small dormant room

464
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,300
all day long.

465
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,300
But it's really hard.

466
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
I...

467
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,300
I...

468
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,300
I was so sad.

469
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,300
I was so disappointed.

470
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,300
I didn't have any regrets.

471
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,300
Only one thing.

472
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,300
That was Qiyun Sect.

473
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:11,300
Qiyun Sect is what I grew up with.

474
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,300
Their actions are the same as my own.

475
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:24,300
Because I'm a disciple of the Palace now.

476
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,300
I will never be able to protect them.

477
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,300
If you go out,

478
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,300
you will be able to protect them.

479
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,300
Will you be able to win me?

480
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,300
If you die, I will kill them.

481
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,300
You won't.

482
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,300
Yu.

483
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,300
Listen to me.

484
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,300
No matter what happens in the past,

485
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,300
I will never be able to break your heart.

486
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,300
What are you doing?

487
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,300
You have a regret.

488
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,300
I will send the body of the Tiger God to you.

489
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,300
With the body of the Tiger God,

490
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,300
I will protect your spirit

491
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,300
to protect your final heart.

492
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,300
Yu.

493
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,300
This is the body of the Tiger God.

494
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,300
The body of the Tiger God.

495
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,300
Your spirit will not die.

496
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,300
If there is no body of the Tiger God,

497
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,300
your spirit will be useless to the people of the court.

498
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,300
I'm not afraid of dying.

499
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
If you die,

500
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,300
what will you do to me?

501
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:20,300
Ask Yu to leave you alone.

502
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,300
You will save my Proud howling,

503
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,300
you will prove that you are good enough

504
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,140
I will not do away with you

505
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:39,300
nor will I bring justice to all who do not present themselves in manner.)

506
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,300
But I will go out of my place.

507
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,300
Yu.

508
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,300
Wait for me to come back.

509
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:52,300
Love is just a cup of tea

510
00:35:53,300 --> 00:36:05,300
My world never needs to be cup of tea

511
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,300
Help!

512
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,300
Help!

513
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,300
It's you again

514
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:52,580
Extracting

515
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,140
This technique I used blood to spread throughzer

516
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,300
It makes you unable to escape

517
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,300
Because of theoll stream

518
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:22,700
who asta

519
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,880
who stopped

520
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,120
Typical

521
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,560
Is

522
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,240
Do not say

523
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,700
Why sister went to live

524
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,160
As

525
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,720
None

526
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
Mr. Bai, we meet again.

527
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
Shh.

528
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,720
Are you really from my family?

529
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
Are you really from the 40th Immortal Lord?

530
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,720
What happened?

531
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,720
When did Li Qiong Yuan come back to cook?

532
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
What happened?

533
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
Don't you know?

534
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
The people who hid the shop these days are busy with the key.

535
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
No one can care about the king.

536
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Now the Immortal Lord is in trouble.

537
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
Madam is also in trouble.

538
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Why is Bai Jiu Si in trouble?

539
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
You...

540
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
How dare you direct the name of the Immortal Lord?

541
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
Okay.

542
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Then why are you in trouble?

543
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
Why are you in a coma?

544
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,720
I heard that it seems that it is the body of the Immortal Lord.

545
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
That is the Holy Bone.

546
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
The famous Huang Bei.

547
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
It used to be a new person's practice.

548
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
This time, someone is soul-breaking.

549
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,720
It is the power of the Immortal Lord.

550
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
Don't just ask me.

551
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,720
You haven't answered my question just now.

552
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,720
You haven't answered mine either.

553
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,720
If you make a choice between the Immortal Lord and Bai Jiu Si,

554
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
who will you choose?

555
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
I choose Li Qiong Yuan because he will cook.

556
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Madam left for six days.

557
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
I feel like I've been through six years.

558
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
I really like my madam.

559
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,720
But the Immortal Lord is also very good.

560
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
Why can't they be together?

561
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
It is hard to break into the garden.

562
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
It is hard to water.

563
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Many things are like this.

564
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
I'll go.

565
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,720
Where is that evil lady?

566
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,720
She's gone.

567
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
You are smart.

568
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
You dare to leave her.

569
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Then why did you come back?

570
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,720
I found the Peach Blossom Garden.

571
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,720
Where is it?

572
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,720
It is because of her.

573
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,720
Is it her?

574
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,720
I don't know.

575
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,720
Is she guilty of being a pervert?

576
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
What are you doing?

577
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
She is guilty.

578
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,720
She is the evil lady

579
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,720
who killed people in front of everyone here.

580
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
He was involved

581
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,720
because you lost her and now you are fallen in heaven.

582
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,720
Was she guilty?

583
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,720
Shameful, defy her point!

584
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
Kill him!

585
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,720
Kill him!

586
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,720
Kill him!

587
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,720
Is he a evil?

588
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
We will know it in a moment.

589
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,720
Now, the evil is coming out of the world.

590
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,720
Today, I will catch the evil and kill him.

591
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,720
I will kill Song He County.

592
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,720
God of Heaven, the God of Thunder, is a evil.

593
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,720
Fire!

594
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,720
Look!

595
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,720
Look!

596
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,720
He killed me!

597
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,720
He is a criminal!

598
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Please, Master Xiu You Zi,

599
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,720
kill him for us!

600
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,720
Kill him!

601
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,720
Kill him!

602
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,720
Kill him!

603
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
Kill him!

604
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,720
Kill him!

605
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,720
Kill him!

606
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Don't!

607
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,720
Xiaotang, you don't understand.

608
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,720
Why are you so bad?

609
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
Xiaotang!

610
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
What?

611
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,720
Take the kid away.

612
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Xiaotang!

613
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
Kill him!

614
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,720
Kill him!

615
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
Don't run!

616
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,720
Kill him!

617
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,720
Kill him!

618
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,720
Kill him!

619
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,720
Kill him!

620
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,720
Kill him!

621
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,720
Kill him!

622
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,720
Kill him!

623
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,720
Kill him!

624
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,720
Kill him!

625
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,720
Xiaotang!

626
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,720
Xiaotang, you are a criminal!

627
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,720
Don't go!

628
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,720
Don't come over!

629
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,720
Xiaotang, I will kill you!

630
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,720
The God of Heaven, the God of Thunder, is a evil.

631
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,720
Only the weapons and disintegrating masters who could heal the human human being.

632
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,720
Nobody in the world knows that the fall has fallen.

633
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,720
Please.

634
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,720
No one know that people died because of you and your brother.

635
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,720
No one knows It can't be true!

636
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,720
Everyone has their own reason.

637
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,720
Xiaotang,

638
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,540
you must look after me!

639
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:32,620
Xiaotang!

640
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,660
Guotan.

641
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,800
Xiaotang!

642
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,200
Xiaotang!

643
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,840
Xiaotang!

644
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,920
Xiaotang!

645
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,580
Xiaotang!

646
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,560
How dare you slail to see Xiaotang?

647
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,860
Get down beat!

648
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,460
Get down beat!

649
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,700
Xiaotang, get down beat!

650
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,520
Jo Mo!

651
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,720
Save Prince Jio!

652
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,080
Save Prince Jio!

653
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,380
Save Prince Jio!

654
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,880
stitches of blood...

655
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,960
Save Prince Jio!

656
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,600
Save Prince Jio!

657
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,140
Save Prince Jio!

658
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,400
Save Prince Jio!

659
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,400
You...

660
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,400
It's been so long since I've been hiding behind you.

661
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,400
It's time to come out.

662
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,400
What are you doing? You're breaking my heart!

663
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,400
Breaking my heart is death.

664
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,400
It's a trap.

665
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,400
It means he's not Zhen Yan.

666
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,400
He's not a person who doesn't know how to do it.

667
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,400
For so many years,

668
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,400
he's still the one who's been trying to get me out of this.

669
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,400
He's still the one who's...

670
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,400
Don't touch him!

671
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,400
Don't touch him!

672
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,400
I'm sorry.

673
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,400
I'm sorry.

674
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
I'm sorry.

675
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,400
I'm sorry.

676
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,400
I'm sorry.

677
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
I'm sorry.

678
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
I'm sorry.

679
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,400
I'm sorry.

680
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,400
I'm sorry.

681
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,400
I'm sorry.

682
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,400
I'm sorry.

683
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
I'm sorry.

684
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,400
I'm sorry.

685
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,400
I'm sorry.

686
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:56,720
Close your ears and slowly slide away.

687
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,880
Oh, old fox.

688
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,880
I'm tired of being lost in the darkness

689
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,880
I'm tired of being lost in the darkness

690
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,880
I'm tired of being lost in the darkness

691
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,880
I'm tired of being lost in the darkness

692
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:23,880
I look back at yesterday's situation

693
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:31,880
Love and hate are no longer as forgotten

694
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:38,880
Memories are still in the window

695
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,880
Flowers are still in the sky

696
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,880
I look at you, wearing a smile

697
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,880
My eyes are closed and the wind is blowing

698
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:12,880
Tell me, where are you?

699
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:20,880
I want to cry, I still want to laugh

700
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:27,880
I want to be drunk in your arms

701
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:41,880
Tell you, I love you very much

702
00:48:50,880 --> 00:49:03,880
