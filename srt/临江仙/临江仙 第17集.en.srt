00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,970
Are you not happy

4
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,990
that I'm feeding you?

5
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,080
I'm too disgusted to eat.

6
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,370
There's no problem.

7
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,870
If you ask me,

8
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,310
Mrs. Bai must be feeling shy.

9
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,329
She's probably secretly happy right now.

10
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,840
Bai, trust me.

11
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,520
Just keep going like this,

12
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,720
and Mrs. Bai will surely be moved
by your thoughtfulness.

13
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,120
Bai.

14
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,760
Bai, don't be impatient.

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,620
I haven't finished speaking yet.

16
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,560
Didn't I tell you to
come to me every month

17
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,840
to ask for the antidote?

18
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,310
Why did you delay for so long?

19
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,270
If you die,

20
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,960
Mr. Meng will be angry with me.

21
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,400
I was delayed by some matters,

22
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,600
so I'm only coming for the antidote now.

23
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,680
I can give you the medicine,

24
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,810
but don't forget what you promised me.

[Savage]

26
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,710
Senior Meng has already been released.

27
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,310
You can go find him yourself.

28
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,470
Would that old-fashioned Zi Yang

29
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,960
really release Mr. Meng?

30
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,800
You might as well say

31
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,470
that the rats of Jingyun Sect dug a tunnel

32
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,360
for Mr. Meng to escape on his own.

33
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,000
You'll see for yourself when you go there.

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,860
The Sect Leader doesn't intend
to stop you anymore.

35
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,030
What nonsense are you talking about?

36
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,150
That old-fashioned Zi Yang

37
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,910
always goes on about good
and evil not coexisting.

38
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,770
How could he possibly not stop us?

39
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,150
Could it be that you're lying to trick me
into going to Jingyun Sect,

40
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,480
and then kill me?

41
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,430
You helped me ascend before.

42
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,160
I have no reason to deceive you.

43
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,560
Give me the antidote.

44
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,080
I have important matters
to attend to next.

45
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,950
I don't have the leisure

46
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,630
to come find you
once a month for the antidote.

47
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,290
I don't believe you, unless you accompany
me back to Jingyun Sect.

48
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,190
I want to see with my own eyes
that Mr. Meng is safe.

49
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,320
Only then will I give you the antidote.

50
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,850
I don't have time to accompany you.

51
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,630
If you don't give me the antidote

52
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,230
and something happens to me,

53
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,610
see how Senior Meng will treat you.

54
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,610
Stop right there.

55
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,830
Fine, I'll give you the antidote, okay?

56
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,080
Why are you following me?

57
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,120
I didn't expect that you, a mere mortal,

58
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,970
could go to such lengths
for the Divine Lord.

59
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,430
It's truly surprising.

What do you want to do?

61
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,650
And what do you want to do
after leaving Jingyun Sect?

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,530
I guess you'll go
find the Divine Lord, right?

63
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,800
You didn't listen to

what I said last time, did you?

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,530
Do you really think
the Divine Lord needs you?

66
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,640
Whether she needs me or not
is her business.

67

Whether I look for her or not
is my business.

Don't look at me like that.

I will never forget your kindness.

Mr. Kong has been taking
the imperial exam for over 30 years.

His savings have long been exhausted,

Mr. Kong's family is very poor.

He's usually struggling to make ends meet.

143
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,000
The fact that he spent money
to treat us to noodles this time

144
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,200
is enough to prove his affection for us.

145
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,680
I was worried

146
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,320
that he would feel sad and upset

147
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
because you didn't eat his noodles,

148

This is about human connections.

She hasn't been out at all.

My wife was thinking of inviting her over.

I hope it's not too presumptuous.

161

Why don't you let your wife

They say close neighbors are
better than distant relatives.

165

Plus, our two families live so close.

166
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,760
We should visit each other more often.

167
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,750
If your wife cheers up,

168
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,870

Hey, Goldie,

174
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,030
why are you here again?

175
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,670
Look, I'm about to close up shop.

You...

177
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,820
Why do you keep coming here every day?

178
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,730
Go on, get out of here. Go on, go on.

You know what?

184

You've been begging for food here
since you were little.

Why are your hands so cold?

You're just not good with words.

221

I'll be going then.

222
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,609
I brought you some flatbreads.

I didn't expect you'd be
willing to help mortals.

After all these days,

226
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:27,410
this is the first time you've
voluntarily spoken to me.

227
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,160
Why did you do this?

228
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,880
As you said,

229
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,350
I'm living like a mortal.

230
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,620
I'm doing what mortals do,

231
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,480
and I haven't used any power.

232
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,310
I'm not talking about power.

233
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,460
Then what do you want to say?

234
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,280
You still don't understand.

235
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,610
Don't understand?

236
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,110
Mrs. Bai, are you ready?

237
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,890
Ready for what?

238
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,310
Going to my humble abode
for embroidery!

239
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,350
Mr. Bai said you also enjoy needlework

240
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,440
and made plans with my husband

241
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,100
to visit my humble home today.

242
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,330
I couldn't wait, so I came over first.

243
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,180
Did I disturb you two?

244
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:58,870
Not at all.

245
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,350
I couldn't find suitable silk cloth.

246
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,230
I was delayed.

247
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,680
No need to look. I have
plenty of silk cloth at home.

248
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm overwhelmed by the choices.

249
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,030
It's perfect that you're coming.

250
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,290
You can help me choose.

251
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,590
Mr. Bai, no need to buy dinner
from the restaurant tonight.

252
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,270
My husband has prepared plenty of food.

253
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,750
Let's eat together tonight.

254
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,880
Let's eat together!

255
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,130
Sounds good.

256
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:18,790
Let's go.

257
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,920
Bai, look.

258
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,880
These are all the books I've collected.

259
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,480
And some ancient paintings.

260
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,040
This one.

261
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,000
This is "Cranes and Bamboo"

262
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,880
by master painter Yuan Danqiu.

263
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,030
When I first arrived in Songhe County,

264
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,960
I discovered this painting

265
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,030
seemed to have a special connection
with this county.

266
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,710
So I spent a lot of money

267
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,800
at a pawn shop

268
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,240
and bought it at a high price.

269
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
Look at this painting hanging here.

270
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,030
Doesn't it match this room perfectly?

271
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,080
Feel free to look around.

272
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:11,960
Here.

273
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,150
Bring it over.

274
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,750
Like this.

275
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,640
You're looking at this?

276
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,400
You think this is quite good too,
don't you?

277
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,790
I happened to read this phrase

278
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,270
in an ancient book.

279
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,240
The ancients often said,

280
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,440
every word and character has its power.

281
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,590
When I read this line of poetry,

282
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,750
I finally felt

283
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,500
that reading excellent poetry

284
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,300
can truly inspire one's spirit.

285
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,220
What do you think, Bai?

286
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,070
"Strategies from Ancient History"?

287
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,330
You like this book too?

288
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,810
I really like this one.

289
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,110
It seems we're like-minded.

290
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,480
Lin,

291
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,570
you must be thirsty after talking so much.

292
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,760
How about...

293
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,020
Let's go. This way.

294
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,110
Bai, let me tell you,

295
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,720
my family has served as officials
for generations.

296
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,550
But most of them became court historians
in the capital,

297
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,110
writing and engraving books.

298
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,680
Later, my grandfather faced
setbacks in his career,

299
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,400
so he left behind a family precept,

300
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,460
forbidding his descendants
from becoming officials.

301
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,240
So my father started a business

302
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,310
and became a merchant.

303
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,630
Later, he discovered he had
a natural talent for business.

304
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,560
He made a fortune

305
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,440
and started supporting my education.

306
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,220
It's a pity. I studied
very diligently back then.

307
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,750
I was so intelligent.

308
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,830
My father told me

309
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,590
if I could take the imperial examination,

310
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,070
I would surely come out on top.

311
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,130
I could even become a prime minister.

312
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,680
But I don't think so.

313
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,960
I think studying is just studying.

314
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
What does studying have to do
with being an official?

315
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,510
Being a good student doesn't mean

316
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,970
you'll be a good official.

317
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,880
Instead, one must have a sense of justice

318
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,080
to be a good official.

319
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,310
Bai, what do you think?

320
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,870
That makes perfect sense.

321
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,360
That's right.

322
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,790
Bai, you truly are my kindred spirit.

323
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,530
Come, Bai.

324
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,550
Try this.

325
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,750
This is the Zhaoyan tea.

326
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,880
Although this isn't that precious,

327
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,510
there are high requirements
for the water used to brew it.

328
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,000
It must be brewed with morning dew.

329
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,830
Every morning, I go to
the back of the mountain

330
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,920
and collect this dew from

331
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,580
the banyan tree's south side.

332
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,110
You'll find that this tea

333
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,640
is very clean and clear.

334
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,790
And when you smell it,

335
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,790
there's a strong grassy fragrance.

336
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,400
Bai, how do you find it?

337
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,110
Bai, how do you find it?

338
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,520
It's quite good.

339
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,640
Bai,

340
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,920
we are both scholars,

341
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,180
but we can't just focus on
studying with our minds.

342
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,400
We also need to diligently
exercise our bodies.

343
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,460
As the ancients say, study at midnight
and rise at dawn.

344
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,880
That's exactly what I do.

345
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,160
I wake up at midnight to study

346
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,030
and at dawn, I go to the back mountain.

347
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,900
This way, not only can I
collect morning dew,

348
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,230
but I can also exercise.

349
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,530
It's killing two birds with one stone.

350
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,410
That's excellent.

351
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,620
Excellent.

352
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,790
You think it's good too, don't you?

353
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,650
In that case, come with me
to the mountain tomorrow.

354
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,560
I said, come with me
to the mountain tomorrow.

355
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,450
That's really not necessary.

356
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,890
Bai, I see that you're quite thin.

357
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,440
If you come with me
to the mountain every day,

358
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,640
your body will surely become stronger.

359
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,450
People say women are like vines,

360
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,070
and men should be like rocks.

361
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,440
Women have always liked

362
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,370
men who can make them feel secure.

363
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,440
If you bulk up a bit,

364
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,680
perhaps your wife

365
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,450
won't look so stern every day.

366
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,400
This tea is quite potent.

367
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,500
-I'm drunk.
-Dear.

368
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,510
Dear, look.

369
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,130
Mrs. Bai's embroidery is really good.

370
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,560
I thought

371
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,880
my wife's skills were already quite good,

372
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,160
but I didn't expect your wife's
to be even better.

373
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,680
It seems Bai wasn't exaggerating.

374
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,010
Your wife is truly skilled in needlework.

375
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,910
Look, isn't it adorable?

376
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,920
Did you embroider this?

377
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,770
I just did it casually.

378
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,690
When did you learn to
embroider these things?

379
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,680
Mrs. Bai, I have a presumptuous request.

380
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,510
Please, go ahead.

381
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,110
My wife really likes
this little tiger hat.

382
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,510
I wonder if you could give it to her?

383
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,880
Of course.

384
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,280
But what do you need this for?

385
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,440
I...

386
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,160
I want it for my unborn child.

387
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,110
My wife is already four months pregnant.

388
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,080
We haven't told anyone yet.

389
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,720
Yes, but today we've shared the news.

390
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,050
It's also to share some joy with everyone.

391
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,820
What did you do?

392
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,650
Your clothes are all wrinkled.

393
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,090
By the time the child is born,

394
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,010
I suppose this peach tree
will be bearing fruit.

395
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,460
Mrs. Bai, do you like eating peaches?

396
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,000
Yes, I do.

397
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,160
It's a pity we can't eat them now.

398
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,890
We have to wait until it blossoms
and bears fruit.

399
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,890
But that's okay.

400
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,350
Once it blossoms and bears fruit,

401
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,810
I'll send some over to you.

402
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,970
You want to eat peaches?

403
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,680
Lin.

404
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,280
This peach tree in your yard

405
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,070
must be over 100 years old, right?

406
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,160
I'm not sure.

407
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,960
We've only been living here
for less than a year.

408
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,000
But the previous owner said

409
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,030
their family had lived here
for three generations.

410
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,830
This peach tree was already
here back then.

411
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,590
So maybe it is quite old.

412
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,010
Being an old tree, it should
have a spirit.

413
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,640
It knows when to bloom

414
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,370
and when to bear fruit.

415
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,510
Bai, listen to yourself.

416
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,550
Don't peach trees always bloom in March

417
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,810
and bear fruit in June?

418
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,510
Not necessarily.

419
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,480
Since someone wants to eat peaches,

420
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,210
it should bloom and bear fruit.

421
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,510
If it can't satisfy one's craving,

422
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,170
what's the point of keeping
this old peach tree?

423
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,090
What are you doing?

424
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,430
I'm sorry.

425
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,400
I'll go get you a new set of clothes.

426
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,200
Wait a moment.

427
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,600
It's windy outside now.

428
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,970
You should put on your outer robe.

429
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,080
Don't catch a cold, okay?

430
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,340
Don't move.

431
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:51,290
♪ I see you standing
in the dark of night ♪

432
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:58,840
♪ Reaching out to me with arms so warm ♪

433

♪ I want to get drunk in your embrace ♪

437
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,190
I've often seen Mrs. Lin
bite off the thread

438
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,730
for her husband like this.

439
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,990
So I just...

440
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:39,600
♪ And tell you I love you ♪

441
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,140
I'll go open the door.

442
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,110
Mrs. Bai.

443
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,720
Yes.

444
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,640
What are you...

445
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,050
Mrs. Bai, isn't it amazing?

446
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,960
We just mentioned yesterday
that we wanted to eat peaches,

447
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,810
and today, they've grown on our tree.

448
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,140
Look, they're this big.

449
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,350
This is what we call an auspicious sign!

450
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,150
Here, take it.

451
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,960
We should report this to the authorities.

452
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,160
Who knows, there might even be a reward!

453
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,680
In my opinion,

454
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,030
some immortal

455
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,840
has blessed Mr. Lin's home.

456
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,840
I don't think it's an immortal.

457
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,550
Look.

458
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,160
Scholar Kong, Mr. Lin, and Mr. Bai

459
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,510
are all educated.

460
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,030
This is a sign that our area

461
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,760
is about to produce a literary god.

462
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,110
-It's a good sign.
-Yes.

463
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,760
Scholar Kong,

464
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,110
I think the one most likely
to become the literary god

465
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,030
is you.

466
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,720
In this imperial exam, you'll
surely receive high merits

467
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,800
and reach success.

468
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,920
-You're right.
-No, no.

469
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,250
These are all peaches from Mr. Lin's home.

470
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,080
It has nothing to do with me.

471
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,160
Mr. Kong,

472
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,750
I'm only responsible
for teaching and educating.

473
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,720
I'm not taking the imperial examination.

474
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,550
When you pass the exam with high honors,

475
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,950
I'll definitely host
a celebratory feast for you.

476
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,070
-Count me in.
-Me too.

477
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,270
-Count me in.
-Me too.

478
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,880
Mr. Lin.

479
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,270
Mr. Lin, thank you for the peaches.

480
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:54,790
Thank you.

481
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,720
-Bye.
-We're leaving.

482
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,250
Goodbye.

483
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,290
It was you again, right?

484
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,270
So much fruit.

485
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,270
Recklessly using power
may lead to backlash.

486
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,470
I didn't do anything.

487
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,240
It must be that old peach tree
that's almost become a spirit

488
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,770
that wanted to bloom
and bear fruit on its own.

489
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,290
Bai Jiusi, watch out.
You're going to lose.

490
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,480
Of course I won't.

491
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,410
Even trees understand feelings
better than humans.

492
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,640
Bai Jiusi,

493
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,010
have you forgotten that you're not human?

494
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,950
Why does it sound like
you're insulting me?

495
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,160
Mrs. and Mr. Bai,

496
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,790

00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,670
Mr. Kong wrote you a letter too?

516
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,630
Bai,

517
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,570
Mr. Kong started his education at six.

518
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,920
He vowed from childhood
to serve the country.

519
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,360
Unfortunately, he kept failing the exam.

520
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,030
He kept trying until he was 53

521
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,110
and finally passed the exam.

522
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,560
But he died of illness
on his way to take office.

523
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,550
Why was heaven so unfair to him?

524
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,350
Life and death are just a cycle of karma.

525
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,390
It's not about fairness or unfairness.

How can you be so cold-hearted?

Mr. Kong considered you as a friend.

528
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,810
He even treated you to birthday noodles.

529
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,480
If only I had...

530
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,360
If only I hadn't sponsored
him for the exam.

531
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,800
Then he wouldn't have
fallen ill from exhaustion

532
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,250
and died away from home.

533

Life and death are all predestined.

534

Even if he hadn't gone to
the capital for the exam,

535
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,680
he might still have died from illness.

536
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,790
That's different.

537
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,190
If Mr. Kong were right in front of me,

538
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,120
I would've definitely tried
every means to save him.

539
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,110

watched him die.

Then let me ask you.

542
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,760
If you knew his life was destined
to end this year,

543
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,490
would you still try to save him?

544
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,230
I would.

545
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,590
But he was fated to die on that day.

546
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,680
Then it's heaven's will for him to die,

547
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,720
not because I let him die.

548

saw him dying and didn't help.

will he feel lonely and sad
because of this?

630

When he asks me about this,

631
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,150
what should I say?

632
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,480
Say the truth.

633
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,030

Yes,

00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,710
there are many things in this world
that can't be changed.

638
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,510
Then why

639
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,400
do some people still try despite the odds?

640
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,760
Because they don't accept fate.

641
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,660
Can that give them the ability
to change their fate?

642
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,640
Mortals have very little power.

643
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,970
If you can't change it,
accept it gracefully.

644
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,320
Otherwise, you'll only struggle

645

in endless pain.

646

No pain, no gain.

If you don't even dare to struggle,

649

whether there's paradise or peril ahead?

651
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,030
You'll understand when you have children.

652
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,160
As a father, I'm willing
to give everything for my child,

653
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,670
even my life.

654
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,510
By the way, I don't have relatives,

655
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,590
but I have you as a friend.

656

When my child is born,

657
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,430
you'll be his godfather.

658

While he's still young,

659
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,480
I'll make more friends

660

to give him more godfathers.

661

This way, he won't be lonely.

00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,760
you've finally said something
pleasing to hear.

668
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:00,340
Bai, let me tell you something sincere.

669
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:02,760
I'm friends with you

670
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,060
because I think you're
different from others.

671
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,810
Actually, I have very high standards.

672
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,680
Not just anyone can be my friend.

673
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,970
Since I moved here, I've only
made three friends in total.

674
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:16,810
One is you,

675
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,360
one is Mrs. Liu who sells insoles,

676
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,090
and one is Old Wang
who transports human waste.

677
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,360
But

678
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,230
among all these friends,

679
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,960
you're the one I value the most.

680
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,960
They all say you're a scholar

681
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,190
and call you Mr. Bai,

682
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,970
but I don't think so.

683
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,510
I think you're a

684
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,280
spoiled rich kid
who can't tell rice from wheat,

685
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,670
who has a nasty temper
and a blunt way of speaking

686
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:44,590
with no filter whatsoever.

687
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,050
You're not likable at all.

688
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:52,760
But that's okay.

689
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,120
It's enough that I like you.

690
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,800
In the future,

691
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,670
don't always be so solitary.

692
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,660
If you encounter any difficulties,
feel free to come to me.

693
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,240
What good would it do to go to you?

694
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,610
I'll drink with you!

Come quickly and help put out the fire!

Wake up! There's a fire!
