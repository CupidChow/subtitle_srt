[Episode 27]

3
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,170
You let me fool you for centuries.

4
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,200
You really are a pair of idiots.

5
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,240
Xiao Jingshan.

6
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
There's no bad blood between us.

7
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,400
Why did you use me like this?

8
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,070
Blame Heavenly Lord Dacheng,
who lives as long as the sun and moon.

9
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,980
Who could ever beat him?

10
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,400
Only you, Divine Lord Siling,

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,680
who share his origin, can kill him.

12
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,590
Unlike you, he isn't soft,

13
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,940
and your softness makes you weak.

14
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,530
You've used my disciple again and again.

15
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,970
It's truly despicable.

16
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,240
Use?

17
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,870
He just showed up at the perfect time.

18
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,610
I'd spent 500 years
secretly learning dark magic.

19
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,600
I didn't need my old magic anymore,

20
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,870
so I gave it to him.

21
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,100
Honestly,

22
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,720
making him my vessel
isn't that unforgivable.

23
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,150
He should be thanking me.

24
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,870
He had been a useless nobody,

25
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,600
and I made him a top cultivator.

26
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,470
Whether it was immortal arts
or dark magic,

27
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,830
you mastered them on your own.

28
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,090
There must be a reason.

29
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
When the Primordial God created the world,

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,370
a wisp of foul air escaped his chest
and drifted into the world.

31
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,940
By some unknown twist of fate,
it ended up possessing you.

32
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,740
But don't let it cloud your mind.

33
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,760
That twist of fate happened
to ensure my success.

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,240
It proves my path is the right one.

35
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,650
Twisting words to justify yourself!

36
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,700
You're responsible
for my master's death too, aren't you?

37
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,150
Her?

38
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,310
What if I insist on
seeing Heavenly Lord Dacheng today?

39
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,460
Then I won't hold back.

40
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,329
Wait.

41
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,520
I-I was just joking.

42
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,500
It's been a long time
since I saw my disciple.

43
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,010
She's missed me too.

44
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,190
I-I'll go now.

45
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,570
Who are you?

46
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,920
She didn't have to die.

47
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,570
But you were starting
to hesitate about killing Bai Jiusi.

48
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,900
So I had to
give you two a little more hatred

49
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,070
to work with.

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,600
You pitted us against each other

51
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,930
just to benefit yourself and destroy

52
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,880
the Infinite Stele, didn't you?

53
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,830
What do you have against it?

54
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,400
Too many questions.

55
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,350
I wanted to do it, so I did.

56
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,080
Indeed, no reason is needed.

57
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,530
Your crimes are unforgivable.
You deserve to die.

58
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,900
What are you doing?

59
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
See for yourself.

60
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,580
This is...

61
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,510
The Life-Link Curse.

62
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,310
The life of the one who casts it

63
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,300
is tied to the one who's cursed.

64
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
Heavenly Lord Dacheng,
you're truly knowledgeable.

65
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,730
Divine Lord Siling,

66
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,040
this guy climbed
the Sky-Reaching Ladder for you

67
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,070
and endured the pain
of having his tendons and bones crushed.

68
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,600
Will you really take my life

69
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,200
at the cost of his?

70
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,980
You won't.

71
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,890
That's your weakness.

72
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,940
First Meng Changqin, now Zhang Suan—

73
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,909
they both became your soft spots.

74
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,230
Once I'm gone,
the curse will lift on its own.

75
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,850
As for the Infinite Stele,

76
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,560
I'll leave it alone for now.

77
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,960
It's just a Life-Link Curse.

78
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,750
Since I know what it is, I can break it.

79
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,760
Bai Jiusi,

80
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,760
this curse can only be lifted
by the one who cast it.

81
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,490
No matter how powerful you are,
you can't undo it.

82
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,740
Begone, evil. Yield!

83
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,960
Now's the time.

84
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,020
Kill him.

85
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,300
Is the curse broken?

86
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,600
Yes.

87
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,040
He's lying to you.

88
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
The Life-Link Curse can't be lifted

89
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,670
unless he's transferred it to himself.

90
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,159
If you kill me,

91
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,659
he'll die too.

92
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,880
Ruyue, haven't you
always wanted to kill me?

93
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,650
Well,

94
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,460
here's your perfect excuse.

95
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,680
Xiao Jingshan is a threat
as long as he lives.

96
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,140
Do it for the greater good.

97
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,470
Ruyue, do it.

98
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,480
I'll leave
the Infinite Stele in your care.

99
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,760
You'll surely do better than I did.

100
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,950
Siling,

101
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,240
do you know why Bai Jiusi

102
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,040
sealed your power for ten years?

103
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't try any tricks.

104
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,940
He did it
to take punishment in your place.

105
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,240
What do you mean?

106
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,330
He's stalling. Do it now!

107
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,070
Looks like I have to

108
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,750
explain what happened myself.

109
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,640
You came to the mortal realm
with Siling to gain experience.

110
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,770
Do you know what she's trying to do now?

111
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,390
She's trying to kill a divine being.

112
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,150
Things form, exist, decay, and vanish.

113
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,490
Karma flows in cycles,
and life never ceases.

114
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,930
That's the law of heaven.

115
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,770
But now she plans to kill
the Drought Dragon.

116
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,950
That's not just deicide.

117
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,220
It disrupts the natural cycle

118
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,890
and interferes with the way of heaven.

119
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,690
You descended with her.

120
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,950
You can't just stand by and do nothing.

121
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,289
What do you want me to do?

122
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,770
Stop her and bring her back
to Empyrean for severe punishment.

123
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,760
You refuse?

124
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,580
I don't agree with what she's doing,

125
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,140
but I'll never hurt her.

126
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
In that case,

127
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,270
I'll do it myself.

128
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,640
Hua Ruyue, how dare you
try to kill a divine being?

129
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,520
It brought ruin
to the mortal realm, so it has to die!

130
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,490
It's a divine being.
Even if it has sinned,

131
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,050
the way of heaven will punish it—

132
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,620
not you!

133
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,650
What did the way of heaven do
when droughts happened?

134
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,820
What did the way of heaven do
when people starved to death?

135
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,790
If the way of heaven
is as merciless as you make it sound,

136
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,140
then it's not worth obeying!

137
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,370
Both mortals

138
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,170
and divine beings

139
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,850
must obey the way of heaven!

140
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,960
Master!

141
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,310
Meng Changqin, what are you waiting for?

142
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,140
Do you have a death wish?

143
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,740
No one is allowed to hurt her.

144
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,580
Not the way of heaven.

145
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
And definitely not you!

146
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,170
If you want to leave,

147
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,670
you'll have to step over my dead body.

148
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,680
The Drought Dragon is dead.

149
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,300
You're too late.

150
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,540
She'll pay the price, and so will you.

151
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,860
Once everything's settled,

152
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,420
I'll go to Empyrean
to accept my punishment.

153
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,570
Alright.

154
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,170
Then I'll be waiting for you
at the Heavenly Punishment Platform.

155
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,040
Just you? Where's Siling?

156
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,220
I've sealed her spiritual energy.

157
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,620
She'll remain at Qichi Hall
in the mortal realm,

158
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,090
living as an ordinary person
for ten years.

159
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,260
The mortal realm is full of suffering.

160
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,090
Those ten years

161
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,610
will be punishment enough.

162
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,130
I'll take the rest
of the punishment alone.

163
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,250
The punishment for deicide is severe.

164
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,140
I don't mind.

165
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,240
You just need someone

166
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
to punish, don't you?

167
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,050
Let it be me.

168
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,370
In the first year of Emperor Qi's reign,
Bai Jiusi descended to the mortal realm

169
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,280
and killed the Drought Dragon,
committing deicide

170
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,170
and disrupting the way of heaven.

171
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,600
He was punished
at the Heavenly Punishment Platform—

172
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,080
struck by 99 bolts
of lightning a day for ten full years.

173
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,880
Time flows the same there
as it does in the mortal realm.

174
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,910
You suffered in the mortal realm
for ten years.

175
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,550
He was punished
in the divine realm for ten years.

176
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,450
He had no way of knowing your hardships.

177
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,370
Do it.

178
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,020
Later, I tried
to destroy the Infinite Stele,

179
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,700
violated heavenly law,

180
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,440
and was imprisoned
at the Heavenly Punishment Platform.

181
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,270
That's where I met him,
during his punishment.

182
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,050
We were neighbors for ten years,

183
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,440
and I witnessed the torment he endured.

184
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,280
The lightning punishment was brutal.

185
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,940
He endured it for ten years
without a single cry.

186
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,850
Truly a remarkable man.

187
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,380
That's when I discovered
his only weakness—

188
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,540
you, Siling.

189
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,490
So I spent centuries setting up the trap

190
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,190
to push you into killing him.

191
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,370
He's trying to shake your resolve.

192
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,360
Do it now!

193
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,790
Can you really do it?

194
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,120
Ruyue.

195
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,490
Fine, then I'll kill him myself!

196
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,020
We'll meet again.

197
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,470
Ruyue.

198
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,880
I'm sorry.

199
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,530
Once again, I've let you down.

200
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,990
Don't speak. Steady your breath.

201
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,880
You know what?

202
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,750
I was acting in Canglei Palace

203
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,130
earlier today,

204
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,190
but I meant everything I said.

205
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:24,020

can I dream about my beloved one ♪

206

210
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,180

♪ I'm missing you on

212

♪ Melancholy takes up half of my life ♪

214
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,640
Master's been seriously injured
for two weeks,

215
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,630
but he's never
gone into seclusion to recover.

216
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,630
Moreover,
his Life-Protecting Pearl is missing,

217
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,480
and just a few days ago,

218
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,480
his primordial spirit
was somehow severely damaged.

219
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,210
This time, with the backlash
from the formation,

220
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,920
I'm afraid he might not make it.

221
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,610
Why didn't you warn him?

222
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,210
I've warned him countless times,

223
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,990
but Master always had his own plans.

224
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,300
He never had time to rest and recover.

225
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,580
Are you saying

226
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
he might die?

227
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,850
I don't know.

228
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,780
His condition

229
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,830
has reached a point

230
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,720
where even I can't heal him.

231
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,240
His primordial spirit can't be repaired.

232
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,310
Worst of all,

233
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,030
he's lost the will to live.

234
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,910
There's nothing I can do.

235
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,280
Let's not dwell on the past for now.

236
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,000
Divine Lord, you and His Lordship
put on an act together.

237
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,130
Then Xiao Jingshan's escape
must pose a serious threat.

238
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,300
We'll stay at Canglei Palace
to take care of His Lordship.

239
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,720
Divine Lord, if you need help
tracking Xiao Jingshan down,

240
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
just say the word.

241
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,570
Why should we help?

242
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,710
I guess
it's what His Lordship would want.

243
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,940
Bai Jiusi,

244
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,740
don't think you can run away
by falling asleep.

245
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,520
You took punishment for me. So what?

246
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,460
The pain I suffered

247
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,410
was real.

248
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,180
Too much has happened between us.

249
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,300
Too tangled to undo.

250
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,640
Too deep to forget.

251
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,020
Bai Jiusi,

252
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,080
I won't apologize to you.

253
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,250
If you never wake up, fine.

254
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,040
Then we'll never see each other again.

255
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,270
Maybe that's how we both find peace.

256
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,220
So you're protesting by trying to die?

257
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,640
All I did was destroy
your spiritual energy.

258
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,000
You've already formed immortal bones.

259
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,800
You'll still live for eternity.

260
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,370
Stop overthinking it.

261
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,750
You really are heartless.

262
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,830
Ling'er,

263
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,160
you can still do whatever you want.

264
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,480
As long as I'm here,

265
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,680
no one will ever hurt you.

266
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,010
The one who's hurt her the most is you.

267
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,590
Divine Lord.

268
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,930
This is all my fault.

269
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,300
I shouldn't have sent you back
just to save you.

270
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,600
It's fine now. I'll take you back.

271
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,260
Wait.

272
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,210
Divine Lord Siling,

273
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,120
even if you and His Lordship
have made up,

274
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,300
she's still my daughter,

275
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,210
so you don't just get to take her away.

276
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,200
Sometimes I really want
to beat you to death.

277
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,890
You think I'm scared of you?

278
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,840
Siling, think about it.

279
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,310
Everything Ling'er's been through
started because of you.

280
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,590
You manipulated her

281
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,720
into staying away from her own father.

282
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
You made her an enemy of His Lordship

283
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,720
and dragged her
into one dangerous thing after another.

284
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,290
That's why I had no choice
but to destroy her spiritual energy.

285
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,750
Now she's no longer

286
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,070
useful to you.

287
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,350
What more do you want?

288
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,580
You really don't get it, do you?

289
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,390
Ling'er doesn't like you

290
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,820
not because she was manipulated.

291
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,550
It's because of you.

292
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,130
Yes, I've asked her to do a lot of things.

293
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,240
But I've always explained why.

294
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,520
I told her what the risks were.

295
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,260
And most importantly,

296
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,170
I gave her the right to choose.

297
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,540
I'm not like you—

298
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,890
doing things that hurt her

299
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,540
while claiming it's for her own good.

300
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,460
Ask yourself honestly:

301
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,400
when have you ever truly given her

302
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,260
the chance to decide for herself?

303
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,790
Let's go.

304
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,350
Wait.

305
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,350
Do you really have to
push Ling'er this hard?

306
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,070
Come to her again when you've learned

307
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,120
to respect your own daughter.

308
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,570
Grandmaster is back.

309
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,550
Suguan.

310
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,280
How do you like the Nine Heavens?

311
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,400
It's boring as hell here.

312
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,400
Yeah, pretty boring.

313
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,420
It's time for us to go back.

314
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,280
My poor Bian,

315
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,350
your death was so unjust.

316
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,870
This is for Ox-Head.

317
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,310
Horse-Face needs some too.

318
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,240
Burn more.

319
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,850
You…

320
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,260
Master, stop burning joss paper.

321
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:54,790
Master,

322
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,920
I heard a cultivator once say

323
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,140
those killed by immortals

324
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,550
don't even get a chance
to enter the underworld.

325
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,630
W-What the hell are you saying?

326
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,150
My Bian died a wrongful death!

327
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,030
This money is for bribing the ghosts.

328
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,000
If those ghosts

329
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,680
bully him in the underworld,

330
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,140
I'll kill you first!

331
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,520
Just let him burn it.

332
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,190
He's quite pitiful.

333
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,680
Yes. After he burns some joss paper,

334
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,310
he might feel a bit better.

335
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,420
Everyone says cultivation is good.

336
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,070
Master.

337
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,570
Jingyun Sect is a top-tier immortal sect.

338
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,000
Who would've thought that
after all that cultivation,

339
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,240
his son didn't even leave a body behind?

340
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,480
-Keep burning.
-Stop it.

341
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
He just lost his son. Let's go.

342
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,900
Burn more.

343
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,270
What's that sound?

344
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,310
Master, Master, listen.

345
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,600
What's that sound?

346
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,640
That's…

347
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,590
Young Master is back.

348
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,290
I told you burning joss paper would work.

349
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,750
They've all come back.

350
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,680
You see that?

[Prosperity]

352
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,170
Grandmaster, did you go to
the Nine Heavens this time

353
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,910
just to lure out Xiao Jingshan?

354
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,150
Yes. Unfortunately,
I miscalculated something.

355
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,610
I realized Zhang Suan was being used

356
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,820
but didn't expect
he'd been cursed with the Life-Link Curse.

357
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,090
Xuan Wei, did you know about
Grandmaster's plan from the start?

358
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,570
I didn't.

359
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,830
I only sensed something off
about Qing Yang's death.

360
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,350
And then Grandmaster sent

361
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,880
the weakest disciple,
Jiang Bian, to issue the challenge.

362
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,190
That's when I knew
Master had another plan.

363
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,590
Zhang Suan

364
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,110
locked himself in the meditation room

365
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,660
after he woke up
and realized what he had done.

366
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,750
He hasn't had a drop of water since.

367
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,680
I tried talking to him,
but it didn't work.

368
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,790
Grandmaster, if you have time,
please go check on him.

369
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,920
I will.

370
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,880
Right now, our top priority
is finding Xiao Jingshan.

371
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,440
To turn Bai Jiusi

372
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,900
and me against each other,

373
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,550
he waited for hundreds of years.

374
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,760
It shows how calculating he is.

375
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,370
Split the disciples into teams
and search for him

376
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,120
with everything we've got.

377
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,580
This time,
he won't stay hidden in the shadows.

[Prosperity]

379
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,640
Even if we have to search
all 12 provinces of Han,

380
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,750
we must find him.

381
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,030
Yes, Grandmaster.

382
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,040
Birth, aging, sickness, and death

383
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,260
are trials every mortal must endure.

384
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,230
Formation, existence,
destruction, and emptiness

385
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,430
are the four stages of the cosmic cycle.

386
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,170
I have a feeling.

387
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,300
The world is about
to face destruction again.

388
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,550
And it might be caused by him.

389
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,840
We'll go make the arrangements right away.

You have something else to say to me?

392
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,010
I just want to ask,

393
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,110
what will you do about
Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

394
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,380
Someone will take care of Canglei Palace.

395
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,840
Xiao Jingshan
shouldn't be able to harm him.

396
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,960
That's not what I'm asking.

397
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,050
I want to know
if you still want to kill him.

398
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,270
I don't know.

399
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,780
He took the punishment for me.

400
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,670
But everything I suffered
was because of him.

401
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,960
I don't know which weighs more.

402
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,290
I don't know what I should let go of
or what I should hold on to.

403

The best ending I can think of

404
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,600
is never seeing him again.

405
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,990
Master, don't overthink it.
Just follow your heart.

406

No matter what you choose,

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,790
I'll always follow you.

Yeah.

409

Why overthink it and upset myself?

I'll go check on Zhang Suan.

411

You're becoming
more and more ill-mannered.

412
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:37,070
You knew I was coming
and didn't even get up to greet me.

413
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,410
Eat something.

414

What? You want me to feed you?

No.

Sorry.

It's not your fault.

You should've killed him then and there.

My life doesn't matter.

What happened to her?

433
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,850
Her father stripped her
of her spiritual energy.

434
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,310
You once lost
all your spiritual energy too.

00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,960
So maybe if you talk to her, it'll help.

Okay.

Stay here and eat. I'll go check it out.

I advise you not to meet him now.

What's that supposed to mean?

why can't I see him?

Are you hiding something from me?

If you insist on seeing him, then come.

What's wrong with Master?

455

Why do you both look so grim?

00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,310
See for yourself.

457
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,360
Master.

458

Who are you?

459
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,800
Have you seen my wife?

460
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Your wife?

461
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,990
Look.

462
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,020
I've prepared so many gifts for her,

463
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,300
but I can't find her anywhere.

464
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,970
Have you seen her?

465
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,510
Did that witch Siling

466
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,190
do something to Master again?

467
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,920
It really wasn't her this time.

468
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,960
I told you—

469
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,550
Master's primordial spirit
has been damaged over and over.

470
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,680
His divine soul was barely hanging on.

471
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,590
It's already a miracle that he woke up.

472
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,250
This is probably what happens
when the primordial spirit

473
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,580
takes that much damage.

474
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,120
Now his mind is like that of a child.

475
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,040
He doesn't remember anyone,

476
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,550
except for…

00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,380
his wife.

No way!

479
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,440
Our master is Heavenly Lord Dacheng,

480
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,810
who lives as long as the sun and moon.

481
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:43,840
How could this happen?

482
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,360
The injuries Master suffered

483
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,700
are enough to kill both of us

484
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,340
several times.

485
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,760
No. Figure something out.

486
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,050
Master has always been dignified.

487
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,470
He can't be seen like this!

488
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,850
Why don't you treat him?

489
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,200
All we can do is let him rest.

490
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,280
After his divine soul recovers,

491
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,740
he'll go back to how he was.

492
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:07,960
Sir,

493
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,700
if you see my wife,

494
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,230
can you take me to her?

495
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,980
Master, please don't call me that.

496
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,670
No, no, no, no,

497
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,820
I really need to find my wife.

498
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,640
Grandpa,

499
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,900
can you take me to her?

500
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,480
Please.

501
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,670
Maybe we should just take him to her?

502
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,970
No way!

503
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,670
Siling's tried
to kill Master more than once.

504
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,110
If we send him to her now,

505
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,450
we'd be handing a lamb to a wolf.

506
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,660
Divine Lord Siling
surely knows what's important.

507
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,510
His Lordship's safety
concerns the Infinite Stele.

508
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,180
She wouldn't hurt him.

509
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,160
Still no!

510
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,550
You say no to this, no to that!

511
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,550
Get up, all of you!

512
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,320
Get up!

513
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,850
I'm telling you,

514
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,020
I need to find my wife!

515
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,860
My master would in no way act like this.

516
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,090
Hurry, take him to see Siling.

517
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,970
Darling.

518
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,310
I prepared this hairpin for you myself.

519
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,430
Do you like it?

520
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,520
We had no choice

521
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,200
but to bring him here.

522
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,440
Please, Divine Lord,
let him stay here for a few days.

523
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,480
Why should I?

524
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,610
He's your master.
Take care of him yourselves.

525
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,160
Don't follow me.

526
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,230
No.

527
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,600
Darling, wherever you go, I go.

528
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,110
Bai Jiusi, quit acting.

529
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,880
Are you pretending

530
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,540
you've forgotten everything

531
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,670
because I said too much

532
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,070
has happened between us?

533
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,030
His Lordship truly is badly injured.

534
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,360
Otherwise, given his personality,

535
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,100
he'd never act this way.

536
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,960
This is a turbulent time.

537
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,070
Even if we take him back today,

538
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,170
he'll still demand to see you.

539
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,210
And no one
at Canglei Palace dares stop him.

540
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:17,150
If word gets out and someone
takes advantage of the situation,

541
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,480
His Lordship may be harmed,

542
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,010
and it could be disastrous.

543
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,910
Please, Divine Lord, for the greater good,

544
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,650
let him stay here for a few days.

545
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,160
Once he recovers,
we definitely won't trouble you again.

546
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,550
Yes.

547
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,560
You don't need
to arrange attendants for him.

548
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,960
Just let him stay.

549
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,630
We'll keep him safe ourselves.

550
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,750
Darling.

551
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,610
Darling, don't you like this hairpin?

552
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,940
Just take a look.

553
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,670
[Temple of the Primordial God]

554
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,410
I spent a long time choosing it.

555
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:02,710
Look.

556
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,910
It's useless.

557
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,090
No matter how hard you try,

558
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,620
lost cultivation won't come back.

559
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,050
Are you here to laugh at me?

560
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,630
I've got better things to do.

561
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,990
Qingyue asked me to check on you.

562
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,640
Master meant well.

563
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
But you might not.

564
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,050
I once lost my cultivation too.

565
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,740
I might've had it even worse than you.

566
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,810
My foundation was destroyed.

567
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,760
I became completely ordinary.

568
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,430
At that time, did you…

569
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,290
ever think about dying?

570
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,550
Yeah.

571
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,150
Falling from a high place

572
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,090
is not a pleasant feeling.

573
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,750
Of course I thought that

574
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:20,910
if I just died,

575
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,590
it'd all be over.

576
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,920
But one day,

577
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,520
I suddenly didn't want to die anymore.

578
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,280
Why not?

579
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,860
Because someone showed up.

580
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,900
I wanted to live for her.

581
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,950
Do you

582
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,980
still like her now?

583
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,590
That's never changed.

584
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,170
If life gets too hard,

585
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,390
give yourself a reason to keep going.

586
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,000
You'll find one.

587
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,710
If I remember right,
the spiritual energy you have now

588
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,320
was passed to you
by Xiao Jingshan, wasn't it?
