1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,020
Huh?

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:17,580
Today, I like my anime more than any other anime's old versions.

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

17
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

19
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

21
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

22
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

23
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

24
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

26
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

28
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

29
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

30
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

31
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

32
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

33
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

34
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

35
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

36
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

37
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

38
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

39
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

40
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

41
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

42
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

43
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

44
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,580
I'm going to the airport to see my mom.

45
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:51,580
Why can't I save Meng Changqin?

46
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,580
You can.

47
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,580
It's different.

48
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,580
What's different?

49
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,580
Meng Changqin will bring you danger.

50
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,580
When Meng Chi came,

51
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,580
I had the same feeling.

52
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,580
From the first time you saved him,

53
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,580
to the moment he returned to the mansion and became the housekeeper,

54
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,580
you didn't know how many rumors there were.

55
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,580
Hua Ruoyuan,

56
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,580
there are so many rumors in the world.

57
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,580
If you are willing to take the risk,

58
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,580
you will definitely win the world.

59
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,580
Do you know why the gods come to the mortal world?

60
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,580
Because there are too many difficulties in the world.

61
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,580
The seven emotions are all over the world.

62
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,580
The old and the old are all dead.

63
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,580
Love is different.

64
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,580
Hope is more.

65
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,580
Hope is not good.

66
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,580
It's always hard work.

67
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,580
There are some things that are destined to be incomplete.

68
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,580
But the gods use the gods.

69
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,580
They can control the lives of the mortal.

70
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,580
If the gods really have feelings for people,

71
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,580
how can they bear to use the gods

72
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,580
to interfere with the heaven?

73
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,580
Even if the heaven is not needed,

74
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,580
the people are in danger.

75
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,580
The gods can be alone.

76
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,580
Hua Ruoyuan,

77
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,580
you are on the way to the heaven now.

78
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,580
I promise you.

79
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,580
Only this time,

80
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,580
after saving Meng Changqin,

81
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,580
I won't be in the mortal world anymore.

82
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,580
What about you?

83
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,580
Why me?

84
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,580
Are you still going to marry me?

85
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,580
Find the next person

86
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,580
who is willing to marry you.

87
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,580
What am I thinking?

88
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,580
Don't you know?

89
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,580
I have always been heartless to you.

90
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,580
I just want you to be with me

91
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,580
and be honest and sincere.

92
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,580
That's all.

93
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,580
Okay.

94
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,580
I promise you.

95
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,580
From now on,

96
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,580
I will be with you every day.

97
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,580
I won't leave even if you are tired.

98
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,580
Let's just be quiet and spend our time together.

99
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,580
Okay?

100
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,580
Let's go.

101
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,580
Boss,

102
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,580
ask Tang Xiaoli.

103
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,580
Okay.

104
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,580
You want to eat?

105
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,580
You were so hot in the bathroom.

106
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,580
You didn't even eat a bite.

107
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,580
Let's go to a restaurant first.

108
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,580
Wait for the meal when you get back.

109
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,580
Okay.

110
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,580
Thank you.

111
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,580
Let's go home together.

112
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,580
Together.

113
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,580
We have been in the mortal world for so many years.

114
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,580
How come we don't have any memories of the past?

115
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,580
Do you not like me?

116
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,580
You hate me?

117
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,580
Have you ever been in love with Bai Jiuci?

118
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,580
Clear the answer.

119
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,580
Tell me.

120
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,580
I'm sorry.

121
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,580
I'm sorry.

122
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,580
You're awake.

123
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,580
Come help me.

124
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,580
Manager.

125
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,580
You are supposed to live for a lifetime.

126
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,580
You are dangerous when you wear resultado.

127
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,580
I dropping in every time

128
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,580
is the ship could cross the past.

129
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,580
Someone is moving you to otherありがとう place.

130
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,220
at the莖この日 Park entrance on a三月日,

131
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,420
tonight we won't even be able to see each other again.

132
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,700
All right,

133
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,540
seems that I can only send my bamboo to

134
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,800
our acorns' grass.

135
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:50,760
The

136
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,580
Run away!

137
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,460
Come on.

138
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,940
Be careful.

139
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,620
Why is the Hirataro girl

140
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,740
all white stallion?

141
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,820
I remembered in the flowers incident,

142
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,100
we all remember their color

143
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,100
when we saw that Michelle's lantern.

144
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,580
This is called the Soul-seeing Light.

145
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,580
Soul?

146
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,580
Some people are killed and buried in the dark.

147
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,580
They don't dare to leave.

148
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,580
So their families put a Soul-seeing Light on them.

149
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,580
This leads them to find their way home.

150
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,580
This way, they can leave without worry.

151
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,580
So...

152
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,580
Man Zi.

153
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,580
I saw your appetite wasn't very good today.

154
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,580
I ate so much dinner.

155
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,580
It's hard to walk.

156
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,580
I'll carry you home.

157
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,580
Come on up.

158
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,580
Do you think those Soul-seeing Light

159
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,580
really have the power to lead the Soul-seeing Light to return to its original form?

160
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,580
The mortal soul has no power.

161
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,580
It's just a request for a rest.

162
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,580
You're not lighting the lantern.

163
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,580
I can also see the things.

164
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,580
I'm not.

165
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,580
Then who did you light it for?

166
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,580
For those who can't find their way home.

167
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,580
What's wrong?

168
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,580
I don't know.

169
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,580
I just feel that you're different from before.

170
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,580
I'm not.

171
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,580
I'm just a little bit different.

172
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,580
But...

173
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,580
No matter what,

174
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,580
you must remember who you are.

175
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,580
You can't lose your way, okay?

176
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,580
The Soul-seeing Light

177
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,580
A-Yuan.

178
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,580
The Soul-seeing Light

179
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,580
The Soul-seeing Light

180
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,580
The Soul-seeing Light

181
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,580
Master.

182
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,580
Master.

183
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,580
Master.

184
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,580
Master.

185
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
Master.

186
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,580
Why did you come here?

187
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,580
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,580
You're so stupid.

189
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,580
Master.

190
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
Master.

191
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,580
It's you.

192
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,580
It's been three years.

193
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,580
How did you become like this?

194
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,580
Don't talk about me.

195
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
Let's talk about you.

196
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,580
Why did you suddenly come to see me?

197
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,580
I came to pick you up.

198
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,580
Pick me up?

199
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,580
I have a house in my house.

200
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,580
I just need a housekeeper.

201
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,580
You've read books and been a official.

202
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,580
I'm sure you can be a good person.

203
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,580
Don't worry.

204
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,580
Three bowls of mushroom soup every day.

205
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,580
I'll starve you to death.

206
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,580
Didn't you say that

207
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,580
life is a good thing?

208
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,580
Follow me.

209
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,580
I'll keep you alive until you're in good health.

210
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,580
Three bowls of mushroom soup is not enough.

211
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,580
I'm from the south of Zounan.

212
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
I have meat.

213
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,580
I have enough meat.

214
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,580
What about the white fish on the sky?

215
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,580
What about the white fish in the sea?

216
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,580
I have them all.

217
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
I won't go.

218
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,580
Why?

219
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
Master.

220
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,580
I have something important to do.

221
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,580
I didn't finish it.

222
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
You still want to see Hanlong?

223
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,580
Yes.

224
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,580
I can't go back with you.

225
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,580
I'll say goodbye.

226
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,580
See you next time.

227
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,580
Mo Changqin.

228
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,580
Can't you give up?

229
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,580
You've taught me a lesson.

230
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,580
I'll protect you as much as I can.

231
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,580
Go back with me.

232
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,580
I'll find a way to make you stay alive.

233
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,580
Don't make trouble outside.

234
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,580
Live a peaceful life.

235
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,580
Master.

236
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,580
I've been living well.

237
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,580
You're right.

238
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,580
I'm just a dead man.

239
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,580
I'll die for sure.

240
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
Master.

241
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
You don't know that

242
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,580
I've been sweating since I was born.

243
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
I've never seen it before.

244
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,580
I've seen the worst of the worst.

245
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,580
I couldn't understand the sound.

246
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,580
That's why I chose to be a official.

247
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,580
I've seen the light of God before.

248
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,580
I've also believed in God.

249
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,580
But later I found that

250
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,580
I couldn't control God.

251
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,580
God never controlled me.

252
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
I'm not used to it.

253
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,580
People should have faith in life.

254
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,580
So now I believe in myself.

255
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,580
Master.

256
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,580
Keep your position as a housekeeper.

257
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,580
When I kill Han Long,

258
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,580
I'll come to find you.

259
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,580
If you can't find Han Long in your whole life.

260
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,580
Then

261
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,580
I can only spend my life with you.

262
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,580
You can trust me.

263
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,580
What?

264
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,580
Trust me.

265
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,580
I'll help you kill Han Long.

266
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,580
No.

267
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,580
This is the body of the Han Long

268
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,580
of Wujushan.

269
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,580
Then

270
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,580
if I kill Han Long,

271
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,580
I can kill Han Zai.

272
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,580
Although Han Long is in a chaotic world,

273
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,580
he is still a human being.

274
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,580
Maybe Han Zai is not his intention.

275
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,580
We still have a chance to return it.

276
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,580
What chance?

277
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,580
Water has a purification power.

278
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,580
But it can't be combined with the river.

279
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,580
If he is willing to go back to the north of the water,

280
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,580
and stop harming people,

281
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,580
then he doesn't have to kill him.

282
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,580
What if he doesn't want to?

283
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,580
Then he doesn't have to be soft.

284
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,580
He can kill the earth.

285
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,580
So

286
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Water will enter it in any given moment.

287
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,400
They'll know.

288
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,860
They'll only know

289
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,580
that I came fromwiąz to it.

290
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
One day

291
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
the wind will be blowing.

292
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,580
A storm will stop.

293
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,580
Wings need to be largely cleaned away.

294
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,580
Master.

295
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,580
Master.

296
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Immortal Immortal Immortal.

297
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,580
Now the world is in a terrible state.

298
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,580
It's all because of you.

299
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,580
If you still have a heart of compassion and compassion,

300
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
you can return to the water immediately.

301
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,580
Don't harm the world.

302
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,580
I was in the north sea,

303
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,580
in the mess of the water in the west.

304
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,580
I was in the big palace.

305
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,580
I was rewarded by the Heavenly Palace.

306
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,580
You can come to the Three Realms with me.

307
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,580
You don't have to be punished.

308
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,580
As you said,

309
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,580
I can't listen to you.

310
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,580
Your freedom

311
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,580
cannot be compared to the Three Realms.

312
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,580
The Three Realms?

313
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,580
It's just a group of people.

314
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,580
Their lives are just like flowers falling into the night.

315
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,580
What's the point of being so loyal?

316
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,580
I thought you were a villain.

317
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,580
But I didn't expect you to be so insincere.

318
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,580
If that's the case, you deserve to die.

319
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,580
Master.

320
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,580
Yes, natürlich.

321
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,580
What's wrong with you?

322
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,580
I will kill you if you cannot come to the venue zone.

323
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,580
You and Siling Yi are in the same boat.

324
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,580
Do you know what she's going to do now?

325
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
She's going to try?

326
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,580
There are four major difficulties in the world.

327
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,580
The UK is in a trance.

328
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,580
It's the heaven.

329
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,580
She's just like the world.

330
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,580
She's just like the world.

331
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,580
She's just like the world.

332
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,580
What I said was right.

333
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,200
She wants to kill Ch Pen now.

334
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,580
She's not just doing the magic fear.

335
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:07,880
It's also to

336
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,900
How do you want me to have?

337
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,580
Stop her.

338
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,680
Cut her off język.

339
00:21:49,580 --> 00:22:18,920
Ten

340
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,060
Kill it

341
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,760

Please clear the way

what are waiting for you

356
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,140
we feel an illusion

357
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,620
Let alone to an alien,

358
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,300
who is now the god

359
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,300
you can never resist the god

360
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,140
Master, I can't kill him!

361
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,140
Chang Qin,

362
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,140
you are so righteous.

363
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,140
You are so selfish.

364
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,140
You can do it!

365
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,140
The God of God, the God of Wei,

366
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,140
has killed everyone!

367
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,140
The God of Wei, the God of Wei,

368
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,140
has killed everyone!

369
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,140
The God of Wei, the God of Wei,

370
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,140
has killed everyone!

371
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,140
I finally...

372
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,140
I did it!

373
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,140
The God of Wei, the God of Wei,

374
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,140
has killed everyone!

375
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,140
The God of Wei, the God of Wei,

376
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,140
has killed everyone!

377
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,140
The God of Wei, the God of Wei,

378
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,140
has killed everyone!

379
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,140
The God of Wei, the God of Wei,

380
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,140
has killed everyone!

381
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,140
The God of Wei, the God of Wei,

382
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,140
has killed everyone!

383
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,140
The God of Wei, the God of Wei,

384
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,140
has killed everyone!

385
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,140
The God of Wei, the God of Wei,

386
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,140
has killed everyone!

387
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,140
Mingğlou,

388
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,140
If you want to keep Agreed,

389
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,140
tell me,

390
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,140
is it going to stop now?

391
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,380
I don't use this day and night anymore.

392
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,140
Magistrate,

393
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,140
He's still in the coma, but he's fine.

394
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,140
That's good. That's good.

395
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,140
Do you know that we killed Hanlong and killed Hanzai today?

396
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,140
From now on, people won't be in the coma anymore.

397
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
I know.

398
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,140
Hanlong.

399
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,140
Do you think I did something wrong?

400
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,140
Yes.

401
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,140
Why?

402
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,140
I told you that you didn't listen to me.

403
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,140
You said that the mortal is not like the dragon.

404
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,140
The fish and birds are different.

405
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,140
But it's not like that.

406
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,140
I saw Mengchi.

407
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,140
He was born to be unparalleled.

408
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,140
But he still drew the picture of the four-color blue with the wood of the wood of the cliff.

409
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,140
I saw Mengqiang.

410
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,140
He went to the mortal with the wood of the mortal.

411
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,140
He knew that he killed Hanlong.

412
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,140
He couldn't even do anything.

413
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,140
Then what?

414
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,140
Then what?

415
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,140
He's dead.

416
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,140
Do you know what you're talking about?

417
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,140
I know what I'm doing.

418
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,140
The one who's really not sober is you.

419
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,140
We're both in the world because of the Qingjian.

420
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,140
I told you that we can't use violence in the mortal world.

421
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,140
We can't make a mistake.

422
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,140
But what about you?

423
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,140
We can use the power to save people.

424
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,140
Even kill Hanlong for the mortal.

425
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,140
He's wrong.

426
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,140
It's hard to judge the right and wrong.

427
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,140
I only saw the result.

428
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,140
Hua Ruyu.

429
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,140
You promised me that you'd save Mengchiang once.

430
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,140
I'm willing to continue to be with you through the Qingjian.

431
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,140
But now you've lost your sight.

432
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,140
Now it's your turn to take the throne.

433
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,140
I can't forgive you anymore.

434
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,140
What are you doing?

435
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,140
I'm going back.

436
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,140
What are you talking about?

437
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,140
I'm going back to the Sky of the Nine Heavens

438
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,140
to make up for my personal crimes.

439
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,140
You're going to kill me?

440
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,140
I won't kill you.

441
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,140
But I'll seal your power

442
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,140
and show my power to the Sky of the Nine Heavens.

443
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,140
I have nothing to do with what you did.

444
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,140
Pei Jiu Si.

445
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,140
Don't you like the mortal?

446
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,140
Then I'll seal your spirit power for ten years

447
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,140
and let you spend ten years in the mortal world.

448
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,140
And I can also keep my word.

449
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,140
We're all good to you.

450
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,140
You can't do this to me.

451
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,140
You can't do this to me.

452
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,140
I'm not a woman.

453
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,140
I'm not a woman.

454
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,140
I thought

455
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,140
that in the mortal world,

456
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,140
you've been sincere to me

457
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,140
for a few years.

458
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,140
But I didn't expect

459
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,140
that everything was fake.

460
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,140
I'm cold-hearted and innocent.

461
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,140
You're the one who made this decision.

462
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,140
No wonder

463
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,140
you've never been willing to have a child with me.

464
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,140
No wonder you never dared to help me.

465
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,140
Did you think

466
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,140
I was helpless and helpless?

467
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,140
You need to keep your word

468
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,140
and keep your word.

469
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,140
You can't be like Bi Li.

470
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,140
I made the decision for you.

471
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,140
You made it yourself.

472
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,140
No.

473
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,140
I'm glad that you're here.

474
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,140
I won't hide for too long.

475
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,140
No.

476
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,140
Let go of me.

477
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,140
Let go of me.

478
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,140
You said

479
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,140
you were

480
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,140
a beautiful woman.

481
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,140
You're like the cool breeze.

482
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,140
I promised to fall in love with you

483
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,140
and I'll be back in the mortal world.

484
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,140
But

485
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,140
I don't know

486
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,140
how to say it.

487
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,140
I've always been

488
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,140
able to understand

489
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,140
the taste of Di Yu Li.

490
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,140
I can't even

491
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,140
remember myself.

492
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,140
I've seen so many tears.

493
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,140
But I've been

494
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,140
in love with you.

495
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,140
I'm afraid

496
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,140
I'll be gone.

497
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
I'll never

498
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,140
need

499
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,140
to be gone.

500
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,140
Uncle Qing Yang.

501
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,140
You really don't know anything.

502
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,140
Why did the senior and the senior

503
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,140
go to the mortal world

504
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,140
and suddenly come back?

505
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,140
You ask me who I'm asking?

506
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,140
It's okay if we don't know each other.

507
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,140
Uncle, you're the senior of the sect.

508
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,140
How can you not know each other?

509
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,140
I'm not sure.

510
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,140
I'm not sure.

511
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,140
I'm not sure.

512
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,140
I'm not sure.

513
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,140
You're the senior of the sect.

514
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,140
How can you not know each other?

515
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,140
That's right.

516
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,140
I want you to say it.

517
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,140
Brother Zhang.

518
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,140
Brother Zhang.

519
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,140
Brother Zhang, you're back.

520
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,140
When did you come back?

521
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,140
Chen Shi just returned.

522
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,140
Chen Shi?

523
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,140
So you came back

524
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,140
with the senior and the senior?

525
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,140
Do you know

526
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,140
why the senior and the senior

527
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,140
went to the mortal world together?

528
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,140
What was he for?

529
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,140
Yes.

530
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,140
We used to play together.

531
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,140
But suddenly he changed.

532
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,140
He was so powerful.

533
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,140
Even the attitude and style

534
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
were different.

535
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Brother Zhang.

536
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,140
Do you think

537
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,140
the sect leader

538
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,140
gave them some spiritual pills?

539
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,140
I don't know either.

540
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,140
Well.

541
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,140
You're the senior of the sect.

542
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,140
How can you not know?

543
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,140
Who else is the senior of the sect?

544
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,140
I'm not.

545
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,140
You're not.

546
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,140
Now, the senior

547
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,140
is a non-known disciple.

548
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,140
Even the younger ones

549
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,140
have gone to the mortal world.

550
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
The mortal world is powerful.

551
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,140
The sky is broken.

552
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,140
The world is hard to find.

553
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,140
The sky is full of stars.

554
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,140
The world is full of wine.

555
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140
The three realms are six.

556
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,140
The eight seas are four.

557
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,140
It's possible.

558
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,140
We can't find it.

559
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,140
It doesn't mean

560
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,140
the people in Canglei Hall can't find it either.

561
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,140
Longyuan is the closest disciple

562
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,140
of the Great City Master.

563
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,140
He must have a way

564
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,140
to find the Great City Master.

565
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,140
The Shizu and Great City Master

566
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,140
disappeared together.

567
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,140
They must be in the same place.

568
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,140
As long as they find the Great City Master,

569
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,140
they will find Shizu.

570
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,140
Brother.

571
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,140
When I was fighting in Tianlu Feng,

572
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,140
I placed the bell of the Great City Master

573
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,140
on Longyuan.

574
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,140
If Canglei Hall has any idea,

575
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,140
I can definitely know.

576
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,140
That's great.

577
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,140
The Great City Master is not a small thing.

578
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,140
We can't make any mistakes.

579
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,140
Yes.

580
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,140
I will order

581
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,140
the disciples of the Sect to

582
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,140
split into 12 groups

583
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,140
and look for them.

584
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,140
Dan Yang.

585
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,140
Since you have placed the bell of the Great City Master,

586
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,140
you can stay at the Sect.

587
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,140
You can monitor the movements of Canglei Hall at any time.

588
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,140
Yes.

589
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,140
Zi Yang.

590
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,140
You lead the disciples to split into four groups

591
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,140
and look for them one by one.

592
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,140
I will go to the back mountain to close the gate.

593
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:33,140
I will use the Great City Master to find the Shizu and Great City Master.

594
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,140
Please keep in mind

595
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,140
that the Shizu and Great City Master

596
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,140
are related to the fate of the Jin Yun Sect.

597
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:44,140
We must find them at all costs.

598
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,140
I have something to ask.

599
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,140
Everyone, go and do your work.

600
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
You may leave now.

601
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,140
Yes.

602
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
What do you want to ask?

603
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,140
Do you know what I want to ask?

604
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,140
You have a lot in your heart, right?

605
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
I want to hear your words.

606
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,140
In this world,

607
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,140
there is no Jin Yun Sect disciple Li Qingyue.

608
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,140
Only the Immortal Master of the Four Spiritual Cult, Yu Tian Tongshou,

609
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,140
can be found in the Shizu and Great City Master's secret place.

610
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,140
The Shizu and Great City Master

611
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,140
are the same person.

612
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,140
The Shizu and Great City Master

613
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,140
have been together for 300 years.

614
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,140
They have been fighting in Canglei Hall.

615
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,140
Their bodies have been destroyed.

616
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,140
Their spirit

617
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,140
has been floating in the world for 300 years.

618
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,140
For the past 300 years,

619
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,140
the Shizu has been destroyed.

620
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,140
They have been hiding in the world

621
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:42,140
to avoid the assassination of Canglei Hall.

622
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,140
Until they were taken by the Shizu and Great City Master

623
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,140
and the Immortal Master of the last generation.

624
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,140
They were sent by the Shizu and Great City Master.

625
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,140
They also established the Jin Yun Sect.

626
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,140
This is why they have been

627
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,140
the Immortal Master of the Four Spiritual Cult,

628
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,140
and they have been secretly

629
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,140
the Immortal Master of the Four Spiritual Cult

630
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,140
under the title of the Immortal Master of the last generation.

631
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,140
We can say that

632
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,140
the reason we have been sent by the Jin Yun Sect

633
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,140
is to help the Shizu

634
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,140
regain its power

635
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,140
and re-establish the Nine Realms.

636
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,140
Then,

637
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,140
where is Qingyue?

638
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,140
The common Li Qingyue

639
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,140
is just the disguise of the Shizu.

640
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,140
His body...

641
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,140
When he was young,

642
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,140
he was drowned in the water.

643
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
Zhang Sun,

644
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,140
in the situation you are in,

645
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,140
you will be confused and blind.

646
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,140
As long as you jump out of the game,

647
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,140
you will see the truth.

648
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
I am confused.

649
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,140
Zhang Sun,

650
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,140
you used the Sky Pavilion to go up the Nine Realms.

651
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,140
I didn't expect this.

652
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,140
You are wrong.

653
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,140
I don't care about this.

654
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,140
Zhao Yang is very strict.

655
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,140
You can't betray him.

656
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,140
Why do you have to

657
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,140
be so stubborn and hurt yourself?

658
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,140
I am too weak to think about it.

659
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,140
In this world,

660
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,140
I have no right or wrong.

661
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,140
You can have the chance

662
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,140
to learn from the Shizu.

663
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,140
It's a disaster.

664
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:09,140
But the Shizu will not

665
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,140
be able to bring you back.

666
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,140
I know.

667
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,140
I know.

668
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,140
I know.

669
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,140
I know.

670
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,140
I know.

671
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,140
I know.

672
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,140
I know.

673
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,140
I know.

674
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,140
I know.

675
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,140
I know.

676
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,140
I know.

677
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,140
I know.

678
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,140
I know.

679
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,140
I know.

680
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,140
I know.

681
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,140
I know.

682
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,140
I know.

683
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,140
I understand.

684
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,140
I know.

685
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,140
I know.

686
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,140
I know.

687
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,140
I know.

688
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,140
I know.

689
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,140
I know.

690
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:57,140
I'm not a flower, you're in the city

691
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:05,140
I want to cry, I still want to laugh at you

692
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:12,140
I want to say this, I'm drunk in your arms

693
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:25,140
I love you so much
