닮어

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,480
......

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,740
I oO

4
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,160
it's okay

5
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,840
you try your best

6
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,940
You have got ...

7
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,240
you can feel your Z..

8
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,880
you're so calm

9
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
You must help him up first.

10
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,880
Si Ling used to use the Heaven's Will to seal Shizun.

11
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,880
Now, only Heaven's Will can seal Si Ling completely

12
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
without hurting Shizun.

13
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,880
Please, Shizun, order him to start the Heaven's Will.

14
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
You guys go back first.

15
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
Shizun.

16
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
Go back.

17
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
Get up. Get up.

18
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
Shizun.

19
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
Go back.

20
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Senior.

21
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,880
Ro Evenan

22
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
Although not dog Kai's will,

23
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,880
hisabs outplayed Bakchi

24
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,880
who deserved the title.

25
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,440
Any woman can't lead the way without the opportunity of letting more than five people live.

26
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,680
As a matter of fact,

27
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,080
E'D rebuilding the foundation of this great family

28
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,760
was fought withanten olsa eunseo

29
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,400
to end relationship with the employer.

30
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,760
What did I 다른...?

31
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,280
But congratulations!

32
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,280
I'm here.

33
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,280
My lady.

34
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,280
My lady.

35
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Where are you?

36
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,280
I'm here.

37
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
My lady.

38
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,280
My lady.

39
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
You've suffered.

40
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,280
I brought you some fruits that I've made myself.

41
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Take some first.

42
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,280
What happened?

43
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Why did you offend the lord?

44
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,280
What are you talking about?

45
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,280
It's none of your business.

46
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Don't ask me again.

47
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,280
Don't come any closer.

48
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,280
My lady.

49
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,280
You don't know that

50
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,280
the lord is going to let you go back to the Yuewu Garden.

51
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,280
Longyuan's late emperor was so upset.

52
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,280
He didn't know what to do.

53
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,280
He was so upset that he didn't know what to do.

54
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
He stopped the lord from letting you go.

55
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
My lady.

56
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
You don't know Longyuan's late emperor.

57
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
He's the eldest disciple of the lord.

58
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,280
He's the most arrogant in the whole Canglei Hall.

59
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
We've never even sold him off.

60
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
I don't know what happened this time.

61
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
He insisted on fighting against you.

62
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Why don't you tell me

63
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,280
what happened?

64
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,280
What if I'm too busy to help?

65
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
I can't let him bully you.

66
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
Just follow him.

67
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,280
Can't you change your temper?

68
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,280
The lord has let you go and kept the Li Qingyue.

69
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,280
What are you still doing?

70
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
I'm not in charge of the temple.

71
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,280
The lord is in danger for the rest of the day.

72
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,280
I'm just thinking for the lord.

73
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,280
I must seal the temple with the seal of the Heavens.

74
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
The temple is the temple.

75
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
The Li Qingyue is the Li Qingyue.

76
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,280
You're lying to others.

77
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,280
I was so jealous of the lord's fault.

78
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,280
The temple is so beautiful.

79
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
The best look.

80
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
That's what happened 400 years ago.

81
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
He pretended to be good to the lord.

82
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,280
But when he was in the temple,

83
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,280
he used the spirit brush to stab the lord.

84
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,280
And then he sealed the lord for 100 years.

85
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,280
He must have pretended to be a bad guy to get close to the lord.

86
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,280
You lost the wrong letter before.

87
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,280
That's why the lord is badly injured now.

88
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Have you ever thought that

89
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
if the Li Qingyue is a bad guy,

90
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,280
he will be killed by the spirit brush.

91
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
You're a kind person.

92
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Have you forgotten that the Dansha Mirror

93
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,280
is full of bad guys?

94
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,280
The lord is responsible for the protection of the temple.

95
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,280
He's been in the temple for nine days.

96
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
He's been in the temple for nine days.

97
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,280
He's been in the temple for nine days.

98
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,280
He's been in the temple for nine days.

99
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,280
If anything happens to him,

100
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,280
the Dansha Mirror will be gone.

101
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,280
Lord, I beg you.

102
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,280
The lord of the Four Seasons will not give him a chance to be in the Dansha Mirror.

103
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,280
The Dansha Mirror

104
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Lord of the Great City.

105
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
You and the lord of the Four Seasons

106
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,280
are the two spirits of the Lord of the Red Alliance.

107
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Since the beginning of the world,

108
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,280
you and him have been in the temple for nine days.

109
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,280
The spirit of the Heavenly Emperor is in the temple for life.

110
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,280
After he sealed you back then,

111
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,280
he was blessed with the blessing of the world.

112
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,280
He took the holy skill and returned to the previous world.

113
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
He was a Taoist.

114
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,280
He was punished for his crimes.

115
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,280
The Lord of the Four Seasons is right.

116
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,280
If the Lord of the Four Seasons comes back,

117
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,280
he will be in trouble for nine days.

118
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
He can't stay.

119
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
He can't stay.

120
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
Lord of the Great City,

121
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,280
go seal him up.

122
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,280
You and him have been together for thousands of years.

123
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,280
Why can't you do it today?

124
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,280
If the God of the Four Seasons really disappears,

125
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
if he is a mortal,

126
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,280
he will be in trouble all the way to heaven.

127
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,280
What if he kills the wrong person?

128
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
Kill him alone,

129
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
change the six realms,

130
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,280
kill him,

131
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
and be a fool.

132
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
You are right.

133
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
If you are him,

134
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
you will die.

135
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Of course.

136
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,280
If he is the Lord of the Four Seasons,

137
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
the Lord of the Great City,

138
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,280
your current method is not to let him go.

139
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,280
If he is in trouble for nine days,

140
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
are you responsible?

141
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
I am responsible.

142
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
I will kill him once,

143
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
and kill him twice.

144
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
Moreover,

145
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,280
I don't need to worry about the personal matters between us.

146
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Greetings, Lord of the Four Seasons.

147
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,280
I have something important to discuss with the Lord of the Great City.

148
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Yes.

149
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
I think the Lord of the Four Seasons

150
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
is here because of the four souls.

151
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,280
Xuan Tian is not concerned about his life and death.

152
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
We care about you.

153
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Lord of the Great City,

154
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
will you forget your responsibility and mission

155
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
because of him?

156
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
I have never forgotten the entrance

157
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,280
of the Three Realms of the Five Seasons.

158
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
The barrier I set up

159
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,280
will be destroyed if I am alive.

160
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
That's the best.

161
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
If you cause problems

162
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
with the two souls,

163
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Xuan Tian will be killed.

164
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
But he will not be alone

165
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
if he is punished.

166
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Nothing will happen.

167
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,280
The Lord of the Four Seasons and the Lord of the Great City

168
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
are together in heaven and earth.

169
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Thousands of years have passed.

170
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,280
You are close to each other.

171
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
You know him best.

172
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,280
You know him best

173
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,280
if he is the Lord of the Four Seasons.

174
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
I told you not to come again.

175
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
How could you?

176
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
You are a mortal.

177
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
You will be hungry.

178
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
I am so angry these days.

179
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
The dragon garden

180
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
took a big group of people

181
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
to kneel at the temple.

182
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
What are you saying?

183
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
I am not angry.

184
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
I am angry.

185
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
I am angry.

186
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
I am angry.

187
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
I am angry.

188
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
I am angry.

189
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
I am angry.

190
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
I am angry.

191
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
I am angry.

192
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
I am angry.

193
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
I am angry.

194
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
I am angry.

195
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
I am angry.

196
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
I am angry.

197
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,620
I hurt you,

198
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,280
but I am happy for you.

199
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
I want to give all my heart to you.

200
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
I have the wisdom to chair you.

201
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
My Lord.

202
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
It's better than the king to say

203
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
you want to nominate me somehow.

204
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
I believe

205
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,380
that is why

206
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,280
the god will nominate you for the rest of life.

207
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
But

208
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
the decision

209
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
will never beominlected.

210
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
Ma'am,

211
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
why do you say that?

212
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
I'm here.

213
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
Senior Zhang, why are you here?

214
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
I'm asking you something.

215
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
I'm here to save you.

216
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,080
You're a mortal. How can you go to the Sky of the Nine Heavens?

217
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
You're also a mortal.

218
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Aren't you here too?

219
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
I...

220
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
I'll take you away.

221
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
Answer me first.

222
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
Why are you here?

223
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Let's go.

224
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
The Yin Yang Sect is in the Sky of the Nine Heavens.

225
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,280
The Demon Palace is gathered in one place.

226
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
You came here to the Sky of the Nine Heavens?

227
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
How do you know that?

228
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Are you crazy?

229
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Do you know what will happen if you do that?

230
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,280
The Sky of the Nine Heavens is in the Sky of the Nine Heavens.

231
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
I know.

232
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Qing Yuan, I'm not afraid of her.

233
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Let's go.

234
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
Let's go.

235
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Master.

236
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
The whole army won't let you in.

237
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Get out of the way.

238
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
Long Yuan, don't do this.

239
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
You're a liar.

240
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,280
If anything goes wrong, I'll kill you first.

241
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
I...

242
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
I'm...

243
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,280
Hurry up.

244
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Why is it so high?

245
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
We'll talk about this when we get to the safe place.

246
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Let's go now.

247
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
Master.

248
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Come.

249
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Brother.

250
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
We're...

251
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Let's go.

252
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
Come with me.

253
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Let's go.

254
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
What are you doing?

255
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Don't come over here.

256
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
How dare you do this to me?

257
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,280
Li Qing Yuan.

258
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
Are you afraid of the big waves?

259
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Don't come over here.

260
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
Sweeping.

261
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Brother.

262
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,360
Brother,

263
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,280
Brother.

264
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
What is this?

265
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
People are so harsh.

266
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Don't tell me.

267
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Brother Qing Yuan.

268
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
how time flies.

269
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Brother Qing Yuan.

270
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
I didn't say that!

271
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,280
Although I've been in the mortal realm for a few years,

272
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,280
you said that you would cherish the past for a hundred years.

273
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
No, I didn't say that!

274
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
I beg you,

275
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
I swear to heaven that

276
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
you will marry me as your wife,

277
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,280
and live a life without a life.

278
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
It's not me.

279
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
It's not me!

280
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
These are all fake.

281
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
Right?

282
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
I said it's not me!

283
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
I'm Li Qingyun.

284
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
I live in Yufan Mountain.

285
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
My father is a spiritual father, and my mother is a spiritual father.

286
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
I'm not a mortal!

287
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
Do you still want to act stupidly?

288
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
You're the one who's stupid.

289
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
I beg you, Li Qingyun.

290
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
I'm not your body!

291
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
You're still here.

292
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
Be careful, Qingyun.

293
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,280
I'll give you one last chance.

294
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
Go back with me.

295
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
No, I won't go back.

296
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Qingyun!

297
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
Qingyun!

298
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Qingyun, let's go.

299
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
You bastard!

300
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Stop!

301
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Get out of the way!

302
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
Brother!

303
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
Brother!

304
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
Are you okay?

305
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
I'm fine.

306
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
I'm fine.

307
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
I'm fine.

308
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
I'm fine.

309
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
I'm fine.

310
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
I can't leave here without my magic.

311
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
I can't take you away from here.

312
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
I'm the one who's making you suffer.

313
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
It's not your fault.

314
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,280
I'm the one who's willing to do it.

315
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Tongtianti is the existence of the devil.

316
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
Why do you have to torture yourself?

317
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,280
And what's the power of your body?

318
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,280
Qingyun, you used the fruit of the food, right?

319
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,280
I knew you were in the Sky of the Nine Kingdoms.

320
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
You're from the Qingyun Sect.

321
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
How can I be a brother to you?

322
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,280
How can I be bullied by others?

323
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
Brother!

324
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
Brother!

325
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
Brother!

326
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
What's wrong?

327
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
Brother!

328
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,280
Brother!

329
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
This is the new news.

330
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
I can only believe you if you eat it.

331
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,280
You'll come to me every month to get the antidote.

332
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Otherwise, the poison will be your weapon.

333
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
Brother!

334
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
Brother!

335
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Brother!

336
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
Someone!

337
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
Baizhu Temple!

338
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
Baizhu Temple!

339
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Baizhu Temple!

340
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,280
Master, your wound is serious.

341
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
You need to rest.

342
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,280
Now, you're in the third round of the third round.

343
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,280
If you continue like this,

344
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
your wound won't heal.

345
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
I'm going to take Hong Lian

346
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
to the Sky of the Nine Kingdoms today.

347
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
In the next few days,

348
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,280
I hope you'll take good care of yourself.

349
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
You can go.

350
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
What are you doing?

351
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Master,

352
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,280
can you see my brother?

353
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
He's not doing well.

354
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
I came here because of your wound.

355
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
I came here to save him.

356
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Master.

357
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
Master.

358
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,280
Master.

359
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
Master.

360
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Master.

361
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Master.

362
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Master.

363
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Master.

364
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
I'm begging you to find my brother.

365
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
He's not doing well.

366
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
Is Lord Li Meng still here?

367
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Can you find him?

368
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,280
Are you that concerned about him?

369
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
I'm afraid you forgot

370
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,280
who is your partner.

371
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
Xuan Sun.

372
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
I've been

373
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,280
making you go through a lot.

374
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
I did everything wrong.

375
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
You want me to be the god of the dead.

376
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
I'll do it.

377
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,280
As long as you can save my brother.

378
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Youyou.

379
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
I really want to kill you.

380
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
I'll kill you.

381
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
Ahyuan.

382
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,280
You'll never know how to make me angry.

383
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
Master.

384
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,280
I'll do anything.

385
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,280
Please save my brother.

386
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,280
If you want to kill me,

387
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
I'll kill him.

388
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
I'll save you.

389
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
Someone will save him.

390
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
As for us,

391
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
we'll find out soon enough.

392
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Master.

393
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
I've been telling you about this.

394
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,280
Tomorrow at noon,

395
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,280
the sky will be full of wind and rain.

396
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
The wind will be the wind's shadow.

397
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Even if you want to blame me,

398
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
I'll have to take care of it.

399
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
After this,

400
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,280
I'll go back to the capital.

401
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
I'll go back to the capital.

402
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
I'll go back to the capital.

403
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,280
I'll go back to the capital.

404
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,280
I'll go back to the capital.

405
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
Even if I tell him,

406
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
he's not the Immortal Immortal Immortal.

407
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
He's just a mortal.

408
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,280
If he colludes with the external people to hurt Master,

409
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
it won't be tolerable.

410
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,280
Master.

411
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
He's already killed you once.

412
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,280
Do you want to give him another chance

413
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
to kill you again?

414
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
If Master doesn't want to,

415
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
he can leave tomorrow.

416
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
But after tomorrow,

417
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,280
the three realms of the Sky and the four seas will be destroyed.

418
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,280
No one will hurt you again.

419
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
No need.

420
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
I'll do it myself.

421
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
Don't worry.

422
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
I'll be there soon.

423
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Master.

424
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
Mrs. Qingyue.

425
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Please.

426
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Master.

427
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,280
Mrs. Qingyue is going to the Sky and the Four Seas.

428
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
Master.

429
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,280
Master.

430
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Why did he kill the Immortal Immortal Immortal?

431
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,280
What did Master say?

432
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,280
What evidence did he find?

433
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280
We don't know.

434
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
We don't know.

435
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Mrs. Qingyue really is the Immortal Immortal Immortal.

436
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
Master.

437
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
He's the first disciple of Master.

438
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,280
He's also the Immortal Immortal Immortal

439
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,280
who has seen the Immortal Immortal in person.

440
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
He said it's the real thing.

441
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Master.

442
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,280
Master.

443
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Master.

444
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Mrs. Qingyue is the Immortal Immortal.

445
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,280
Besides, he hasn't found out

446
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
whether he's the Immortal Immortal.

447
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
Even if he's not the Immortal,

448
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,280
he's the biggest evil in the world.

449
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
Even if he's not the Immortal,

450
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,280
Master is the master of the Sky and the Immortal

451
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,280
and he's the great blessing to be the Immortal.

452
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
A little mortal woman.

453
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,280
She's just a little girl.

454
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,280
She's just a little girl.

455
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,280
She's just a little girl.

456
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
I'm sorry.

457
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
I'm sorry.

458
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
I can't stand this woman.

459
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Yes.

460
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
It's a crime.

461
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
It's also punishable in mortal world.

462
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,280
How dare you kill the Immortal with mortal world?

463
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,280
You're so insensitive.

464
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
You're so insensitive.

465
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,280
What a great opportunity.

466
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
I wonder if he's the real one.

467
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
He's the one who saved himself.

468
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,280
This medicine can temporarily suppress poison.

469
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,280
But the poison in your body is already in the lungs.

470
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
It's very cause-and-effect.

471
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,280
I can only suppress it and not dissolve it.

472
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,280
I can wait for a few days until Immortal Li Mo comes back

473
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
and then I'll treat him.

474
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
It's you.

475
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Come with me.

476
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,280
It's too late to come here.

477
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
What's wrong?

478
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Madam was taken away by the dragon.

479
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,280
They said

480
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
they want to send Madam to the Heavenly Mother

481
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
and use the seal of Heaven.

482
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Before the seal is opened,

483
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
they need to be punished by the Immortal.

484
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
Then they'll have to be punished

485
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,280
by the Immortal for 81 days.

486
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,280
That's why they're doing it.

487
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
I'm sorry.

488
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
I'm sorry.

489
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
I'm sorry.

490
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
I'm sorry.

491
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
I can only finish it in 21 days.

492
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
Madam is a body-bending monster.

493
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
How can she suffer this kind of pain?

494
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
When the seal is opened,

495
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
she'll die.

496
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Are you okay?

497
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
I'm fine.

498
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
Let's go save Qingyue.

499
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,280
Immortal Xuan!

500
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
Immortal Xuan!

501
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Immortal Xuan!

502
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,280
Immortal Xuan!

503
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
What else do you want to say?

504
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Thank you for saving my brother.

505
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Is that all?

506
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,280
Master said

507
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,280
the seal of Heaven is not good.

508
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,280
Now it looks like this.

509
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Immortal Xuan.

510
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,280
I won't lie to you again.

511
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
I'll kill you.

512
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,280
Maybe I can meet Immortal Xuan in Jiuyou.

513
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,280
Do you have anything to say to him?

514
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,280
I'll tell him personally.

515
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
Let's start.

516
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
A-Yue.

517
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
I'll ask you one last time.

518
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,280
Do you want to tell me the truth?

519
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
Immortal Xuan!

520
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
Don't hesitate.

521
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
It's a magic.

522
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
Immortal Xuan, don't forget.

523
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
I'll take you back to Jiuyou.

524
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,280
Immortal Xuan!

525
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Qingyue!

526
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,280
No!

527
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Immortal Xuan!

528
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,280
I'll kill you!

529
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Immortal Xuan!

530
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Why can't I come?

531
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
No!

532
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
Go.

533
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,280
Go.

534
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,280
Go.

535
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
Go.

536
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
I'll kill you.

537
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
Immortal Xuan.

538
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Are you...

539
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Huarongyue?

540
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,280
As long as you say yes,

541
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
I'll stop you right away.

542
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,280
I'll...

543
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
You...

544
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
Qing...

545
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Yue!

546
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,280
Go away!

547
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Go!

548
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
Go!

549
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
Ling'er?

550
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,280
Immortal Xuan!

551
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,280
I'll kill you.

552
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,280
I'll kill you.

553
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,280
I'll kill you.

554
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,280
I'll kill you.
