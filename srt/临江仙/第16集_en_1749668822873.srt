1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
That doesn't carry much pressure anymore when you hear this tune.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,120
I'm going the wrong way, it's too loud.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,360
NO, NO, I don't have time or everything!

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,920
Please stop it, it's too loud.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,920
I'm not sure if I can make it.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,920
I'll try to make it.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,920
I'll try to make it.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,920
I'll try to make it.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,920
I'll try to make it.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,920
I'll try to make it.

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,920
I'll try to make it.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,920
I'll try to make it.

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,920
I'll try to make it.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,920
I'll try to make it.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,920
I'll try to make it.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,920
I'll try to make it.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,920
I'll try to make it.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,920
I'll try to make it.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,920
I'll try to make it.

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,920
I'll try to make it.

21
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,920
I'll try to make it.

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,920
I'll try to make it.

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,920
I'll try to make it.

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,920
I'll try to make it.

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,920
I'll try to make it.

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,920
I'll try to make it.

27
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,920
I'll try to make it.

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,920
I'll try to make it.

29
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,920
I'll try to make it.

30
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,920
I'll try to make it.

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,920
I'll try to make it.

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,920
I'll try to make it.

33
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
I'll try to make it.

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
I'll try to make it.

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,920
I'll try to make it.

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
I'll try to make it.

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,920
I'll try to make it.

38
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,920
I'll try to make it.

39
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,920
I'll try to make it.

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,920
I'll try to make it.

41
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,920
I'll try to make it.

42
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,920
I'll try to make it.

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,920
I'll try to make it.

44
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
I'll try to make it.

45
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,920
I'll try to make it.

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,920
I'll try to make it.

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,920
The bird can be caught by the net.

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,920
I can only be trapped in this place.

49
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,920
You were still in the game when I was a child.

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
How can I not be worried?

51
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,920
The ten disciples of the Cang Lei Hall left the Danxia Palace to find the master.

52
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,920
I'm the only one.

53
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,920
I'm trapped in this Luo Ying Lin.

54
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,920
I'm forced to think about it.

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,920
I'm forced to think about it.

56
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,920
I'm forced to think about it.

57
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
That's a misunderstanding.

58
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,920
You don't know what happened to Mr. Ling.

59
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,920
You don't know what happened to Mr. Ling.

60
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,920
Misunderstanding?

61
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,920
My daughter and Mr. Ling colluded with each other.

62
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,920
I don't know what happened to me.

63
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,920
How can I explain this misunderstanding?

64
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,920
Maybe the others don't know.

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,920
But Mr. Ling is the true god of the ancient world.

66
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,920
He has been around for thousands of years.

67
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,920
He has been with many people.

68
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,920
When Mr. Ling returns, he will give you a clear answer.

69
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,920
You can drink water, but you can't drink water.

70
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,920
You can't easily see through it.

71
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,920
No!

72
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,920
What is it that Dad la probed me to do today?

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Ling'er, are you still mad at me?

74
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,920
You think too much.

75
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,920
I'm not the first person to see you die.

76
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
How can you be angry?

77
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,920
You always say I'm dead.

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
But why did you talk to me?

79
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,920
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

80
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Maybe it's that arrogant, but slow-witted Ling'er.

81
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,920
Or that fake disguise that I've been unable to see the real reality for years.

82
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Is it because I'm too good at disguising?

83
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Or is it because my father cares too much about me

84
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,920
that I haven't found my change?

85
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,920
When did you start to rely on the Immortal Lord of the Four Seasons?

86
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,920
No, I didn't.

87
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
I was originally the Immortal Lord of the Four Seasons.

88
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,920
So you told me you like the Immortal Lord of the Great City?

89
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,920
It's all fake.

90
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Yes.

91
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,920
I'm more comfortable with the love of the Immortal Lord of the Four Seasons.

92
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,920
The purpose of disguising the love of Immortal Lord of the Four Seasons

93
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,920
is to help the Immortal Lord of the Four Seasons.

94
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
The first time I started to help the Immortal Lord

95
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,920
was to let the Immortal Lord reach the Great City Hall

96
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
and get rid of the White Snake's primordial spirit.

97
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
The second time I started to help the Immortal Lord

98
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
was to let the Immortal Lord of the Four Seasons

99
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
and the Red Lotus's primordial spirit

100
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
get rid of the Fire of the Fire.

101
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I was able to enter the Great City Hall

102
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
and help the White Snake to revive.

103
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
So you colluded with the Immortal Lord of the Four Seasons

104
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
to get rid of the Fire of the Fire.

105
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
No.

106
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,920
No.

107
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
It's earlier.

108
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Otherwise, your plan wouldn't be so complicated.

109
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
When did you know him?

110
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Three hundred years ago.

111
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I took my mother to the Demon King's Valley to get a doctor.

112
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
I accidentally fell into the cliff.

113
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
At that moment,

114
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
I saw the Immortal Lord of the Four Seasons.

115
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
No.

116
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
What's wrong?

117
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Nothing.

118
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
I saved you.

119
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Who?

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Who's talking?

121
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I don't know.

122
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
The Immortal Lord of the Four Seasons is here.

123
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
No wonder.

124
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
No wonder you revealed

125
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
your amazing skill in the Heavenly Manor.

126
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
You became the leader of the tribe in a month.

127
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
You gave me the day.

128
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
You took me as your disciple.

129
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,920
All of this is the instruction of the Immortal Lord of the Four Seasons.

130
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
What are you doing?

131
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Please help the Immortal Lord of the Four Seasons to get to this level.

132
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Do you still remember my mother?

133
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Do you still remember

134
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
who your brother was?

135
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
It was the Eighth Amendment.

136
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
You two couldn't love each other for three months.

137
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
You married your brother again.

138
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,920
My mother is just an ordinary mortal.

139
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,920
She has no background in the Nang family.

140
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
She can't rest in the law.

141
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
She's been imprisoned in the manor.

142
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
But your father

143
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,920
never cared about her.

144
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
He's always been like this.

145
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
He loves to be kind and kind.

146
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
He doesn't love to be abandoned.

147
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
To you,

148
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,920
my mother is just one of your many wives.

149
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,920
There's no distinction between the other women in the backyard.

150
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
But to my mother,

151
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
you're her only husband.

152
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
She's an ordinary woman.

153
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,920
Naturally, she has the jealousy of ordinary women.

154
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
The pain of ordinary women.

155
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,920
So, when you married the 11th wife,

156
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
she was able to get married.

157
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,920
What does this have to do with it?

158
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
So,

159
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
your mother's life

160
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
is in your hands.

161
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,920
What does this have to do with it?

162
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Ling'er, I'm worried about you.

163
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Worry about me?

164
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,920
You're worried about me, aren't you?

165
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,920
You're as worried as you are about your mother.

166
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,920
You've been a late-master since you came.

167
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
That's just a benefit.

168
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
You're using your revenge.

169
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
You're so smart.

170
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
You can't even recognize me?

171
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Being late-master

172
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
is a good thing, isn't it?

173
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
You have many wives.

174
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,920
I have many siblings.

175
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
You're the owner of a family.

176
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,920
I'm the only one in the family who's like a donkey.

177
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
When I was a child,

178
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
my favorite thing

179
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
was to be at the door every day,

180
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,920
hoping that my father would pass by me.

181
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
He called me all the time.

182
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Ling'er,

183
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
I've been happy for a few days.

184
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
Ling'er, I...

185
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,920
But I've been given the blessing of a cow.

186
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
If I hadn't been late-master,

187
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
my mother would have been in a bad mood.

188
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Using late-master

189
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
is my luck.

190
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Listen to me.

191
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
Canglei Hall is the god's place in the Sky Kingdom.

192
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
It's not a small place

193
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
that can defeat the enemy in the Cloud Sect.

194
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
So if you come back,

195
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
I'll...

196
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
I'll choose

197
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
my life.

198
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Mr. Fan.

199
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Mr. Fan, are you free?

200
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Mr. Fan.

201
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Mr. Fan.

202
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
What's the matter?

203
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Do you know where Qingyue is?

204
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
I don't know.

205
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
You really don't know?

206
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
You stole Qingyue

207
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
and got caught by Canglei Hall.

208
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
You can say that your life is in Qingyue's hands.

209
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
But you're in a state of

210
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
fear of her downfall.

211
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
I can only think of two things.

212
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
First, you've thought about

213
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
how to solve the problem of Canglei Hall.

214
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Second,

215
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
you know Qingyue's downfall, right?

216
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Can I come back in a hurry?

217
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Why do you care so much about her?

218
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Ancestral Palace

219
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Through love and yearning,

220
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,920
I canOT know her better.

221
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Cause she only thinks about someone

222
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
and the person at her side

223
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:38,840
is neither our grain nor your nominated sua

224
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,920
What do you mean by that?

225
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
I am asking you to get out of here as soon as possible.

226
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
Don't get too close to me.

227
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,920
It will hurt you.

228
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Is it difficult?

229
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Try it.

230
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Shang Guan?

231
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Senior Meng.

232
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,920
What brings you here?

233
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
I have a message from the sect leader.

234
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
He wants me to let you out.

235
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Let me out?

236
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,920
Why?

237
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
I don't know about that.

238
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
You'd better ask the sect leader yourself.

239
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
OK.

240
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Master.

241
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
You are here.

242
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Master, I have a question.

243
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,920
I know what you want to say.

244
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,920
But...

245
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,920
I have something to tell you.

246
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,920
It wasn't a matter of your decision.

247
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,920
aring a overthrow against fear of this被 it into a甚ger,

248
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:48,920
becomes an excuse to let the perpetrators lead Si Tu and lure us as he decides the great Martinez엇.

249
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,920
It has always been your fault.

250
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,500
but now you two can mix into a roundabout sky and seas wordt snow and form a

251
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,920
ity.

252
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,920
Master, you won't oppose us anymore?

253
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Why would I oppose?

254
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Qu Xingman is kind and kind.

255
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
He's very good-looking.

256
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
I can't be with you anymore.

257
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,920
After you leave, go find him.

258
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,920
By the way, go find your uncle Danyang.

259
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Ask him for some spiritual pills and magic weapons.

260
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Send him a gift.

261
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
But he's from the Demon Sect.

262
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
How is the Demon Sect?

263
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,920
He can't choose his birth place.

264
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,920
As long as he doesn't kill, do evil, and do good deeds, that's the right path.

265
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,920
We, the people of the Sect, can't choose the person who is born and who is evil.

266
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
We can't live in the world.

267
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Do you know that?

268
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Master, I know.

269
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
Hurry up.

270
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Senior Meng, you're back from the Sect?

271
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,920
You must be surprised.

272
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
How can I say?

273
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,920
I suddenly feel empty in my heart.

274
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,920
Get used to it.

275
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
What are you doing?

276
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
Isn't it obvious?

277
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Sister-in-law.

278
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,920
You're the core disciple of the Sect. How can you do this?

279
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,920
The disciples of the people, the sister-in-law, and the cook,

280
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,920
are now the heroes of the sect.

281
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,920
They're over 200 years old.

282
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,920
That sword is born and is used.

283
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
At least ten years older than me.

284
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Other disciples are now looking for the master group.

285
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
That's...

286
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
Sister-in-law Li.

287
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
The sect is now in a lack of people.

288
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,920
You go to the kitchen to help the master and the junior to cook and help him.

289
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,920
It's okay anyway.

290
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Excuse me.

291
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Excuse me.

292
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,920
If you really know the master, you won't worry about him.

293
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,920
He's never the one who's afraid of the small and cowardly,

294
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
and has no real Li Qingyue.

295
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,920
He's the four-leafed master who's a great god.

296
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
The god, he's a god of origin,

297
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,920
and he's been living for 300 years.

298
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,920
He can definitely solve this kind of minor problem.

299
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
I believe he can solve it.

300
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
But if he finds him later,

301
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
he'll be more difficult.

302
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Any difficult?

303
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
For the master, it's all about the opportunity.

304
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
What opportunity?

305
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,920
The opportunity to kill Bai Jiu-si.

306
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Let's go.

307
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,220
When I return, you will help me revive the city.

308
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,360
I will look for Eldest Senior.

309
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,160
People of Siegwain are ready.

310
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,860
Hold off on my protection!

311
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,800
I give my greetings!

312
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,460
Where is my brother?

313
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,600
I…

314
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,640
He has got through.

315
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,940
He went back to his office.

316
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,200
We can't get back there.

317
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,200
Hurry!

318
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,440
Go.

319
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,400
We're going to Tangcan!

320
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,720
Wait for me.

321
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,000
Let's talk to her after work.

322
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,760
You two go to Cigars with Li Zhiyuan.

323
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,920
You're not in the room. Where are you going?

324
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,920
Ah Yue, I'm waiting for you to talk.

325
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,920
What are you doing?

326
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,420
Nothing.

327
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,420
I just want to talk to you.

328
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,920
What else do you have to talk about between us?

329
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
I'm just...

330
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,920
I'm used to talking a lot.

331
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:08,920
The End

332
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,920
Such a big war.

333
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,920
What does the Great City Lord want to see?

334
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,920
410 years ago, I sealed your spirit power.

335
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
I've been waiting for you.

336
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Are you still in love with me?

337
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
What do you think?

338
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,920
After you recovered from your spiritual power, you pretended to be married to me.

339
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,920
During the wedding, you used the soul ring to stab my heart.

340
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
It's been a hundred years since I've been suppressed.

341
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,920
Ah Yue, is this hundred years of pain

342
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,920
that still makes you suffer?

343
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Pain is not something that can be stopped.

344
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,920
Fine. I really want to know how much hatred you have.

345
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,920
After you sealed me, you took the magic pill and attacked the Immortal Sect.

346
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,920
You became a traitor and led the Heavenly Envoy to be killed.

347
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
I've never seen the Heavenly Envoy to be killed.

348
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
It's not like I want to kill my immortal.

349
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,920
You know that. I've never wanted to kill you.

350
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,920
The Heavenly Envoy I wanted was just an explanation.

351
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,920
You took the body back and fought with your spirit.

352
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
I didn't do anything to you.

353
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Even if you didn't do anything to me, you should die.

354
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
I should die?

355
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,920
Do you think everything you did in the past is right?

356
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Everything is a blessing.

357
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Everything is a blessing.

358
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Everything is a blessing.

359
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Everything is a blessing.

360
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
The world is a great disaster.

361
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Even though there is a disaster,

362
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,920
why don't you think about it?

363
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,920
The world is full of light.

364
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Why did the disaster choose Wu Ju Mountain as the cave?

365
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,920
It was because Wu Ju Mountain is the place of its origin.

366
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,920
It was born and cultivated.

367
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,920
But people were dreaming and dying.

368
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,920
They were trying to kill the forest on Wu Ju Mountain.

369
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,920
From then on, the plants and plants on Wu Ju Mountain

370
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,920
were all dead.

371
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,920
And Han Long had to leave here

372
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,920
and find another place.

373
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
You have the heart of death.

374
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,920
You have killed Han Long before.

375
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
But people's lives are dead.

376
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
Isn't the life on Wu Ju Mountain

377
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,920
the life of the forest?

378
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,920
The cause of death is the body.

379
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,920
It's the blood source that can't be killed.

380
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,920
The blood source that can't be killed is the body.

381
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,920
The body is the body.

382
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,920
The body is the body.

383
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,920
The blood source is the body.

384
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Han Long can't represent the life on Wu Ju Mountain.

385
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Those people who died because of the disaster

386
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,920
are not the victims of the disaster.

387
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
You are the god.

388
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,920
You jumped out of the city and sacrificed your life.

389
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,920
But you never thought about it.

390
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,920
The cause of death is to make them suffer.

391
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,920
This is not the cause of death for them.

392
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,920
It's the disaster of the hopeless.

393
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,920
There are many troubles and troubles.

394
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
When the accident happened,

395
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,920
people were like a cat's blood.

396
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,920
They were born with a body.

397
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
The ancestors of the thunder were lost.

398
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,920
The gods were gone.

399
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,920
From then on,

400
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,920
people became devils and doctors.

401
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Since you are talking about the cause of death,

402
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
why do they only become good

403
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
and not suffer from evil?

404
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,920
If you are talking about the cause of death,

405
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
the cause of death is the cause of death.

406
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
I need to talk to you.

407
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,920
You said the cause of death is certain.

408
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Do you think I am the god?

409
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,920
I have been a servant for ten years.

410
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,920
I have dedicated my life to the god.

411
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,920
I have a lot of love for the god.

412
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,920
I am the cause of death.

413
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,920
I kill the people who are the victims of the disaster.

414
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,920
It's the fruit.

415
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,920
I have been a servant for ten years.

416
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,920
Why are you right?

417
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
I am wrong.

418
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
You are the god.

419
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,920
Your cause should not be with people.

420
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
You forgot that

421
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,920
the real Li Qingyue died

422
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
when he was killed 11 years ago.

423
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,920
I have used the god to enter his body.

424
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,920
I am also a mortal since then.

425
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,920
What about you?

426
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,920
Why do you and your cause

427
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,920
are always with me?

428
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,920
I thought you knew.

429
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Bai Jiusi,

430
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,920
have you ever suffered from the disaster?

431
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,920
You have never experienced the misfortune of a mortal.

432
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,920
You are not qualified to discuss with me.

433
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,920
You have been crazy for ten years.

434
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Today, I will make another ten years' wish with you.

435
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
See if you can do anything.

436
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
Do you dare?

437
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,920
Why not?

438
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
Okay.

439
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Don't regret it.

440
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Brother!

441
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Brother!

442
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
Brother!

443
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Brother!

444
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Brother, did you find the master?

445
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,920
The world is changing.

446
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,920
It's only the east.

447
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,920
I have checked the east with the spirit.

448
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,920
But I was blocked by the Great Water Tribe.

449
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,920
The Great Water Tribe?

450
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,920
What does that mean?

451
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,920
The water is cold and the ice is cold.

452
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,920
The master is in the water.

453
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,920
What should we do?

454
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Inform the four seas dragon tribe

455
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,920
to send out the water army.

456
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
We will do our best to find the master.

457
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,920
We must not let the immortal master stand in the way.

458
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,920
We must not let the immortal master stand in the way.

459
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,920
Puyuan, inform the all the disciples of the Cangli Hall.

460
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,920
We will stop the water from the east.

461
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,920
We must search carefully.

462
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,920
We must not let any corner of the river fall.

463
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,920
Don't worry, brother. I will go and arrange it.

464
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
Elder!

465
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Elder, there is a move in Cangli Hall.

466
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Where are they going?

467
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
They are going to the east.

468
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,920
We cannot know where they are going.

469
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Inform the all the disciples to go east.

470
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,920
We must find the master before we go to Cangli Hall.

471
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
Yes, master.

472
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Uncle.

473
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Qingyue used to be my disciple.

474
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,920
Although he hid me from the master in the past,

475
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,920
I still want to find him.

476
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,920
It's good that you are careful.

477
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Yes, uncle.

478
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,920
You have been crazy for ten years.

479
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,920
You cannot forget the power in ten years.

480
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,920
Once you are out of the forbidden place, you will suffer.

481
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,920
Qingze was injured and lost his body.

482
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,920
He was killed by the gods.

483
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,920
He is not well.

484
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Okay.

485
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,920
I will wait for you to lead me to the so-called world.

486
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,920
So,

487
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,920
am I a mortal now?

488
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,920
What is the so-called world?

489
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,920
Time is long.

490
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,920
You should understand it yourself.

491
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,920
Even if you are mortal, you should have a identity.

492
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,920
If someone asks about our relationship,

493
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,920
how should I be?

494
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,920
How about

495
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,920
we go back to the same old days?

496
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,920
How?

497
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,920
With you.

498
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,920
I don't understand the meaning of the word.

499
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,920
I don't understand the meaning of the word.

500
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,920
I don't understand the meaning of the word.

501
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,920
I don't understand the meaning of the word.

502
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,920
You are awake.

503
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,920
Come and have tea.

504
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
What are you doing?

505
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,920
I read a book last night.

506
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,920
It's called The Golden Bell.

507
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,920
It says that

508
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,920
the book says that

509
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,920
the bamboo is full of blood and blood

510
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,920
and the earth is full of flesh and grass.

511
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,920
The building is full of clothes and the house is full of clothes.

512
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,920
If you are lucky, you will be a great emperor.

513
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,920
Look at the scenery of the yard.

514
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
Compared to the one 400 years ago,

515
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,920
I built a 70-meter house for you.

516
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,920
It's not only one-star.

517
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,920
What?

518
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,920
You want to build another 70-meter house?

519
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,920
That's not necessary.

520
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,920
I just want to have a little rest.

521
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,920
Look.

522
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,920
I plan to put two more flowers here

523
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,920
and plant some flowers in the yard.

524
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,920
I want to have some fish in the pond

525
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,920
and put the whole yard in the powder brush.

526
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,920
Don't you like cooking?

527
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,920
I also plan to turn the kitchen a little bit.

528
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Do you think it's good?

529
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,920
I say, this old man,

530
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,920
how can a woman like to be on the stage?

531
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,920
If you really want to marry your wife,

532
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
you must accompany her to cook

533
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,920
instead of building a kitchen for her.

534
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,920
Let's go.

535
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,920
Pack up the things.

536
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Let's go.

537
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Brother, it's done.

538
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Master, we can finish the rest of the work tomorrow.

539
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
So we'll go back today.

540
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Where are we going?

541
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Let's go.

542
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,920
Let's go.

543
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,920
Let's go.

544
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,920
Are you the new neighbor?

545
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,920
My name is Lin Fan. I live next door.

546
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,920
My wife made some cakes.

547
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
I'll bring them to you.

548
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Thank you.

549
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
You're welcome.

550
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Why are you being so polite?

551
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,920
I'm looking for something to eat.

552
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,920
I'm hungry.

553
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,920
You're a neighbor now.

554
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Tell me your name.

555
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
Bai Jiu Si.

556
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
Bai Jiu Si?

557
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,920
I'll put this here.

558
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,920
Remember to eat.

559
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,920
Goodbye.

560
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Remember to eat.

561
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,920
You're back.

562
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
What are you cooking today?

563
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,920
It smells so good.

564
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,920
I'll help you.

565
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
I'll go get it.

566
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,920
Where's mine?

567
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Didn't you say you'd experience the pain?

568
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
Then you can do it yourself.

569
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,920
I'll go get it.

570
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
Take care.

571
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
Sir, what do you want to eat?

572
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
I'll go get it.

573
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
Wait a minute.

574
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,920
The food will be ready soon.

575
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,920
Kong Xiu Cai, you're much more crispy than before.

576
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
You can't just eat the white cake and soak it.

577
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
You have to eat something good.

578
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,920
Can you make it?

579
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,920
Yes.

580
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,920
Kong Xiu Cai is so good at this.

581
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,920
He's doing it for the sake of his back.

582
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,920
If you do this, I think you'll be able to make it this year.

583
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,920
I'll be grateful.

584
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
I'll leave first.

585
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,920
Goodbye.

586
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,920
Goodbye.

587
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,920
Sir Lin, Miss Lin, don't be so rude.

588
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,920
Eat well.

589
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,920
Mr. Lin, you're here.

590
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,920
Mr. Lin, you're here.

591
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,920
Mr. Lin, have a good sleep.

592
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,920
Mr. Lin, come to the restaurant again.

593
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
Yes.

594
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
I'll give you a good old look.

595
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,920
Okay.

596
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,920
Please.

597
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Kong Xiu Cai is here too.

598
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Mr. Lin is here.

599
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
Have a seat.

600
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
Bai Xiong.

601
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,920
Miss.

602
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,920
This is the one I often mention to you.

603
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Our neighbor, Bai Xiong.

604
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,920
This is my wife.

605
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
Everyone.

606
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,920
This is our new neighbor.

607
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,920
Please take care of him.

608
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,920
Thank you.

609
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,920
Thank you.

610
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,920
Bai Xiong, I heard that your wife and you live together.

611
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,920
Why are you here alone?

612
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Did you have a fight?

613
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,920
This is your team.

614
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,920
A man and a husband.

615
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,920
How can you let your wife go?

616
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,920
Or I'll teach you a lesson.

617
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,920
No matter how big your mistake is,

618
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,920
I'll make sure your wife is happy.

619
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,920
Hong.

620
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Look.

621
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,920
Have a seat.

622
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,920
Come on.

623
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
Bai Xiong.

624
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,920
Just like this.

625
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,920
If you care about your wife all the time,

626
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,920
how can she be angry with you?

627
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,920
Bai Xiong.

628
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,920
