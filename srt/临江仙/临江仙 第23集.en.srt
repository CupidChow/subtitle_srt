[Episode 23]

3
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,680
And then?

4
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,509
Years flew by after that,

5
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,810
and somehow we started fighting.

6
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,550
We'd fight every time we met.

7
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
But that was fine.

8
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,010
At least it let me
see him from time to time.

9
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,360
I thought

10
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,760
we would keep fighting like this forever.

11
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,520
Until one day,
he suddenly invited me to go

12
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,840
be a couple with him in the mortal realm

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,660
to pass the love tribulation.

14
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,600
I played it cool on the surface,

15
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,829
yet I was actually exhilarated.

16
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,360
We spent a hundred years together
in the mortal realm.

17
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,850
Despite occasional quarrels and fights,

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,870
those were my happiest days.

19
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,400
I even prayed deep down inside,

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
hoping that we would never
pass this love tribulation

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
so as to live together forever.

22
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,310
But later...

23
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,590
Later, he fell in love with someone else

24
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,680
and abandoned you.

25
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,310
Then you swore to kill him for vengeance.

26
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,080
Am I right?

27
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,030
Go on.

28
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,590
Please continue.

29
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,960
Since birth,
I've had a soft spot for mortals.

30
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,280
But he was born aloof,

31
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,120
more like a god compared to me.

32
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,800
Lofty, indifferent, and solitary,

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,740
detached from the masses.

34
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,250
Later, because of an incident,

35
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,079
he sealed my power

36
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,880
and left me in the mortal realm.

37
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,950
Not until then did I realize that

38
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,390
I was the only one who had fallen in love.

39
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,120
He spent all that time with me
just to pass the tribulation—

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,150
nothing more.

41
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,630
You can travel through time and space
in the Three Realms.

42
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,830
Of course I can since I'm in charge
of the rising and setting

43
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,760
of the sun and moon,
the calendar of heaven and earth.

44
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,480
The universe is boundless,
unlike the Three Realms.

45
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,310
From primordial essence comes matter;
from matter comes space;

46
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,680
from space comes time;
from time comes everything.

47
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,430
I am the God of the Sun,

48
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,750
the Mother of Time.

49
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,760
Then can you change the past and future?

50
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,250
Everything in the world,
karma, and reincarnation

51
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,159
are all under your control.

52
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,040
Do you know

53
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,430
something is immutable in the cosmos?

54
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,920
The sun rises in the east
and sets in the west;

55
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,870
plants flourish in summer
and wither in autumn;

56
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,360
karma and reincarnation
occur in their own way.

57
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,800
I can travel through time and space
in the Three Realms,

58
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,560
holding sway over
the sun, moon, and stars,

59
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,070
but I'm merely a witness

60
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,270
of the long history.

61
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,690
Because all things in the world,
karma, and reincarnation

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,260
take their own course.

63
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,040
Then how can I see

64
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,720
the past that I wish to see?

65
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,120
Bai Jiusi, your real karma is here.

66
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,920
This is the past,

67
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,630
the ten years when you left your wife
in the mortal realm.

68
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,390
You don't belong to this time and space.

69
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,270
But you can see

70
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,730
the people and events
of this time and space.

71
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,920
However, they can't see or hear you.

72
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,830
Bai Jiusi...

73
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,870
You're such a bastard!

74
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,920
Master!

75
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,690
It's been three months.

76
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,310
You really can't drink anymore.

77
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,560
Why can't I?

78
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,659
Because...

79
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,430
Your mortal realm's alcohol

80
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,390
is really something great.

81
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,310
Master.

82
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,160

84
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,870
Master!

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
He left.

86
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,750
He abandoned me.

87
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,390

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,600
Okay.

91
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
You should quit drinking from now on.

92
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,540
If you keep this up,

93
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,130
you will be totally wrecked

94
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,400
even though you're an immortal.

95
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,760
Your wife is pregnant, you know?

96
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,670
What?

97
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,930
She's four months pregnant.
You don't know that?

98
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,480
What did you say?

99
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,910
You're already four months pregnant.

100
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,110
None of you knew that?

101
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,790
You're too careless.

102

Yeah.

104
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,850
I want to continue.

105
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,070
You're almost there!

106
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,080
I can see the head! Just need a push.

107
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,670
There we go! The baby's out!

108

Don't cry, don't cry.

Congratulations, it's a boy.

Master, it's a boy.

114
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,970
He doesn't have a name yet.

115
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,440
Let's call him Shi'an.

116
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,750
My mom thinks so too.

117
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,910
She also entrusted
a fortune-teller in the north of the city

118
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,320
to get me a new name—

119
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,390
Lin Shi'an.

120
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,200
She said it means "peace across the land."

121
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,600
-Don't cry.
-I'll go get you some food.

122
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,960
Meet your mother.

123
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:48,910
Come on.

124

Don't cry, good boy.

126

Don't cry, Shi'an.

127
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,630
Uncle Bai, did you see
my bamboo dragonfly?

128
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,600
I just let go,

129
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,460
and it disappeared with a whoosh.

Who allowed you to play here?

135
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,550
I do have a dad!

136
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,790
Don't let him go! Stop him!

137
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,510
Stop him there!

138
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,040
How dare you try to run away?

139
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,400
Where's your father?

140
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,960
My father is up in heaven!

141
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,330
So he's dead, huh?

142
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,490
Says you! My father isn't dead!

143
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,480
Look, this is my dad.

144
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,720
Do not ever call me

145
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,080
a fatherless brat again!

146
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,360
I do have a dad!

147
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,080
You can find all the truths in the past.

148
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,150
Although you were born a god,

149
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,960
you cannot see all the truths.

150
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,120
My dad is not dead!

151
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,150
He's not!

152

Want to keep watching?

153
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,360
Continue.

154
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,000
I want to know the whole story.

155
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,910
The world moves in a grand cycle
of ten thousand years.

156
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,550
Plagues and wars

157
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,450
are common in the mortal realm.

158
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,270
This family's awash with money and food!

159
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,510
Everyone, if you don't want to starve,
join me in looting!

160
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,750
Yeah! Let's loot!

161
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,920
Come on, loot!

Open the door! Ram it!

-Harder!
-Open the door!

164
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,480
Mother, I'm so scared.

165
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,720
They're unbelievably rampant.

166
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,250
Master, I'll go fight them!

167
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,550
We're outnumbered.
Better not pick a fight.

168
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,670
Let them plunder as they wish.

169
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,400
Let's leave.

170
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,240

Open the door!

172
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,800
Be careful, Master.

173
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:35,970
Master.

174
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,440
Let's go!

175
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,080
Master, you go first.

176
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,370
Let's go.

177
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,650
Stop there! Don't come any closer!

178
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,360
Stop!

179
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,240
What are you doing? Back off!

180
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
He's alone! Charge through! Ignore him!

181
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,720
Ignore him.

182
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,310
Go wait for me at the gate.

183
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,240
I'll go save him.

184
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,270
Go!

185
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,160
Go to hell!

186
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,069
Stop hitting!

187
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:18,880
Go away!

188
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,680
Stop hitting!

189
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,069
Where is the food? Hand it over!

190
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,880
Guys! Let's go to the back
and grab the food! Hurry!

191
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,510
Mother!

192
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:28,960
Shi'an!

193
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,920
Mother!

194
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,550
Master?

195
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,830
Master!

196
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,310
Master!

197
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,480
Master, you're awake.

198
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,240
How do you feel?

199
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,090
I'll go get you the med.

200
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,750
It's okay.

201
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,400
Shi'an.

202
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,110
Shi'an?

203
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,310
Shi'an.

204
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,880
He's having a fever.
I'll go get him some meds.

205
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,440
Shi'an.

206
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,680
Shi'an.

207
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,400
Shi'an?

208
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,480
Shi'an!

209
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,790
Master, Master.

210
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,930
Here you are.

211
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,110
You hold him, and I'll feed him.

212
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,590
Okay.

213
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,270
Come on, Shi'an.

214
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:42,810
Shi'an.

215
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,880
Shi'an, take it.

216
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,330
It's the medicine.

217
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,160
Shi'an.

218
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,250
Master, he's not drinking.

219
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,630
Let me try.

220
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,960
Shi'an, take this medicine,

221
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,240
and I will take you to fly a kite.

222
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:02,960
Okay?

223
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:04,960
Come on.

224
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,400
Shi'an, I can't live without you.

225
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,070
Take the medicine.

226
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,480
Come on.

227
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,010
Good! He's drinking it!

Why is his fever still not going down?

Master, calm down.

I'll go get other prescriptions.

Wake up.

Don't scare me.

Where's Uncle Changqin?

257
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,010
He went to buy you medicine.

258
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,200
Mother, I'm feeling terrible.

259
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,240
Mother, Uncle Changqin said
you're a goddess from heaven.

260
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,720
You used to live in heaven, right?

261
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,480
Yes.

262
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,000
Is it beautiful up there?

263
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,850
It's beautiful.

264
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,350
Up there in heaven,

265
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,440
it's the closest to the sun.

266
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,000
At sunrise,

267
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,680
the clouds are bathed in sunlight,

268
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,310
looking like clumps of golden malt sugar.

269
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,400
Mother, if immortals get really hungry,

270
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,030
do they eat the clouds in the sky?

271
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,170
No, they don't.

272
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:13,400
There are assorted
delicious divine fruits in heaven,

273
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,350
and desserts too.

274
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,590
Besides, immortals have
spiritual energy to back them up.

275
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,850
They don't get hungry.

276
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,070
Then immortals
don't get sick either, right?

277
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,720
Yeah, immortals don't get sick.

278
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,920
Mother, is Father an immortal too?

279
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,440
He's the most powerful immortal
in the Nine Heavens.

280
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,440
Mother, if both you
and Father are immortals,

281
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,400
why don't I have spiritual energy?

282
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,350
Why do I get sick?

283
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,750
Why can't I protect you?

284
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,200
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

285
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,110
When I was pregnant with you,

286
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,830
my power was sealed.

287
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,470
You couldn't absorb any spiritual energy.

288
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,160
So you're no different
from ordinary children.

289
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,160
But it's okay.

290
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,450
Just wait three more years.

291
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,640
In three years, I'll have my power back.

292
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,610
I'll take you back to the Nine Heavens.

293
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,240
You can enjoy divine fruits
and miraculous medicine.

294
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,680
I'll teach you
immortal power and techniques.

295
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,240
And just like me,

296
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,000
you won't get hungry, die,

297
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,830
or get sick anymore.

298
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,830
Everything sounds awesome
in the Nine Heavens.

299
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,510
Mother, please go back

300
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,400
to heaven after I die.

301
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,790
I don't want you to suffer anymore.

302
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,550
