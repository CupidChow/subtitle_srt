00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,040

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,040
I'm not sure if I can make it.

00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,040
I'm not sure if I can make it.

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,040
I'm not sure if I can make it.

I'm not sure if I can make it.

I'm not sure if I can make it.

I'm not sure if I can make it.

I'm not sure if I can make it.

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,040
I'm not sure if I can make it.

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Episode 19

56
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Why are you the one who closed the door?

57
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Those first time I went to the Sky of Nine Heavens.

58
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,040
I'm so excited.

59
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,040
It's okay if you don't want to.

60
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
Go back and rest.

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Tomorrow is a bad day.

62
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Qingyue.

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Qulong.

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
I'll see you tomorrow.

65
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,040
I won't let you go to lectures with me.

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
Zna.

67
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Say hello to the grandsons.

68
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
I'll ask them.

69
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,040
ZA horn could thevoy make up environment for free in spring?

70
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Rui.

71
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,580
I should turn on your

72
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,580
I have been in the Wenxuan Palace for thousands of years.

73
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,580
I have seen the couple and the brothers.

74
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,580
I have never seen the whole gate of the Zou Sect.

75
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,580
You all have great powers and are very responsible.

76
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,580
It's been a thousand years since I created this.

77
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,580
Congratulations.

78
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,800
The

79
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,580
Immortal Sect will begin.

80
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,580
How do you call me?

81
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,580
Don't go in first.

82
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,580
Why?

83
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,580
We are not here to be the Immortal Sect.

84
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,580
Why did the Immortal Sect come to the Nine Heavens?

85
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,580
To kill people.

86
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,580
But there is no one in the Nine Heavens.

87
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,580
There is only Immortal.

88
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,580
That is the Immortal.

89
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,580
Senior Brother,

90
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,580
the Immortal Sect just said that you killed the Elder Qingyang of the Jinyun Sect.

91
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,580
What happened?

92
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,580
It must have been a mistake.

93
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,580
It must have been a warning to me to kill me.

94
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,580
It must have been a warning to me to kill me.

95
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,580
It was a miscarriage to me.

96
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,580
But why did the Immortal Sect use this method?

97
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,580
What?

98
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,580
You believe in it but not me?

99
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,580
I am thinking

100
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,580
if there is any misunderstanding.

101
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,580
I am a bright and bright dragon.

102
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,580
I am a person who does things and does things.

103
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,580
I never did anything.

104
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,580
I don't want to be in trouble.

105
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,580
Tomorrow,

106
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,580
I will kill the Immortal Sect

107
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,580
by killing him.

108
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,580
I will not be the Immortal Sect.

109
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,580
Don't worry, Senior Brother Longyan.

110
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,580
We will not let you fight alone.

111
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,580
We are willing to live together.

112
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,580
We are willing to live together.

113
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,580
We are willing to live together.

114
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,580
I will be back soon.

115
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,580
Where is Fan Jiaojiao?

116
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,580
Immortal Fan has gone to pick up his daughter.

117
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,580
Senior Brother Longyan,

118
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,580
the Immortal Sect has come.

119
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,580
They said they will take Immortal Fan away.

120
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,580
I...

121
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,580
I...

122
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,580
Immortal Sect asked me to pick up Miss Ling'er back.

123
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,580
Master.

124
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,580
Yes.

125
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,580
He has already given Ling'er the poison of Yan Hua.

126
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,580
I should have guessed

127
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,580
he would not come to pick her up personally.

128
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,580
Immortal Fan is really suffering.

129
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,580
I hope that he wakes up one day

130
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,580
and doesn't want me to send him back to his father.

131
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,580
Yes.

132
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,580
I will not let him go.

133
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,580
I have to go.

134
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,580
I will go.

135
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,580
I will go.

136
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,580
I will go to pick him up.

137
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,580
Master,

138
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,580
it is also a choice for his safety.

139
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,580
Ling'er,

140
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,580
don't blame me.

141
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,580
Only by doing this

142
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,580
can you stay here forever.

143
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,580
Don't mess things up.

144
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,580
Immortal,

145
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,580
if Miss Ling'er wakes up,

146
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,580
she will hate you completely.

147
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,580
She didn't have much affection for me.

148
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,580
I don't have much affection for her.

149
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,580
I am protecting her.

150
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,580
You are getting more and more annoying.

151
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,580
You are not only coming in.

152
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,580
Before going in,

153
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,580
you still have questions to answer me.

154
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,580
What questions?

155
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,580
Tomorrow,

156
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,580
I will have to fight.

157
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,580
What do you think?

158
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,580
What else can we do

159
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,580
for the sake of the money?

160
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,580
I don't know.

161
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,580
I don't know.

162
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
Although I don't like

163
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,580
people like Bai Jiu-si and Cang Lei-dian,

164
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,580
I still have questions.

165
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,580
Do you really think

166
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,580
Uncle Qingyang was killed by Long Yuan?

167
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,580
Who else can he be?

168
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,580
You have this trick.

169
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,580
You should rest.

170
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,580
I will kill you.

171
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,580
Absolutely.

172
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,580
It hurts.

173
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,580
Really?

174
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,580
Don't believe me.

175
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,580
Junior, I will do it myself.

176
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,580
How is it?

177
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,580
How is it?

178
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,580
Xian Zong is back.

179
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,580
Xian Zong is back.

180
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,580
Xian Zong is back.

181
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,580
I am sorry.

182
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,580
I am sorry, Senior.

183
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,580
I am sorry, Son.

184
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,580
Master.

185
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,580
This time,

186
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,580
the four spirits are going to attack the gate.

187
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,580
They want to revenge.

188
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,580
I was in a fight last time.

189
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,580
With my sword,

190
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,580
I shouldn't have let you go last time.

191
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,580
Master, you are looking at me like this.

192
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,580
Do you really believe

193
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,580
the four spirits

194
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,580
that I made up for you?

195
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,580
Master.

196
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,580
Before Long Yuan,

197
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,580
although Xian Zong is a little bit aggressive,

198
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,580
he shouldn't have killed me.

199
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,580
I think there is some misunderstanding.

200
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,580
Since Master is back,

201
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,580
why don't you ask the four spirits

202
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,580
to come and talk to him?

203
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,580
No need.

204
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,580
What you mean is...

205
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,580
Tomorrow, we will open the barrier

206
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,580
and let them in.

207
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,580
Master, you have thought it through.

208
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,580
Tomorrow, I will be the first to

209
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,580
resist the fire again.

210
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,080
The guns stores' equipment

211
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,580
should be changed.

212
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,580
I will give it up for you to see.

213
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,760
You are awake, Ling'er.

214
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,700
Adjust the rhythm

215
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,180
Your head's action is fading

216
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,680
Failed

217
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,020
This minute

218
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,980
What did you do to me?

219
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,460
Where's my spirit power?

220
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,880
What on earth did you do to me?

221
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,640
Liao'er

222
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,020
You should stop using this bad gadget

223
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,140
You're one of us who has no power

224
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,160
To get away from it

225
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,160
I just wasted your cultivation.

226
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Let me tell you something.

227
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
I'm not in danger.

228
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,160
You've wasted my 200 years of cultivation.

229
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
It's okay. Don't worry.

230
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
Although your cultivation is gone,

231
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,160
you still can't get used to it.

232
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
I'll protect you well.

233
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,160
You won't be in danger.

234
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Si Ling will be here soon.

235
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
I'll go help Master.

236
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
I won't be with you.

237
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
You can find a way.

238
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Stop right there!

239
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
After we leave,

240
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,160
we'll lead the other disciples to open the Hushan Formation.

241
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
We'll be able to get rid of the birds.

242
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
The tree is not close.

243
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Yes, Master.

244
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
You guys stay in the sect.

245
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
No matter how difficult it is,

246
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
I'll be there for you.

247
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
I'll be there for you.

248
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
I'll go with you.

249
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
You three stay here.

250
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
Master.

251
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,160
You can listen to me.

252
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Yes.

253
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
Jiang Bian.

254
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Where are you?

255
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
You stay and guard the gate.

256
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Yes, Master.

257
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Master, be careful.

258
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
Time's up.

259
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
Let's go.

260
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Let's go, Master.

261
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Master.

262
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Master.

263
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Master.

264
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Master.

265
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Master.

266
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Master.

267
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Master.

268
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Master.

269
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
Master.

270
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Master.

271
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Master.

272
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Master.

273
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Master.

274
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Master.

275
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
Master.

276
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Master.

277
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
Master.

278
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Master.

279
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Master.

280
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Master.

281
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Master.

282
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Master.

283
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
Master.

284
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Master.

285
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Master.

286
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Master.

287
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
Master.

288
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Master.

289
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
trump card.

290
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,160
For charge,

291
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Why it is you one person?

292
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Did you hide anyone?

293
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,100
Feng Nian Palace used to

294
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,000
show Sieges of Waterflowing Flames during this battle.

295
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
Grandson for him,

296
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,160
please say something for him.

297
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
Bai Jiu Si, back.

298
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
What did you tell her?

299
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
I'm here to fight.

300
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
As long as you come here as a phoenix,

301
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,660
I will make sure you are satisfied.

302
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,660
Could it be that he wants to send out the dragon's handkerchief?

303
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,660
You will know when you go there.

304
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,660
Okay. I will see what the White-Haired Manor can do.

305
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,160
Master is thinking about something.

306
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Let's follow him.

307
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,160
I will take care of him.

308
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
I will take care of him.

309
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
I will take care of him.

310
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I will take care of him.

311
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
I will take care of him.

312
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
I will take care of him.

313
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
I will take care of him.

314
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
I will take care of him.

315
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
I will take care of him.

316
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
I will take care of him.

317
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
I will take care of him.

318
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
I will take care of him.

319
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
I will take care of him.

320
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
I will take care of him.

321
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
I will take care of him.

322
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
I will take your Dai Sui.

323
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:30,400
Sister Dan

324
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,160
I don't know what's wrong with Senior.

325
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
He is just being like this all the time.

326
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,360
I heard that they sent people to take Sailing with Feng Nian.

327
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,160
It doesn't look like they're going to start a war. It looks like they're going to win.

328
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,360
Could it be that they really want to push Brother Long Yuan out to be a compensation?

329
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
I don't think so.

330
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,360
Did you see the sword on the table?

331
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,360
That sword is the Seven Moon Sword. It's not different from the one on the Sailing's hand.

332
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,360
After ten thousand years of practice, this sword can open the sky and set the ground, and the gods and the gods are the first to appear.

333
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
It's also created by the Ten Thousand Years of Han.

334
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,360
The firepower of the Sailing is very similar to the one of the Heavenly Life.

335
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,360
I think that the decoration of Zhang Deng Jie Cai is just to relax the Sailing's spirit.

336
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,360
I'm afraid that it's a fierce battle.

337
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Okay, I'll see when the Sailing can be destroyed.

338
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,560
The Black Dart

339
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,360
There are once more girls appearing above us, I think.

340
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
How do we do that?

341
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,360
Hey, where's that girl? If it's you, come down!

342
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,420
Dangnuts?!

343
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,320
Finish him!

344
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,200
I'm defeated, no matterize how!

345
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,320
You're the reason why your sword was so strong!

346
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,400
We've won exactly, we've won exactly!

347
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,240
Now death, death!

348
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:38,040
Huang El remote park

349
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Now we have to charter 40 restaurants

350
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,960
Don't move!

351
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,720
No.

352
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,040
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

353
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,040
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

354
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,040
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

355
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:37,040
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

356
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,040
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

357
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,040
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

358
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,040
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

359
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,040
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

360
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Let's go to the mouth.

361
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,040
It's troublesome.

362
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Master, could you get hurt?

363
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,040
I'll ask Shichong to bring me another one.

364
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
No need.

365
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
I don't need it.

366
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
I'll go directly.

367
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,040
The Immortal Immortal is here.

368
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
The Immortal Immortal is here.

369
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
The Immortal Immortal is here.

370
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
You're here.

371
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
The Immortal Immortal is here.

372
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
I've been waiting for this for so long.

373
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
I finally got to see you.

374
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
How dare you say that to my grandson?

375
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Bai Jiu Si.

376
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,040
What are you doing again?

377
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
I was marrying you last time.

378
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
I didn't get married.

379
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,040
I regret it.

380
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,040
It's a rare opportunity to make up for you.

381
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Look.

382
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
I'm so happy today.

383
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Do I look like

384
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
I've prepared a wedding for you?

385
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,040
Stop wasting your time.

386
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Are you trying to protect Long Yuan?

387
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Don't worry.

388
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
I'll make you happy.

389
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
Yuan.

390
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Your red dress is really beautiful.

391
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
It turns out

392
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
we've become three families.

393
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,040
The temple of the Immortal Immortal

394
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,040
and the temple of the Immortal Immortal

395
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
and the temple of the Immortal Immortal

396
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
but

397
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
I can't take care of it.

398
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
I'm really sorry.

399
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Stop talking nonsense.

400
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
I'll ask you

401
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,040
if you'll give Long Yuan's life.

402
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Long Yuan.

403
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Come here.

404
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
Long Yuan.

405
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
I want you to get up.

406
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
No matter what happens in the future,

407
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
you can't let A-Yun

408
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
and the people of Jingyun Sect

409
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
do anything.

410
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
If you die

411
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
in this situation,

412
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
you can't get up.

413
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,040
It seems you've decided to protect him.

414
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
I'll kill you.

415
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
I swear

416
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
I'll say it one last time.

417
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
I swear.

418
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
I

419
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
Long Yuan

420
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
will die here.

421
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
No matter what happens in the future,

422
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
I'll hurt anyone in the temple

423
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
and the people of Jingyun Sect.

424
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,040
If this happens,

425
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
I'll kill you.

426
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
It's good.

427
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Go back.

428
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Bai Jiu Si.

429
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
Since you've made your decision,

430
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
what are you waiting for?

431
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Shoot.

432
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
What are you doing?

433
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
I've said it before.

434
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Just one life is enough.

435
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
I'll pay for

436
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
your master's life.

437
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Master.

438
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Master.

439
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Master.

440
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Master.

441
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Master.

442
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Master.

443
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
Don't move.

444
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Master.

445
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
I'll kill you.

446
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
I'll kill you.

447
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Yu.

448
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
I'm really sorry.

449
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,040
Master.

450
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
Master.

451
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Master.

452
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
Master.

453
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
Master.

454
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Master.

455
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Master.

456
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
Master.

457
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Master.

458
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Master.

459
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Master.

460
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Master.

461
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Master.

462
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Master.

463
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Master.

464
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Master!

465
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Lianzhen!

466
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Master!

467
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Master!

468
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Zhangsun, what are you doing?

469
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Master!

470
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,040
Master, what's wrong?

471
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Master, what's wrong?

472
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
Listen to me!

473
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Zhangsun!

474
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Yes, master!

475
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Master!

476
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,040
You!

477
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Master!

478
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,040
Mr. Jiuyun has gone to the valley.

479
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
Let them go.

480
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Master!

481
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
Master!

482
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Master!

483
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Master!

484
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,040
He's in a dangerous situation.

485
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
Follow him!

486
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
Yes, master!

487
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
Master!

488
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
The sword is back!

489
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
You're still alive?

490
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
You're still alive?

491
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
You just did a trick to trick me.

492
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,040
You're just a little mouse after the people.

493
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
You're not acting.

494
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
How dare you show your face?

495
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
I didn't expect that.

496
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused.

497
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused.

498
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,040
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused.

499
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,040
I'm now your assistant in the front.

500
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,040
It seems you know a lot about our past.

501
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,040
In order to deal with me,

502
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
you set up such a big battle.

503
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,040
I have to cooperate with you.

504
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,040
Come on.

505
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
Just kill or kill.

506
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
Just do as you please.

507
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Okay.

508
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,040
You can leave Zhang San first.

509
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,040
We should talk about it.

510
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,040
Xiao Jing Shan.

511
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,040
You dare to come?

512
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
I went to investigate some old things.

513
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,040
Sorry for the delay.

514
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
What old things?

515
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,040
I went to see the time god Xie E.

516
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,040
I knew everything about the past.

517
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
I don't care what you found out.

518
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,040
I just know that my master is dead.

519
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,040
It's not what Long Yuan did.

520
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
I know.

521
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
Bai Jiu Si.

522
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
Let's put the N-yue first.

523
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
I have something more important to tell you.

524
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,040
I used the Great Huang Cup in Su He.

525
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,040
Do you remember that you saw Zhang San?

526
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
Yes.

527
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
The Great Huang Cup is my master.

528
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
Without my birthday,

529
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,040
no one can enter or break the illusion created by him.

530
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,040
Unless...

531
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,040
Unless he is the master of the Great Huang Cup.

532
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Because he is the master of the Fairy Qi.

533
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,040
He will never be the master of the Great Huang Cup.

534
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
I helped you repair the N-yue.

535
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
I have read a lot of books about the N-yue.

536
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,040
So what is Zhang San's origin?

537
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,040
I saw Zhang San in the N-yue.

538
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,040
He is fine.

539
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,040
The problem is that when he went to the Sky of Nine Heavens,

540
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,040
I met someone.

541
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,040
He passed all the techniques to him when he was about to die.

542
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Who is it?

543
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,040
It's your old acquaintance, Xiao Jing Shan.

544
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
I remember him.

545
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
He is the most talented repairman in the world.

546
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
He has the skill of the Mountain Train.

547
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,040
After the N-yue was reborn,

548
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,040
he was caught by me because he destroyed the N-yue many times.

549
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
He gave it to the Angelic Stone.

550
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
Then he was locked on the Sky of Nine Heavens.

551
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,040
Why did he destroy the N-yue?

552
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
The real reason is unknown.

553
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,040
It seems that the problem is here.

554
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,040
You protect the N-yue.

555
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
He wants to destroy the N-yue.

556
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,040
That's why he used me to deal with your moves.

557
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
I'm afraid that's not the only reason.

558
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
He wanted to destroy the N-yue many times.

559
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
But N-yue didn't die.

560
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
Because he wanted to destroy the N-yue,

561
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,040
he had to use the Holy Sword.

562
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,040
The Sword of the Moon and the Sword of the Moon?

563
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
That's right.

564
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,040
Actually, I came here today for this.

565
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
Where?

566
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
I was here when the water level was quite low.

567
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,420
Hard Twitter

568
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,580
I returned to the M goals for this,

569
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,360
and noticed that two people's lives

570
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,420
disappeared so fast.

571
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,040
I heard through the data

572
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,840
there's a photo of the two doesn't seem to hit anyone.

573
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,840
Is

574
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,360
things out for them.

575
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,620
By the way,

576
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,300
you and I fight with the back of the base.

577
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,420
There must have been some kind of a push and release.

578
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,660
That's because

579
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,580
I was the one who broke it.

580
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,040
She has not been able to kill me today.

581
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:44,900
If the person behind usaint us then we should

582
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,440
let쪽에 to be killed by you and your life,

583
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,320
I expect you alone.

584
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,480
I only have one request.

585
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,840
I wear red clothes.

586
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,840
Bai Jiu Si,

587
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,840
you and I have no relationship.

588
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,840
Shi An, Meng Chang Qian, my master,

589
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,840
these people are all dying because of you.

590
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,840
But this is a matter of time.

591
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
You and I are in the same boat.

592
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840
Someone is using me to deal with Bai Jiu Si.

593
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,840
It's impossible to change the bad.

594
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,840
I brought the gate to the world today

595
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
to get the person behind me.

596
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,840
I'm standing in front of you.

597
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,840
Who else do you want to see?

598
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,840
You drew the record of the fairy in front of me, right?

599
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,840
You still dare to show your face in this way.

600
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,840
No wonder you were so brave to hide behind me

601
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,840
and set up hundreds of people.

602
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
I've been deceived for hundreds of years.

603
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,840
You are so stupid.

604
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,840
I'm sorry.

605
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,840
I'm sorry.

606
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,840
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

616
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
I'm sorry.

617
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,840
I'm sorry.

618
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,840
Hello?

619
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,840
Hello?

620
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,840
You are so stupid.

621
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,840
I'm sorry.

622
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,840
I'm sorry.

623
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,840
Please.

624
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
Please.

625
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,840
Please.

626
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,840
Please.

627
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,840
Please.

628
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,840
Please.

629
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:28,520
Tears fall through my sugar cane

630
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:35,640
Seeing yesterday again, I'm台嶽系

00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,840
Loved with hazy premiere, and masseurhop

632
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:48,020
The hidden darkness in the world

633
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:55,740
scrape the atomized sea

634
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,820
I look at you

635
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,840
wearing an underwear

636
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,500
evil eyes

637
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,300
In the wind

638
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:23,300
Tell me, where are you?

639
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:30,300
I want to cry, I still want to laugh at you
