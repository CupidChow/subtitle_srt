1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,440
To.

2
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,040
I love you more than you

3
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,420
The thought of flowers

4
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,440
start

5
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:58,200
the department

6
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,440
I've been through this for many years.

7
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,440
We fought without any reason.

8
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,440
We fought as soon as we met.

9
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,440
But it's good that I can at least meet him.

10
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,440
I thought we would fight like this.

11
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,440
But one day, he suddenly told me

12
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,440
he wanted to be a couple with me and be together.

13
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,440
I didn't care about him.

14
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,440
I was happy.

15
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,440
We spent hundreds of years in the mortal world.

16
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,440
Although we fought half-naked,

17
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
it was my happiest day.

18
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
I even prayed in my heart.

19
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,440
I hoped we could never cross this barrier.

20
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,440
We could be together forever.

21
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
But then...

22
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,440
Later, he fell in love with someone else and abandoned you.

23
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
You wanted to kill him and revenge him.

24
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Isn't that right?

25
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,440
You can continue.

26
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,440
I've been a kind person since I was born.

27
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
But he's a kind person.

28
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,440
He's more like a god than me.

29
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,440
He's a kind person.

30
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
He's a kind person.

31
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,440
He's cold-hearted.

32
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,440
He's a kind person.

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
Later, because of one thing,

34
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,440
he sealed my power and left me in the mortal world.

35
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,440
I only found out that I was the only one who was heartbroken.

36
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,440
He was with me just to make me feel better.

37
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,440
I was the only one who was heartbroken.

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,440
I was the only one who was heartbroken.

39
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,440
I was the only one who was heartbroken.

40
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,440
I was the only one who was heartbroken.

41
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,440
I was the only one who was heartbroken.

42
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,440
I was the only one who was heartbroken.

43
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,440
I was the only one who was heartbroken.

44
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,440
I was the only one who was heartbroken.

45
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,440
I was the only one who was heartbroken.

46
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,440
I was one person who was heartbroken.

47
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,440
I was the only one who was heartbroken.

48
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,440
I was heartbroken.

49
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,440
I was heartbroken.

50
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,440
There's one thing that most people do.

51
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,440
Don't be at this time to mean much.

52
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,440
There is one thing that makes me feel better.

53
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,440
There is one more heavenly joy.

54
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,440
I am the god of jade, the Time of Time.

55
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,440
Then can you change the past and the future?

56
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Time and Time, the cycle of the UK, are in your hands.

57
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Do you know that there are some things in the world that cannot be changed?

58
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,440
The sun rises and sets, the grass and the trees are falling, the UK and the cycle of the UK are in your hands.

59
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,440
I can be in the space of the three realms, and the moon is in the stars.

60
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,440
But I can be a observer in the time of the long river.

61
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Because there is nothing in the world that can be changed.

62
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Then how can I see the past that I want to see?

63
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,440
Definitely, in your hands.

64
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Bai Jiu Su, the real UK is here.

65
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,680
No!

66
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,440
There's nothing in the sky for you.

67
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,000
What will you do withoutwater?

68
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,460
Are you trying to dodge it?

69
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,380
Ah...

70
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,020
Right, it's nothing.

71
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,020
Just wait and see what matters.

72
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,020
It's nothing.

73
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,920
Big Boss...

74
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,920
But you can see the people and things of this time and space.

75
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,920
But they can't see you, and they can't hear you.

76
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,280
Shen Mian Addict

77
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,120
Amanda

78
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,720
Jun Seo

79
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,880
You piece of art

80
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,800
Hear exactly there of this

81
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,440
a

82
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,960
young

83
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,620
color

84
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:46,920
GI

85
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,120
char

86
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Master!

87
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Master!

88
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
It's been three months.

89
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
I can't drink anymore.

90
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Why can't you drink?

91
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Because...

92
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,120
Your wine in the mortal world is a good thing.

93
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Master!

94
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Master!

95
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Master!

96
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Master!

97
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,120
He's gone.

98
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
He's gone.

99
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,120
Master!

100
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Master!

101
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
Let me have a drink.

102
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Okay.

103
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Don't drink anymore.

104
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,120
If you drink like this, you'll be a god.

105
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
You can't bear it.

106
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Your wife is pregnant. Do you know that?

107
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
What?

108
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,120
It's been four months. You don't know?

109
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
What did you say?

110
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,120
It's been four months. You don't know?

111
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,120
You're too careless.

112
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,120
Do you want to watch it?

113
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,120
I want to watch it.

114
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
I want to watch it.

115
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
Hurry up.

116
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,120
I see the end.

117
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,120
It's almost there.

118
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
It's coming out.

119
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
The baby is coming.

120
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Don't cry.

121
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Come on.

122
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Don't cry.

123
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Congratulations. You're a boy.

124
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Master, you're a boy.

125
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120
He doesn't have a name.

126
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Let's call him Shi'an.

127
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Shi'an.

128
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,120
My mother lost her mind when she found me.

129
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
She gave me a new name.

130
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
It's Lishan.

131
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
Why?

132
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
It's a land of land.

133
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Don't cry.

134
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
I'll call my mother.

135
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Come.

136
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,380
Xia.oi

137
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,440
I told you not to cry.

138
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,580
You find your own!

139
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,700
Don't cry!

140
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,400
Hey...

141
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,240
I will take Minister for it.

142
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,400
Don't cry...

143
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,580
I will take Minister for you.

144
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,280
Don't cry, Sun.

145
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,920
No, no.

146
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
I'm sorry.

147
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
I'm sorry.

148
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
I'm sorry.

149
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm sorry.

150
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Uncle Bai, you're my destiny.

151
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
I've been a doctor for a long time.

152
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
He's gone again.

153
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Xu An?

154
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
I'm sorry.

155
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
Xu An?

156
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Xu An!

157
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Who is this kid?

158
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Are you playing here?

159
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
I'm here to save you.

160
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Don't run away.

161
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Don't run away.

162
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
How dare you run away? Where's your father?

163
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
He's in heaven.

164
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
He's dead?

165
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
My father is dead.

166
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Your father is dead.

167
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Look, this is my father.

168
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
Don't say that I'm not your father's kid.

169
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
I'm your father.

170
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,920
All the truth is in the lost time.

171
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
You're a god.

172
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
But you can't hide the truth.

173
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
My father is dead.

174
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
He's dead.

175
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
Do you want to see it?

176
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,920
I want to know the truth.

177
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,920
King Xu An is lost now.

178
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,580
Ruontem ...

179
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,420
are no longer in danger.

180
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,920
The human race泰 ...

181
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,920
is theラة isn't falling from them.

182
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,360
Yes.

183
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,360
Let's court these growling.

184
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,480
Next time, arrest him at my homestay!

185
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,760
All right.

186
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,080
Yes!

187
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,360
Hurry!

188
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,740
Show us your enclosed exorcism, sorry!

189
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,860
I feel nervous.

190
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,560
He's a obtainer.

191
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
Master, don't let them get away!

192
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Don't let them get away!

193
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
They want money, so let them get away.

194
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
Let's go.

195
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Master, slowly.

196
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Master!

197
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Master, let's go.

198
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
Let's go.

199
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,560
Stop!

200
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
Don't come over!

201
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Don't come over!

202
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Don't come over!

203
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Don't come over!

204
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,560
I'll go save my uncle.

205
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Don't come over!

206
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
Let go of me!

207
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
Don't come over!

208
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Don't come over!

209
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
Let go of me!

210
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Let go of me!

211
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Master!

212
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Dad!

213
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
Master!

214
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Master!

215
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Master!

216
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Master!

217
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
Master!

218
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,560
Master!

219
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
You're awake!

220
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
Are you feeling unwell?

221
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
I'll get the medicine.

222
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
It's okay.

223
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Master!

224
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Shuan.

225
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
Shuan.

226
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,560
Shuan.

227
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,560
He's mad at me.

228
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
I'll get the medicine.

229
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Shuan.

230
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,560
Shuan.

231
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
Shuan.

232
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
Shuan.

233
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,560
I'll get the medicine.

234
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
Master!

235
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Shuan!

236
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
He's mad at me.

237
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Here's the medicine for you.

238
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Here's the medicine.

239
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Here.

240
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
I'll get the medicine.

241
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
Shuan.

242
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
Here.

243
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
Here.

244
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
Here.

245
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
Here.

246
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
The medicine.

247
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Shuan.

248
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Master, he doesn't drink.

249
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
Let me drink.

250
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,260
Shan, drink the medicine.

251
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,160
I'll take you to the air conditioner.

252
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Okay?

253
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Come.

254
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,760
Shan, you can't be without you.

255
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,360
Drink the medicine.

256
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Come.

257
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Come.

258
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
Okay.

259
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
I'll go.

260
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
I'll go.

261
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Shan.

262
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,360
The wind has blown away the grass.

263
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,360
The wind has blown away the grass.

264
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,360
The moon shadow has been broken down.

265
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,360
The dream has been lost for a long time.

266
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,360
The smile is crying and crying.

267
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,360
The life is full of sorrow.

268
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,360
Love is gentle and cruel.

269
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,360
The water is hard to water.

270
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,360
My heart is shaking.

271
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
The rain is laughing.

272
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,360
I'm not shy.

273
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,360
The cup of wine is only for the dream.

274
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,360
The flower has been in the rain for a long time.

275
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,360
The flower has been broken, but the heart is happy.

276
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,360
The white fog is gone.

277
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,360
The smile is crying and crying.

278
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,360
I can't drink.

279
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,360
I'm not shy.

280
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,360
I'm not shy.

281
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,360
The cup of wine is only for the dream.

282
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,360
The wind has blown away the grass.

283
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,360
The moon shadow has been broken down.

284
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:27,360
The dream has been lost for a long time.

285
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:39,360
The life is full of sorrow.

286
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,360
I'm not drunk. Why don't you take a break?

287
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,360
Master, don't be in a hurry. I'll go get the other medicines.

288
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
Shan.

289
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,360
Shan, please wake up.

290
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,360
Don't scare me.

291
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Where is Chang Jin?

292
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
I'll buy you some medicine.

293
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,360
I'm so sad.

294
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Chang Jin said you're a fairy in heaven.

295
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,360
You're a fairy in heaven, right?

296
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
Yes.

297
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,360
Is heaven beautiful?

298
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
It is.

299
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,360
Heaven is the closest place to the sun.

300
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,360
Every day, the sky is full of clouds.

301
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,360
The light is shining.

302
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,360
I want to buy some medicine.

303
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Mother, is the sun in heaven going to be dark?

304
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
No.

305
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:18,360
There are many delicious fruits in heaven.

306
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
There are also snacks.

307
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
And the gods have magical power.

308
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
It's not good.

309
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,360
I'll get sick.

310
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
Yes.

311
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
I won't get sick.

312
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,360
Mother, is the god in heaven?

313
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:49,360
He's the most powerful god in the world.

314
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,360
Mother, is the god in heaven?

315
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,360
Why am I not sick?

316
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,360
I'll get sick.

317
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,360
I'll protect my mother.

318
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Father.

319
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,360
I'm sorry.

320
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,360
When I was pregnant, I was forced to do magic.

321
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,360
You couldn't absorb the power.

322
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,360
So you were forced to do it.

323
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,360
But it's okay.

324
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
You've waited for me for three years.

325
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
You've waited for me for three years.

326
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,360
I'll take you back to the heaven.

327
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,360
I'll get you some medicine.

328
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,360
I'll get you some magic.

329
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
You'll be like my mother.

330
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,360
You won't get sick and die.

331
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,360
The heaven is so beautiful.

332
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,360
Mother, if I die, you'll be born.

333
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,360
I won't let you suffer.

334
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Mother, I want to ask you something.

335
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,360
Shan.

336
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,360
Shan.

337
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Shan.

338
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
Shan.

339
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,360
Shan.

340
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Shan.

341
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Shan, don't sleep.

342
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,360
Don't sleep.

343
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
Shan.

344
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,360
Don't sleep.

345
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Don't sleep.

346
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
Don't sleep.

347
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
Don't sleep.

348
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
I'm sorry.

349
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
I'm sorry.

350
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
I'm sorry.

351
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
Please save my life.

352
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,360
Find Baikun Temple.

353
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
Please accept my gratitude.

354
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,360
I did all the wrongs by myself.

355
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,360
I'm sorry.

356
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
I'm sorry.

357
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
I'm sorry.

358
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,360
I'm really sorry.

359
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,220
Oh.

360
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,800
My.

361
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,320
Sorry.

362
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,740
Sorry...

363
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,640
I'm sorry.

364
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,460
I'm sorry.

365
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,140
I'm sorry!

366
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,180
I'm sorry!

367
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,480
Please let me go only no matter what.

368
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,560
Please...

369
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,040
Please..

370
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,200
Please let me go only no matter what.

371
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,100
Brother!

372
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Please don't leave us in this world ...

373
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,700
Mom, please don't leave us ..

374
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Brother!

375
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,980
Mom, please don't leave us.

376
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,740
Dad, there's no other way.

377
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,640
My sister is in a disease

378
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,300
The 108th chauvinist

379
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:18,700
My sister does nothing

380
00:32:50,200 --> 00:33:00,200
I never need to be sad

381
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
What about your child?

382
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
I'm a child of Wen Yi. I'm six years old.

383
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
This is your wish.

384
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Is it your wish to kill her for hundreds of years?

385
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Not only that.

386
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Do you know what the biggest pain in this world is?

387
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
What?

388
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
It's death.

389
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
It's death.

390
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
It's death.

391
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
That's why he killed me with the demon.

392
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
He must be the new master of the Soul-division.

393
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Kill him.

394
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Kill him.

395
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Kill him.

396
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Kill him.

397
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Kill him.

398
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
Kill him.

399
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Kill him.

400
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Kill him.

401
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Kill him.

402
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Kill him.

403
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
Kill him.

404
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Kill him.

405
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Kill him.

406
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Kill him.

407
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
I'll kill you.

408
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Kill him.

409
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Master, go.

410
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
Go.

411
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Go.

412
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
Go.

413
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Go.

414
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Go.

415
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,200
Master.

416
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
The refugees here are taking you as a demon.

417
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
You can't save her.

418
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Chang Jin.

419
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Catch them.

420
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Kill them.

421
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
Kill them.

422
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Kill them.

423
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Kill them.

424
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Kill them.

425
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Kill them.

426
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Kill them.

427
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Kill them.

428
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Kill them.

429
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Kill them.

430
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Chang Jin.

431
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Master.

432
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
Master.

433
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,200
Chang Jin.

434
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Master.

435
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
They're the demons.

436
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Run.

437
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Chang Jin.

438
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Chang Jin.

439
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
Chang Jin.

440
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,200
Come on in.

441
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
Let's go see the doctor.

442
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,200
Didn't you say that you're curious about the sky?

443
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
When you're recovered,

444
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,200
I'll take care of the sky for ten years.

445
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
You...

446
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
You can't even kill anyone.

447
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
I'll die.

448
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
I'll go to Chang Jin,

449
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,200
go to the temple,

450
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,200
go to the temple,

451
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
go to the temple,

452
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
go to the temple.

453
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
I'm no better than anyone.

454
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,200
It's you.

455
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,200
How long will you be in the hair salon?

456
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
I don't need your care.

457
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Let's go.

458
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Chang Jin.

459
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
Chang Jin.

460
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Master.

461
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
Master.

462
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
I can't see.

463
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
I feel a little...

464
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
I feel like...

465
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
I'm dying.

466
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
I feel like...

467
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
I'm sorry.

468
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
I'm sorry.

469
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
I'm sorry.

470
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Master.

471
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,200
The best god in the world.

472
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Although I've never seen any god,

473
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,200
you're the only one who can make me happy.

474
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
You're the most beautiful one.

475
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
You're the most beautiful one.

476
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,200
You're the most beautiful one.

477
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Chang Jin.

478
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
When I was young,

479
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Master told me to tell you.

480
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
You should not be a god.

481
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Otherwise,

482
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
you'll disappear.

483
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
But I'm not a god.

484
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
If you can't stand

485
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,200
and run away,

486
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
you can't leave.

487
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,200
You're right.

488
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,200
If I was really wrong,

489
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
I would have been in trouble.

490
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
You can rest.

491
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Don't talk.

492
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
What should I do

493
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,200
to be alone in this world?

494
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
What should I do?

495
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,200
I feel like I'm alone.

496
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,200
I'm alone.

497
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,200
Chang Jin.

498
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
Chang Jin.

499
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Chang Jin.

500
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Chang Jin.

501
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,200
Chang Jin.

502
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,200
Chang Jin.

503
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Chang Jin.

504
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,200
Chang Jin.

505
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Chang Jin.

506
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,200
Chang Jin.

507
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
I love you.
