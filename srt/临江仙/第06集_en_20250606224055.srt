1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
ME Sergeant!

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,620
I thought I got an idea, but I think I'll just have to follow it for a while!

3
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,060
The strict directions coloured the road with red signs and cars transformed the landscape Bienvenue and the чтобы제 directive into matchmaking.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll try to make it.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll try to make it.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll try to make it.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll try to make it.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll try to make it.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll try to make it.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll try to make it.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll try to make it.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll try to make it.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll try to make it.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll try to make it.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll try to make it.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll try to make it.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll try to make it.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll try to make it.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll try to make it.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll try to make it.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll try to make it.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll try to make it.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll try to make it.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll try to make it.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll try to make it.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll try to make it.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll try to make it.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll try to make it.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll try to make it.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll try to make it.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll try to make it.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll try to make it.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll help you get better.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll try to make it.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You missed us.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
disinfection,

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What do you mean?

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,480
You didn't attacked us carefully.

40
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,000
Then you emphasized ouritarian skills.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,720
President Kong Xun ARESS

42
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,580
Your time has come.

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:23,780
Very

44
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:32,540
If distress gemacht,

45
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,660
cooling down nearby niin

46
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,260
is going to deline your heart—

47
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,980
and slash the Strom at it with a prima- gatherer-

48
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,980
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

49
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,980
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

50
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,980
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

51
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,980
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

52
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,980
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

53
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,980
Go and see how she's doing.

54
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,980
Madam, the gold vein is getting shorter.

55
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,980
I'm afraid we can't hold on too long.

56
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,980
Li Mo Xuan is in the medical room.

57
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,980
Tell her to come back.

58
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,980
Yes.

59
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,980
I'm sure she's fine.

60
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,980
What kind of soldier wants you to see me with blood?

61
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,980
Long Yuan almost left the post.

62
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,980
He came back with me.

63
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,980
You were too hasty.

64
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,980
You'll know it in a minute.

65
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,980
Hurry up.

66
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,980
Don't talk nonsense in a while.

67
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,980
Who?

68
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,780
Hurry.

69
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,980
We'll know in a minute.

70
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,980
Hurry up.

71
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,780
This is...

72
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,780
Let's see how she's doing.

73
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,780
She's just a mortal.

74
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,780
Let me cure you.

75
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,180
Don't talk nonsense.

76
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,780
I can't save her.

77
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,780
The transcendent spirit serait bonds against the שה- Emily,

78
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,980
that powers 144.

79
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,180
It's just physical reflection.

80
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,180
It will becue not able to receive.

81
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,340
Now stopped airtime and

82
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,380
philosophy,

83
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,580
all I've got, is 노래�.

84
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,180
The front versteem,

85
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,580
Π Shköpalus.

86
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

87
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,580
That's right.

88
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,580
She must have used a drug that can enhance her internal strength.

89
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,580
She was severely injured and had a heart attack.

90
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,580
Can you let her wake up?

91
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,580
I can't do it.

92
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,580
Let her wake up in a short time.

93
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,580
I'm sure of it.

94
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,580
Let her wake up.

95
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,580
I have something to ask her.

96
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

97
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

98
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

99
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

100
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

101
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

102
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

103
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

104
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

105
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

106
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

107
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

108
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

109
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,580
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

110
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,580
Chi Yang Valley is a valley that can re-enact the Golden Valley

111
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,580
and revive the spirit of the dead.

112
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,580
If you fall into the hands of the Immortal Sect,

113
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,580
this is the strength of cultivation.

114
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,580
If you fall into the hands of the Demon Sect,

115
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,580
in this world,

116
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,580
it's hard to have a new blood.

117
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,580
I'm here to report that the Yin Lian Sect is ready.

118
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,580
Zhang Sun, can your aura be repaired?

119
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,580
It seems to be a problem.

120
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,580
So you must be careful.

121
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,580
Yes, Zhang Sun.

122
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,580
Zhang Sun.

123
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,580
Yes.

124
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,580
This pill is good.

125
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,580
This Huiyuan Pill is our secret treasure in the Golden Cloud Sect.

126
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,580
It's a secret pill.

127
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,580
Within two hours, your skills will be improved.

128
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,580
There are three of us in the Golden Cloud Sect.

129
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,580
We took two of them away when Qingyue was born.

130
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,580
The rest is...

131
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,580
You take it.

132
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,580
A cup of non-dark blood.

133
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,580
Thank you, master.

134
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,580
The Golden Cloud Sect is ready.

135
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,580
Shang Lan.

136
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,580
Xuan Zun.

137
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,580
Dad.

138
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,580
The mortal's pill.

139
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,580
You want to use the power of the pill to improve your internal strength,

140
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,580
but you don't want to hurt the root of your body after you lose your strength.

141
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,580
You haven't even fixed the Golden Cloud Pill.

142
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,580
Do you want to make this life impossible and have no chance to survive?

143
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,580
Why did you kill Bai She?

144
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,580
She and I have a grudge.

145
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,580
What grudge?

146
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,580
I dare to ask Xuan Zun.

147
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,580
11 years ago,

148
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,580
did Bai She ever make a mistake?

149
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,580
She did.

150
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,580
Then, Xuan Zun, do you still remember where she went?

151
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,580
The Golden Cloud Sect.

152
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,580
The Yufan Mountain Bridge.

153
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,580
The Southern Yuzun.

154
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,580
The White Snake County.

155
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,580
The Red Water Taoting.

156
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,580
My mother died in that big water.

157
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,580
What should we do?

158
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,580
Dad.

159
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,580
My family is gone.

160
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
Help me.

161
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,580
You are so strong.

162
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,580
Don't leave me, mom.

163
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,580
You are so bad, mom.

164
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,580
Please save me, mom.

165
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,580
Mom.

166
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,580
The Red Water Taoting.

167
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,580
With the White Snake and the Wander,

168
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,580
the whole village has suffered a lot.

169
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,580
I have to leave the place.

170
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,580
I have to go back to the Golden Cloud Sect with Master Qingyang.

171
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,580
I have to live until today.

172
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,580
Why did you never mention me in the past?

173
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,580
Because Xuan Zun never asked me.

174
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,580
About my past,

175
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,580
Xuan Zun never wanted to know about it.

176
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,580
I said that

177
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,580
he would die in the future.

178
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,580
Why did you say that?

179
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,580
Even if he dies in the desert,

180
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,580
he might die in my hands.

181
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,580
The Red Water Taoting is heaven and the White Snake is nothing.

182
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,580
You are a disciple of the Grand Sect of the Yufan Mountain.

183
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
You are so kind.

184
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,580
Your disciple is very kind.

185
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,580
The Cloud Sect is always in Xuan Zun's eyes.

186
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,580
Maybe it's not that bad.

187
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,580
But in the mortal world,

188
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,580
he is also a master of the sect.

189
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,580
The world is long-awaited.

190
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,580
But most of us have to enter the sect.

191
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,580
We can't just leave the place.

192
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,580
Although Ji Yuan and Qiao He are the first to be in the sect,

193
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,580
they can be chosen through the trials and trials on the way.

194
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,580
Being a disciple of the Grand Sect

195
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,580
is not just luck.

196
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,580
What else?

197
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,580
Even the people of the capital

198
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,580
are willing to kill me

199
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,580
with the information that I have.

200
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,580
Then what do you think of me?

201
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,580
I am Xuan Zun's wife.

202
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:56,580
I am naturally loving Xuan Zun.

203
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,580
Xuan Zun.

204
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,580
Do you think he is like me?

205
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,580
He is very like me.

206
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,580
But I believe in my own medical skills.

207
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,580
He is just a mortal.

208
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,580
If he is really him,

209
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,580
he will never kill Baishuo.

210
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,580
Baishuo is really dead?

211
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,580
Yes.

212
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,580
The Immortal Sword of the Cloud Sect is a bit dull.

213
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,580
It goes into the Baihui Sect until the spirit stage.

214
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
It is a critical move.

215
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,580
It is all about the air.

216
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,580
Then he...

217
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,580
Is he really dead?

218
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,580
I am going to talk about this.

219
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,580
I found out that there are some living beings in the mortal world

220
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,580
who are known for their food.

221
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,580
But the dead are flesh and bones.

222
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,580
They are reborn and re-decorated.

223
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,580
If you want to save them,

224
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,580
you must do this.

225
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,580
Will he really die?

226
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,580
If he dies,

227
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,580
he will not die.

228
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,580
But if he is a mortal,

229
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,580
he will die.

230
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,580
You are back.

231
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,580
You are back again.

232
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,580
You have been looking for excuses to be strong these years.

233
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,580
Are you really not going to take a look?

234
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,580
Since you know it,

235
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,580
I am deliberately hiding.

236
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,580
Why do you still want to persuade me?

237
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,580
Your cultivation has been stopped for hundreds of years.

238
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,580
I think this is your problem.

239
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,580
You are not going to break it.

240
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,580
You can try it.

241
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,580
Master,

242
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,580
I have a plan.

243
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,580
We have to do something big this time, right?

244
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,580
Master has already told me.

245
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,580
I will go and take a look.

246
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,580
General.

247
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,580
It is the murderer of Chunyang Sect.

248
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,580
The bone is broken.

249
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,580
It should be the master of the Yin Lian Sect.

250
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,580
It seems that the Yin Lian Sect has arrived.

251
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,580
We are still late.

252
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,580
Be careful.

253
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,580
Be careful.

254
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,580
The Bian Fu Sect is a sacred spirit.

255
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,580
It has gone out of the spiritual ring and has opened its demon form.

256
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,580
Be careful.

257
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,580
Don't get caught by the Bian Fu Sect.

258
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
Thank you.

259
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
You still care about me.

260
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,580
Are all the disciples of the Yin Sect here to die?

261
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,580
No.

262
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,580
They are just here to die.

263
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,580
Are all the disciples of the Yin Sect here to die?

264
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,580
Demon girl.

265
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,580
I am a demon girl.

266
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,580
What are you?

267
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,580
You have been resting for so many years.

268
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,580
Do you still think that you are a demon girl?

269
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,580
Senior.

270
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,580
Hold it.

271
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,580
Senior.

272
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,580
Follow me.

273
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,580
Follow me.

274
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,580
Where are you going?

275
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,580
Please save my wife.

276
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,580
She was hurt while she was in the cliff.

277
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
She didn't get well.

278
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,580
She was just cooking for you.

279
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,580
Now she is hurt by someone.

280
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,580
She is so pitiful.

281
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,580
Do you think she will die?

282
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,580
She can't die.

283
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,580
No.

284
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
You are so pitiful.

285
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,580
You are so pitiful.

286
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
I brought you a way to kill you.

287
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,580
You still want to insult me?

288
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,580
All the disciples of the Yin Sects are like you.

289
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,580
You know that?

290
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,580
You are so polite.

291
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,580
You have been helping us to fight the demon beast.

292
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,580
You want to take the demon fruit.

293
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,580
I know that you want to take the demon fruit.

294
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,580
I think she is just here to save you.

295
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,580
You are so pitiful.

296
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,580
You are so pitiful.

297
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,580
You are so pitiful.

298
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,580
You are so pitiful.

299
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,580
You want to take the demon fruit.

300
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,580
I think she is just here to save you.

301
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,580
You can't just let me go.

302
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
The demon beast is so pitiful.

303
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,580
I trust you.

304
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,580
I will kill you.

305
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,580
Brother Zhang.

306
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,580
Brother Zhang.

307
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,580
No.

308
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,580
We are in trouble.

309
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,580
Brother Zhang.

310
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,580
Brother Zhang.

311
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,580
No.

312
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,580
Wait.

313
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,580
Brother Zhang.

314
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,580
Brother Zhang.

315
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,580
Brother Zhang.

316
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,580
Xuan Zun.

317
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,580
Did Xuan Zun save me again?

318
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,580
I killed the white snake on my own.

319
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,580
Is Xuan Zun still angry?

320
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,580
I'm dead.

321
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,580
What's wrong with me being dead?

322
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,580
Qing Yue committed suicide.

323
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,580
She's guilty of Xuan Zun.

324
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,580
Thank you for not being my witness.

325
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,580
Xuan Zun.

326
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,580
My life is yours.

327
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,580
Xuan Zun.

328
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,580
Are you okay?

329
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,580
Don't touch me.

330
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,580
This is my room.

331
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,580
You go back first.

332
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,580
Go back.

333
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,580
Xuan Zun, if you feel uncomfortable, you must tell me.

334
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,580
Xuan Zun.

335
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,580
Did you have another day?

336
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,580
Li Qing Yue was beaten by Xuan Zun.

337
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,580
How is she hurt?

338
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,580
I heard she was badly injured.

339
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,580
She was just in a bad mood.

340
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,580
What's Xuan Zun's reaction?

341
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,580
Xuan Zun was killed last night.

342
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,580
She took the medicine for her.

343
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,580
She's recovered now.

344
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,580
She's dead.

345
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,580
Ling'er.

346
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,580
Did you hear what Xuan Zun and Shimeu said?

347
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,580
Now you know that Shizun is very serious about Shimeu.

348
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,580
Don't ever...

349
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,580
Stop thinking about it.

350
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,580
Okay.

351
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,580
Don't think about these annoying things.

352
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,580
After I get married, I'll take you out to have a good time.

353
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,580
You want to get married again?

354
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,580
Yes.

355
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,580
Ling'er.

356
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,580
You're a salesman.

357
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,580
Help me choose.

358
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,580
What wine do you use for the wedding banquet?

359
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,580
Wine.

360
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,580
Why did you come to heaven?

361
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,580
You can't change the problem of the world.

362
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,580
Look at her.

363
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,580
Senior Sister, how long do you want to stay?

364
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,580
That's all.

365
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,580
Senior Brother, you're not recovered.

366
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,580
Lie down first.

367
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,580
How long did I sleep?

368
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,580
It's been three days.

369
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,580
Senior Brother Zhang is really good.

370
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,580
He was beaten by the Great Chen Xuan Zun.

371
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,580
It's just three days of marriage.

372
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,580
If you changed the other person, you would have died.

373
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,580
Senior Brother Zhang's anger and pain has been greatly damaged three years ago.

374
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,580
Plus, now, he's been beaten by Great Chen Xuan Zun.

375
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,580
That's why he's injured.

376
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,580
I just sealed your anger and pain with the silver needle.

377
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
You need to rest well.

378
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,580
If...

379
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,580
Senior Brother Zhang, you're not recovered. Where are you going?

380
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,580
What if?

381
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,580
I'll tell you.

382
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,580
Senior Brother, look.

383
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,580
I'm Zhang Sun.

384
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,580
I'm asking for your opinion.

385
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,580
Come in.

386
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,580
Master.

387
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,580
Master Dai Yang.

388
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,580
You're injured again.

389
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,580
Why don't you let me heal you?

390
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,580
What's the reason?

391
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,580
I remember Master once said

392
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,580
that the Chiyang State has a golden bone.

393
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,580
Why would it die?

394
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,580
Is that so?

395
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,580
Yes.

396
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,580
Chiyang State is a very good medicine.

397
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,580
It can kill people and make them white bones.

398
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,580
If it's Master,

399
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
it's useless.

400
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,580
Master's body is not soft.

401
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,580
It's a good medicine for the body.

402
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,580
Chiyang State is a good medicine for the body.

403
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,580
It's a good medicine for the body.

404
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,580
Since Chiyang State is a good medicine for the body,

405
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,580
why would Great Chen Xuan Zun

406
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,580
take Chiyang State away from Chiyang State?

407
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,580
Well...

408
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,580
Well...

409
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,580
In other words,

410
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,580
who is the one

411
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,580
who will be the one

412
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,580
on the whole Nine Heavens?

413
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,580
The injured need to cure them with Chiyang State.

414
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,580
Madam, you're really amazing.

415
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,580
It's been a few days.

416
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,580
You've grown so fast.

417
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
Thanks to Xuan Zun's Chiyang State,

418
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,580
I feel that

419
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,580
I'm perfect in the cold.

420
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,580
Especially when I'm in the palace for a rest,

421
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,580
I feel that I'm in the palace for a rest.

422
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,580
Master,

423
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,580
you're really amazing.

424
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,580
You're really amazing.

425
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,580
You're really amazing.

426
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,580
You're really amazing.

427
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,580
You're really amazing.

428
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,580
If I were Xuan De,

429
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,580
I would have practiced for decades.

430
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Xuan Zun is taking revenge on me.

431
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,580
He saved my life.

432
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,580
I really don't know how to repay him.

433
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,580
That's too hard.

434
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,580
I've been in the palace for so long.

435
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,580
I've never heard that Xuan Zun likes anything.

436
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,580
Last time I cooked for Xuan Zun,

437
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,580
I think he likes it a lot.

438
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,580
I'll cook for him.

439
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,580
Okay, okay.

440
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,580
I want to eat it too.

441
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
I want to eat it too.

442
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,580
Go get ready.

443
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,580
Yes.

444
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,580
My Lady.

445
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,580
My Lady, what's up?

446
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,580
Eh…

447
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,580
I saw Xuan Zun yesterday.

448
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,580
I feel having back pain.

449
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,580
So, I brought some food.

450
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,580
Xuan Zun is at customs?

451
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:22,160
Are you sure you've guys studied

452
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,160
so I know that we're in the school?

453
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,300
Yes.

454
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,580
Lady you really are crazy.

455
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,300
Look.

456
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,540
Mr. Xuan is closing the coffin.

457
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,740
He's not seeing anyone these days.

458
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,540
Did you remember to tell me

459
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,220
when Mr. Xuan left the coffin?

460
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,020
Yes.

461
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,940
Great God Bird smartphone hermit,

462
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,660
Ruer數

463
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,500
clever

464
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,100
educated

465
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,860
Ruer Saint Imperial Master.

466
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,260
My real point is

467
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,500
I'm just a loose mat but I can walk

468
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,780
like a ihnch.

469
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,300
How I canAUDIO sends these brothers

470
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,460
let me live

471
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,460
I miss him and miss him.

472
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
But I have someone in my heart.

473
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,460
I have been wandering around,

474
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,460
and I have been wandering around.

475
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,460
If I were to live like a child,

476
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
I would be so proud.

477
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,460
I am here today.

478
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,460
I wish to be like a flower,

479
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,460
and be like a couple.

480
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,460
A couple is like a single body.

481
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,460
We are like a couple.

482
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,460
The marriage is a promise.

483
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,460
The marriage is a promise.

484
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,460
We will live a happy life.

485
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,460
A Yuan,

486
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,460
I will never let you go again.

487
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:01,460
I can't let you go again.

488
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,460
But I am more clear.

489
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,460
I want to be with you forever.

490
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:13,460
I can't help but think of you.

491
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,460
The birds are singing.

492
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,460
The young ones are crying.

493
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,460
The young ones are crying.

494
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,460
The young ones are crying.

495
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,460
The young ones are crying.

496
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,460
The young ones are crying.

497
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,460
The young ones are crying.

498
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,460
The young ones are crying.

499
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,460
The young ones are crying.

500
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,460
The young ones are crying.

501
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,460
The young ones are crying.

502
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,460
The young ones are crying.

503
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,460
The young ones are crying.

504
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,460
The young ones are crying.

505
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,460
The young ones are crying.

506
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,460
The young ones are crying.

507
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,460
The young ones are crying.

508
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,460
The young ones are crying.

509
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,460
The young ones are crying.

510
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,460
The young ones are crying.

511
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,460
The young ones are crying.

512
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,460
The young ones are crying.

513
00:36:50,460 --> 00:37:04,460
Why?

514
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,460
Why?

515
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:17,460
Why did you do this to me?

516
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,460
Because you deserve to die.

517
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,460
The young ones are crying.

518
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:29,460
Bai Jiu Si.

519
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,460
Wang Yue, stop!

520
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,460
Wang Yue, stop!

521
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,460
Wang Yue, stop!

522
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,460
Wang Yue, stop!

523
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,460
Wang Yue, stop!

524
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,460
Wang Yue, stop!

525
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,460
Wang Yue, stop!

526
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,460
Wang Yue, stop!

527
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,460
Wang Yue, stop!

528
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,460
Wang Yue, stop!

529
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,460
Wang Yue, stop!

530
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,460
Wang Yue, stop!

531
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,460
Wang Yue, stop!

532
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,460
Wang Yue, stop!

533
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,460
Wang Yue, stop!

534
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,460
That woman are crying.

535
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,460
The young ones didn't wait for you.

536
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:25,460
You stand here to watch it.

537
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,460
It's painful to see someone cry like that.

538
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,460
Why?

539
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,460
Because the creator is right.

540
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,460
He threw a string and left it behind.

541
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,460
She said he was a happy bride.

542
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,460
When the sooner the better.

543
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,180
Xuan Zun is not the first time she's been closed.

544
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,460
The Immortal Army will take care of her.

545
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,180
Xuan Zun is often closed?

546
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,620
Probably every ten years.

547
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,620
Why?

548
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,820
I don't know.

549
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,620
Maybe it's because of the scar left by Qing Ling.

550
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,420
Mrs. Qing Yue.

551
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,980
Today is the wedding day of my father.

552
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,900
I heard that you didn't receive the invitation.

553
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,820
So I came to send the invitation myself.

554
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,660
I hope you can appreciate it.

555
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,740
I have no relationship with the Immortal Army.

556
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,140
I'm not going to do such a big thing.

557
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,820
You're joking.

558
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,620
You're Xuan Zun's disciple.

559
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,460
You're Xuan Zun's wife.

560
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,980
In my opinion,

561
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,460
you should call me your mother.

562
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,940
How can you say that?

563
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,540
Forget it.

564
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,940
I was afraid that I would be embarrassed if I went there.

565
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,260
Since that, I won't force you.

566
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,020
I came to find you today.

567
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,220
What is it?

568
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,100
I kept Xuan Zun's things in the past.

569
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,220
Now, you're the woman of the Cang Lei Hall.

570
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,580
You should leave it to me.

571
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,820
What is it?

572
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,620
It's all Xuan Zun's personal belongings.

573
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,140
And you said you wanted to saw his face?

574
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,060
Of course, he loves me.

575
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,340
Let's talk about it.

576
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,340
Fine. Let me go and have a look.

577
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,780
Xuan Zun's personal belongings are all precious happiness.

578
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,180
She should roam on her own.

579
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,680
Wait here for me.

580
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,000
End of the road

581
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,260
What items are so faint?

582
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,960
Xuen are so valuable

583
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,360
Thar dare to approach them

584
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,740
And I have been busy fixing the barrier

585
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,280
I haven't cleaned these these past days

586
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,980
So, I'm a bit into it

587
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,400
When we were following this road

588
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,600
we didn't even see a few people

589
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,220
Today is a Temple Day

590
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:58,920
People from the Le snakes店

591
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,200
They went to the toilet for Hongiggling

592
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,700
Why didn't you go

593
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,680
How can there be so few daughters in this world who are happy to have their own father?

594
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,680
The old things in this are all precious to Xuanzen.

595
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,680
I usually keep them.

596
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,680
Now that I've given them to you, they're considered the original owner of the house.

597
