00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Dress as Miss Leah

00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,760
WAKE UP

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,740
Disney World

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,020

tour into the next world

6
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,440
The shadow of the spring is so soft

7
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,880
I pretend that I don't want to listen

8
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,200
I don't want to look at your eyes

9
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,880
But tears are the essence of the past

10
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,240
I want to learn to be independent

11
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,040
And turn back to my heart

12
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,580
Looking back on my mistakes

13
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,860
With shorted hair and thin skin

14
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,860
The End

15
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,860
Episode 1

16
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,860
Bai Jiu Si.

17
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,860
This is what you want to see.

18
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:06,860
It's not over yet.

19
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,860
It's over!

20
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,860
My dear friends!

21
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,860
He's the demon of the Demon Realm!

22
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,860
Our disaster and suffering are all because of him!

23
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,860
As long as we get rid of him, our bitter days will end!

24
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,860
Collect him this time!

25
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,860
Collect him.

26
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,860

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,160

31
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,380

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,620

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,680
Not him!

34
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,800
murdered

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Don't let me go!

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Don't let me go!

37
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Don't let me go!

38
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Don't let me go!

39
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Don't let me go!

40
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Don't let me go!

41
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Don't let me go!

42
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Don't let me go!

43
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
What a beauty!

44
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
She's so hot!

45
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Come on, let's go.

46
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Get up and let's go.

47
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Don't let me go!

48
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Don't let me go!

49
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Don't let me go!

50
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
You're really lucky.

51
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,800
The Great Emperor's Law

52
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
The Great Emperor's Law

53
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
is the best in the world.

54
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,800
And the Great Emperor's Law is the best in the world.

55
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
The Great Emperor's Law

56
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
is the best in the world.

57
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
The Great Emperor

58
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
's Law is the best in the world.

59
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
You're really lucky.

60
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
The Great Emperor's Law

61
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
is the best in the world.

62
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
You're really lucky.

63
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
I'm so lucky.

64
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,800
I can't let anybody kidnap you.

65
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
I will stop him.

66
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,800
So after I recover my power,

67
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
I will pretend to help him.

68
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
I will seal him with the seal of Heaven.

69
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
So that he can't stop me.

70
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
I will stop him.

71
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
That's his child.

72
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
If he knows,

73
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
he might help you.

74
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
He won't.

75
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
This is the last one.

76
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,800
The God of Hell has already been in this big town.

77
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Mom.

78
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Mom.

79
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Mom.

80
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Mom.

81
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Mom.

82
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Mom.

83
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Mom.

84
00:10:50,800 --> 00:11:02,800
The God of Hell has died.

85
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Hua Ru Yue.

86
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
You are a great man.

87
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
You are a great man.

88
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Do you admit your crime?

89
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
I will die.

90
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
You are a great man.

91
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Your Majesty.

92
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
The God of Hell has died.

93
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
My world

94
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
never needs

95
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
the God of Hell.

96
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
He is a great man.

97
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
I have been with him for a thousand years.

98
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
He can't even throw me away.

99
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
He will be saved.

100
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
But he has never seen the world before.

101
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
How could I dare to bet

102
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
he will be affectionate to a child

103
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
he has never seen before?

104
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Okay.

105
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
It's almost the same as you said.

106
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
You are here in three days.

107
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Are you sure you won't leave?

108
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
I am your master.

109
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
I can't leave without anyone else.

110
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
I love drinking.

111
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
I won't leave.

112
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Hey.

113
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
One more time.

114
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Bai Jiu Si.

115
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
He is hurt.

116
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Why did he kill you?

117
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Do you understand now?

118
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
There is no love in this world.

119
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
There is no hatred in this world.

120
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
I saw your past.

121
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
I knew you were the God of Hell

122
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
who respects the cause and the law.

123
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
It's time to face your cause.

124
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
I will go.

125
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
I will go.

126
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
I will go.

127
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
The God of Hell is so lucky.

128
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
300 years ago,

129
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
he was so angry and upset

130
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
about the God of Hell.

131
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
He was so upset.

132
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
At that time,

133
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
I was so worried about him.

134
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
I was so worried about him.

135
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
I was so worried about him.

136
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Otherwise,

137
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
he would have been so rude.

138
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,800
I was drawing the painting in the mountain river.

139
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
That painting

140
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
is like a mountain river.

141
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
It's like a natural air.

142
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
It's like a natural air.

143
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
I drew this painting

144
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
after more than ten years.

145
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
After the painting,

146
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,800
the God of Hell was killed by the God of Hell.

147
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
The God of Hell escaped to the mortal realm.

148
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Otherwise,

149
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,800
I would have killed him.

150
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
How could it be like today?

151
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
I was in the Sky of the Nine Kingdoms.

152
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
But the God of Hell

153
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
is the reason for the God of Hell.

154
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
I was so upset

155
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
about the God of Hell.

156
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
It seems that

157
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
no matter how powerful the God of Hell is,

158
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,800
love and affection will be lost.

159
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Lian Yang,

160
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
what are you doing?

161
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
It's a pity.

162
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
I was closing the door at that time.

163
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
When I came out,

164
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
the God of Hell

165
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,800
had already killed the body of the God of Hell.

166
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
I didn't have a chance to do it.

167
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
For this matter,

168
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
I haven't been to the Sky of the Nine Kingdoms

169
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
for 300 years.

170
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
In the end,

171
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
I'm still the God of Hell.

172
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Right?

173
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
How could we not wait for such a big thing?

174
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
I was so upset.

175
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
The God of Hell is so magical.

176
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
No one is there when they need it.

177
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Now,

178
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
I'm here when I'm out of the Sky of the Nine Kingdoms.

179
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Don't say that.

180
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
I'm still so upset.

181
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Tomorrow, I'll kill the four spirits.

182
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
I hope you will follow me.

183
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Don't look for other reasons.

184
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
What's wrong with that?

185
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
What's wrong with that?

186
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Why are you looking at me?

187
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Next,

188
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,800
you should help me watch over Zhang Sun.

189
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Are you going to find Master again?

190
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I told you that he had a place in his heart.

191
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
You had no chance.

192
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
That's my business.

193
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
I'll go after him.

194
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Come on.

195
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
You can't have someone else.

196
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
That's my business.

197
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
It has nothing to do with you.

198
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Of course it has.

199
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
You stole my jade pendant?

200
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Are you sure?

201
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Isn't your jade pendant in your key?

202
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Do you remember when you got it?

203
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I don't remember.

204
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
It was on my body when I was in the military.

205
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
My family said it was my protective suit.

206
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
It must be you.

207
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Me?

208
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
I once asked the former military officer of the Fish and Moth Department.

209
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,800
He said that someone else's jade pendant is my maid.

210
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Can you help me to clear the jade pendant?

211
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Then you can change it to someone else.

212
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
You said you don't want to save the precious thing.

213
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Yes.

214
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
No.

215
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
What did you do to me?

216
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
This is my jade pendant.

217
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
I just wanted to show you.

218
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Don't make a fool of me.

219
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Get rid of it.

220
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
How can I get rid of it?

221
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,800
The jade pendant is the one that is destined to be.

222
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
I'm so tired.

223
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
I'm telling the truth.

224
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
How is it?

225
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Master, the car is in the line.

226
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
I can't pull it.

227
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Then you have to find someone else to pull it.

228
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
I'm telling you, we must get to the Jinyun Sect today.

229
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Otherwise, something bad will happen.

230
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Master, the yellow wine is black.

231
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Where can I find someone?

232
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
You're not human.

233
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
You're not human?

234
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Stand here and talk.

235
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Let's talk with him.

236
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
My daughter is still in the Jinyun Sect.

237
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
She's still a child.

238
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
If anything happens to her, I don't want to live anymore.

239
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
I should have brought her here.

240
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Master, the young master is already in the 20th grade.

241
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
He's not a child.

242
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Why are you talking so much?

243
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
You're a child.

244
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Do you need help?

245
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Is he a human or a ghost?

246
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
I don't know.

247
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
What was that?

248
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
I'm talking to him.

249
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Me?

250
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
What did you say?

251
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Do you need help?

252
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Of course, I need help.

253
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Your family can live in a mansion.

254
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
There's a husband and a brother in the family.

255
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
No, there's no husband and a brother.

256
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
There's no husband and a brother in the family.

257
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Then, there can be a little sister or sister in the family.

258
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Auntie, grandma can do it.

259
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
As long as she can help me push the car out,

260
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
I will be very careful.

261
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
She will be very happy.

262
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
No need to be so troublesome.

263
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
I can do it alone.

264
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Alone?

265
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Do your sister always push the button at home?

266
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,800
I'm so anxious when I'm not kidding.

267
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Look at me.

268
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
What a big car.

269
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
I didn't expect you to be so strong.

270
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
I'm so tired.

271
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Don't be so polite.

272
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Are you going to the gym?

273
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Great.

274
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
I'm going to the gym, too.

275
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Do you know how to walk?

276
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
I'm going, too.

277
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Then, let's go.

278
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Master.

279
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Master.

280
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
The car is broken.

281
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
We can't go now.

282
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
We have to take a break.

283
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
What are you doing?

284
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Go and take a break.

285
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Okay.

286
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Look.

287
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Look.

288
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
The car is broken.

289
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Miss.

290
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
I'll take you to the gym

291
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
when I fix the car.

292
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
That's too much trouble.

293
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
I'll take you to the gym.

294
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
You can guide me.

295
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
The gym?

296
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Master.

297
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Is the car still broken?

298
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
No.

299
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
There's a magic ring here.

300
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
It can't fly.

301
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Let's go there.

302
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
It's good that it doesn't fly.

303
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Haven't you found a way to wake Master?

304
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
I've never returned to my position.

305
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
I can't wake up now.

306
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
The sky is almost clear.

307
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
If I don't wake up,

308
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
no one can stop me from going down the hill.

309
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Master's spirit

310
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
doesn't look like someone's body.

311
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,800
It looks like he doesn't want to wake up.

312
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Master.

313
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Wake up.

314
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
If you don't wake up,

315
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
you'll be in trouble.

316
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Master.

317
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Greetings, Master.

318
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Where are the four masters?

319
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
They've sent people to the gym many times.

320
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
They said they'd come in soon.

321
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
I won't wait for them.

322
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Go down the hill.

323
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Fight!

324
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Master.

325
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Master.

326
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Master.

327
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Master.

328
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Master.

329
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Master.

330
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Master, are you okay?

331
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Take the soldiers

332
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
and go back.

333
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Master.

334
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Master.

335
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Listen to me.

336
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
If anyone in the gym

337
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
dares to attack the Jingyun Sect,

338
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
take the sages away

339
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
and get out of the gym.

340
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Yes, sir.

341
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Are you still fighting?

342
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Yes.

343
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Why are you still standing?

344
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
Master.

345
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
I think the hidden thunder is in trouble.

346
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Madam.

347
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
Madam.

348
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
I finally found you, madam.

349
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
I'm begging you.

350
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Di?

351
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Di.

352
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Di.

353
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
Di.

354
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Di.

355
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Madam.

356
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
I finally found you.

357
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,800
I'm begging you.

358
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
I'm begging you.

359
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Madam.

360
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Madam.

361
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Madam.

362
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
I'm begging you.

363
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
I'm so hungry.

364
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Hurry and cook.

365
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Don't touch my madam.

366
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
It seems that we can't fight today.

367
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
We can't.

368
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Go back and practice.

369
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Don't let go of the police.

370
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Yes, sir.

371
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
You mean the White-Haired Man is gone again?

372
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Yes.

373
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
I knew it wasn't done by madam.

374
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
But that Longyuan Immortal

375
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
insisted on saying it was madam.

376
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
He not only collected the soldiers of Danxia Jin

377
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
but also found the four respecters.

378
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
And he used the sages to write the war books.

379
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
He didn't know what the sages said.

380
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
He didn't know what the sages said.

381
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
He didn't know what the sages said.

382
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
He even wrote this?

383
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
When did he write this?

384
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
He wrote it when he was unconscious.

385
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Madam.

386
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
The sages must have you in their heart.

387
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
So even if you kill him,

388
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
he still won't let you do it.

389
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
It's all because of Longyuan Immortal.

390
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
He's so stubborn.

391
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
We all laugh at him.

392
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
If we don't know him,

393
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
we all think he's the one who was lost.

394
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Madam.

395
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
I didn't say you were lost.

396
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Since Longyuan is so serious about him,

397
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,800
why did you escape from the storage?

398
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
I forgot everything.

399
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
I sneaked out on the day Longyuan Immortal

400
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
used the sages to write the war books.

401
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Luckily, I got the help of Fan Xian Jun.

402
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
I could get the room in time.

403
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
He asked me to do something.

404
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
He gave you this box.

405
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
He said it was different from the sages.

406
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,800
But it's the last thing he can do for you.

407
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
What is this?

408
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
I don't know. You read it yourself.

409
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
I don't want his stuff.

410
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
I just gave him the stuff.

411
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
If you don't want it, tell him yourself.

412
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
You're from the storage.

413
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
You didn't just come to me for Fan Xian Jun.

414
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
You even told me about this.

415
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Aren't you afraid Longyuan will make things difficult for you?

416
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
I'm afraid you'd misunderstand.

417
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
That's why I sneaked out.

418
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
It's all my fault.

419
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
I've been a bit too careless.

420
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
I didn't get the hang of it.

421
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
I think Xuan Jun woke up today

422
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
and stopped Longyuan.

423
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Bai Jiu Si doesn't want to kill me.

424
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Of course.

425
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Xuan Jun loves you.

426
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Why would he want to kill you?

427
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
You've come to Yun Zong.

428
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
I'm afraid you can't go back to the storage.

429
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
No.

430
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Xuan Jun, you can go back to the storage.

431
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
I can go back to the storage.

432
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
There's no way.

433
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Xuan Jun, where are you going?

434
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
I need to investigate something.

435
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
But if you leave like this,

436
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
I'm afraid Longyuan will...

437
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
This time,

438
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
he won't dare to do it.

439
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
If you don't go back to the storage,

440
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
I won't go back to the storage.

441
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
I'll find them out.

442
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Don't worry.

443
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
I'll go back to the storage.

444
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
I've been a bit careless.

445
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
I'll go back to the storage.

446
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
I'm afraid you can't go back to the storage.

447
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
There's no way.

448
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,800
I'm afraid you can't go back to the storage.

449
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,800
I'll help you find out the order of the two of them.

450
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Who are these two people?

451
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
I don't know.

452
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
You don't know anything?

453
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
How can I find out?

454
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
Can you find out?

455
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Can you?

456
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Can you?

457
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
Can you?

458
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Stay here.

459
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Take this with you.

460
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
You can't stay here anymore.

461
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Let's go back.

462
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
Brother Jiang, are you leaving?

463
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Who said I'm leaving?

464
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
I'm not leaving.

465
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
You said it.

466
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,800
How can you be so afraid of death?

467
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
You abandoned the man who ran away?

468
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Yes.

469
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
You're right.

470
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Now, Cang Lei Hall is in the top of the Jin Yun Sect.

471
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
It's so hard to win.

472
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Even the new books are wasted.

473
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,800
I don't believe that Brother Jiang will leave at this time.

474
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Yes.

475
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
How can I leave the Jin Yun Sect?

476
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
No, no, no.

477
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
No, no, no.

478
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
It's not Bin.

479
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Who told you to take me back?

480
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
I know.

481
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
You must have been so lying to me

482
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
that you changed your mind.

483
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
I didn't change my mind.

484
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
I'm a disciple of the Jin Yun Sect.

485
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
I'm a disciple of the Jin Yun Sect.

486
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,800
I can't leave.

487
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Dad, don't try to persuade me.

488
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
Dad, I'm telling you.

489
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Drink some water.

490
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
You must be thirsty.

491
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
You're so far away.

492
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
Drink more water.

493
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Drink more water.

494
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
You guys go practice dance first.

495
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
I'll be there in a while.

496
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
Let's go, brother.

497
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
We're waiting for you.

498
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
No, you guys have to practice dance.

499
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Don't say that.

500
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Don't say that.

501
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
You really don't want to leave?

502
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Dad,

503
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Cang Lei Hall is now afraid to fight against the Jin Yun Sect.

504
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Now the Jin Yun Sect is safe.

505
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
I didn't leave at that time.

506
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
How can I leave now?

507
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
If I stay here now,

508
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
I'll be in trouble with the Jin Yun Sect.

509
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
At that time,

510
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
I can't save my good.

511
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
But Bin,

512
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
people are more important than words.

513
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Sometimes,

514
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
the name of the first-born disciple

515
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
can't be used.

516
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Dad,

517
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
do you think you can't see your son like this?

518
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
You believe me?

519
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
One day,

520
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,800
I'll be the most important person in the Jin Yun Sect.

521
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Who is it?

522
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Bin, is it you?

523
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Yes.

524
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,800
What can I do for you in the end?

525
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
I have to see what I can do.

526
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Let's go.

527
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
I said I'll let you change.

528
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
Don't look after me.

529
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Now.

530
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
Now.

531
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
Now.

532
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Look for the new disciple.

533
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
The last thing he said was

534
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
he asked me to come to you.

535
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
He didn't say what's wrong with him.

536
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Madam, what's wrong?

537
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,800
You're the forest of Mu Xie.

538
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
Can you show me what's wrong with him?

539
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
What's wrong with him?

540
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
What's wrong?

541
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
What's wrong?

542
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Didn't you bring this to give it to Lin?

543
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm the forest, so it's fine.

544
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Madam, please don't be so agitated.

545
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
There's a flower garden in here.

546
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
Flower garden?

547
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
The flower garden is a unique flower pot in the Imperial Court.

548
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
It was born on the sea of demons.

549
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
It's a flower garden.

550
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
It needs to be planted in a million trees.

551
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
So it's hard to see a tree for a hundred years.

552
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
No matter how many people are sent to this flower garden,

553
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
it will never wake up.

554
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
In the future, we'll die in the dream.

555
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
We'll be able to cure it.

556
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
The flower in the imperial court.

557
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
It's strange.

558
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
It's obviously the flower that Fan Xianjun asked me to give him.

559
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Why are there flowers inside?

560
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,800
Is it because someone wants to kill Fan Ling'er?

561
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
No.

562
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,800
Fan Jiaojiao is forcing us to give her to her.

563
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Otherwise, she will die.

564
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
How is that possible?

565
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,800
How could a father do such a cruel thing to his daughter?

566
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
Do you have a way to cure this flower?

567
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
This flower is very difficult to grow.

568
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,800
I used to see it in the Imperial Court.

569
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
I don't know how to do it.

570
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
I don't know how to do it.

571
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,800
If you want to return Fan Ling'er to the imperial court,

572
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
we should ask her father to pick her up

573
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
or we should send her back to the Canglei Hall.

574
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Are you not sure that this is a trap for a wild girl?

575
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,800
So you can't get out of it no matter what.

576
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
I'm not sure.

577
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,800
So no matter what, you can't get out of it.

578
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,800
No one in Canglei Hall can beat me.

579
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
If one of us can't beat you,

580
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,800
then ten of us will beat ten thousand people.

581
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,800
Besides, we don't know what's going on there.

582
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,800
If we don't choose the right person,

583
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,800
we can't just watch Ling'er die.

584
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
Isn't there still time?

585
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Let's check the situation in Canglei Hall.

586
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
We'll decide if we can do it again.

587
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
There are a few bags of food in the plate.

588
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,800
After we finish it, we'll eat it.

589
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,800
One, two, three, four.

590
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
You can eat it?

591
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Five, six, seven, eight.

592
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Here, call me brother.

593
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,800
I'll buy more bags for you.

594
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,800
Eight, nine, ten.

595
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
Eight, nine, ten.

596
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,800
You're so big!

597
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
You're so big!

598
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
Uncle, brother.

599
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
I told you to practice.

600
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
Why are you drinking again?

601
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,800
What's wrong with you?

602
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
It's none of your business.

603
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,800
He's the eldest in the sect.

604
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
He should participate in some things.

605
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Let's drink together.

606
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Don't drink when you see the master.

607
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
Don't talk too much.

608
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Since you're the master,

609
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,800
we can't just watch him die.

610
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,800
I'll go to Canglei Hall to rest.

611
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,800
I'll just have a look at why he stopped yesterday.

612
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,800
I think we don't need to hurry.

613
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,800
There's still time.

614
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
You're right.

615
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,800
I can go back to the ancient city.

616
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
I'll find a way to cure the poison.

617
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,800
If there's no cure, we won't go to Canglei Hall.

618
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Wait.

619
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
Have you ever thought about it?

620
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
You've been to Canglei Hall for nine days.

621
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
You're the one who got the revenge.

622
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
If you go there,

623
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
you'll be in trouble again.

624
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,800
So why don't you let me go?

625
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Nonsense.

626
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
You're so stupid.

627
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
How can I go?

628
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Well,

629
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,800
you can just go there with your own power.

630
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
I haven't even handed over the key to Canglei Hall.

631
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,800
They won't hate me so much after they see me.

632
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Besides,

633
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,800
the war between two countries is not a war.

634
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,800
The gods should have the same rules.

635
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,800
We'll find out the cure for the poison after this.

636
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Yes.

637
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Why are you here again?

638
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
I'm here to drink with you.

639
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,800
Do you know why I told you to go to Canglei Hall?

640
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
Why?

641
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,800
For you.

642
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
Me?

643
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
I'm here to see you.

644
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
I'm here to see you.

645
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
I'm here to see you.

646
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
I'm here to see you.

647
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
I'm here to see you.

648
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Me?

649
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
You told me last time

650
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,800
that you and Cheng Xuan's grudges.

651
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
I don't think

652
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,800
you have any doubts about it.

653
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
At least I'm your master.

654
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,800
I'm going to be your guest between you and Bai Jiu Si.

655
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
I don't need to be a guest.

656
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,800
That's not necessary.

657
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
You're a playwright.

658
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Of course, you can't see clearly.

659
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,800
I'm a guest of the next level.

660
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
As you said,

661
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,800
Cheng Xuan is a good person.

662
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
He's a good son.

663
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,800
He should have caught you

664
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
when he found you.

665
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
But he didn't take you back to Canglei Hall.

666
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,800
He's too self-righteous.

667
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,800
You're so stupid.

668
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,800
No wonder you haven't been in love for years.

669
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,800
You think so.

670
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,800
I've never asked you about it.

671
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,800
You've done all the things you did to him.

672
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,800
Canglei Hall hasn't been in love with you.

673
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,800
That's enough to prove that he's not a bad person.

674
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
I'm confused too.

675
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,800
Why didn't he do anything?

676
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,800
Maybe he's trying to make a bigger comeback.

677
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
You're so mean.

678
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,800
Forget it.

679
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
I'm your master.

680
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,800
I should teach you how to do things.

681
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,800
Okay, okay.

682
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,800
Don't be so mean.

683
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,800
You're like a wood.

684
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Come on.

685
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
Sit down.

686
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
Come on.

687
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,800
Let's have a good drink tonight.

688
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Come on.

689
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
You're so mean.

690
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
You're so mean.

691
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
You're so mean.

692
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
You've been a murderer for hundreds of years.

693
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800
I understand that.

694
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
You're guilty because of him.

695
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
You're guilty because of him.

696
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,800
You're more like a loser.

697
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800
No matter if he's a good person or not,

698
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,800
his injuries are all gone.

699
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,800
It's all his fault.

700
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,800
But he's not guilty.

701
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,800
I know you know that.

702
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
I've never experienced anything like that.

703
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,800
I'll forgive you for being so mean.

704
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,800
My good disciple.

705
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,800
You hurt him every time.

706
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,800
You hurt yourself every time.

707
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,800
Because you can't let go.

708
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,800
You've been a murderer for hundreds of years.

709
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,800
You've been a murderer for hundreds of years.

710
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,800
You're not a murderer.

711
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,800
You're guilty because of him.

712
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:55,800
I love you
