1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
ella

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
today

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
let's go

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
can someone

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
put a

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
police will

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
with

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The day is 618, so you can win beautifully.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We are the rest of the medicine.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Is this Xu Ying's house?

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You can't go.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Go, go.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Go.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
My name is Sun Ya.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
My husband is Xu Ying.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
My wife is Qingmei's wife.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We have been married for over ten years.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's been more than ten years.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He loves drinking and drinking.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why didn't he listen to me?

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That night, he didn't return.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I thought he was drunk outside.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But I didn't think that

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
someone was outside to find his body.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Did Honglian do it?

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Where does he usually drink?

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Lan Yue House.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Is it here?

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Lan Yue House is the biggest green house in Songhe County.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Since you're the main culprit,

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
you must hold that evil demon to avenge my husband.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm so sorry.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If there's a monster that's harmful,

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
we'll definitely kill it for the people.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Husband.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Did you hear that?

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Husband.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Husband.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Sir, your food is here.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm so happy.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't run.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Follow me.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Didn't you say that it's a monster?

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Why is there no one on the street in the daytime?

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There are so many people in Lan Yue House in the evening.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Of course, there's something here.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's dangerous to make people feel uncomfortable.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You said that Xu Ying's death was really done by Honglian.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why did he hurt people's hearts?

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Do you know Honglian's power?

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He's the one who's been in the lotus field of the River of Nigh.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He's been in many souls' graces.

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So when he's in the shape of a flower, he's got evil spirits.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Every night, the evil spirits on him

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
will be in the body and lead to the pain of the bones.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Only the heart of the dead can be cured.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then can't the evil spirits be cured?

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They can, but they can't.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What do you mean?

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
They can.

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Is that him?

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What are you waiting for?

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This is the spirit of the ghost.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's useful for the master.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Sit down.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The spirit?

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Where is he?

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He was suppressed for hundreds of years.

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He was severely injured.

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He must be nearby to control the spirit of the ghost.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You can't see his body's trace.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He's been living in the world for thousands of years.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He has his own way of hiding it.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So Xuan Sun didn't think he was that powerful.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Good!

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Good!

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Good!

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Good!

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's great!

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's great!

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's great!

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's great!

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's great!

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's great!

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's great!

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's great!

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That's great!

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's great!

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Miss Lin, this is Yang Zhiyu, from my family.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Look, can you see through your eyes?

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Miss Lin, this is the night pearl I bought in Zhongjing.

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is the precious, precious, and precious, Chen Xiangmu.

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I want it, not these pearls.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is your love.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll go there.

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Is it really that beautiful?

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I really like Miss Lin.

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Honglian is the best at making people happy.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Does Shen Zun like her?

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Don't listen to them.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't listen to them, kid.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They're all human beings.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't talk to them.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't talk to them.

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't talk to them.

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't talk to them.

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't talk to them.

149
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't talk to them.

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't talk to them.

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't talk to them.

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't talk to them.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What is that?

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why don't you talk to them?

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
These two wolves

156
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
look like eyes.

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Miss Lin Er is famous in Jiuwen.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We're here for the sake of the name.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This little wolf

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
is so strong.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The people in the Man-tang

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
are just like you.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I wonder if the Wolf King

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and Miss Lin Er

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
would like to have a drink together?

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Then it's better to be quiet than to be impolite.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Wait for me here.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Miss Lin Er.

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Miss Lin Er.

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Miss Lin Er.

171
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Miss Lin Er.

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Miss Lin Er.

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Miss Lin Er.

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Miss Lin Er.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Miss Lin Er.

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Let Help

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,680
Miss Lin Er's

178
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,000
and her life are in ruins.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,560
Nothing in this room

180
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,000
pruses anyone.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,480
Neither of you

182
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,000
get into such a big trouble.

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,440
How can you be so precious?

184
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,640
Come, have a drink.

185
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,640
It seems that Miss Li'er

186
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,240
is very interested in human heart.

187
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,120
It's not that I like it.

188
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
It's just that

189
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,240
the world is too hard to find.

190
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,600
So it seems more precious.

191
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,920
Is Miss Li'er here

192
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,160
just to find out the truth?

193
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,760
I'm waiting for someone.

194
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,440
Waiting for who?

195
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,440
Waiting for someone who doesn't love me.

196
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,960
If you meet him,

197
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,680
can you let him come to me?

198
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,720
What did he tell you?

199
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,160
He said he was waiting for someone.

200
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,440
Do you know who he was waiting for?

201
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,920
I do.

202
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,360
Then let's find him.

203
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Maybe he can help us catch the red lotus.

204
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,720
He doesn't want to meet me.

205
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,840
How can we take the man?

206
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,760
What should we do?

207
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,560
We can only wait for the red lotus to come out first.

208
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,880
What if he runs away?

209
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,800
I've been in the whole Songhe County

210
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,920
and I've been to the bloodline.

211
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,560
He can't escape.

212
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,040
What should we do next?

213
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,720
Wait.

214
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,040
Wait?

215
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,600
He doesn't want to show up.

216
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,640
We can't find his body.

217
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,840
Let's see

218
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
who can't do it first.

219
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,040
But I'm curious.

220
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,160
What did the red lotus do

221
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,960
to be sealed in the prison?

222
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,800
No way!

223
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,040
The red lotus

224
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,320
여�此

225
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,240
Hello, man.

226
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,120
There are a lot of people,

227
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,360
especially you.

228
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,880
You need to be be皇 to seal in the prison.

229
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,280
I can't do nothing.

230
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

231
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,800
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

232
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

233
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

234
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

235
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

236
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

237
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

238
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

239
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

240
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,460
The Third

241
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Ha.

242
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,800
It's your memory again.

243
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,800
You haven't told me who he is in the lotus face.

244
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Lin Mo.

245
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
You're one of the three magic kings?

246
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Good memory.

247
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,800
If that's the case, then it's his fault.

248
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
It's his fault.

249
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Silly girl. He doesn't love you at all.

250
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Who?

251
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,800
You know that he doesn't love you.

252
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

253
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

254
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

255
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

256
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

257
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

258
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

259
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

260
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

261
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

262
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

263
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
It's not the first time I've seen him.

264
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Why is he so surprised?

265
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Don't look at me. This is my illusion.

266
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,800
As long as I don't let no one come in, no one can get out.

267
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
What are you trying to do?

268
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Why don't you guess?

269
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,800
I'm trying to avoid the silence.

270
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
You're so smart.

271
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Sit down.

272
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,800
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

273
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Sit down.

274
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
I've been avoiding you for hundreds of years.

275
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Are you sure he'll come?

276
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,800
It depends on how important you are to Bai Jiu Si.

277
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,800
It depends on whether he'll come to see me because of you.

278
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,800
If he doesn't want to, that's fine.

279
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Even if I help you to get a person out of this world,

280
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,800
he will.

281
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,800
You still don't understand men.

282
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,800
No matter how much he loves you,

283
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
I might not be like that.

284
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,800
I've been living for thousands of years.

285
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
I've seen a lot of people.

286
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,800
I'm not a man.

287
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Not all men are like that.

288
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Do you know what this is?

289
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Evil spirit.

290
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Looks like Bai Jiu Si told you about this.

291
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,800
It's the evil spirit.

292
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,800
Every time I see it, I feel so sick.

293
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,800
The dream on the bridge of the river told me

294
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
that only the heart of the person who truly loves me

295
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,800
can erase the evil spirit on me.

296
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,800
What a pity. I've been waiting for thousands of years.

297
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,800
This evil spirit still hasn't been removed.

298
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Guess why?

299
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Maybe...

300
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,800
I'll let you see it yourself.

301
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Then you'll understand.

302
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
We grew up together.

303
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
We're still young.

304
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
We've already discussed this.

305
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
As long as you don't mind,

306
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,800
I'll go to your house to propose tomorrow.

307
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Okay.

308
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Lian Er, you've promised me.

309
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,800
That's great.

310
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Lian Er has promised to marry me!

311
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Lian Er has promised to marry me!

312
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,800
He has promised!

313
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
What do you want me to see?

314
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
This...

315
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
What is this?

316
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,800
This person is still my ex-wife.

317
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Who is it?

318
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Who's knocking?

319
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Wake up. Wake up.

320
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Miss Hong Lian, thank you for saving my life.

321
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,800
I'll definitely marry you with my high-level honor.

322
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
I'll wait for you.

323
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Lian Er!

324
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Lian Er!

325
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Lian Er, I'm back to marry you.

326
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Lian Er!

327
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Lian Er!

328
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Lian Er!

329
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Lian Er!

330
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Lian Er!

331
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Lian Er!

332
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Lian Er!

333
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Lian Er!

334
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Lian Er!

335
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Lian Er!

336
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Lian Er!

337
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Lian Er!

338
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Lian Er!

339
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Lian Er!

340
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Lian Er!

341
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Lian Er!

342
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Lian Er!

343
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Did you see it clearly?

344
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Whether it's the life and death of the princess, the life and death of the old maid,

345
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
or the high mountains and the flowing water,

346
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
they are all fake.

347
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
They are very affectionate.

348
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,800
But they don't have anyone to marry me.

349
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
Do you think it's funny?

350
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
You killed them?

351
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
I didn't marry them.

352
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
I just married them with their new blood.

353
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,800
Since you have decided to marry a man,

354
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
why do you insist on looking for Li Mo?

355
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
He's different.

356
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
What's different?

357
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
He doesn't love me.

358
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Only he doesn't love me.

359
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Then why do you insist on looking for him?

360
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
It's me.

361
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:09,800
I have to find a way to find a way to find him.

362
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Okay.

363
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Someone is here to see me.

364
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
I won't play with you anymore.

365
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Good girl.

366
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,800
I'll go and check on Bai Jiu Si's true feelings for you.

367
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
What do you want?

368
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Let me out!

369
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Stop!

370
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Come back!

371
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Let me out!

372
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Come back!

373
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Come back!

374
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Come back!

375
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
It's just a puppet.

376
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
You can't hurt me.

377
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,800
If you want to kill me, you can kill me.

378
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Where's he?

379
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Where can Li Mo come to exchange?

380
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
If you want to see him,

381
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
you need to see him personally.

382
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
You think I'm stupid?

383
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,800
If it's my body standing in front of you,

384
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,800
I'm not qualified to fight with you here.

385
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
How about this?

386
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,800
I heard that the blood curse of the Cang Lei Hall

387
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
I have to listen to it.

388
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
As long as you give Li Mo a chance,

389
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,800
I'll tell you where Li Qing Yue is.

390
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
How about that?

391
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Where?

392
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Li Qing Yue is inside.

393
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
But I have to remind you first.

394
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,800
It's hard to get in and out.

395
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
That's right.

396
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
This is the trap I set up.

397
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
Do you dare to see it?

398
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,800
It's getting interesting.

399
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Shen Zui!

400
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Shen Zui!

401
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Shen Zui!

402
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
There's only one person inside.

403
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Bai Jiu Si, you only have one chance.

404
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
If you make a mistake,

405
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,800
then this little girl will be in trouble.

406
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
If you make a mistake,

407
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,800
then this little girl will be locked up in the ice.

408
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Then, you'll be the one to make a mistake.

409
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
You won't be able to come back.

410
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Shen Zui!

411
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
I'm the real one.

412
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Don't listen to them.

413
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
I'm the real one.

414
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Shen Zui!

415
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
I'm Qing Yue.

416
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Shen Zui!

417
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Shen Zui!

418
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Shen Zui!

419
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
They're all fake.

420
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
I'm the real one.

421
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
I'm the real one.

422
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Shen Zui!

423
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Shen Zui, look at me.

424
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Shen Zui!

425
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Shen Zui!

426
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Bai Jiu Si, are you sure you're not looking?

427
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Those memories

428
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,800
will accompany me to the end of the sky.

429
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
How did Xuan Zui know it was me?

430
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,800
We won't bear to make mistakes.

431
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
We'll remember it.

432
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,800
I knew Xuan Zui would be the best to me.

433
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,800
It really touched me.

434
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
If that's the case,

435
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,800
I won't bother you two.

436
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
You can't leave.

437
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
You have to let us out.

438
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
When I see Li Mo,

439
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
I'll let you two go.

440
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
What if he doesn't come?

441
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Are you going to keep an eye on us?

442
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Speak!

443
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Shen Zui,

444
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
do you have a way out?

445
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
No.

446
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
What should we do?

447
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Take her away.

448
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Shen Zui,

449
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
am I dragging you down again?

450
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
No.

451
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Get up!

452
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Get up!

453
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
Get up!

454
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Thank you, Shen Zui.

455
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Shen Zui,

456
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
are you okay?

457
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
I'm fine.

458
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
I'm fine.

459
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
I'm fine.

460
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
I'm fine.

461
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
I'm fine.

462
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,800
I'm fine.

463
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
I'm fine.

464
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
I'm fine.

465
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
I'm fine.

466
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm fine.

467
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
I'm fine.

468
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
I'm fine.

469
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
I'm fine.

470
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Why are you playing this song?

471
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
You're the disciple of Jin Yun Sect?

472
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
How is Brother Meng?

473
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
I'm not hungry.

474
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
I have something to ask you.

475
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
I'll come here secretly.

476
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Brother Meng said that you saw this letter.

477
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
You'll understand.

478
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
You want to go to the Sky of Nine Flames?

479
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Yes.

480
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Follow me.

481
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,800
The Sky of Nine Flames is the first sect leader

482
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,800
in the world to be able to communicate with the world.

483
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
The first sect leader of my sect

484
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,800
is the one who is here to attack the Great City.

485
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
He's flying for nine days.

486
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Most valuable evidence

487
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,800
will soon be found.

488
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,800
This is the Holy debutedoger of my Soul Land, the Sky of Nine Flames.

489
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,800
You cankho, and avoid his不行 in order to obtain the heart heart.

491
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,960
HunListener will turn into

492
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,880
Halloween soon.

493
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,760
It truly is a bridge отвendenent

494
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,680
bridge with a palace layout.

495
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,660
This is an 칙

497
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:35,160
The Wushu Somey

498
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,480
Why couldn't it be

499
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,700
who can't suffer from pain Cameron

500
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,040

Whirl

503
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,480
It is whoever is hidden

504
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,300
What is he going to

505
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,940
Do you think I will change?

506
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,840
What do you handle me?

507
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,680
Something bubbled

508
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:16,660
Yes, but for no

509
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,380
I want you to save Brother Meng

510
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,660
You should know him best

511
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,020
If he wants to leave, he should leave

512
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,700
You are all unadulterated idiots

513
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,620
I helped you today

514
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,420
You need to help me send a letter to Brother Meng in the future

515
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,380
As long as it doesn't hurt Brother Meng

516
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,620
It's okay

517
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,620
Of course

518
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,540
After all, it's Brother Meng's sect

519
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,100
Okay

520
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,780
I promise you

521
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,300
在星湾 admissions district

522
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,140
I came here for your gleichen

523
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:51,860
to send a했

524
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,060
You eat it

525
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,100
And I shall believe you

526
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:54,820
In the future

527
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,820
You have come to me every month

528
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,500
Otherwise it'll ruin

529
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,340
your marital較

530
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,220
Can you makes way now

531
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,660
I'm curious now.

532
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,660
Who is the one who doesn't want to take care of the price?

533
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,660
Master, have you eaten yet?

534
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
What do you think?

535
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,660
Next time, I really need to start training my butt.

536
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,660
If I keep waiting like this, I'm really afraid that I'll starve to death.

537
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,660
Xuan Zi, come with me and talk to me.

538
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,660
Let's turn our attention.

539
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,660
What do you want to talk about?

540
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,660
What exactly happened between Li Mo Xian Jun and Hong Lian?

541
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,660
It's worth his 100 years of knowledge?

542
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,660
I don't know.

543
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
You're not Li Mo Xian Jun's teacher, are you?

544
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,660
How do you not know?

545
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,660
After I sealed Hong Lian, Li Mo defeated me.

546
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,660
I didn't ask much if he didn't want to mention it.

547
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,660
I thought I could find some clues that could be found in their past.

548
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,660
Xuan Zi, look.

549
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,660
Before you came,

550
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,660
Hong Lian showed me several of his past.

551
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,660
You've solved this.

552
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,660
Do you think these are all his memories?

553
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,660
Hong Lian's mind is Li Mo Xian Jun's.

554
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,660
I'm not sure.

555
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,660
Hong Lian's mind is Li Mo Xian Jun's.

556
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,660
We've figured out what happened in their past.

557
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,660
Can we find a way out of this?

558
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,660
We can.

559
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,660
Wait.

560
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,660
What is this?

561
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,660
The Heart-Burning Talisman.

562
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,660
I can tell where you're going to be next.

563
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,660
I'll start.

564
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,660
Liar!

565
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,660
You're all liars!

566
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,660
Stop!

567
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,660
You've been doing this for several times.

568
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,660
What's wrong with you?

569
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,660
You're a demon.

570
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,660
You're a form of drawing.

571
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,660
You should practice with your heart.

572
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,660
How could you learn these evil tricks?

573
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,660
You even hurt people.

574
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,660
What's the use of this?

575
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,660
I'm just trying to make it clear.

576
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,660
You're a god.

577
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,660
You'll be punished by the god.

578
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,660
Have you ever tasted the evil spirit of the demon?

579
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,660
The smell of the evil spirit on you?

580
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,660
Have you ever tasted the essence of your skin?

581
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,660
The pain of being torn apart?

582
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,660
The pain of being healed?

583
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,660
What do you mean?

584
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,660
I've been trying to make it clear.

585
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,660
You say...

586
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,660
The god...

587
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,660
has never been fair to me.

588
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,660
It seems like Honglian is a little pitiful.

589
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,660
I just want to be sincere.

590
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,660
I want to protect Zhou Jian.

591
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,660
But all of this...

592
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,660
is fake.

593
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,660
If that's the case,

594
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,660
let me help you.

595
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,660
These are indeed Honglian's memories.

596
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,660
Mr. Xuan, do you want to continue?

597
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,660
Go on.

598
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,660
These are all the traps left by the mortal.

599
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,660
There are many injured animals.

600
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,660
Can you save them?

601
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,660
I'll try to save one.

602
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,660
It's really hard to adapt to the dark trap here.

603
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,660
Mr. Xuan, don't you feel dizzy?

604
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,660
You came just in time.

605
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,660
This rabbit is just right.

606
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,660
It smells so good.

607
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,660
Do you want to eat it together?

608
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,660
Mr. Xuan, I...

609
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,660
This is a trap.

610
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,660
It's all fake.

611
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,660
What's wrong?

612
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,660
Are you angry?

613
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,660
There are many spirit weapons here.

614
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,660
You've lost a few of your evil energy

615
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,660
after practicing here.

616
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,660
These can cure your evil energy.

617
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,660
You can take them.

618
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,660
You've been taking me

619
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,660
for a hundred of pills these days.

620
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,660
But I haven't seen you well.

621
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,660
Can you eat them?

622
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,660
Your evil energy has been in your body for too long.

623
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,660
You can't eat it.

624
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,660
You have to take it slowly.

625
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,660
I'll take it slowly.

626
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,660
I'll take it slowly.

627
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,660
You have to take it slowly.

628
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,660
Actually,

629
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,660
I have a way to cure my evil energy faster.

630
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,660
Why don't you come and love me?

631
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,660
I'll use your blood

632
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,660
to cure you.

633
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,660
Sorry.

634
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,660
I'm just a poison.

635
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,660
I can't love you.

636
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,660
Mr. Xuan,

637
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,660
do you think this evil energy

638
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,660
will really not move?

639
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,660
Is that all you have?

640
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,660
Mr. Xuan,

641
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,660
do you think this evil energy

642
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,660
will really not move?

643
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,660
I don't think so.

644
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,660
I don't think so.

645
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,660
I don't think so.

646
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,660
I don't think so.

647
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,660
I don't think so.

648
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:32,660
I don't think so.

649
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,660
I don't think so.

650
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,660
I don't think so.

651
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,660
I don't think so.

652
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,660
I don't think so.

653
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,660
I don't think so.

654
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,660
I don't think so.

655
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,660
I don't think so.

656
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,660
I don't think so.

657
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,660
Someone told me

658
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,660
something was wrong.

659
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,660
Maybe I was wrong.

660
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:54,660
I don't think so.

661
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,660
I don't think so.

662
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,660
I don't think so.

663
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,660
I'm just a poison.

664
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,660
It won't move.

665
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,660
I'll take it slowly.

666
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,660
I Web dogs.

667
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:06,660
I don't think so.

668
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,660
Mr. Xuan,

669
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

670
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

671
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

672
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

673
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

674
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

675
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

676
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

677
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

678
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

679
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

680
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

681
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

682
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

683
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

684
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

685
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

686
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

687
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

688
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

689
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

690
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

691
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

692
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

693
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

694
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

695
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

696
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

697
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

698
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

699
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

700
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

701
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.

702
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,660

I'm not sure if I can do it.

711
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,660
I'm not sure if I can do it.
