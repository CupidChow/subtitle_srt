3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,080
I'm not sure if I can make it.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
I'll try to make it.

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
I'll try to make it.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,080
I'll try to make it.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,080
I'll try to make it.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,080
I'll try to make it.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,080
I'll try to make it.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,080
I'll try to make it.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,080
I'll try to make it.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,080
I'll try to make it.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,080
I'll try to make it.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
I'll try to make it.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,080
I'll try to make it.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,080
I'll try to make it.

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,080
I'll try to make it.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,080
I'll try to make it.

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,080
I'll try to make it.

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,080
I'll try to make it.

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,080
I'll try to make it.

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,080
I'll try to make it.

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
I'll try to make it.

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,080
I'll try to make it.

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,080
I'll try to make it.

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
I'll try to make it.

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,080
I'll try to make it.

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
I'll try to make it.

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
I'll try to make it.

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
I'll try to make it.

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
I'll try to make it.

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
I'll try to make it.

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
I'll try to make it.

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
I'll try to make it.

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
I'll try to make it.

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,080
I'll try to make it.

37
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,080
I'll try to make it.

38
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,080
I'll try to make it.

39
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,080
I'll try to make it.

40
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,080
I'll try to make it.

41
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,080
I'll try to make it.

42
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,080
I'll try to make it.

43
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,080
I'll make it.

44
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,580
I'm not staying W underscore...

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,080
No!

46
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
No!

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
No!

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
No!

49
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
Why?

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
I'll help you.

51
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Don't come over!

52
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
Don't come over!

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Wait!

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
What are you doing?

55
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
I don't need any herbs.

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,080
My blood is not good enough.

57
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
I'll help you.

58
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
No!

59
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
I have a question.

60
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
What question?

61
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,080
If this is just a illusion created by the fox,

62
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,080
why would it put so many ice petals in it?

63
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
I don't know.

64
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,080
I don't know.

65
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,080
I don't know.

66
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,080
I don't know.

67
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,080
I don't know.

68
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,080
I don't know.

69
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,080
I don't know.

70
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,080
What we just saw is a fake.

71
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,080
Then I can only ask Li Mo.

72
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,080
I think it's true.

73
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,080
I know that

74
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,080
Hong Lian is in love with Li Mo Xian Jun.

75
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,080
But in the memory we saw just now,

76
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
Li Mo Xian Jun was not black.

77
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,080
I don't think Hong Lian needs to create fake memories for us.

78
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
And I've said that

79
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Hong Lian was sealed for hundreds of years.

80
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
It's not as strong as before.

81
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,080
It's not a ritual to create a person who can keep your spirit.

82
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
So I have an idea.

83
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
You want to...

84
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Destroy everything here.

85
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Stand behind me.

86
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,080
Come on.

87
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
Is it real?

88
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Yes.

89
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
I guessed it right.

90
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Those illusions are really her real body.

91
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Little girl.

92
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
I really underestimated you.

93
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,080
Xuan Sun, hurry and catch her.

94
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Hong Lian.

95
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
Come back to the prison with me.

96
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
I'll keep you alive.

97
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,080
Xuan Sun.

98
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Xuan Sun.

99
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Help.

100
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Help.

101
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
Help.

102
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
What's wrong?

103
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
I'm in trouble.

104
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
I'm in trouble.

105
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,080
Don't be afraid. Take me to see.

106
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
Let's go.

107
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Let's go.

108
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Don't waste your energy.

109
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Don't move.

110
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Be careful.

111
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
This is not a trap.

112
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,080
It's just the lowest level of the monster.

113
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
I've already removed the control.

114
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
It's okay now.

115
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Can you please help me to tie her up?

116
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
I'm not...

117
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
She's like this.

118
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
I'm not...

119
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
I'm not...

120
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
I'm not...

121
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
She's like this again.

122
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
Okay.

123
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Then you find a rope.

124
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
Bai Jiu Si.

125
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Your spiritual power

126
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,080
didn't go down half of your life before.

127
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
It seems that this time you forced yourself to leave the coffin.

128
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,080
The internal injury you suffered

129
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
is grave.

130
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Do you know

131
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,080
what the biggest weakness of these gods is?

132
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
They are too trusting.

133
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
You must know

134
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,080
that sometimes people's hearts are more vulnerable

135
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,080
than demons.

136
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,080
This is the way we taught the sect.

137
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Even if she's controlled by others,

138
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
she can't be controlled.

139
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Thank you, Miss.

140
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
I have something to do.

141
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
I'll go first.

142
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
I saw you changing your mind

143
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
and giving Li Qing Yue the bronze gold talisman.

144
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
If I remember correctly,

145
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,080
other than being able to change the position of the bronze talisman,

146
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
if the person who was scared of the talisman was hurt,

147
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
the person who drew the talisman

148
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
will also be divided into half.

149
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
If Li Qing Yue dies,

150
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,080
will you have to leave half of your life?

151
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Xiaobao.

152
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
It's not that easy.

153
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
It's you.

154
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Why are you...

155
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Why did you go up the door?

156
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
What?

157
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Xun Ying's soul bomb died.

158
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Why did you go up the door to investigate?

159
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
It's you who killed Xun Ying.

160
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
It's him who should die.

161
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Wei Yan.

162
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Where are you going?

163
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Where are you going, Xiaobao?

164
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
It's you again.

165
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
I'll go get you.

166
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Are you going to stop bothering me?

167
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
Get out.

168
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Wei Yan.

169
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
You're drunk.

170
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
Get out.

171
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Tell me.

172
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,080
I'm telling you,

173
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
don't you understand?

174
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
You're not my brother.

175
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
I'm just a little girl.

176
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Just get out.

177
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
If you keep saying that,

178
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
I'm going to get angry.

179
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
You're bothering me again?

180
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
I'm still hitting you.

181
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Xiaobao.

182
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Wei Yan.

183
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Xiaobao.

184
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
Wei Yan.

185
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
Wei Yan.

186
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Wei Yan.

187
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Wei Yan.

188
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
That's right.

189
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
That's me too.

190
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Wei Yan.

191
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
Sister.

192
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
You should be afraid.

193
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
It's not me.

194
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,080
Is it worth it for a man like him?

195
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
You're a real man.

196
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Do you really want to live?

197
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Wei Yan.

198
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Where are you?

199
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
Wei Yan.

200
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
Where are you?

201
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,080
I was wondering

202
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080
why this man would change.

203
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
We were together since childhood.

204
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Why did he change so suddenly?

205
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,080
I just wanted to see if he was still in love.

206
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,080
His heart is red.

207
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Why did he do such a thing

208
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
that he was so heartless?

209
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
So before we came here,

210
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,080
you and Hong Lian got along well.

211
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
Get along?

212
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
He was helping me.

213
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,080
I don't think you two are black and white.

214
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,080
You two are just talking about the demon.

215
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Why are you two so mean?

216
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,080
You don't care about the evil people.

217
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,080
You treat us like poor people.

218
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
We're not black and white.

219
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
We're just a stranger to your husband.

220
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
That's right.

221
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
He really dares to...

222
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Stop it.

223
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
I don't believe you two are so mean.

224
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
You're talking about the evil people.

225
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Hong Lian helped me so much.

226
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
I'm a demon.

227
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
I'm a demon.

228
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,080
I should help him.

229
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Bai Jiu Si,

230
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
how can I see you win?

231
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,080
You're so hard to kill.

232
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
You can't even die.

233
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
If you're broken by the dragon,

234
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
you'll be able to live.

235
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,080
You're so cruel.

236
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
You're so cruel.

237
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,080
You're so cruel.

238
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
You're so cruel.

239
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
You can't even live.

240
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,080
This is the poison that can cure the illness.

241
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
Take it.

242
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,080
This time, you'll have to use me.

243
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,080
Hong Lian and the people in the mountain are all on fire.

244
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,080
The Xuan Sun has been chasing Hong Lian.

245
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
Maybe he's in danger now.

246
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,080
We have to find him as soon as possible.

247
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
The Xuan Sun has been chasing Hong Lian.

248
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,080
He's coming.

249
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
Let's go.

250
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,080
Go.

251
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Go.

252
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,080
Go.

253
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
Go.

254
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,080
Go.

255
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,080
Go.

256
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,080
Go.

257
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,080
Go.

258
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Go.

259
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Go.

260
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
Go.

261
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Go.

262
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,080
Go.

263
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Go.

264
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Go.

265
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Go.

266
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,080
Li Mo.

267
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,080
You finally came to see me.

268
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Xuan Zun! Are you okay?

269
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,080
Li Mo Xian Jun!

270
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Let's go.

271
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Don't go!

272
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
Let's go.

273
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
Don't go!

274
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,080
You killed me!

275
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
Chun Fang

276
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
The whole heaven

277
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
You made as you fell to the ground

278
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
After such a big flag,

279
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,080
all social chaos spread over the earth

280
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
You thought that the little boy could beよろated

281
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,080
But not Being applications,

282
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
When waves of frustration were hanging from a sertopen

283
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,980
He has poor incomplete longevity.

284
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,360
This is truly Japanese-grown.

285
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
Honglian is a great demon.

286
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
Master has been living with fire for a long time.

287
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
He is a great master.

288
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,080
But you are also a master of the Yin-sui.

289
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
Why do you have so much power?

290
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,080
Master has been in a bad state.

291
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,080
I have been taking the medicine for the evil spirit.

292
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,080
Now, I am hurt again.

293
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
I can't recover for a few months.

294
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,080
This...

295
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
Why are you so weak?

296
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Master has been getting the fire-resistant magic for the spirit.

297
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Why did you disappear suddenly?

298
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
I wouldn't have disappeared without any fear.

299
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
I am so strong.

300
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
If I am not here,

301
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
I will be hiding somewhere.

302
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Master still suspects me.

303
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Master, you are awake.

304
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
Eat something.

305
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
You don't need to eat.

306
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
Do you want to eat, too?

307
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
I don't need to.

308
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
What are we going to do next?

309
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
Catch Honglian?

310
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
Time is too short.

311
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
I only cured Master's external injury.

312
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
Now, Master's internal injury is serious.

313
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
We need time to recuperate.

314
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
We can fight with Honglian again.

315
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
Then, you are the one.

316
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
I am not a Honglian.

317
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,080
But you just flew him away.

318
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Okay.

319
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,080
Then,

320
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
we can hide some of the patient.

321
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
We can't.

322
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
What do you mean?

323
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Now, I am suffering from internal injury.

324
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Honglian has been hiding his strength.

325
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
He changed my way of healing.

326
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
Now, I can't leave this place.

327
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,080
He has become our home.

328
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
It's okay.

329
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,080
It's time for Longyue to go to Xuantian Tree.

330
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
It's time to come back.

331
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
We will definitely reach this place.

332
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,080
Before that, we can only hide from Honglian.

333
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
That's all.

334
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,080
We can't make a living from the conflict.

335
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
Honglian has been looking for you.

336
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
He won't let us hide like this.

337
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
Let's go.

338
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
Hurry.

339
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
Don't go.

340
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
Lin Mo Xian Juan.

341
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,440
Xuan and I have seen your past in the

342
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,080
Honglian's illusion.

343
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,080
Didn't you two have a good relationship?

344
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
Why are you making this up?

345
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Xuan didn't ask you before.

346
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
He respected your choice.

347
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,080
But now, you can't talk about it.

348
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Why don't you tell me?

349
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,080
Let me see if I can get along with Xuan.

350
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
How much do you know?

351
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,080
I know you wanted to help Honglian get rid of the evil spirit.

352
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,080
You even gave him your own blood.

353
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
That makes sense.

354
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
He should be grateful to you.

355
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,080
Why did you hide from him?

356
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,080
I didn't hide from him because I didn't want him to be too obsessed.

357
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,080
Consciousness?

358
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,080
Honglian has been a businessman.

359
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
He has been a star.

360
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,080
He is just to relieve his evil spirit.

361
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
I have been with him since I met him.

362
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,080
I have been with him for over ten years.

363
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,080
At first, I just wanted to find a way to cure him.

364
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,080
But I didn't expect that he would come.

365
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,080
Then I got him another kind of illness.

366
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
What illness?

367
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
Poisonous illness.

368
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Lin Mo.

369
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
You...

370
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
What are you doing?

371
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,080
Why are you holding him?

372
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,080
I am giving him some medicine.

373
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
Didn't you say you would cure me?

374
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Why are you taking care of them now?

375
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
I will find a way to cure your illness.

376
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
I will not leave you alone.

377
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,080
You are not leaving me alone now, are you?

378
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
You are the same as them.

379
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,080
I will be with you forever.

380
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
You are different.

381
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
I will be with you forever.

382
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
You are using your blood to save others?

383
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
Don't be angry.

384
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,080
If others know about this,

385
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,080
they will misunderstand me as a monster.

386
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,080
It's okay.

387
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,080
You can take the medicine later.

388
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
So you treat everyone like this.

389
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
What?

390
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,080
What are you doing?

391
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
Lin Mo.

392
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,080
Can't you see that I like you?

393
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,080
You don't need to be so stubborn.

394
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,080
My heart is bleeding.

395
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,080
Since you are angry,

396
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
I will find a way to cure your illness.

397
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,080
I will not leave you alone.

398
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,080
I will not leave you alone.

399
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,080
I will do it.

400
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
You don't believe my love for you?

401
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,080
The letter is meaningless.

402
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,080
I said that I only have the heart of an old man.

403
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,080
I have the heart of a man and a woman.

404
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
Don't do that.

405
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,080
Since that,

406
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,080
then you can only be with me.

407
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,080
The person who can cure you is the one who can cure you.

408
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
No matter how hard you try,

409
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
you will make me feel bad.

410
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,080
Then I can't leave you with me.

411
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,080
I will not leave you alone.

412
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
Come.

413
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,080
What did you do?

414
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
If you save someone,

415
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,080
you can only save me.

416
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,080
Your blood can only be given to me.

417
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,080
What did you do?

418
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,080
What did you do?

419
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,080
What did you do?

420
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,080
I am at the edge of the river.

421
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,080
I am in a bad mood.

422
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Your blood can only be given to me.

423
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,080
And my blood can only be given to you.

424
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
Tell me.

425
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Are we two perfect?

426
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,080
Why do you want to kill their lives?

427
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
Only by killing them,

428
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
can you save their lives.

429
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Then you won't save others.

430
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,080
I said,

431
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
you can only be with me.

432
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
Now you are fine.

433
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,080
You don't have to make it difficult.

434
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,080
From now on,

435
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
I will only need you.

436
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
What happened?

437
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
What happened later?

438
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,080
Later,

439
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,080
I couldn't bear to take my own life

440
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,080
and killed a few lives.

441
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,080
I never wanted to see Hong Lian again.

442
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,080
Then you started to hide from him?

443
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
I was just a reason to know.

444
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,080
I can only save others.

445
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,080
I can't kill him.

446
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,080
You were the one who helped Feng Yi and Hong Lian

447
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,080
to kill him?

448
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
No.

449
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
I was just looking for him.

450
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,080
You mean...

451
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
Yes.

452
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,080
They were in the village

453
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,080
and they were able to seal Hong Lian.

454
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,080
So I went to see him.

455
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
But I was guilty.

456
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
He kept making trouble to see you.

457
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,080
Didn't he go to see you?

458
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
I was guilty.

459
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Now I just want to make up for it.

460
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
I will do my best

461
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,080
to solve the crime I committed.

462
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,080
What about him?

463
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,080
He doesn't care.

464
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,080
I was too weak.

465
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,080
I used to think

466
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,080
that I could kill him

467
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
to make up for it.

468
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
Now he has been sealed

469
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
and I have to punish him.

470
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
He is the only one you can kill.

471
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
You must hide.

472
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
You can't.

473
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
I am so heartless.

474
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Please forgive me.

475
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,080
I can't forgive you.

476
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
You really don't like Hong Lian?

477
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,080
I don't.

478
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,080
No.

479
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,080
No?

480
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,080
No wonder.

481
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,080
You can't understand the nature of a person who likes to be self-centered.

482
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,080
That's not a trap.

483
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,080
That's the love that's born out of love.

484
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,080
I've seen Hong Lian acting like a man before.

485
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
It's only different from you.

486
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,080
I think it's the first time he's learned to love.

487
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,080
What do you mean?

488
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,080
I just...

489
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
I just thought about it.

490
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,080
Hong Lian is so evil.

491
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,080
But he's a demon.

492
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,080
As you said, he's been tortured and tortured for a long time.

493
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,080
He only wants to protect himself.

494
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,080
No one calls him a good man.

495
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,080
But if you start it,

496
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,080
you can explain it to him with a clear mind.

497
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
You can make him feel better.

498
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,080
Then there won't be any later disaster.

499
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
Of course.

500
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
You don't have a boyfriend for Hong Lian.

501
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
That's not your fault.

502
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
You just keep avoiding him.

503
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
And make him feel more and more crazy.

504
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,080
That's not appropriate.

505
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,080
I didn't expect you to be so filial to my boyfriend.

506
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,080
I know how to love.

507
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,080
I like Xuan Zun.

508
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,080
You're just talking about your boyfriend.

509
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
Can you hear our conversation?

510
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
I know.

511
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,080
I just said it on purpose.

512
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
Lin Mo Xian.

513
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,080
I think Xuan Zun's spirit power is a bit stable.

514
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,080
Is he in the family?

515
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,080
But I think you love him.

516
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
I don't.

517
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
Don't be so serious.

518
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,080
There are millions of lovers in the world.

519
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,080
Not only men and women.

520
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,080
What's wrong?

521
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Be careful.

522
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,080
What's this?

523
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Hong Lian's spirit power.

524
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,080
Did he find us?

525
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
No.

526
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,080
But he forced us to appear.

527
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,080
He forced us?

528
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
Could he be...

529
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,080
The entire Lingfeng Songhe County.

530
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,080
What about the people there?

531
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,080
I don't think I'll see them.

532
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,080
So I asTVU each other,

533
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,080
I will keep a secret until my eyes meet the hint

534
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,080
of criminals.

535
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,080
What if we can't stop capturing a sweet talk to Nian me?

536
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Good, good.

537
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Why don't we murder our little間 incomplete.

538
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
Then we want to get rid of her.

539
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Is that gonna happen?

540
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,080
It's time to find her to solve the problem.

541
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,080
Let's go together.

542
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,080
You don't understand a man and a woman.

543
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,080
I'm afraid you'll say something and make her fight.

544
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,080
Let's go together.

545
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,080
This shield can protect you from being hurt by the frost.

546
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
Let's go.

547
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,080
Honglian, stop.

548
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:56,080
You haven't changed your mind about saving people for so many years.

549
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,080
You want to see me? I'm already here.

550
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Don't hurt the people in Songhe County.

551
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,080
I want to see you.

552
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,080
But I've been sealed for hundreds of years.

553
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Why didn't you come to see me?

554
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,080
You're still blaming me for letting you kill me?

555
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,080
Why don't I let you be a murderer and let you stop avoiding me?

556
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,080
No!

557
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Master, you can't move your power anymore.

558
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,080
I'll help you.

559
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,080
You're better in terms of health.

560
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,080
Hurry up and solve your problems.

561
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,080
Go.

562
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,080
I won't hide from you this time.

563
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,080
Don't make mistakes again.

564
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,080
Maybe I'll be the one to pay you back the crimes you committed.

565
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,080
Crimes?

566
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,080
I've never felt guilty.

567
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,080
You're the one who decided to pay me back the crimes.

568
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,080
You're the one who saved me.

569
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,080
You saved others.

570
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,080
You're the one who committed the crime.

571
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,080
I've never thought about taking you away.

572
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,080
But you did it.

573
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:58,080
For hundreds of years, I've been tortured by the evil spirit.

574
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,080
I've never believed in anyone.

575
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,080
I only believed in you.

576
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
But you?

577
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,080
But how do you dare to drive me away?

578
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,080
It's useless.

579
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,080
You said you were a doctor.

580
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,080
You saved others.

581
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,080
You didn't even save me.

582
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,080
You saved others.

583
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,080
What's the difference between you and those men?

584
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,080
Lord Yimo, I can't hold on anymore.

585
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,080
You're the one who saved me.

586
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
You did it.

587
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,080
You're the one who saved me.

588
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,080
I know you can do it.

589
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,080
You saved others.

590
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
You did it.

591
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,080
You saved others.

592
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,080
You didn't even save me.

593
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,080
But you did it.

594
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,080
You did it.

595
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,080
You did it.

596
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,080
You did it.

597
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:16,080
Before that, I was not in the hands of others.

598
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,080
This time, I will talk to you.

599
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
Do you love me?

600
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,080
Mr. Li Mo, just say you love him.

601
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,080
How can you do that?

602
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
I...

603
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,080
No need.

604
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
I don't need this.

605
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Hong Ling.

606
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,080
Hong Ling, what are you doing?

607
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
Xuan Tzu.

608
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
Xuan Tzu.

609
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
Let's go.

610
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,080
Hong Ling, enough.

611
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,080
Xuan Tzu.

612
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
Let me go.

613
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Let me go.

614
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
Let me go.

615
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
Let me go.

616
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,080
Xuan Tzu.

617
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,080
A-Yu.

618
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,080
Xuan Yi.

619
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,080
Xuan Yi.

620
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,080
Xuan Yi.

621
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,080
I love you.

622
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,080
I love you.

623
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,080
I love you.

624
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,080
I love you.
