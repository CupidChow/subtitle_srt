00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,340
[FEUD]

2
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,030
[Episode 3]

3
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,580
[Cang Tu]

4
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,280
I am Cang Tu, the steward
of Canglei Palace.

5
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,410
Greetings, My Lady.

6
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,190
So this is the Canglei Palace where
the Heavenly Lord lives?

7
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,470
It's completely different from
what I imagined.

8
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,070
It's actually quite modest.

9
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,220
This is the courtyard for you
to live in, My Lady.

10
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,780
Won't I be living with the Heavenly Lord?

11
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,770
His Lordship is tied up with affairs.
He will come when he's finished.

12
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,800
But isn't today the day

13
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,030
the Heavenly Lord and I
are getting married?

14
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,630
Don't you divine beings need to
bow at the hall

15
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,490
and enter the bridal chamber
when getting married?

16
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,910
His Lordship really can't get away.
Please understand, My Lady.

17
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,840
This is Ning Yan.

18
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,340
[Ning Yan]

19
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,590
She will be your maid and at your service
from now on, My Lady.

20
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,720
Greetings, My Lady.

21
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,400
Please make sure to tell
the Heavenly Lord that

22
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll be waiting for him here.

23
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,340
Yes, I will.

24
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,410
My Lord.

25
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,370
That one from the Jingyun Sect
has been settled.

26
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:43,210
Are you sure you don't want to go
and check on her, My Lord?

27
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,450
There's no rush.

28
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,000
Hua Ruyue!

29
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,960
You plundered celestial artifacts
and seized blessed lands.

30
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,090
Do you plead guilty?

31
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,400
Bai Jiusi.

32
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,720
You're the guilty one!

33
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,280
[Divine Lord Siling: Hua Ruyue]

34
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,710
Ruyue!

35
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:05,840
Stop it!

36
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,400
Do you think

37
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,930
they look similar?

38
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,720
My eyes are not keen enough.

39
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,250
Apart from the appearance,

40
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,230
I haven't noticed any similarities
between them.

41
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,640
He's really not coming, huh?

42
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,620
My Lady.

43
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,870
His Lordship might just be...

44
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,670
Hasn't dinner been brought yet?

45
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,640
I've been waiting all day. I'm hungry.

46
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,100
I apologize for letting you
go hungry, My Lady.

47
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,590
Here in the Nine Heavens,

48
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,830
there are either enlightened immortals,
who have ascended,

49
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,160
or divine beings born here.

50
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Over time,

51
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,570
we've forgotten that mortals need to eat.

52
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,750
Don't you immortals eat at all?

53
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,830
It's not that we don't eat at all.

54
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,800
We can eat a little when
we crave something.

55
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,730
But we won't starve if we don't eat.

56
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,330
In that case,

57
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,430
being an immortal does
have its advantages.

58
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,360
At least you don't have to worry about
food and drink.

59
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,670
This fruit of yours is amazing.

60
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,890
I was starving earlier,

61
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,390
but after just a few bites,
I feel somewhat full.

62
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,440
Of course.

63
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,040
I'm the spirit of the Jianmu Tree,
and these are my fruits.

64
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Of course they're incomparable to those
mundane fruits of the mortal world.

65
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,760
Jianmu?

66
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,850
Is that the legendary divine tree?

67
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,880
Years ago, I cultivated on Mount Wuji.

68
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,000
I gained enlightenment, absorbed
the essence of frost and dew,

69
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,510
inhaled and exhaled primordial energy,
and practiced day and night.

70
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,600
It took countless years,

71
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,070
but I established my foundation, condensed
my meridians, and became an immortal.

72
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,600
The Nine Heavens are truly
full of talented beings.

73
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,210
Of course. This is the Nine Heavens
after all.

74
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,530
My Lady, I'll take care of you
from now on.

75
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,220
Please feel free to ask me for
anything you need.

76
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,730
Actually, there is one thing.

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,720
What is it?

78
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,690
Where does the Heavenly Lord live?

79
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,659
In the Canglei Palace, of course.

80
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,120
I'll go find him then.

81
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,000
My Lady.

82
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,800
Lord Cang Tu said you should wait here.

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,430
Please don't wander off.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,950
You don't understand.

85
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,230
I must see the Heavenly Lord tonight.

86
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,270
Why is that?

87
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,870
Novels say

88
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,370
if a bride spends her wedding night alone,

89
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,360
the couple's married life will
be very rocky.

90
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,770
It's not that I won't let you go.

91
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,470
Please, come with me and see.

92
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,860
The Tianmu Peak is enormous!

93
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,159
This is the passage between the divine
and demonic realms.

94
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,500
Naturally, it took some effort to build.

95
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,310
Which direction is the quickest way
down the mountain?

96
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,040
There's no path down from here.

97
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,390
You can't fly, and you're not prepared.

98
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,520
Going down recklessly would be fatal.

99
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,140
Who says I'm not prepared?

100
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,560
You're all the preparation I need.

101
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,870
Slowly.

102
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,860
Be careful.

103
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,990
My Lady, I can only send you this far.

104
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,830
I'm bound by the Binding Spell

105
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,409
which prevents me from
leaving Tianmu Peak.

106
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,870
Tianmu Peak, where we are now,
is in the far north,

107
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,000
while the Canglei Palace is
in the far south.

108
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,200
If you want to go to the Canglei Palace,

109
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,900
just keep heading south.

110
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,950
It's a long journey.

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
It will take at least 10 days.

112
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,570
10 days it is, then.

113
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,030
As long as I don't sleep along the way,

114
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,690
I won't be considered spending
the night alone.

115
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,280
Please be careful, My Lady.

116
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,630
If you're unlucky and encounter danger,

117
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,720
you can also mention that you're

118
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,580
Heavenly Lord Dacheng's wife
to protect yourself.

119
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,120
Who? Who hit me?

120
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,900
There are enemies!

121
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,900
Where are they? Where?

122
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,080
Where? Where?

123
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,050
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

124
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,160
A woman?

125
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,910
A woman, where? Where?

126
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,840
Third Brother, open your eyes and look.

127
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,100
Don't try to trick me into opening my
eyes. If you want to look, do it yourself.

128
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,600
So you guys can't see?

129
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,720
You're the one who can't see.
We're having a bet here.

130
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,200
A bet?

131
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,750
Yes, a bet.

132
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,550
Many years ago, there was a woman.

133
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,610
She made a bet with us three brothers.

134
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,760
Whoever opens their eyes first loses.

135
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,880
So what about that woman?

136
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,040
That woman went home to close her eyes.

137
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,560
If she opens her eyes,

138
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,470
she'll come back and tell us.

139
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,630
How do you know she wasn't tricking you?

140
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,790
She wouldn't.

141
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,330
We made a deal.

142
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,900
There's a saying in the mortal realm,

143
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,000
which goes...

144
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,630
Second Brother, how does it go again?

145
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,890
"Once a word is spoken,

146
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,040
even four..."

147
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,080
Right, four...

148
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,670
Even four Qilin beasts can't recall it.

149
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,480
Brother, it's "four horses."

150
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:11,960
Right, right.

151
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,630
Brother, it should be "four horses."

152
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,550
W-Whether it's Qilin beasts or horses
doesn't matter.

153
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,750
I-It doesn't matter.

154
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,720
The most important thing...

155
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,120
Is...

156
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,750
You.

157
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,530
We brothers hate women the most.

158
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,910
And we specifically target women
who can't fly.

159
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,390
Why specifically target those
who can't fly?

160
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,790
Because we can't beat the ones
who can fly, of course.

161
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,390
Why do you have so many questions?

162
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,120
Just tell us, can you fly or not?

163
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,690
I can't.

164
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,440
That makes it easy then.

165
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,050
Brothers, let's get her.

166
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,610
Hold on!

167
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,360
I'm Heavenly Lord Dacheng's wife.

168
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,330
Then we have even more
reason to resent you!

169
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,540
You shouldn't have let her talk so much.

170
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,240
Is that woman dead?

171
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,120
Sounds like she's still breathing.

172
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,420
Let's see if she dares to come to
the Stone Forest again.

173
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,270
Before we acted,

174
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,870
I felt like I could

175
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,390
Bai Jiusi's stench.

176
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,290
It's late at night. Why say
such unlucky things?

177
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,720
Retreat!

178
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,790
Is anyone there?

179
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,790
[Puyuan]

180
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,300
Master, I have a secret matter to report.

181
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,410
I wonder if you remember
Xiao Jingshan, Master?

182
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,750
He was originally the most skilled

183
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,030
artifact-forging human cultivator
in the Ninth Heavens.

184
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,720
But since he tried to destroy
the Infinite Stele,

185
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,270
he was captured by you, Master,
and then imprisoned

186
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,750
in the Heavenly Punishment Platform
by the Heavenly Emissary.

187
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,880
Until three days ago, he was released.

188
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,790
I'm worried that this person still
harbors evil intentions,

189
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,720
and he might try to destroy
the Infinite Stele again.

190
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,480
Senior Puyuan, I think you're
overthinking this.

191
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,380
[Yongshou]

192
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,870
Master has already set up a barrier
on the Infinite Stele.

193
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,580
Even if there's the slightest disturbance,

194
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,000
Master would be able to sense it.

195
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,400
Of course I trust Master.

196
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,000
It's just I think sending more people
to guard it

197
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,530
would be more appropriate.

198
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,790
Someone has already been sent
to Tianmu Peak.

199
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,250
Which immortal lord is it?

200
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,480
Ning Yan and...

201
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,040
Li Qingyue.

202
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,960
Who is Ning Yan? And who is Li Qingyue?

203
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,030
Ning Yan seems to be a celestial attendant
taken in by Master.

204
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,390
As for this Li Qingyue,

205
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,470
I've never heard of her before, either.

206
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, um...

207
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,740
I heard a sound here,

208
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,940
so I came to check it out.

209
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,720
Who is this?

210
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,680
She is...

211
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,680
Heavenly Lord!

212
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,410
How dare you!

213
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,200
Who are you to intrude on
our morning meeting?

214
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,660
What are your intentions?

215
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,230
I have no intentions.

216
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,880
I just wanted to see the Heavenly Lord.

217
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,510
You think you can see His Lordship
whenever you want?

218
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,710
Get out now and accept your punishment!

219
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,050
I forgot to introduce.

220
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,290
This is my wife,

221
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,220
Li Qingyue.

222
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,420
So this is where you live, Heavenly Lord.

223
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,030
If I had known, I wouldn't have
wandered around.

224
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,630
I would have just waited here
for you to return.

225
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,270
You came all the way to Chongwu Hall.

226
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,000
It's because you want to show your face
in front of everyone

227
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,350
and make everyone aware
of your existence, isn't it?

228
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,400
That's not true.

229
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,170
I woke up and didn't know where I was.

230
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,510
So I wanted to find someone to ask,

231
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,310
but there wasn't a soul in sight.

232
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,410
That's how I accidentally ended up
at Chongwu Hall.

233
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,240
Yesterday, I was knocked out by
three stone men.

234
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,370
Was it you who saved me, Heavenly Lord?

235
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,610
Your injuries seem to have
healed quite quickly.

236
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,270
Thanks to the miraculous medicine
Master Dan Yang gave me earlier.

237
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,330
Otherwise, I definitely wouldn't
be able to get up now.

238
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,170
The Stone Forest isn't on the way
to Canglei Palace.

239
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,920
Why did you end up there?

240
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,070
I just followed Ning Yan's instructions

241
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,270
and kept going south.

242
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,940
Could it be I went in the wrong direction?

243
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,830
Those three stone men were
particularly unreasonable.

244
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,960
They attacked me as soon as they saw me.

245
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,160
Heavenly Lord, you didn't encounter
them, did you?

246
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,400
You're not hurt, are you?

247
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,960
No.

248
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,320
That's good.

249
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,200
Why did you come to Canglei Palace?

250
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,750
Heavenly Lord, you said before that
you don't wear clothes others have worn.

251
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,750
I specially bought a new set for you.

252
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,750
Unfortunately, I got locked up by
the Sect Leader before coming back.

253
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,590
So I never had the chance to
give them to you.

254
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,120
I don't wear clothes made
in the mortal world.

255
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,710
Then you'll definitely like this.

256
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,270
You said earlier that you wanted to eat
Xiaoqiu Berries.

257
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,730
So before I came this time,

258
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,110
I specially went to Xiaoqiu Mountain

259
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,170
and picked some fruits to bring over.

260
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,830
These are my favorite fruits.

261
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,790
Try some too.

262
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,810
Xiaoqiu Berries...

263
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,330
Using these old stories to provoke me,

264
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
is it fun?

265
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,560
What old stories?

266
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,840
Didn't you say you wanted to
eat Xiaoqiu Berries?

267
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,480
Heavenly Lord, what's wrong?

268
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,070
You came to find me

269
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,590
just to bring me some clothes
and Xiaoqiu Berries?

270
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,310
Of course not.

271
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,680
Heavenly Lord, don't you know

272
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,310
sleeping alone on the wedding night

273
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,640
can lead to marital discord in the future?

274
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,590
Oh no.

275
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,590
What now?

276
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,960
I passed out last night.

277
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,510
That already counts as sleeping alone.

278
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,400
I don't care, being unconscious
doesn't count as sleeping.

279
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Can we consider tonight as
the wedding night instead?

280
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,190
Sure.

281
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,160
That's about enough!

282
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,280
When we spar again next time,

283
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,280
if you still hold back like this,

284
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,660
there's no point in us sparring anymore.

285
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,510
Zhang Suan, you're being a bit too hasty.

286
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,720
The miraculous medicine given to you by
Heavenly Lady

287
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,350
could only strengthen your body,

288
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,350
but it failed to restore your qihai.

289
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,880
You should take it slow.

290
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,460
Master Dan Yang, your advice is correct.

291
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,960
Qingyue.

292
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,110
How are you doing on your own now?

293
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,800
Didn't you say you want to
consummate our marriage?

294
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,600
Wait a moment.

295
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,130
Are you scared?

296
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,080
Why don't you have any wine in your room?

297
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,640
What do we need wine for?

298
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,010
Isn't it customary to drink wedding wine
on the wedding night?

299
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,470
Why bother with all those formalities?

300
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,030
Isn't it better to just get started?

301

I just really want to know.

320
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:16,150
We're married now, so I don't need to
hide anything from you anymore.

321
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,730
When I was little, my family died
in a disaster.

322
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,200
To survive, I joined the Jingyun Sect.

323
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,880
Since my aptitude was so poor,

324
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,640
I was just idling away
in the Jingyun Sect.

325
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:35,330
All my life, I've always relied on myself.

326
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,210
No one has ever cared about me.

327
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,640
So when I got hurt,

328
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,880
I could only find medicine for myself.

329
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,560
There was no one to share my joy,
and no one to confide my sorrows.

330
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,310
I thought this was it for me
in this life.

331
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,550
But then, I met you, Heavenly Lord.

332
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,440
And now, when I fall off a cliff,
someone would come to save me.

333
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,500
When I'm wronged, someone would
stand up to protect me.

334
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,470
Even when I'm beaten unconscious,

335
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,080
someone would take me home.

336
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,110
For the first time in my life, I feel

337
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,680
I'm no longer alone.

338
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,750
I admit, Heavenly Lord, that

339
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,910
at first, I was only attracted
to your appearance.

340
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,080
But you kept protecting me
time and time again,

341
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,340
which made me see myself clearly.

342
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,920
Heavenly Lord, I really, really like you.

343
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,960
Alright, I'm thick-skinned.

344
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,620
I've said everything I wanted to say.

345
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,590
I know you're not good with words,
Heavenly Lord,

346
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,390
so I won't insist on getting
any response from you.

347
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,970
Let's get started then.

348
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,000
What?

349
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,700
Consummate our marriage, of course.

350
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,480
Are you scared, Heavenly Lord?

351
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,340
Where is he?

352
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,680
Why did I suddenly fall asleep last night?

353
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,040
Steward Cang.

354
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,440
Greetings, My Lady.

355
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,520
Why are you here?

356
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,830
His Lordship asked me to bring
you some food, My Lady.

357
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,540
This is too much. How can I eat it all?

358
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,140
This is for you to eat on the road,
My Lady.

359
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,100
On the road?

360
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,070
His Lordship said you've fulfilled
your wish, My Lady,

361
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,530
so it's time for you to
return to Tianmu Peak.

362
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,310
I have to go back there?

363
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,880
Of course. That is your
residence, My Lady.

364
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,540
It wasn't easy for me to come here.

365
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,520
Can't I stay for a few more days?

366
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,330
This is the rule of the divine race.

367
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,880
I hope you won't make it difficult
for His Lordship, My Lady.

368
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,270
What kind of rule separates newlyweds?

369
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,240
His Lordship asked me to tell you

370
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,790
not to wander around after getting back,
My Lady.

371
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,960
He will come to find you himself, My Lady.

372
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,550
What if he never comes to see me?

373
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,000
I can only wait and do nothing?

374
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,750
That's just how the rules are.

375
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,160
Being an immortal is truly difficult.

376
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,270
Once you've packed your things, My Lady,

377
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,400
I'll escort you out.

378
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:35,880
My Lord.

379
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,920
This is an invitation letter
sent by Fan Jiaojiao.

380
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,980
He's getting married again tonight.

381
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,840
He takes a new bride every year.
No need to pay attention to it.

382
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,620
Lady Qingyue has left.

383
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,040
The bait.

384
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,430
If you suspect Lady Qingyue, My Lord,

385
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,620
isn't it more reason for you
to keep her close by?

386
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,960
Or, is it because you've realized
you mistook her identity, My Lord?

387
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,560
There are countless fish
swimming in the pond.

388
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,790
Why did I catch this particular one?

389
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,210
This...

390
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,110
The karma of three lifetimes,
an unbroken cycle.

391
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,850
If it's meant to be her,

392
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,450
then so be it.

393
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,230
The fish will eventually
return to my pond.

394
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,290
Did I take a wrong turn?

395
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,600
Burn the evil, ignite the wicked.
Control their life and death.

396
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,240
Burn the evil, ignite the wicked.
Control their life and death.

397
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,360
Burn the evil, ignite the wicked.
Control their life and death.

398
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,730
[Map of Danxia Land]

399
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,970
Who's there?

400
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,550
Who are you?

401
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,400
Are you from around here?

402
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,110
I think I'm lost. Do you know the way?

403
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,600
Don't run away!

404
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,010
Hey, why did you run?

405
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,280
They... They're coming!

406
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,550
Who?

407
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,520
Who's coming?

408
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,389
Demons!

409
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,840
Demons? What demons?

410
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,670
Man-eating demons, lots and lots of them!

411
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Run! We must run!

412
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,010
Run! Run!

413
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,230
Don't...

414
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,150
Stop there.

415
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,510
You're here looking for someone, right?

416
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,360
She ran away in that direction.

417
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,870
By the way, could I ask you
for directions?

418
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,030
Is it her?

419
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,060
-Yes, it's her.
-No, it's not!

420
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,070
You've got the wrong person. It's not me.

421
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,140
It is her.

422
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,110
No, I'm...

423
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,190
Let's go.

424
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,280
Got it.

425
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,920
Play the music.

426
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,190
Lift the sedan chair!

427
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,230
Red attire tied with a knot of unity.

428
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,840
Green trees bloom with a thousand
layers of brocade.

429
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,670
Red thread embroiders the
shadows of two wild geese.

430
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,600
Colorful satin stitches the love
of mandarin ducks.

431
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Jade-like feet step out into
the scenery of Penglai.

432
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,160
Purple flute falls into the
Phoenix Tower.

433
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,530
Put on new makeup to welcome new joy.

434
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,470
Hairpins shake, black jade
shines doubly bright.

435
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,590
Bride.

436
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,280
Are you satisfied with your makeup?

437
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:32,400
Once the auspicious time arrives,
the wedding will begin.

438
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,030
No matter how scared you are, you can't
cry during the wedding.

439
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,960
If you cry, it will bring bad luck.

440
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,250
Do you understand?

441
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,700
Is everything ready?

442
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,600
Not bad.

443
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,730
Take good care of her.

444
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,720
I'll go ask the kitchen to hurry up.

445
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,950
Your family has been paid.

446
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,870
Besides, I've already told you,

447
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,110
I won't let anything happen to you.

448
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,390
What's not good about being my wife?

449
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,480
What else is there to think about?

450
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,700
My Lord, it's time.

451
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,150
Shall we get going?

452
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,720
Let's go.

453
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,440
Let's go.

454
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,000
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

455
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,960
The auspicious time has arrived!

456
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,000
The newlyweds have arrived.
Let the feast begin!

457
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,270
First bow to the heavens.

458
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:08,150
On this auspicious day and hour,
heaven and earth are in harmony.

459
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,630
Second bow to the earth.

460
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:15,580
Yin and yang unite, bringing good fortune
in all four seasons.

461
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,170
Third bow to each other.

462
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,860
Great wealth, great nobility, great
fortune, and great prosperity.

463
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:35,410
Great wealth, great nobility, great
fortune, and great prosperity.

464
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,300
Heavenly Lord...

465
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,110
Heavenly Lord!
