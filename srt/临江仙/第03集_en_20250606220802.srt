00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
3. Goоде

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,400
2 Night

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll try to make it.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll try to make it.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll try to make it.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll try to make it.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll try to make it.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll try to make it.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll try to make it.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll try to make it.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll try to make it.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll try to make it.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll try to make it.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll try to make it.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll try to make it.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll try to make it.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll try to make it.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll try to make it.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll try to make it.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll try to make it.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll try to make it.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll try to make it.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll try to make it.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll try to make it.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll try to make it.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll try to make it.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll try to make it.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll try to make it.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll try to make it.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll try to make it.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll try to make it.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll try to make it.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll try to make it.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll try to make it.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll try to make it.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll try to make it.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'll try to make it.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'll try to make it.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll try to make it.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll try to make it.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'll try to make it.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll try to make it.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll try to make it.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,560
The 400 series is super clear and real

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,320
You can watch Lin Jiangxian

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
32 years of training first

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,440
Real-time use of the old household

49
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,200
South convinced battery

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,680
You can watch Lin Jiangxian

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Find the state

52
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,200
Buy the move back

53
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,720
Buy the move

54
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,440
You can watch Lin Jiangxian

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The warehouse is a warehouse

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I've seen my wife

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is this the warehouse of the Xuanzuanzhu?

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's totally different from what I thought

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's pretty simple

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is the yard for the wife

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't know if Xuanzuan and I are the same

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm not sure

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't know

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't know

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't know

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't know

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't know

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't know

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't know

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't know

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't know

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Xuanzuan doesn't live together?

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Xuanzuan is a good girl

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
She will come after she is done

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But today

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Isn't it the wedding day with Xuanzuan?

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't you need to pay for the wedding?

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The house is in the house

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Xuanzuan is really ugly

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Please understand

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is Ningyan

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
She is your maid

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You can take the money with you

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Greetings, madam

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You must tell Xuanzuan

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll wait here

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Xuanzuan

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The one in Jinyun Sect has already settled down

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Xuanzuan

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Aren't you going to have a look?

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No hurry

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hua Ruyue

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Ruyue is a fairy

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
She is a strong man

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You can take her with you

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll kill you

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll kill you

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll kill you

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll kill you

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll kill you

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll kill you

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll kill you

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll kill you

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll kill you

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll kill you

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hua Ruyue

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Stop

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Do you think it's similar?

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't think so

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Except for the appearance

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I didn't find anything similar

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Up next

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They are coming

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Madam.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Xuan Jun, he might just...

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Didn't you bring the food?

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I've been waiting for a day. I'm hungry.

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Sorry to make you hungry.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is the heaven of the nine realms.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Either you get the high-class person who is born to fly,

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
or you are born to be the god of the world.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You eat and drink all the time.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I forgot that I have to eat.

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't eat at all.

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Not at all.

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I can eat a little bit if I want to.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But I can't starve to death.

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It seems that

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
being a god is really a good thing.

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
At least it won't be a problem for eating and drinking.

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This fruit is so magical.

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm hungry just now.

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm going to eat a few bites.

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm full.

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Of course. I'm the tree spirit of the wood.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This is my fruit.

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Of course it's not what those wild fruits in the mortal realm can compare to.

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Wood?

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Is this the legendary magic tree?

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I used to practice in Mount Wuji in the past.

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I opened the spiritual system.

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I used to take the golden flower of the two roads.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I used to practice in the night.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I used to practice in the forest for many years.

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I used to practice in the forest for many years.

148
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is a miracle.

149
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is a miracle.

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This is natural.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This is a miracle.

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Madam,

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I will take care of you in the future.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Just tell me what's going on.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I really have something.

156
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What is it?

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Where is Xuan Zun?

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's the hidden thunder palace.

159
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll go find him.

160
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Madam,

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the Immortal Lord of the Cangtu said that you'd better wait here.

162
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Don't run away.

163
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You don't understand.

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I must meet Xuan Zun tonight.

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why?

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The painting itself says that

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
if you get married and have a night of solitude,

168
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
you will be very pitiful

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
in the future.

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I won't let you go.

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let me see.

172
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let me see.

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The sky and wind are too strong.

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This is the two-story hall of the Immortal Lord.

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Of course, you must use some skills to repair the sword.

176
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Which direction can you go faster?

177
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
There is no way to go down here.

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You won't fly and you won't be prepared.

179
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You'll fall down like this.

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Who said I wasn't prepared?

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Isn't my preparation yours?

182
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Slow down.

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Be careful.

184
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Be careful.

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Madam,

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I can only send you here.

187
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The Immortal Lord uses his skills

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
to repair the sword.

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No!

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
No!

191
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No!

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The sky and wind we are in is in the north.

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And the Canglei Hall is in the south.

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
If you go to Canglei Hall,

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
you only need to go south.

196
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The path is long and you have to stay at least ten days.

197
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Ten days is ten days.

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
If I don't sleep on the way,

199
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I won't be able to go back alone.

200
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Madam, be careful.

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If you don't go to the prison and get in danger,

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
you can also report to the name of your great-grandma's wife.

203
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Who hit me?

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Where?

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Where are you?

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Go!

207
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Go!

208
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Where?

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There is a ladder.

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Where?

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Where is it?

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Go!

213
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I didn't mean it.

215
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Woman?

216
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Woman?

217
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Where?

218
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Where?

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Madam, open your eyes.

220
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Don't lie to me.

221
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Open your eyes.

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Can't you see?

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You can't see?

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We are gambling here.

225
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
gambling?

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes, gambling.

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Many years ago, there was a woman

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
who played a gambling with our brother.

229
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Who was the first to open her eyes?

230
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Who said?

231
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What about that woman?

232
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That woman went home and closed her eyes.

233
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If she opened her eyes, she would come back and tell me.

234
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
How do you know that she is not crazy about you?

235
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No way.

236
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We have already said it.

237
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes, there is a saying.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This...

239
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What did you say?

240
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
A word.

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Four...

242
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Four...

243
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Four horses.

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Four horses.

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I can't catch up with them.

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Brother.

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yes, yes, yes.

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's horses.

249
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes, it's horses.

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Not important.

251
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Not important.

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The most important thing is...

253
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You.

254
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The most annoying woman we have.

255
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And especially,

256
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
women who don't know how to fly.

257
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Why don't you know how to fly?

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I can't fly.

259
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But...

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
No, no, no.

261
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Why do you ask so many questions?

262
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You said you know how to fly.

263
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't know.

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's good.

265
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Brothers, stop.

266
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Don't move.

267
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I am the wife of the Great City Council.

268
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Then let's go to the hospital.

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What?

270
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I shouldn't have heard so many things.

271
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Is the woman dead?

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It seems like she has an excuse.

273
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
She dares to come here again.

274
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Before she does,

275
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I seem to be able to smell the smell of the White wine.

276
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What are you talking about?

277
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Retreat.

278
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Retreat.

279
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Retreat.

280
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Is anyone here?

281
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I am here.

282
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Master,

283
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I have a secret message for you.

284
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't know if you remember Xiao Jing Shan.

285
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
She was the highest-growing person in the Nine Heavens.

286
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But she was caught by Master because of the black magic.

287
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Then she was locked up in the Sky Faction.

288
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Until three days ago, she was released.

289
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I am worried that she will destroy the black magic again.

290
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Brother Fu Yan,

291
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
you are the one who is worried.

292
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Master has set the barrier on the black magic.

293
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Even if there is a wind blowing,

294
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Master can also find out.

295
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I believe you.

296
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I just think it's better to send more people to guard.

297
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's more appropriate.

298
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Someone has already gone to Tian Mu Palace.

299
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Who is the Immortal Lord?

300
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Ning Yan and Li Qing Yue.

301
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Who is Ning Yan?

302
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Who is Li Qing Yue?

303
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Ning Yan seems to be the Immortal Lord's master.

304
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
As for Li Qing Yue,

305
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I have never heard of her.

306
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Well,

307
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I heard that there is a business here.

308
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So I came to see.

309
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Who is it?

310
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Master!

311
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
How dare you!

312
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Who are you?

313
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
How dare you break into the city?

314
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What is your intention?

315
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I have no intention.

316
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I just want to see Master.

317
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You can see what you want to see.

318
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What do you want to see?

319
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Go out and get punished.

320
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I forgot to introduce.

321
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This is your master.

322
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Li Qing Yue.

323
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is my master.

324
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So this is the place of the Immortal Lord.

325
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I would have known if I had not run around.

326
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I would have waited for you here.

327
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You came to the Spring House Hall.

328
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You just want to show your face to everyone.

329
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Let everyone know your existence.

330
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I didn't.

331
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I just woke up.

332
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't know where I am.

333
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I just wanted to ask someone.

334
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But I didn't even see anyone.

335
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I accidentally went to the Spring House Hall.

336
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I was married to three stones yesterday.

337
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Did the Immortal Lord save me?

338
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The injury was good.

339
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Thanks to the medicine that Uncle Danyang gave me.

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to climb up.

341
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The stone forest is not at the place of the Immortal Lord's secret palace.

342
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Why did it appear there?

343
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I just walked down the wrong direction

344
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
according to what you said.

345
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Those three stones are so unreasonable.

346
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
They are so aggressive.

347
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Didn't you meet them?

348
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Did you get hurt?

349
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No.

350
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That's good.

351
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Why did you come to the secret palace?

352
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The Immortal Lord said that

353
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
he didn't wear the clothes that others wear.

354
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I bought you a new set of clothes.

355
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's a pity that you were locked up

356
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
when you came back.

357
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I never had a chance to give you that.

358
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I didn't wear the clothes that the mortal world knew.

359
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't know what you are thinking.

360
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I don't know what you are thinking.

361
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't know what you are thinking.

362
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't know what you are thinking.

363
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Then I will give you the clothes that you like.

364
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Then you will like this one.

365
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Xin Xin, you said you want to eat the small autumn fruits.

366
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So I brought some fruits

367
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
from the small autumn mountains before I came here.

368
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The small autumn fruits

369
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This is my favorite fruit.

370
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I will give you one.

371
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Little Qiu Guo?

372
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Then these young people are here to stimulate me.

373
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's fun.

374
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What young people are they?

375
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Didn't you say you wanted to know about Little Qiu Guo?

376
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Xuan Zun, what's wrong?

377
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Are you here to see me?

378
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
To send me clothes and Little Qiu Guo?

379
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Of course not.

380
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Xuan Zun, don't you know that you'll be sleeping alone at night?

381
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You'll be angry and angry in the future.

382
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh no!

383
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What's wrong again?

384
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Don't get too excited.

385
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You're already sleeping alone.

386
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't care.

387
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm not sleeping at night.

388
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Tonight is the night of the wedding, okay?

389
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Good night.

390
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Try to end iters feelings.

391
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I won't create further Yue Jun 2013 nenhum.

392
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Think about it.

393
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll see you about this sphere journey.

394
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I will study with you.

395
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'll wait for you on the beach andittäin then.

396
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Now!

397
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Then there's no need to fight anymore.

398
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Zhangsun, you're not in a hurry.

399
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The medicine that Madam Xuan gave you can only be strong and healthy,

400
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
but it can't repair your anger.

401
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You should take your time.

402
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What Uncle Danyang taught me.

403
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Qingyue, how are you doing alone?

405
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Aren't you going to move the house?

407
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Wait a minute.

408
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm scared.

409
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Why aren't you getting drunk in your room?

410
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Why should I get drunk?

411
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You have to get drunk at the wedding night.

412
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Why bother to meddle in the wedding?

413
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's not good to start right away.

414
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm sorry.

415
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Wait a minute.

416
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
What's wrong again?

417
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I have something to say.

418
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
At this time?

419
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yes.

420
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
When did Madam Xuan start liking me?

421
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Is this important?

422
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I just want to know.

423
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
We're married.

424
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't need to hide it from you.

425
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm right. I'm married to a family member.

426
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I want to live and die in the Jinyun Sect.

427
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Because I'm too weak to be proud,

428
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm just a fool to die in the Jinyun Sect.

429
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
In my life,

430
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I've always been looking for myself.

431
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
No one ever valued me.

432
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So I can only look for myself when I'm hurt.

433
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm happy that no one shared my pain.

434
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm sad that no one is suffering.

435
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I thought that's how I've been in my life.

436
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But I didn't expect to meet Madam Xuan.

437
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
When I fell into the cliff, someone came to save me.

438
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I was wronged.

439
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Someone would come out to protect me.

440
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Even if I was hurt,

441
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
someone would take me home.

442
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I felt that I was no longer alone.

443
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I admit that I was just a little suspicious of Madam Xuan.

444
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But she came out to protect me once and for all.

445
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
She made me clear myself.

446
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Madam Xuan, I really like you.

447
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Please forgive me.

448
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm sorry I didn't know you were like this.

449
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's all right.

450
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Well, I'm a little tired.

451
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I've already finished my words.

452
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I know that Madam Xuan didn't like this.

453
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And I don't know what to say to you.

454
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,840
Ophiuchus?

455
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,480
Are you scared?

456
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,520
After Valmene,

457
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,600
after confident death for two of them,

458
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,180
it only became their detention centre.

459
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,200
Valmene is still around the temple place.

460
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm énormément grinding down a burning stone in the mountains.

461
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,840
All of a sudden,

462
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,480
this young girl has econocentacağ筿.

463
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,860
We need her to come down and face this world recommendation!

464
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,460
In this world,

465
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,720
the most lonely girl is you.

466
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,240
I can understand.

467
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,060
With all these,

468
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,100
I have to make sure sheень.

469
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,140
Deeraldine company should be taken over the temple.

470
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,180
I should bring it out.

471
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,140
managed office?

472
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,220
I met my lady.

473
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,260
why do you have come here?

474
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,860
you told me to send some food for your lady.

475
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,820
for her?

476
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,540
how can I eat all that?

477
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,420
she is eating on the road.

478
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,020
on the road?

479
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,180
my lady said

480
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,860
they have a space at De Chang Academy

481
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,700
so she will go back to Tianę J deuxième.

482
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,340
I need to go back.

483
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:58,860
fir,

484
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,820
just be a decoration here.

485
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,140
I can't live for a few more days.

486
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,140
This is the rule of the gods.

487
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,140
Please don't make it hard for me.

488
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,140
How can you let the bride and groom share the rules?

489
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,140
The lord said that after you go back, don't run around.

490
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,140
He will look for you.

491
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,140
If he doesn't come to look for me,

492
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,140
I can only wait.

493
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,140
The rule is the same.

494
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,140
I will wait for you.

495
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,140
I will wait for you.

496
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,140
The rule is the same.

497
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,140
The gods are so hard to deal with.

498
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,140
When you pack up your things, I will take you out.

499
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,140
The wedding is coming.

500
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,140
You have to go back to your room.

501
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,140
I will wait for you.

502
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,140
I will wait for you.

503
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,140
I will wait for you.

504
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,140
I will wait for you.

505
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,140
I will wait for you.

506
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,140
Wait for me.

507
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,140
Son.

508
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,140
If the lord suspects Mrs. Qingyue,

509
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,140
shouldn't we keep her by our side?

510
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,140
Or did the lord find out that he is mistaken?

511
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,140
If I get the exact answer,

512
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,140
I will skip this task.

513
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,140
To 100,000 yuan?

514
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,140
Why did I take this in the first place?

515
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,140
This is

516
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,140
He is him.

517
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,140
Yu'er will finally return to my hall.

518
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,140
It's the wrong way.

519
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,140
The evil will rise and die.

520
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,140
The evil will rise and die.

521
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,140
The evil will rise and die.

522
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,140
Who are you?

523
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,140
Who are you?

524
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,140
Are you here?

525
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,140
I think I'm lost.

526
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,140
Do you know the way?

527
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,140
Don't run.

528
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,140
What are you doing?

529
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,140
They are coming.

530
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,140
Who are they?

531
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,140
The demon.

532
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
The demon?

533
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,140
What demon?

534
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
The demon of the human.

535
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,140
So many.

536
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,140
Run.

537
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,140
Run.

538
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,140
Run.

539
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,140
Run.

540
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
Don't...

541
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140
Don't run.

542
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,140
Don't run.

543
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,140
Don't run.

544
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,140
Don't run.

545
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,140
Stop.

546
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,140
Stop.

547
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,140
You are here to find someone, right?

548
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,140
He just went over there.

549
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,140
Can I ask you a way?

550
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,140
Is it him?

551
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,140
Yes.

552
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,140
No.

553
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,140
You know the wrong person.

554
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,140
It's not me.

555
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,140
It's him.

556
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,140
No.

557
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,140
I'm...

558
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,140
Go.

559
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,140
Go.

560
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,140
Go.

561
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,140
Go.

562
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,140
Go.

563
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,140
The red dress is the same as the new one.

564
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:09,140
The flower is open and the red thread is embroidered with double eyes.

565
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,140
The thread is broken and the thread is tangled.

566
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,140
The flower tied the thread is the same as the golden hair.

567
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,580
Why are they placed in the station

568
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,140
and are the two神明舞場 액?

569
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,140
In the same person,

570
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,420
the people going up,

571
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,140
are the same as the 자주-dessert element.

572
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,140
I'm sorry.

573
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,140
Lady Xin.

574
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,140
Lady Xin, are you satisfied with the look?

00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,140
The wedding ceremony has begun.

576
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,140
No matter how much you're afraid of the wedding, you can't cry.

577
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,140
You can't be anxious after crying.

578
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,140
Remember that?

579
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,140
Are you ready?

580
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,140
Not bad.

581
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,140
You two are good friends.

582
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,140
I'll go to the kitchen.

583
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,140
Your family is rich.

584
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,140
I told you that you wouldn't be in danger.

585
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,140
You're still a bad wife.

586
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,140
What else do you want?

587
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,140
My lord, it's time.

588
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,140

00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,140
Go.

595
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,140
The bride is here.

596
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
Let's go.

597
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,140

598
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,140
Go.

599
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,140
Go.

600
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,140
One day, two days,
