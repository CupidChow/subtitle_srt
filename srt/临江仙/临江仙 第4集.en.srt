[Episode 4]

3
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,000
Lately, great demons
have been stirring.

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,860
Even the Bone Nails
are showing signs of loosening.

5
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,479
There's really nothing to celebrate
on Danxia Land these days.

6
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,180
I was left with no other option,

[Fan Jiaojiao]

8
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,570
so I decided to get married myself.

9
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,009
But I didn't expect to accidentally
marry my own master's wife.

10
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,910
The one I was supposed to marry

11
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,880
was the sixth daughter
of the Liu family from Yunquan Cave.

12
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,079
Not only did I send the betrothal gifts,

13
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,150
I even gave them
several magical artifacts as compensation.

14
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,400
Her parents agreed without hesitation.

15
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,560
No idea what she was thinking,

16
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,870
but right before
the wedding, she ran off.

17
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,170
So you kidnapped my wife instead?

18
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,620
No.

19
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:36,540
Master, I'd never
even seen Miss Liu before.

20
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,560
It was pitch-black that night.

21
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,880
And your wife was all alone,
standing in the wilderness.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,690
I didn't see clearly.

23
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,220
I swear I didn't mean to.

24
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,120
How about

25
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,540
I apologize to her again?

26
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,680
Master?

27
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,360
So…

28
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,440
it's another coincidence?

29
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,230
What?

30
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,780
Do you believe you took her

31
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,810
by chance?

32
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,670
Master, I never meant it.

33
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,350
Please don't misunderstand.

34
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,430
All by chance?

35
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,670
Heavenly Lord.

36
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,630
My Lady.

37
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,270
His Lordship sent me to take you
to Yuewu House for some rest.

38
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,670
Where is Yuewu House?

39
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,490
It's within Canglei Palace, of course.

40
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,150
His Lordship said you may
live there from now on.

41
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't need to return to Tianmu Peak?

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,410
Yes. He said your magic is too weak,

43
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,240
and living alone could be dangerous.

44
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,970
So he's making an exception
and letting you stay at Canglei Palace.

45
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,400
Where is His Lordship?

46
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,070
He's busy. He asked me to lead the way.

47
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,800
Is he mad at me
and doesn't want to see me?

48
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,330
Ah, right.
Fan Jiaojiao was rude to you earlier.

49
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,310
You must have been scared.

50
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,870
Later,

51
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,920
I'll have him personally
bring you a calming tonic.

52
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,980
It'll help you sleep better tonight.

53
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,280
Don't bother. I'm fine.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,040
But this groom called Fan Jiaojiao

55
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
is a bit clueless.

56
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,300
He actually mistook me for his bride.

57
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,010
His Lordship must be furious that
I took vows with someone else.

58
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,190
It's not entirely Fan Jiaojiao's fault.

59
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,850
He holds a wedding every year.

60
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,050
Anyone could make a mistake like that.

61
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,900
Every year?

62
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't tell me he kidnaps all his brides.

63
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,650
Don't worry, My Lady.

64
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,800
Even though Hell Ruins
houses many vicious demons,

65
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,000
it's not some lawless place.

66
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,960
No marriage is forced.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,160
Nothing unscrupulous.

68
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,640
Then Immortal Lord Fan must be so charming

69
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,120
to have so many women
lining up to marry him.

70
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,630
Fan Jiaojiao is one of His Lordship's

71
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,930
Three Dharma Lords.

72
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,440
He oversees the Nailers—

73
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,510
people tasked with
subduing demonic beasts.

74
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,120
Most demonic beasts are feral,
vicious, and hard to tame.

75
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,460
Being sealed here

76
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,580
only builds up their resentment.

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,830
Immortal Lord Fan is a master artificer.

78
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,630
The Bone Nails he forges draw on
heaven's energy and water's essence—

79
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,090
perfect for
suppressing their resentment.

80
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,970
But over time, the nails loosen.

81
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,600
So...

82
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,680
So he has to get married?

83
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,270
Yes.

84
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,360
The resentment is dissolved through joy.

85
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,750
And weddings provide

86
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,210
the Nailers with that joy.

87
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,270
Food at the wedding

88
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,270
is a steady source of energy for them.

89
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,040
So far,

90
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,120
Hell Ruins has been

91
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,830
peaceful for over 100 years.

92
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,540
This yard is called Tongyou Yard.

93
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,870
It has nine winding paths
and hidden towers among the clouds.

94
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,560
It's the heart of Canglei Palace.

95
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,270
The yard has nine exits,

96
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,520
each leading to a different corridor.

97
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,100
Due east
connects to Canglei Palace's gate.

98
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,800
Due west leads to Hell Ruins,
where demonic beasts are sealed.

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,600
Due north is the Chongwu Hall, where
His Lordship handles official matters.

100
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,750
From right to left,

101
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,600
the other exits lead to the domains
of the Three Dharma Lords.

102
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,480
Of course, My Lady,
there's no need for you to know all that.

103
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,600
Then what should I know?

104
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,600
Naturally, your sleeping quarters
and His Lordship's.

105
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,180
Where we came from just now
is Linyuan Pavilion.

106
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,400
That's His Lordship's residence.

107
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,140
Your residence
is in the opposite direction.

108
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,100
It's just ahead.

109
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:43,790
Ah, your quarters are a bit secluded,

110
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,350
close to Hell Ruins.

111
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,680
So don't wander around at night.

112
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,040
You might run into something unexpected.

113
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,330
You mean demonic beasts?

114
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,280
You might run into
Fan Jiaojiao holding another wedding.

115
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,380
You just mentioned

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,060
His Lordship has Three Dharma Lords.

117
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,000
I've only met Immortal Lord Fan so far.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,080
Who are the other two?

119
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,830
Are they also in Canglei Palace?

120
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,090
That's a long story for such a short walk.

121
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,290
You'll know them when you meet them.

122
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Lady Qingyue, we've arrived.

123
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,870
From now on,
you'll be staying in Yuewu House.

124
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,000
Let me know if you need anything.

[Yin Tongzi]

145
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,960
Who are you, kid?
Why are you in my room?

146
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,620
Can you tell stories?

147
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,350
I don't tell stories.

148
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,380
It's late. Go home, kid.

149
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,810
How about I tell you a story?

150
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,850
You'll leave after that?

151
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,410
Fine. Go ahead.

152
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,720
Once upon a time,

153
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,720
there was a not-so-special girl
in a second-rate sect

154
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,910
in the mortal realm.

155
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,910
But she got lucky—

156
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,730
she married a powerful
and influential man.

157
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,500
But as soon as she got married,

158
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,750
her husband

159
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,750
cast her off to some remote mountain

160
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,220
and never visited her.

161
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,010
She went through hell,

162
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,510
barely survived,

163
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,510
and finally met her husband.

164
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,040
But her husband was cold as ice.

165
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,240
Even when someone else tried to marry her,

166
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,580
he didn't care at all.

167
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,910
He didn't even want to see her!

168
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,740
Shut up if you don't know
how to tell stories.

169
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,800
That's not true.

170
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,940
But she still loved her husband very much.

171
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,720
And then,

172
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,190
she was sent by an old man to Yuewu House.

173
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,480
She opened the wardrobe
and found a little boy inside.

174
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,910
The boy wanted to tell her a story.

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,080
A story about counting heads.

176
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,220
Count how many heads are in the room.

177
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,320
Once the counting's done,

178
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,300
the boy will eat her whole in one bite.

179
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,030
One.

180
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,390
Two.

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,230
What's going on?

182
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,630
Help!

183
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,870
My Lady, apologies for the fright.

184
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,840
Ning Yan.

185
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,960
Thank goodness you're here.

186
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,340
Don't be afraid, My Lady.
He's just a little demon.

187
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,020
A demon?

188
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,120
That boy is a demon?

189
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,480
What demon is he?

190
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,870
He's called Yin Tongzi,

191
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,000
a vicious demon that feeds on human heads.

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,690
He was locked up
in Canglei Palace by His Lordship

193
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,960
but snuck out later.

194
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,010
Unfortunately, before he could
get a bite of anything warm,

195
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,140
he got caught again.

196
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,340
If you run into him again,
just punch him in the face.

197
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,140
Like I could beat him.

198
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,580
Then just cover your ears and ignore him.

199
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:55,740
That simple?

200
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,260
Didn't you say you were bound
by the Binding Spell

201
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,470
and couldn't leave Tianmu Peak?

202
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,720
How did you get here?

203
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,280
Immortal Lord Cang Tu brought me here.

204
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,260
He also said

205
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,030
you don't need
to return to Tianmu Peak anymore.

206
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,890
You'll be living here from now on.

207
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,440
I'm here to protect you.

208
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,470
It's getting late.

209
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,910
You should rest, My Lady.

210
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,550
My Lady.

211
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,390
My Lady.

212
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,000
Do I look good?

213
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,180
Why are you drawing on your face?

214
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,140
I'm filling in my brows, not drawing.

215
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,120
Then why are your lips bleeding?

216
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,330
It's not blood. It's lip rouge.

217
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,870
My lips are pale
from my weak constitution,

218
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,680
so I need a bit of red to look good.

219
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,560
Want to try it?

220
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,710
I'll pass.

221
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,760
Have you ever worn rouge before?

222
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,440
No.

223
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,200
I've devoted myself
to cultivation since childhood.

224
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,060
I've never used things like that.

225
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,880
Then you have to try it.

226
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,480
I promise you'll love it.

227
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,840
You've dressed up so beautifully.

228
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,200
You must be going
to see His Lordship, right?

229
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,840
Yes.

230
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,710
Then you'd better hurry.

231
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,000
At this hour,

232
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,240
he's just finished the morning meeting.

233
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,680
If you delay any longer,
you might miss him.

234
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,420
You're right.

235
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll get going then.

236
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,210
What a terrifying thing.

237
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,920
Who are you?

238
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,710
Li Qingyue.

239
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,140
[Supreme Gatekeeper]

240
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,510
Heavenly Lady?

241
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,510
[Grand Gatekeeper]

242
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,770
Is His Lordship inside?

243
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,870
Yes.

244
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,470
Good.

245
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,580
My Lady, let me
announce your arrival first.

246
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,300
Wait.

247
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,030
You're too young. Not mature enough.

248
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,480
My Lady, I'll go.

249
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,600
You?

250
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,810
Look at your old face.

251
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,030
You smile with wrinkles
all over your face.

252
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,560
You may scare His Lordship.

253
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,240
Old? So what?

254
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,810
At least I'm not short.

255
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,870
If I don't look down,
I can't even see you.

256
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,670
You know that?

257
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,560
So what?

258
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,210
I'm talented.

259
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,910
I formed
my golden core at eight years old.

260
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,020
I can stay young forever.

261
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,270
Unlike me,
you didn't form your golden core until 80.

262
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,930
But I had a major breakthrough
in my later years.

263
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,270
My magic is now three levels above yours.

264
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,070
You know that?

265
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,120
I'll go.

266
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,210
Is that so?

267
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,150
Excuse me.

268
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,120
Old man.

269
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,630
Wait. I'm warning you.

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,130
Don't you dare call me an old man again.

271
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,620
Old man.

272
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,560
Bring it on.

273
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,080
My Lord.

274
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,520
Those two guards
are still fighting outside.

275
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,180
It really doesn't look great.

276
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,980
Why don't we transfer them back

277
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,250
to guard the gate of Canglei Palace?

278
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,610
Let them be. I like the noise.

279
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,340
But as long as they're here,

280
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,180
Her Ladyship won't be able to come in.

281
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,810
All the better.

282
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,780
Let me see how badly she wants to see me.

283
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,290
Uh, stop fighting, okay?

284
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,200
I won't see His Lordship.

285
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,930
This has nothing to do with you.

286
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,819
I'm here to see His Lordship.

287
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,109
What are you looking at?

288
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,440
Can't I look at you?

289
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,319
You wanna get beaten again?

290
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,410
An old man like you

291
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,790
never gets to beat me!

292
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,109
Old man!

293
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,880
Old man!

294
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,940
Shorty!

295
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,780
Shorty!

296
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,320
My Lady, you didn't
get to see His Lordship again?

297
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,470
Are you hungry? Want a peach?

298
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,890
I feel like His Lordship
might be mad at me.

299
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,790
It's not a feeling. He's definitely mad.

300
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,150
I knew it.

301
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,480
No normal man

302
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,550
would stay calm

303
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,250
after watching
his wife marry someone else.

304
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,010
But he won't even see me now.

305
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,790
What can I do to make him forgive me?

306
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:30,570
Well...

307
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,530
I don't really get romance stuff.

308
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,460
I don't want to give you bad advice.

309
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,510
This is my first time getting married.

310
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,110
I have no experience either.

311
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,670
Get out!

312
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,850
No.

313
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,960
Can you tell stories?

314
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,920
Let me tell you a story.

315
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,610
Once upon a time,

316
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,200
there was a woman despised by her husband.

317
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,630
Ning Yan!

318
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,820
Someone's hitting a kid! Help!

319
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,030
Someone's hitting a kid! Help!

320
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,730
[Dear, you linger long in my heart.
Though I do not go to you, could you not send word to me?]

321
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,870
Nice handwriting.

322
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,680
Indeed.

323
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,590
Let me tell you.

324
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,390
This is exactly
the kind of stuff Master falls for.

325
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,810
[Dear, you linger long in my heart.
Though I do not go to you, could you not send word to me?]

326
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,610
[Dear, you linger long in my heart.
Though I do not go to you, could you not send word to me?]

327
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,190
Her Ladyship is quite romantic.

328
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,440
[I can't forget you since I met you.
I miss you like mad if I can't see you. -Li Qingyue]

329
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,400
[I can't forget you since I met you.
I miss you like mad if I can't see you. -Li Qingyue]

330
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,310
Her Ladyship

331
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,330
really loves His Lordship deeply.

332
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,090
Yes.

333
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
His Lordship
must be pleased on the inside.

334
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,480
Once upon a time, a little boy

335
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,880
was locked up in a yard.

336
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,440
He ate peaches every day.

337
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,330
Then, the boy started telling his story.

338
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,860
Count how many peaches are on the table.

339
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,110
Once he finishes counting,

340
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,340
he will eat them in one bite.

341
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,310
One.

342
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,680
Two.

343
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:44,920
Three.

344
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,070
Four.

345
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,790
Five.

346
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:48,920
Six.

347
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,350
What's wrong? You want to hear a story?

348
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,290
Let me tell one instead.

349
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
A guy from the Li family fell hopelessly
in love with a girl from the Wei family.

350
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,310
He thought about her day and night.

351
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,120
So he wrote her several love poems
and had them delivered to her.

352
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,400
Miss Wei was touched by his love poems.

353
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,400
So...

354
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,750
What's wrong?

355
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,490
Heavenly Lord!

356
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,550
Stop reading that kind of nonsense.

357
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,210
Heavenly Lord!

358
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,200
Heavenly Lord!

359
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,160
Heavenly Lord? Heavenly Lord!

360
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,510
My Lady, your romance books
are so helpful.

361
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,910
His Lordship actually came to you himself!

362
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,080
Of course!

363
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,400
He was so shy

364
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,050
that he even burned my book.

365
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,550
That's too bad.

366
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,550
How will you know what to do next?

367
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,520
It's fine.

368
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,400
I've memorized

369
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,920
everything in it.

370
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,840
I'll just keep doing

371
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,300
what the book says.

372
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,910
Who told you
to climb in through the window?

373
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,530
I came for a secret midnight rendezvous.

374
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,950
I thought you knew you couldn't beat me,

375
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,370
so you tried to scare me to death instead.

376
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,430
If you don't like it,

377
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,110
I won't wear makeup next time.

378
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,230
You're not still mad, are you?

379
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,110
I'm not mad.

380
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,480
You don't have to lie.

381
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,880
I understand.

382
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,350
If you held a wedding with another woman,

383
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,950
I'd be mad for a long time too.

384
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,560
That's why you came to see me?

385
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,830
Come on, Heavenly Lord.

386
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,400
Forgive me, will you?

387
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,640
Didn't I tell you to stop reading

388
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,970
that ridiculous stuff?

389
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,160
The books say this is how you apologize.

390
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,590
You…

391
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,510
No apology is needed.

392
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,140
I'm not mad.

393
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,310
The books also say when couples fight,
they mean the opposite

394
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,830
of what they say.

395
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,110
Mention those books again
and see what happens.

396
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,550
Okay, okay. I won't.

397
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,920
Tell me. What else?

398
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,630
Actually, I want you to teach me magic.

399
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,440
You want me to teach you?

400
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:24,980
Why?

401
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,790
Because I don't want
to keep being a burden to you.

402
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,610
You already have so much on your plate.

403
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,510
I don't want to be someone

404
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,240
you always have to rescue.

405
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,230
We're husband and wife.

406
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,040
I can't keep dragging you down.

407
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,890
That's the only reason?

408
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,840
I heard that you live
as long as the sun and moon.

409
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,170
But my magic is too weak.

410
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,500
One day, I'll grow old, get sick, and die.

411
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,720
If I could improve my magic,

412
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,070
maybe I could stay by your side

413
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,310
a little longer.

414
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,940
Come find me tomorrow.
I'll teach you magic.

415
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,240
Even though you agreed to teach me,

416
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,240
I still think you're holding onto

417
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,960
some resentment

418
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,830
about that whole wedding thing.

419
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,220
How about this?

420
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,220
Kiss me,

421
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,610
and I'll believe you're not mad anymore.

422
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,260
Look, he's shy.

423
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,850
Burn the evil, ignite the wicked.
Control their life and death.

424
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,890
Rise.

425
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,190
I know your magic is weak,

426
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,310
but I didn't expect it to be so weak.

427
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,980
Burn the evil, ignite the wicked.
Control their life and death.

428
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,770
Rise.

429
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,660
Heavenly Lord, I conjured fire!

430
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,550
Look, Heavenly Lord.

431
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,860
Heavenly Lord.

432
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,480
Look.

433
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,310
It's gone.

434
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,720
Gone?

435
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,110
This is the Blazing Fire.

436
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,480
Heavenly Lord, you're amazing.

437
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,860
Rise.

438
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,750
It's fire.

439
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,080
Ning Yan, look.

440
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,680
Ning Yan, I did it!

441
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,870
No, My Lady.

442
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,880
I'm afraid of fire.

443
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,640
I'm afraid of it.

444
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,790
Take a look.

445
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,400
No, My Lady.

446
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,590
Yin Tongzi!

447
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,790
Yin Tongzi!

448
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,720
What? Do you want to hear a story?

449
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,070
No.

450
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,250
I'm not listening.

451
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,350
I'm not listening.

452
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,710
I saw it clearly today.

453
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,870
The fire magic Her Ladyship uses

454
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,650
isn't the Fire-Parting Technique
mastered by Divine Lord Siling.

455
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,960
I took that magic from her.

456
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,210
But when she saw it again today,

457
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,530
she wasn't angered at all.

458
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:46,530

My Lady, have some peaches.

465
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,200
We've been eating peaches
for a whole month now.

466
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,530
Aren't you sick of them?

467
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,440
Not at all.

468
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,790
They're delicious.

469
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,200
I've been eating them for centuries.

470
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,160
Look, the boy loves them too.

471
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,480
Count how many peaches are on the table.

472
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,500
Isn't there anywhere here

473
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,160
even remotely like a kitchen?

474
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,510
No one in Canglei Palace
eats or cooks.

475
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,380
Of course there's no kitchen.

476
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,720
Immortals really do live differently.

477
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,960
My Lady, His Lordship treats you so well.

478
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,240
If you ask him for a kitchen,

479
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,770
I'm sure he'll say yes.

480
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,610
You think so?

481
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,650
Definitely!

482
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,440
No.

483
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,030
Why not?

484
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,480
No reason.

485
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,230
If I beat you in Go,

486
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,960
will you give me a kitchen?

487
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,790
You?

488
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,480
Me.

489
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,760
All right.

490
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,390
Should I put it here?

491
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,510
Can't you see my pieces

492
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,830
have surrounded yours?

493
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,730
Yeah.

494
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,770
I'll put it somewhere else.

495
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,210
How about here?

496
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,350
What do you think?

497
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,210
It probably doesn't work.

498
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,680
Let me think about it.

499
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,070
Do you know how to play Go or not?

500
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,880
I do.

501
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,830
I used to play with
Senior Zhang Suan at Jingyun Sect.

502
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,920
I never lost once.

503
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,270
Why do I keep losing to you?

504
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,670
Are you seriously
comparing me to a mortal?

505
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,800
Sorry, my bad.

506
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,200
You're the best.

507
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,820
Heavenly Lord,

508
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,780
in the mortal realm,
we say you should eat what you lack.

509
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,170
And since I'm so bad at chess,

510
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,750
I must be lacking
brain-nourishing, protein-rich food.

511
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,300
If I had some hickory nuts,

512
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,659
fish, roasted pork, and stuff like that,

513
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,320
maybe I'd improve a little.

514
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,590
Then eat them.

515
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,239
Hickory nuts are easy to find.

516
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,610
But fish and pork…

517
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,070
Even if I had the ingredients,

518
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,880
they'd need to be cooked first.

519
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,190
You're right.

520
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,840
If I could
build a kitchen in this courtyard

521
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,219
and stock it with flour, oil, and grains,

522
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,400
I could cook regularly

523
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,510
and even bring you a dish or two.

524
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,840
Whatever.

525
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,760
So you're saying yes?

526
00:34:59,110 --> 00:34:59,710
You lost.

527
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,590
I already lost?

528
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,220
What about my kitchen?

529
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,800
My Lord.

530
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,000
Miss Ling'er is back.

531
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,720
That's enough for today.

532
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,880
You may go.

533
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,030
Who's Miss Ling'er?

534
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,550
His Lordship actually
has to receive her personally.

535
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,760
I didn't fail my mission.

536
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,190
The cracks in the Zhuri Sword
have all been mended.

537
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,400
I placed it in a yang-infused place
to absorb the sun's energy.

538
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,960
After 81 days, it will be fully restored,

539
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,510
[Fan Ling'er]

540
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,920
and its divine power will return.

541
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,480
Well done.

542
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,720
Seems Miss Ling'er's trip
to the mortal realm

543
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,150
has made her even more capable.

544
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,590
Of course.

545
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,440
She's my daughter after all.

546
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,400
Miss Ling'er,

547
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,040
I missed you terribly while you were gone.

548
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,110
His Lordship thinks
I'm not as considerate as you,

549
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,070
and your father wouldn't listen to me.

550
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,320
Now that you're back,

551
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,590
you'd better stay a while.

552
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,360
That depends on
His Lordship's arrangements.

553
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,360
Then stay here
in Canglei Palace for a while.

554
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,020
No need to leave again.

555
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,230
-Thank you, Master.
-Thank you, My Lord.

556
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,190
Heavenly Lord, are you in?

557
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,000
Hello, My Lady.

558
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:01,970
You...

559
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,080
Let me introduce you.

560
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,140
This is His Lordship's newlywed wife,

561
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,850
Li Qingyue from Jingyun Sect.

562
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,760
This is Immortal Lord Fan,

563
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,080
one of the Three Dharma Lords.

564
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,420
You already know him.

565
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,980
This is his daughter.

566
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,420
You can call her Ling'er.

567
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,820
She's been working for His Lordship
for almost 200 years now.

568
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,390
I was worried His Lordship
might get thirsty during the meeting,

569
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,590
so I brought some tea.

570
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,760
If you're discussing important matters,

571
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,710
I won't intrude.

572
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,490
Steward Cang,
could you please take it in for me?

573
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,110
Let her in.

574
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,760
It's okay.

575
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,840
Come on up.

576
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,410
Didn't you want to see me?

577
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,210
Why so quiet now?

578
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,440
I brought you tea.

579
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,590
Enjoy it.

580
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,270
Isn't this the teapot
from Linyuan Pavilion?

581
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:41,920
Yes.

582
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,280
Why is it cold?

583
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,800
It's meant to be cold.

584
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,960
What are you really here for?

585
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,650
I just wanted to see

586
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,800
the girl who could
get a personal welcome from you.

587
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,000
I didn't welcome her.

588
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,190
She returned
to report on official matters.

589
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,180
You don't need to explain
such trivial things to me.

590
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,530
I wasn't explaining.

591
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,670
I get it.

592
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,620
Wait a moment.

593
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,440
I'll go get some hot tea for you.

594
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,690
So this was the surprise
you prepared for me?

595
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,700
Be patient. There's more.

596
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,320
Come with me.

597
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,440
Come.

598
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,110
Ling'er,

599
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,630
it's not ladylike for you to wield swords

600
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,280
and fight.

601
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,070
You should learn
to be gentle and virtuous.

602
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,000
Look.

603
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,480
Later, get changed,

604
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,550
comb your hair, and wear more hairpins.

605
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,480
I'm a Dharma Lord.

606
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,750
Very rich.

607
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,980
I don't know how to spend all my money.

608
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,420
So help me out a bit,

609
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,590
won't you?

610
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,570
If you're really that rich,

611
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,280
why not buy some dresses and jewelry

612
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,840
for the Heavenly Lady?

613
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,230
She may put in a good word for you

614
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,280
with His Lordship.

615
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,610
So you already know.

616
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,110
Why didn't you
tell me His Lordship got married?

617
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,790
It all happened so suddenly.

618
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,570
I only found out after the fact.

619
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,290
And with the inexplicable turbulence
in Hell Ruins lately,

620
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,180
I've been swamped, and it slipped

621
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,800
my mind.

622
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,710
It slipped my mind.

623
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,910
Did it slip your mind,
or did you keep it from me on purpose?

624
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,400
It's a done deal now.

625
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,140
What difference does it make?

626
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,190
Ling'er.

627
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,320
Ling'er.

628
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,000
I took a quick glance
at her today at the hall.

629
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,590
From her face alone,

630
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,070
I knew why His Lordship married her.

631
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,480
To look that much like her

632
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,970
is a skill in itself.

633
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,490
I lost, and I accept it.

634
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:37,840
Go.

635
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,400
Kill her.
