3
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,920
Why are you guarding the gate?

4
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,150
My juniors are all excited about
coming to the Nine Heavens

5
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,210
for the first time.

6
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,570
Forget the gate.

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,930
Go get some rest.

8
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,290
We're in for a brutal fight tomorrow.

9
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,360
Qingyue.

10
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,280
Do we really have to fight?

11
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,900
May I ask, are you Divine Lord Siling?

12
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,660
I am.

13
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,720
Greetings, Your Divinity.

14
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,470
I'm Lingshu,

15
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,030
the divine official
under Lord Yu Ya of the Wenxuan Palace.

16
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,300
I've come here

17
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,360
to register the immortals
who have ascended

18
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,490
to the Nine Heavens.

19
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,910
I've worked
at Wenxuan Palace for 1,000 years.

20
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,470
I've seen husbands and wives ascend,
brothers ascend,

21
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,950
but never an entire sect
ascend all at once.

22
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,700
You're all powerful and blessed.

23
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,750
Such destiny is rare even in 1,000 years.

24
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,810
Congratulations.

25
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,560
Let's start with this gentleman here.

26
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,880
May I have your name?

27
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,450
No need for registration.

28
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,510
Why not?

29
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,800
We didn't ascend to become immortals.

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,870
If not for immortality,

31
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,530
why did you come to the Nine Heavens?

32
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,180
To spill blood.

33
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,190
But the Nine Heavens hold no mortals,
only immortals.

34
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,440
Then we'll kill immortals.

35
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,450
Senior, just now Divine Lord Siling said

36
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,870
you killed
Master Qing Yang of Jingyun Sect.

37
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,930
What's that about?

38
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,870
She must be holding a grudge
over my earlier warning

39
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,270
and wants to get rid of me,

40
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,890
so she framed me to ruin my name.

41
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,050
But Siling has never

42
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,160
done anything like that before.

43
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,060
What?

44
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,460
You trust her more than me?

45
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,750
I'm just thinking

46
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,490
maybe there's been some misunderstanding.

47
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,410
I'm upright and honest.

48
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,410
If I did it, I'll own up to it.

49
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,480
But if I didn't,

50
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,959
no one's pinning it on me.

51
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,630
Tomorrow, I'll fight Siling myself.

52
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,750
Even if she kills me,

53
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,480
I won't let a false accusation
stain my name.

54
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,040
Don't worry, Senior Long Yuan.

55
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,390
We won't let you fight alone.

56
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,159
We'll fight by your side
till the very end.

57
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,340
We'll fight by your side
till the very end!

58
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,190
We'll fight by your side
till the very end!

59
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,610
Calm down. Master will return soon.

60
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,770
Where's Fan Jiaojiao?

61
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,140
He seems to have gone
to pick up his daughter.

from Canglei Palace is here

64

sent me to bring Miss Ling'er home.

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,640
Master?

[Prosperity]

70

It figures.

71
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,940
The moment he fed Ling'er
the Nightmare Flower,

72
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,390
I should've known

73
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,520
he wouldn't come to fetch her himself.

74
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,170
Celestial Attendant Fan
has suffered enough.

75
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,660
I just hope that when she wakes up,

76
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,980
she won't hate me
for sending her back to her father.

77
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,010
Master, you only did that

78
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,630
for her safety.

79
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,780
Ling'er, don't blame me.

80
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,930
This is the only way to keep you still

81
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,920
and out of trouble.

82
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,970
Immortal Lord,
after Miss Ling'er wakes up,

83
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,990
she might end up hating you forever.

84
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,250
It's not like she ever liked me very much.

85
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,670
I'm protecting her.

86
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,500
You're getting more insolent by the day—

87
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,610
barging in uninvited.

88
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,750
You still haven't answered
the question I asked at the gate earlier.

89
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,720
What question?

90
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,530
Do we… have to fight tomorrow?

91
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,270
What do you think?

92
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,970
Why else have we
come all the way up here?

93
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,270
I don't like Bai Jiusi

94
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,200
or the people from Canglei Palace,

95
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
but there's something I want to ask.

96
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,360
Do you really believe Master Qing Yang

97
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,710
was killed by Long Yuan?

98
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,030
Who else could it have been?

99
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,960
Instead of overthinking,
you'd be better off getting some rest.

100
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,980
That's definitely…

101
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,870
It hurts, so he's real.

102
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,470
He's real?

103
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,390
Don't you believe me?

104
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:36,720
Stop.

105
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,870
Junior, I'll do it myself.

106
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,880
How is it?

107
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,710
How is it? Is that him?

108
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,750
His Lordship is back.

109
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,830
His Lordship is back!

110
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,910
His Lordship is back!

111
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,380
He's back!

112
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:55,960
Sorry, sorry.

113
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,990
I'm sorry, Senior. I'm so sorry.

114
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,370
Master, Siling was the one
who started it this time.

115
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,300
She clearly wants to get back at me
for declaring war last time.

116
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,000
In my opinion,

117
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,800
we shouldn't have
let Jingyun Sect off the hook last time.

118
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,070
Master, why are you
looking at me like that?

119
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,360
Do you really believe Siling's

120
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,020
false accusation against me?

121
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:34,990
Master.

122
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,460
Long Yuan may have been a bit aggressive,

123
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,480
but I don't think
he'd have killed Qing Yang.

124
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,940
There has to be
some misunderstanding here.

125
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,490
Now that you've returned,

126
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,140
why don't you invite
Divine Lord Siling over for a talk?

127
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,510
No need.

128
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,450
My Lord, you mean…

129
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,370
Open the barrier tomorrow.

130
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,490
Let them in.

131
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,320
Master, you've finally made up your mind.

132
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,380
Tomorrow, allow me

133
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,500
to be the first to charge into battle.

134
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,520
It's about time we redecorated

135
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,980
Canglei Palace.

136
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,420
You're awake, Ling'er.

137
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,010
What have you done to me?

138
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,100
Where's my spiritual energy?

139
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,760
What the hell did you do to me?

140
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,910
Ling'er, don't blame me.

141
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,050
You kept ignoring my warnings,

142
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,220
so I had no choice
but to destroy your cultivation…

143
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,280
to make you a bit more obedient

144
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,920
and keep you from getting in danger again.

145
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,680
You wiped away over 200 years
of my cultivation?

146
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,370
It's nothing serious. Don't worry.

147
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,360
Even without your spiritual energy,

148
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,320
you're still immortal.

149
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,000
From now on, I'll protect you.

150
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,110
I won't let anything happen to you.

151
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,750
Siling is about to attack us soon.

152
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,330
I need to go help Master.

153
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,650
I can't stay with you now.

154
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,250
If you need anything, tell Zhu Li.

155
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,020
Tell Zhu Li.

156
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,580
Stop right there! I said stop!

157
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,270
Come on.

158
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,450
Once we leave,

159
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,350
you'll lead the outer disciples

160
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,200
to activate the protective formation.

161
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,910
After that,
not even a bird will get through,

162
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,310
and no magic can break it.

163
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,930
Yes, Grandmaster.

164
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,570
You all just stay in the sect.

165
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,640
No matter the danger,

166
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,890
I'll follow you without hesitation,
Grandmaster.

167
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,610
You three stay here as well.

168
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,670
Grandmaster…

169
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,000
When Grandmaster gives an order,

170
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,380
you follow it.

171
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,320
Yes.

172
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,260
Jiang Bian.

173
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,480
I'm here.

174
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,210
You'll stay behind to guard the gate too.

175
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,390
Yes, Grandmaster.

176
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,870
I...

177
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,300
Master, please be careful.

178
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,650
It's time. Let's go.

179
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,460
Farewell, Grandmaster.

180
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,580
Steward Cang?

181
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,130
Why are you the only one here to face us?

182
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,910
Is there no one else in Canglei Palace?

183
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,790
I've been ordered to welcome you.

184
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,800
His Lordship
has prepared a bridal palanquin for you.

185
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,030
Please come with me.

186
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,490
Bai Jiusi has returned?

187
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,770
What did you tell him?

188
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,390
I came here for a fight.

189
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,030
Why prepare a bridal palanquin for me?

190
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,040
His Lordship said that

191
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,030
if you're willing
to come in the palanquin,

192
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,520
you'll leave here today feeling satisfied.

193
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,480
Is he offering up
Long Yuan's head as a gift?

194
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,090
You'll see soon enough.

195
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,310
Fine. I'd like to see what trick

196
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,610
Bai Jiusi has up his sleeve this time.

197
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,060
Master has her reasons for doing things.

198
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,020
All we need to do is follow her lead.

199
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,000
What is Master thinking?

200
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,230
Why is Canglei Palace adorned this way?

201
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,320
I heard he even
sent a bridal palanquin to fetch Siling.

202
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,820
This place doesn't look prepared
for battle at all.

203
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,420
It looks more like a wedding.

204
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,400
Is he really offering up Senior Long Yuan

205
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,610
as an apology?

206
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,770
I don't think so.

207
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,880
Did you see that sword on the table?

208
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,210
That's the Qiyue Sword.

209
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,870
It's on par with Siling's Zhuri Sword.

210
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,620
It was refined for 10,000 years.

211
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,360
It can split the heavens
and slay immortals.

212
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,680
Forged from
10,000-year-old cold stone,

213
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,680
it's a natural counter
to Siling's fire-based power.

214
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,100
I think these festive decorations

215
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,820
are just bait to lower Siling's guard.

216
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,280
Once she's here,

217
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,320
she probably won't walk out.

218
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,520
Good.

219
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,830
Let's see how long

220
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,890
Siling can keep up that arrogant act.

221
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,240
Woman!

222
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,150
If it's you, come down!

223
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,640
Answer me, is it you?

224
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,900
Yes, it's me.

225
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,140
Have you opened your eyes?

226
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,530
I've opened my eyes.

227
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,100
Woman, you've lost!

228
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,850
Yes, I've lost.

229
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,330
-She's opened her eyes.
-She's opened her eyes.

230
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:51,830
She's opened her eyes.

231
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,010
We've won!

232
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,620
We've won!

233
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,920
We've won! We've won!

234
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,140
We've won! We've won!

235
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,550
We've won!

236
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,190
Form up!

237
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,350
If you've got the guts, let us out!

238
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,750
Don't play dirty tricks!

239
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,330
What a nuisance.

240
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,850
Master, are you injured?

241
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,910
I'm fine.

242
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,230
The palanquin is broken.

243
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,010
Please wait a moment, Divine Lord.

244
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,790
I'll have another one brought over.

245
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,160
No need. I didn't need it anyway.

246
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,970
I'll go there myself.

247
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,020
Divine Lord Siling is here.

248
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,080
You've come.

249
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,190
After hiding like a coward all this time,

250
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,490
you finally decided to show up.

251
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,760
How dare you speak to my master like that!

252
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,590
Bai Jiusi, what are you scheming now?

253
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,330
When we married last time,
we didn't have a proper wedding.

254
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,190
I've always regretted that.

255
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,120
Since we've got the chance today,
I thought I'd make it up to you.

256
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,460
Look around, so many honored guests.

257
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,470
Doesn't it feel like
I've held a wedding banquet for you?

258
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,780
Stop stalling.

259
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Are you trying to protect Long Yuan?

260
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,150
Don't worry. You'll get what you came for.

261
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:30,900
Ruyue.

262
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,420
You look beautiful in red.

263
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,610
By my count, I've married you three times.

264
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,680
In the temple of the Primordial God,

265
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,850
Xiaoqiu Valley,

266
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,750
Tianmu Peak, and Jingyun Sect…

267
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,790
Unfortunately,

268
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,830
none of them ended well.

269
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,340
I'm truly sorry.

270
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,220
Enough of this nonsense.

271
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,740
Just answer me this.

272
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,900
I'm going to kill Long Yuan.

273
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,540
Will you let me or not?

274
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,740
Long Yuan, come here.

275
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,020
Long Yuan, I want you to swear an oath.

276
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,700
No matter what happens in the future,

277
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,590
you'll never harm Ruyue

278
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,540
or anyone from Jingyun Sect.

279
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,190
If you break this oath,
your body and soul will perish completely,

280
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,660
and you'll never find peace.

281
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,210
So you've decided to protect him?

282
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,550
Swear it!

283
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,400
I'll say it one last time—

284
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,630
swear it!

285
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,380
I, Long Yuan,

286
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,480
hereby swear

287
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,350
that no matter what happens in the future,

288
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,220
I'll never harm Siling

289
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,910
or anyone from Jingyun Sect.

290
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,660
If I break this oath,
my body and soul will perish completely!

291
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,790
Great.

292
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,230
Go back.

293
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,880
Bai Jiusi,

294
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,930
since you've made your decision,

295
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,600
what are you waiting for?

296
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,610
Draw your sword!

297
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,610
-What are you doing?
-You said it yourself.

298
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,160
A life for a life would be enough.

299
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,020
Your master's life…

300
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,770
I'll repay it for my disciple.

301
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,350
Master!

302
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:42,920
Master!

303
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,600
Master!

304
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,310
Master!

305
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,170
Don't move!

306
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,720
I made a terrible mistake…

307
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,980
that's beyond saving.

308
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,990
Ruyue.

309
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,420
I'm truly sorry.

310
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,520
Master!

311
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,100
Master!

312
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,780
Siling! Give my master back!

313
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,120
Kill them all!

314
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,990
Don't forget the oath

315
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,030
Master just made you swear.

316
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,040
Are you going to defy

317
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,050
Master's last order?

318
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:10,090
Avenge Master! Avenge Master!

319
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,290
Avenge Master!

320
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,290
Avenge Master!

321
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:17,800
Form up!

322
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,460
Grandmaster!

323
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,610
Zhang Suan, what are you doing?

324
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,050
How is Grandmaster?

325
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,150
Go find Zhang Suan.

326
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,640
But Grandmaster...

327
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,200
Do as I say. Go find him!

328
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,520
Find Zhang Suan!

329
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,500
-Yes.
-Yes.

330
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,530
You…

331
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,350
Long Yuan.

332
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,960
Something seems
to have happened among them.

333
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,000
Let them go.

334
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,490
[Lord Qing Xu, Yuan Chenghua]

335
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,720
[Lord Qing Xu, Yuan Chenghua]

336
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,780
[Lord Qing Xu, Yuan Chenghua]

337
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,590
Break!

338
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,250
[Lord Qing Xu, Yuan Chenghua]

339
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,680
[Lord Qing Xu, Yuan Chenghua]

340
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,060
Oh, no.

341
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,240
He's heading for the Infinite Stele.

342
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,560
After him!

343
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,530
Yes.

344
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,340
Sword, return!

345
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,190
Bai Jiusi, you didn't die?

346
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,590
You were putting on an act
to fool me just now.

347
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,360
For someone like you,

348
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,440
a coward hiding behind others,

349
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,310
if we hadn't staged that,

350
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,870
you never would've exposed yourself.

351
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,360
I didn't expect that

352
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,480
in the end, I actually helped bring

353
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,240
the two of you back together.

354
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,140
It seems you know a lot about our past.

355
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,680
To deal with me,

356
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,560
you went to such great lengths.

357
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,560
So I guess

358
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,670
I'd better play along.

359
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,640
Go ahead.

360
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,160
Kill me or torture me.

361
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,630
Do your worst.

362
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,700
Alright, but get off Zhang Suan first.

363
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,460
We really do need to have a good talk,

364
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,150
Xiao Jingshan.

365
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,410
How dare you come here?

366
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,360
I went digging into some old history.

367
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,070
Sorry I'm late.

368
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,370
What old history?

369
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,890
I met with Xi E, the Goddess of Time.

370
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,850
Now, I know everything

371
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,650
that happened in the past.

372
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,040
I don't care what you found out

373
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,970
or what you know.

374
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,070
All I know is, my master is dead now.

375
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,890
It was not Long Yuan who did it.

376
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,630
I know.

377
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,480
Bai Jiusi,

378
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,230
let's put our grudges aside for now.

379
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,120
I have something
more important to tell you.

380
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,030
In the illusion I created

381
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,890
in Songhe County
using the Great Wilderness Stele,

382
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,370
do you remember seeing Zhang Suan there?

383
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,480
I do.

384
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,990
The Great Wilderness Stele
was under my control.

385
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,320
Without my permission,

386
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,840
no one could enter

387
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,190
or disrupt the illusion it created.

388
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,500
Unless...

389
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,030
Unless it's the person
who created the Great Wilderness Stele.

390
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,520
Because a celestial artifact can recognize

391
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,440
its maker and won't resist them.

392
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,370
When I helped you repair the Zhuri Sword,

393
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,640
I read many books on artifact forging.

394
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,580
So that Zhang Suan,

395
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:53,830
who is he, really?

396
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,550
I watched Zhang Suan
join Jingyun Sect myself.

397
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,010
Nothing's wrong with him.

398
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,900
The problem is that when he came
to the Nine Heavens to find me,

399
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,330
he met someone.

400
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,890
That person, right before death,

401
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,850
passed all his cultivation to him.

402
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:11,650
Who was it?

403
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,960
An old acquaintance of yours.

404
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,660
Xiao Jingshan.

405
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,880
I remember him.

406
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,140
He was a highly gifted cultivator
in the mortal realm,

407
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,800
skilled in artifact forging.

408
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,410
After ascending to the Nine Heavens,

409
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,260
he repeatedly tried
to destroy the Infinite Stele.

410
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,100
I caught him

411
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,310
and handed him over
to the Heavenly Emissary,

412
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,630
who imprisoned him
on the Heavenly Punishment Platform.

413
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,230
Why does he want
to destroy the Infinite Stele?

414
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,800
The real reason remains unknown.

415
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,110
Looks like that's where the problem lies.

416
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,400
You protected the Infinite Stele,

417
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,060
while he wanted to destroy it.

418
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,910
That gave him the motive
to use me against you.

419
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,950
I'm afraid that's not the only reason.

420
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,100
He tried many times
to destroy the Infinite Stele,

421
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,810
but it remained intact.

422
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,550
To destroy the Infinite Stele completely,

423
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,680
you'd need ancient divine artifacts.

424
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,880
The Zhuri Sword and the Qiyue Sword?

425
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,440
Exactly.

426
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,080
In fact, that's why I came here today.

427
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,750
I went to Yu Ya to check the Book of Fate
for these two people.

428
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,840
They died over 600 years ago

429
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,610
during the battle
to eliminate the Lei Bird.

430
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,610
Whoever you encountered afterward

431
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,810
might've been people
disguising themselves as them.

432
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,620
If that's the case,

433
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,190
our falling out

434
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,090
really was orchestrated
by someone behind the scenes.

435
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,160
It's all my fault.

436
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,620
I realized it too late.

437
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,350
If someone's trying
to turn us against each other,

438
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,890
why don't we just stage a brutal fight

439
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,530
to give them what they want?

440
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,470
Whatever you say, I'll do it.

441
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,390
I only have one request.

442
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,140
What is it?

443
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,210
When you come to kill me,

444
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,860
could you wear red?

445
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,620
Bai Jiusi,

446
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,160
this isn't a reconciliation.

447
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,450
Shi'an, Meng Changqin, and my master

448
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,530
all died,
directly or indirectly, because of you.

449
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,030
Once this is over,

450
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,000
we'll settle our scores.

451
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:31,030
Someone is using me against Bai Jiusi,

452
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,270
likely to destroy the Infinite Stele.

453
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,290
Today, I brought the entire sect to ascend

454
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,780
to draw that person out.

455
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:43,420
I'm standing right in front of you.

456
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,060
Who else do you want to find?

457
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,000
You disguised yourself
as the Immortal of Amusements

458
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,330
to give me the Record of Artifacts, right?

459
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,590
After all that's been said,

460
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,990
you still don't dare show your face?

461
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,610
No wonder you've spent centuries
lurking and scheming

462
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,770
in the shadows.

463
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,410
You let me fool you for centuries.

464
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,430
You really are a pair of idiots.
