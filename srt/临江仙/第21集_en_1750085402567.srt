1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Who will be the 그래서 stomach-sick guy?

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,840
doing something else?

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,060
Back stressing

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,680
They're very cute

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,220
Where are we again?

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,540
lately

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,700
Sex&rock

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,400
on manyok

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,600
Normally

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,720
I ignored them

11
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,120
But

12
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,000
He's right

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,980
You're making fun of us

14
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,780
I am

15
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,900
gonna use that

16
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,320
God

17
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,480
to give immediate direction

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,480
The shadow of the spring is scattered

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,480
I pretend to be heartless

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,480
I don't care about your eyes

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,480
But tears are the essence of time

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,480
I want to learn to be independent

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,480
To be the perfect result

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Forget about the past

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,480
And stick to your smile

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Flower memory

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,480
Something happened

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,480
What's wrong?

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,480
I just arrived at the palace

30
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
The guards are back

31
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,480
They have sent out the protection code

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,480
To put Longyuan and the Immortal Army in the trap

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,480
The code seems to be created by the Immortal Lord

34
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,480
It's powerful and invincible

35
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,480
It can't even break the Longyuan

36
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,480
Besides, the code has the ability to weaken the power

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
This...

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,480
If we stay for a while

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,480
Longyuan's power will be too low

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
How could that be?

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,480
I know the rules and I don't know the truth

42
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,480
So I'm here to guard you

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Go and bring someone to rescue Longyuan

44
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
This...

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,480
You can't get lost now

46
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,480
You can't cause trouble again

47
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,480
I'll go with the Immortal Lord to the trap

48
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Okay

49
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,480
Let's go

50
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
Yes

51
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,480
I don't have the courage to kill the Immortal Lord

52
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
I have to know

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
In the nine heaven and earth

54
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
The three realms are here

55
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,480
I can kill you

56
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
I can kill you

57
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
I can kill you

58
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,480
But I'm the only one left

59
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,480
For the past six years

60
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,480
I've been so hard on the people who have been killed

61
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,480
This is the pain you've been through

62
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is too weak

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
It's just a long search

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
It's not a good time to be in the Valley

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,480
You hate me so much

66
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,480
Why don't you kill me?

67
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
But you have to take the precious

68
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,480
And make me a hero for six years

69
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
I tried to kill you

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,480
But the Immortal Lord of the City has no power

71
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,480
I can't kill you

72
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,480
So I can only put your Immortal Lord in this trap

73
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,480
I can only kill you

74
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,480
If I can kill you

75
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,480
For the past six years

76
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,480
I've been so hard on the people who have been killed

77
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,480
I can only kill you

78
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,480
But the Immortal Lord of the City has no power

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
For the past six years

80
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,480
This is a illusion

81
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
That's right

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,480
This is just a illusion

83
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,480
It's a illusion I've been working on for you

84
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
What?

85
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Did you fall for it?

86
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,480
How sad are you?

87
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Everything here is fake

88
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

89
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

90
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

91
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,480
And the Immortal Lord of the City is also fake

92
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

93
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
In this place

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,480
Only I can kill you

95
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Is true

96
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
No matter what I see

97
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
It's impossible

98
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
You're the one who gave me everything

99
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

100
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

101
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

102
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

103
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

104
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

105
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,480
You're the one who gave me everything

106
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
It's so good

107
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,480
I can only kill you

108
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,480
And the Immortal Lord of the City is fake

109
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

110
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,480
I can't even compare to the one who killed the Immortal Lord of the City

111
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Where did he die?

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

113
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

114
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Especially the woman who lost her family

115
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
She's like the fire in the darkness

116
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
She's weak and weak

117
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,480
She can't even kill the Immortal Lord of the City

118
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
The Immortal Lord of the City is fake

119
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
It's you

120
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
I finally understand

121
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Xiu Hua

122
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Xiu Hua

123
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
It's the past

124
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
You've been missing

125
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,480
What happened to you in the past ten years of the law

126
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
I've been telling you

127
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
You don't understand

128
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,480
You gave me everything

129
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Don't run

130
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
Don't run

131
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Are you dead?

132
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
I hate you

133
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,480
I hate you

134
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
I hate you

135
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
I hate you

136
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
I hate you

137
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,480
I knew that you're not your character

138
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,480
You pretended to be arrested that day

139
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Because you heard me say

140
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,480
You found the Immortal Lord of the City, right?

141
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Ling Er

142
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Do you still want to hurt Immortal Lord of the City?

143
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Bai Jiu Si killed Immortal Lord of the City to kill himself

144
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,480
Now, it's hard to get a chance

145
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,480
I must make him the one who only has the right power

146
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,480
You're really hurt by that Immortal Lord of the City

147
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,480
You and I are the same

148
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
You really want to protect them?

149
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
Ling Er

150
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
Immortal Lord is my master

151
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
You're my daughter

152
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,480
Can you stop making me feel uncomfortable?

153
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
uncomfortable?

154
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
When did you feel uncomfortable?

155
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Anyway, your choice is never mine

156
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,480
I'll say it one last time

157
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
Get out

158
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
Then you kill me first

159
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Do you think I don't dare?

160
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
My child

161
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
I used to have a child

162
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
I can't do it

163
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
I can't do it

164
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
I can't do it, right?

165
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Bai Jiu Si

166
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,480
How dare you thank me for this?

167
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,480
You're not qualified to do this

168
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,480
You're not qualified to be a father to him

169
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Immortal Lord

170
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,480
I want to make him the one who only has the right power

171
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
Impossible

172
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
You're lying to me

173
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
You just want me to die

174
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
You're lying to me, right?

175
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
You're lying to me, right?

176
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
You're lying to me, right?

177
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
You're so hard-hearted

178
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,480
You'll be hurt

179
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,480
You're lying to me, right?

180
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
You're lying to me, right?

181
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Bai Jiu Si

182
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
You should die

183
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
You're lying to me, right?

184
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
Immortal Lord

185
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
My son

186
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
Please give me Han Lee Bi

187
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Please explain to me

188
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,480
Everything is a misunderstanding

189
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Please, my son

190
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Give it to me

191
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
You're crazy

192
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,780
Back's in the head мик

193
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,640
Right

194
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,520
I know it's yours

195
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,760
Water's邱

196
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,160
I can't let you go.

197
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,040
Jeolla prepared for you.

198
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,720
Just once.

199
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,120
But we...

200
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,840
We have a baby.

201
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,200
What is happening now?

202
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,400
It's me.

203
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,160
��var.

204
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:16,240
towards the location where the

205
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,120
enemy went!

206
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,820
I am their guardian...

207
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,040
...for Bichang Arch.

208
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,320
I don't see why not use your power.

209
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,940
But if it can ARM asks,

210
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,920
we will have right at Bichang Arch.

211
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,780
Yes!

212
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,280
I just said that thisstoneルan$$ is shining.

213
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,440
that's why I want you to see it.

214
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,360
You broke your Range of Want.

215
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,760
I only take it out.

216
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
I don't know why she's broken.

217
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
Nonsense!

218
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,120
I couldn't break anything.

219
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
You must have used your soul power.

220
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
I didn't do anything.

221
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
I'm sorry.

222
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
Brother Xiaohuan!

223
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
Brother.

224
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Shut up.

225
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,120
You're guilty for saving me.

226
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
I'll kill you.

227
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
What are you doing?

228
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
Don't come over.

229
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
I'm the most loving disciple of the Shizu Clan.

230
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,120
If you dare hurt me, I'll kill you.

231
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
Brother.

232
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Brother.

233
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Brother.

234
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
Brother.

235
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,120
I am the most loving disciple of the Shizu Clan.

236
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,120
I've been a father for five years.

237
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,120
When I was five,

238
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,120
I went to the sect master's house

239
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,120
and asked the Shizu clan to teach me.

240
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,960
I willず encircle him completely.

241
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
I am your brother.

242
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,720
The world is bigger than you two.

243
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:58,440
Terms of life and death will pass.

244
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,720
Boredom

245
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,280
Long Ye Developers

246
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,220
on this old book

247
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,180
Held the Emerald of Black Doom!

248
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,700
You pigs...!

249
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Brother!

250
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm here!

251
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,980
Enough, Moon.

252
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,480
Bring him!

253
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Brother!

254
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,480
How did I get here?

255
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
How did I die?

256
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
How did I get here?

257
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
I have to die, too!

258
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,480
Brother!

259
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
Brother!

260
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Brother!

261
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
Brother!

262
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,480
I said...

263
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
I won't let you go!

264
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
Brother!

265
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
You little guys...

266
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
You're not good at magic.

267
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
You're not good at magic.

268
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
No!

269
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Brother!

270
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Brother!

271
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Sik-Ling!

272
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Get out of here!

273
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Brother!

274
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Brother!

275
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
What's wrong with the door?

276
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
Did you hide the power?

277
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Yes.

278
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Fortunately, the master is back.

279
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
He's already taken care of the people in the garden.

280
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
You're talking about Qingyue?

281
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
Brother Chang is very strict.

282
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
He can't be called master.

283
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Where is he?

284
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Brother Meng was seriously injured.

285
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
The master was injured for him.

286
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
He should be in the disciples' room.

287
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
You...

288
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,480
The master is still in the garden.

289
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,480
He can hurt you like this.

290
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Don't use magic these days.

291
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
You should rest.

292
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,480
Thank you, master.

293
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,480
You're injured.

294
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Don't mind it.

295
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
Are they all back?

296
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
They're all waiting outside the door.

297
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,480
Master, the master is here.

298
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Master!

299
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
Re famously,

300
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
you've come back from the north.

301
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
Listen,

302
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Go back inside naturally.

303
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
After you finish your business,

304
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
we will pay your price of house rent.

305
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Come out.

306
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Why do you come back in the miej meters?

307
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
Why are you at daytime?

308
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Let's go home.

309
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,480
You can go home now.

310
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,480
We'll see each other again when we're away.

311
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,480
It's a pity that I didn't have the chance to kill Bai Jiu Si.

312
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,480
There's still a chance.

313
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,480
After several battles, Cang Lei Hall is just like that.

314
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,480
Besides, there's a master's team to lead the formation.

315
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,480
I believe that if we don't win, we'll definitely succeed.

316
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,480
What do you think of Cang Lei Hall?

317
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,480
It's been so many years. Thank you for your hard work.

318
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,480
I'm sure that you'll be able to come back safely.

319
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
You'll be able to attack safely.

320
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Bai Jiu Si's spirit power is damaged and his attack is weak.

321
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,480
But Cang Lei Hall will definitely be in a serious condition.

322
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,480
We still need to protect our enemies and protect the gate.

323
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Please be careful and go to the capital.

324
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,480
Yes, Master.

325
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
Leave.

326
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Yes.

327
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Cang Lei Hall

328
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
Cang Lei Hall

329
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Cang Lei Hall

330
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Master!

331
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Master Xuan, you're back.

332
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
Master!

333
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Master, you've been recovering from your illness.

334
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,480
How are you feeling?

335
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,480
The woman in the temple is in danger.

336
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,480
Master, you're in danger again.

337
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
I'm the god of the world.

338
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
I can't let this go.

339
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,480
I'm sure that Master is going to order me to bring Si Ling back to ask for forgiveness.

340
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
No one can move.

341
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,480
I have a plan in my heart.

342
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Please leave.

343
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,480
Master, leave!

344
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Hurry up. Let's go.

345
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
Master, what happened?

346
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,480
I don't know what happened to Si Ling's demon girl.

347
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
What happened to her?

348
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,480
Master said that she was going to kill her.

349
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,480
I don't know what happened to her.

350
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,480
I don't know what happened to her.

351
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Master, you're so stubborn.

352
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
Master, you're so stubborn.

353
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,480
You're so stubborn.

354
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,480
I don't know what happened to her.

355
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Master said that no one can move.

356
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Please don't do anything wrong.

357
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
You're back.

358
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
Yes, Master.

359
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
I told you to stay in the Qingyun Sect.

360
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Before I come back, you don't have to look for me.

361
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Why don't you listen?

362
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Please punish me.

363
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,480
I followed Zhang Sun to Songhe County to find you.

364
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Later...

365
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,480
My father cheated me.

366
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,480
I don't know what you're up to.

367
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,480
But I heard that the people in the hidden palace found Bai Jiu Si.

368
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,480
So I wanted to take advantage of you to get rid of this bad luck.

369
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
I don't know what happened to her.

370
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,480
But I know that you're a good person.

371
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,480
You're a good person.

372
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,480
I'm sorry.

373
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,480
I'm sorry.

374
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
I'm sorry.

375
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,480
I'm sorry.

376
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
I'm sorry.

377
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
I'm sorry.

378
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
I'm sorry.

379
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
I'm sorry.

380
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,480
I'm sorry.

381
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,480
I'm sorry.

382
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,480
I'm sorry.

383
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
I know that you're thinking for me.

384
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,480
But don't act like a good person next time.

385
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Luckily, your father met you this time.

386
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,480
If you change your mind, you won't be able to get away with it.

387
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,480
You don't have to say anything for him.

388
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,480
He's just trying to be himself.

389
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,480
I can't say much about your father and daughter.

390
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Just be careful.

391
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Don't take risks next time.

392
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,480
Yes, Master.

393
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Master, Zhang Sun is here.

394
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,480
I know. You can go now.

395
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Go back and rest.

396
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Yes.

397
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
I have something to ask you.

398
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Are you a new master or Li Qingyun?

399
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,480
I'm a new master.

400
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
You were in the Jinyun Sect when you were 11 years old.

401
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
I was pretending.

402
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,480
I was pretending to be a good person.

403
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,480
I don't need to explain it to you.

404
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,480
But I don't want to see you being so loyal.

405
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,480
I don't want to see you being so serious.

406
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,480
I'm just worried about you.

407
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,480
You know I'm not loyal to you.

408
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
You're loyal to me.

409
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
I'm not loyal to you.

410
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,480
You came to hide some things from me when you were in the Jinyun Sect.

411
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
I was afraid you might be a bad person.

412
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,480
You were so close to me.

413
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
What's your problem?

414
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,480
I met someone in the Jinyun Sect.

415
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Who?

416
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Iet.

417
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Yeah.

418
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Man, still mad at me?

419
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,480
What's wrong?

420
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,480
That monk hasn't come to see you yet.

421
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,480
This proves that he still can't bear to see his sect.

422
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,480
In his mind, that Jingyun Sect is more important than you.

423
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,480
You're just a man.

424
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
If you really like him,

425
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,480
I'll go and get him.

426
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
I'll lock him up in your room.

427
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
You're almost there.

428
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
I'll count to three.

429
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
If you don't get up,

430
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
I'll be sorry to you.

431
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
One.

432
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
I'm sorry to you, bad old woman.

433
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
One.

434
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Two. Three.

435
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
You're a secret woman.

436
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
I'm sorry to have raised you.

437
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Xiao Jingshan?

438
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
Do you know him?

439
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
I haven't seen him, but I've heard that

440
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,480
500 years ago, he tried to destroy the White-Haired Man

441
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
and was arrested by the White-Haired Man.

442
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Later, he was ordered to be imprisoned by the Heavenly Emperor.

443
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
Now he's dead.

444
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Yes.

445
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
I saw it with my own eyes.

446
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,480
I've even made a stone cup for him.

447
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,480
Do you think it's wrong to do that?

448
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
No.

449
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,480
You're now a good man who has a good foundation.

450
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Ling said that you went to the Song River Line to look for me.

451
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,480
So you're the one who caused the illusion in the Song River Line.

452
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
What you said is...

453
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,480
This is the Yellow Cup.

454
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,480
How do you know it's the Yellow Cup?

455
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
I saw a book in the Library of the Past.

456
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
It contains the magical energy.

457
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
I think I've lost it with my own hands.

458
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,480
I don't remember how you did it.

459
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
How did you do it?

460
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
I don't know.

461
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,480
I just took it easy.

462
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
He just came out of the library.

463
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,480
You said that you saw the White-Haired Man in the Song River Line.

464
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
Do you remember that?

465
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
Yes, I do.

466
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,480
I did see the White-Haired Man in the Song River Line.

467
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,480
I didn't have the chance to attack him, so he disappeared.

468
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
The Yellow Cup is controlled by the magical energy.

469
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
Without my control, how can you enter?

470
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,480
Wang Chu, come out!

471
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
I told you not to come here again.

472
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,480
Do you understand?

473
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,480
If it weren't for you, I would have come to your place.

474
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Your place? We're the immortals now.

475
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
You can just come out of the place and beat you to death.

476
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,480
I didn't teach you how to do it.

477
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Don't think that I don't know how many gold and silver you have.

478
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,480
What are you talking about?

479
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,480
If you don't let me in, I'll break your door with the Silver-Haired Man.

480
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
You're kidding me.

481
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
You can't even enter our door.

482
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
You?

483
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,480
The door?

484
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
Who is that little disciple?

485
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
You don't know the door.

486
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Listen.

487
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,480
He is the first disciple of the Great Chen Xuan.

488
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
He can be a member of the group.

489
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,480
I have the most time to hold on to him.

490
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,480
Are you scared?

491
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,480
If you don't say the last sentence, I'm a little scared.

492
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
Master.

493
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Zhang Sun!

494
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
I knew you were the one who was angry.

495
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Are you here to pick me up?

496
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
I remember you.

497
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,480
You're the disciple of the one who got hurt by me.

498
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
You know that I didn't mean to hurt you.

499
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,480
But the little bitch Lv Su Guan had to pull you in front of him to get a treatment for him.

500
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
How are you?

501
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Are you healed?

502
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480
How about this?

503
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,480
You tell him to wait for me in front of the mountain.

504
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,480
If you help me today,

505
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,480
from now on, you'll be my little brother.

506
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,480
I'll take care of you in 12 weeks.

507
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,480
You can't leave without a trace.

508
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
What do you want to do?

509
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
What do you want to do?

510
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
You can do whatever you want.

511
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
I want to do whatever I want.

512
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Oh, right.

513
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
If someone bullies you,

514
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
you'll be my whole family.

515
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
If he still dares to be rude,

516
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,480
you tell him that I'll beat him to the ground.

517
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,480
Let him regret that he was born in 12 weeks.

518
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
You're so good.

519
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
Of course.

520
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,480
I'm the leader of Yin Lian Sect.

521
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,480
Have you heard of Yin Lian Sect?

522
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,480
No.

523
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Yin Lian Sect doesn't know.

524
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,480
No wonder I can only be a little brother

525
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
who doesn't know how to play.

526
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,480
I can't even beat a three-legged cat.

527
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,480
But...

528
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
You're so good today.

529
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,480
Forget it. I won't tell you.

530
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
Go find Brother Meng for me.

531
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,480
Let the leader come out and let him be quiet.

532
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,480
Mr. Why are you here?

533
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
Mr. Xie, this is a crab heart soup.

534
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,480
I added Nichuan Kyurou andräge in it.

535
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,480
This spectacular flavor will be of the mostん~!

536
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
I meant something else to make you feel better.

537
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
Don't be aquesta.

538
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,480
What is this?

539
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,440
Hu orazang banana- zabolo-

540
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
What are you talking about?

541
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
It goes wrong with glasses.

542
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
It makes me pronounce informationやكل.

543
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Basically done according to the instruction.

544
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,480
Junior sister, it's not appropriate for men and women to be together.

545
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,480
Besides, I'm changing clothes. It's not appropriate.

546
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,480
What men and women are not together? What's not appropriate?

547
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
We never had these problems when we were young.

548
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,480
How come you're still interested in it?

549
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,480
In the end, aren't you afraid of your little demon girl?

550
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,480
Yes, I'm just afraid of Ah Man's interest.

551
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,480
Junior sister, I already have a heart. Don't be obsessed with it anymore.

552
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,480
There are so many excellent disciples in the Jinyun Sect.

553
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,480
If you don't come in, you can go to other places to find them.

554
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,480
You can definitely find someone who's suspicious of you.

555
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Why are you hanging around in my tree?

556
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,480
Even if it's that big, pure, and pure servant's subordinate,

557
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,480
I can't look at it.

558
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,480
In my heart, there's only one senior brother.

559
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,480
If you don't want to, I'll wait.

560
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,480
I'll wait for you to be with me forever.

561
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
You'll be back.

562
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,480
Don't.

563
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Senior brother.

564
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,480
Jiang Bian, what's the matter?

565
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,480
Senior brother, that little demon girl came to see you.

566
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,480
She's shouting at the door.

567
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,480
The door is really big.

568
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,480
It's only been two hours since we've been together.

569
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
Senior brother.

570
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
Senior brother.

571
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,480
Let me drink.

572
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
Get out.

573
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
Senior brother.

574
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,480
Put the wine in my cup.

575
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
I'll let Ling'er fix it.

576
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,480
Go to the library and find the book you've read before.

577
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
Okay.

578
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,480
Did I mess up your plan?

579
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
You're heartless.

580
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
How could I blame you?

581
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,480
Maybe I missed something when I read the book.

582
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,480
Okay.

583
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,480
In this battle,

584
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,480
I'm sure the store is not good at making up for it.

585
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,480
You can make a plan next time.

586
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Baijiu is always arrogant.

587
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,480
Now that I have such a big loss,

588
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
he won't give up easily.

589
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,480
But he's not my opponent anymore.

590
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
Yes.

591
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,480
He's a little stubborn,

592
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,480
but he still has feelings for you.

593
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,480
I know a lot about you.

594
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
Don't be too curious.

595
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,480
You shouldn't know too much about me.

596
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,480
How should I support you?

597
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
Follow you.

598
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,480
I love you.

599
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,480
I'm so happy.

600
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,480
I'm so happy.

601
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,480
I'm so proud of you.

602
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,480
I'm so happy.

603
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,480
I'm so proud of you.

604
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,480
I'm so proud of you.

605
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,480
I'm so happy.

606
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,480
I'm so proud of you.

607
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,480
I'm so happy.

608
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,480
I'm so proud of you.

609
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,480
I'm so happy.

610
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,480
I'm so proud of you.

611
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,480
I'm so happy.

612
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,480
I'm so proud of you.

613
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,480
I'm so proud of you.

614
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,480
I'm so proud of you.

615
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,480
I'm so happy.

616
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,480
I'm so happy.

617
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
I'm so happy.

618
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,480
I'm so happy.

619
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,480
I want to cry.

620
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,480
I want to laugh at you.

621
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,480
I want to be drunk in your arms.

622
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,480
I'm so happy.

623
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:26,480
I'm so happy.

624
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,480
I'm so happy.
