3
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,770
What's going on?

4
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,759
It's only been one night;

5
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,460
how could Master's primordial spirit
leave his body again?

6
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,660
I'm not sure either.

7
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,760
But this time,
there's a golden body shield.

8
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,710
Master's primordial spirit should be safe.

9
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,400
Should be?

10
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,200
When it comes to Master's safety,

11
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,840
how can you speak with such uncertainty?

12
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,910
I'm a healer,

13
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,090
not a soul summoner.

14
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,400
It must be that witch Siling

15
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,000
who used some trick

16
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,190
to steal Master's primordial spirit!

17
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,250
We shouldn't have let her stay alive.

18
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,490
It might not be her.

19
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,880
Then who else,

20
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,560
in all 12 provinces of Han,

21
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,300
would want to harm Master?

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,079
The Heavenly Lord's primordial spirit
has left his body once more.

23
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,750
Something's definitely happened.

24
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,030
Right now, the most urgent thing

25
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,890
is to find out
where his primordial spirit has gone.

26
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,820
I'm going to wipe out
Jingyun Sect right now.

27
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,120
Let's see if Siling still dares
to lay a hand on Master!

28
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,520
The Heavenly Lord said
we must not harm her.

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,610
That's only because
Master's been bewitched by her.

30
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,470
Protecting Master

31
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,280
is our duty as disciples.

32
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,000
It's my responsibility
to remove any threat to him.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,870
Let's not even say for sure
whether it was Divine Lord Siling's doing.

34
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,470
With your cultivation level,
how could you possibly defeat her?

35
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,360
You're right. I can't beat her.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,240
But who said I'm going alone this time?

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,400
Come back—

38
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,520
Take good care of the Heavenly Lord.

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,579
I'll go check on him
before he stirs up any more trouble.

You hold no divine rank
in the Nine Heavens.

That's a long story,

88
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,920
and I doubt you wish to hear it now.

89
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,750
So you're here to stop me.

90
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,610
It was your spell that alerted me.

91
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,240
Manipulating time is a perilous act.

92
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,770
Even the Primordial God
would not try it lightly.

93

You are a remnant of his vital energy.

94
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,630
So I advise you to value your life more

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,430
and not act on impulse.

96
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,780
There is something

97
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,680
that matters more than life itself.

98
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,990
Like what?

99
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,480
The truth.

What's that mouth of yours for, huh?

101
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,830
If you want to know something, just ask.

102
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,390
The truth I seek,
whether it's true or false,

103
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,270
is like a sword without a hilt.

104
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,290
It hurts others as well as myself.

105
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,320
That's why I must see it with my own eyes.

106
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,270
I see.

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,870
You're afraid the truth you believe
might turn out to be real,

108
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,789
but you're just as scared
that what you uncover might be a lie.

109
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,750
You can't bear to make the person
who knows the truth

110
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,810
reopen old wounds,

111
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,200
so you'd rather turn back time
and dig into the past yourself.

112
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,730
I don't have time to talk to you.

113
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,880
You'd better leave on your own.

114
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,700
Look at you,
turning hostile after just a few words.

115
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,630
Offering your primordial spirit
to the formation is too steep a price.

116
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,560
I told you, I'm the Goddess of Time.

117
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,360
I can show you the past you want to know.

118
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,600
But the truth isn't always kind.

119
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,320
It might delight you

120
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,170
or cause you unbearable pain.

121
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,120
Bai Jiusi, to see or not to see,

122
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,150
you need to think it through.

123
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,460
I want to see it.

124
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,520
Then don't regret it.

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,870
Let's go.

126

Master was harmed
by villains and remains unconscious.

From this day on,

128

all within Canglei Palace
shall follow my command.

and set up a barrier.

No one shall come or go
without authorization.

133

Meanwhile, rally all our forces
outside Canglei Palace.

134
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,510
Be on high alert

135
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,430
and ready to descend
to the mortal realm at a moment's notice.

136
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,670
Yes.

137
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,270
Fan Jiaojiao,
go inform the Four Venerables:

138
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,000
Canglei Palace is preparing to send troops

139

against Divine Lord Siling.

140
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,680
Siling once stole
their celestial artifacts.

141
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,610
See if they're willing
to join forces with Canglei Palace now.

142
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,440
Yes.

143
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,800
At the battle of Tianmu Peak,

144
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,380
Siling conspired with the Jingyun Sect,

145
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,150
wounding my Master's immortal body

146
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,050
and disgracing
the divine prestige of our kind.

147
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,630
With wicked intent, Siling schemes,

148
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,960
and the Jingyun Sect enables her tyranny.

149
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,180
It is only right
that we seek justice for our Master—

150
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,320
lay waste to the Jingyun Sect,
slay Siling,

151
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,550
and reclaim
Master's lost primordial spirit.

152
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,010
Long Yuan, the situation
hasn't been fully investigated yet.

153

Are you planning to go against
the Heavenly Lord's previous command?

154
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,270
Everything I do is for Master's safety.

155
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,510
If blame must be assigned,
I'll bear it all.

156

You...

157

We're willing to share the responsibility
with Senior Long Yuan.

sealing off Danxia Land.

165
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,960
But our scouts saw

166
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,510
four messengers depart from Danxia Land,

167
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,670
heading in all four directions—

168
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,870
east, south, west, and north.

169
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,000
Messengers?

170
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,810
Are they turning to the Four Venerables
for help?

171
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,460
This doesn't sound like Bai Jiusi at all.

172
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,150
Has a life of ease

173
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,120
dulled his courage?

174
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,910
Master, Canglei Palace
is calling for reinforcements.

175
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,030
Should we make some preparations?

176
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,080
No need.

177
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,870
We only have to wait;
he'll come to us himself.

178
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,030
Yes.

179
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,100
What did the Four Venerables say?

180
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,440
They've all given their replies.

181
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,170
Each one has agreed
to stand with Canglei Palace.

182
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,910
Once we give the command,
the might of all five lands

183
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,730
will unite to strike the Jingyun Sect.

184
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,000
Before the battle begins,
we should send them a fair warning.

185
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,800
Let them witness
the divine power of Canglei Palace.

186
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,790
Skyshade Mirror, go.

187
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,870
Why don't we go take a look?

188
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,960
If what Bian wrote in his letter is true,

189
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,870
then Jingyun Sect is no longer
a place to stay.

190
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,840
We can't do that.

191
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,980
Do you even know what he wrote?

192
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,640
The gatekeeping junior
became the Grandmaster,

193
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,870
an elder soared up to the Nine Heavens,

194
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,270
and now
there's talk of fights and killing.

195
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,750
How could he make up such ridiculous lies?

196
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,150
It's absolutely absurd.

197
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,630
I think he either
got himself into trouble,

198
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,480
or just doesn't want to cultivate anymore,

199
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,640
so he's making up excuses
to run home and live in comfort.

200
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,720
Ever since he was little,

201
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,960
he's never given us a moment's peace—

202
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,910
always shirking his studies,

203
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,320
but never missing a chance to slack off.

204
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,640
-I'm so angry!
-Dear.

205
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,550
Don't let it affect your health.

206
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,390
And you!

207
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,080
Overindulgence breeds incompetence.

208
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,940
You're to blame for coddling him.

209
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,270
Once we visit him,
he'll have someone to lean on.

210
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,720
That'll only make him even less willing
to focus on his cultivation.

211
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,630
Listen,

212
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,150
the Jingyun Sect
is a renowned immortal sect.

213
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,510
Their affairs have always been handled
with order and discipline.

214
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,390
The rules are strict and clear.

215
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,960
What could possibly go wrong?

216
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,910
But what if something does go wrong?

217
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,140
There you go again. Unless the sky falls,
there's nothing to worry about.

218
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,600
Master! Madam! Come out quickly!

219
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,200
The sky's about to collapse!

220
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,960
You and that jinxed mouth of yours!

221
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,020
What did I just say?

222
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,510
Everything was fine just a moment ago.

223
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,600
Why did the sky suddenly turn dark?

224
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,640
What's going on?

225
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,120
Yes, it was fine just a moment ago.

226
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,240
What's going on?

227
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,270
Dear, what on earth is happening?

228
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,730
-What happened?
-This...

229
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,870
Why did it suddenly go dark?

230
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,120
Could it be a solar eclipse?

231
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,720
Nonsense!

232
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,510
Have you ever seen a solar eclipse
cover the whole sky like this?

233
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,100
This...

234
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,320
You're right, dear.

235
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,440
Something serious must have happened.

[Jingyun Sect]

[Everlasting Grace and Legacy]

238
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,720
Before the dawn of time,
the world was shrouded in chaos.

239
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,270
The Primordial God forged the world

240
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,730
and with his divine form,
bestowed blessings upon countless beings.

241
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,160
He scattered his own flesh and blood
across the realms,

242
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,560
and only then did the human race
gain a world to call their own.

243
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,440
Humans were once as lowly as insects,

244
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,890
yet by a twist of fate,
they rose to become people.

245
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,390
The divine race guards
the Three Realms, Six Paths,

246
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,319
Four Seas, and Eight Desolations.

247
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,940
Only by their grace
do you continue to exist.

248
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,910
You ought to bear gratitude
in your hearts,

249
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,550
stand humbly upon the earth,
and offer reverence to the heavens above.

250
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,210
To be content with one's lot
is the way of heaven.

251
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,880
To revere the gods and honor the immortals
is a moral duty.

252
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,430
But now,
the Jingyun Sect of Yufan Mountain

253
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,880
has shown disrespect to the divine race
and blasphemed divine grace.

254
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,550
If such defiance goes unpunished,

255
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,960
chaos will descend upon the Three Realms,
and disorder will plague the Six Paths,

256
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,680
bringing calamity to all living beings.

257
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,740
In light of the innocents among them,

258
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,110
those who leave Jingyun Sect
within five days

259
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,550
shall not be held accountable
for past transgressions.

260
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,680
But after five days,
we will wipe out the sect.

261
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,410
Let this serve as a warning
to all in the mortal realm:

262
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,440
Those who defy shall meet the same end.

263
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,750
Long Yuan.

264
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,440
What are you doing?

265
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,270
As an immortal lord,
how can you abuse your powers

266
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,310
to interfere in the mortal realm?

267
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,840
Even the lowly Jingyun Sect

268
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,700
dared to trespass upon the Nine Heavens.

269
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,400
If left unchecked,

270
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,060
the world will truly fall into chaos.

271
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,070
As a deity,

272
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,130
it is my duty to sound the warning.

273
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,550
And I've already shown mercy.

274
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,960
I gave those in the Jingyun Sect

275
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,440
a chance to turn back.

276
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,930
In five days, war shall begin.

Is your crusade against Jingyun Sect

280
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,810
for the greater good or for yourself?

281

For both.

282
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,290
Master's safety concerns the greater good.

283
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,350
My personal grievance stems from
the harm done to Master time and again.

I won't argue with you.

287
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,920
But if you continue to stand in my way,

288
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,000
I came into being,

dwelling between sky and soil,
as timeless as both.

306

Thousands of years ago,

There has long been a deep grudge
between us.

309
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,310
Back then, I used the Heaven-Turning Seal
to suppress his spiritual energy.

310
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,920
But he later broke free from the seal

311
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,750
and rallied many immortals
to attack Canglei Palace,

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,880
forcing me down into the mortal realm.

I kept a low profile for 300 years.

Please take the time
to think about your future.

326
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,000
If there's a chance someday,

327
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,350
I hope we'll share
wine and laughter again.

328
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,550
The Primordial God
poured all his spiritual energy

329
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,750
into shaping the mountains and rivers
and separating heaven from earth.

330
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,830
He sacrificed his own flesh and blood
to forge the sun, moon, and stars,

331
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,690
shedding light across all creation.
That is the greatest act of love.

332
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,830
I've lived as both deity and mortal.

333
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,910
Humanity is not insignificant,

334
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,560
nor do the divine beings
hold dominion over all under heaven.

335
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,240
For centuries, the Jingyun Sect
has stood firm in the mortal realm,

336
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,830
slaying demons and safeguarding life.

337
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,640
Our deeds withstand
judgment from the heavens,

338
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,000
and our conscience
remains clear before the people.

339
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,790
Remember,

340
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,510
wherever life may take you,

341
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,660
never forget
the teachings of the Jingyun Sect.

342
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,200
I heed your orders.

343
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,510
In the face of danger,
I will never abandon you.

344
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,070
I swear to defend Jingyun Sect.

345
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,120
You don't have to do that.

346
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,980
[Temple of the Primordial God]

347
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,720
Never abandon, always defend!

348
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,920
Never abandon, always defend!

349
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,960
Never abandon, always defend!

350
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,070
Never abandon, always defend!

351
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,100
Why am I suddenly feeling sleepy?

352
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,320
I'm feeling a bit drowsy too.

353
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,350
One, two, three.

354
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,590
Are you going to find Li Qingyue?

355
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,790
I have some important business
to take care of.

356
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,650
I don't have time to play with you.

357
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,200
Let go.

358
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,030
Don't hold me. Let me go!

359
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,550
Go play by yourself.

360
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,750
Can't I just bring you some food
when I get back?

361
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,550
I don't want food.
I just want to find Li Qingyue.

362
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,480
Otherwise,
you're not going anywhere either.

363
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,110
I can still tell the difference

364
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,000
between a one-time treat
and an everyday meal.

365
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,250
Alright. I'll take you there.

366
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,070
But you must follow me closely.

367
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,870
And we can't let anyone else find out,
understand?

368
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,560
Let's go. Don't hold me back.

369
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,980
Let go of your hand!

370
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,280
What are you doing?
You bumped into me and it hurts!

371
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:30,960
You!

372
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,170
Are you planning
to descend to the mortal realm?

373
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,400
How could that be?

374
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm just bored and taking a stroll.

375
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,860
It seems I misunderstood.

376
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,070
I thought if you were going down,

377
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,260
I could escort you part of the way.

378
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,430
Wait, Immortal Lord Fan.

379
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,840
Do you really want to help me?

380
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,550
Long Yuan ordered his men

381
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,680
to set up a barrier around Danxia Land.

382
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,050
With your strength alone,

383
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,400
you won't be able to
break through the barrier and leave.

384
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,880
I'm with her.

385
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,000
Go away.

386
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,800
I can help you leave the Nine Heavens.

387
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,250
But you'll have to
do something for me in return.

388
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,310
What is it?

389
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,110
Jingyun Sect is currently
in a time of turmoil.

390
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,030
It's really not the right moment
to take outsiders in.

391
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,270
Besides, Qu Xingman
comes from the Yinlian Sect.

392
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,720
She even had clashes

393
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
with our disciples before.

394
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
It's hard to be sure

395
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,680
she doesn't have some hidden agenda now.

396
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,140
Xingman left the Yinlian Sect
because of me.

397
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,440
Obviously, she won't have any disloyalty.

398
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,900
That's just what she said.

399
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,110
Who knows
if she's in cahoots with her mother,

400
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,400
trying to exploit our crisis

401
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,460
for their own gain?

402
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,650
I know exactly what kind of person

403
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,030
Xingman is.

404
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,550
Senior, you've been bewitched
by that witch.

405
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,310
Junior, we've grown up side by side.

406
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,310
Our bond as fellow disciples
is unbreakable.

407
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,110
I've always seen you as a sister.

408
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,920
So please, don't set your heart

409
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,480
on me anymore.

410
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,200
Xingman is the only one I care about.

411
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,510
It's always been that way
and always will be.

412
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,070
Senior.

413
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,550
Well said.

414
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,510
Stop putting on that righteous act

415
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,920
in front of Mr. Meng.

416
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,640
Didn't you just use your fellow disciple

417
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,030
as a shield before?

418
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,360
Why are you suddenly so concerned about
Jingyun Sect now?

419
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,900
Fear of death is human nature.

420
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,650
I don't need to explain myself.

421
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,920
You're just an outsider causing trouble.

422
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,580
You have no right
to stand here and say anything.

423
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,030
Mr. Meng, am I really an outsider?

424
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,070
Junior, go find Master Dan Yang first.

425
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,360
Xingman doesn't know this place well;
I have to stay by her side.

426
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,410
Actually, what my junior said

427
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,990
isn't completely wrong.

428
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,730
The Jingyun Sect
is now in a time of crisis.

429
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,980
Aren't you afraid?

430
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,830
I am.

431
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,790
But more than that,
I'm afraid of being separated from you.

432
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,190
Then why didn't you ask me
to leave with you?

433
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,920
I knew you wouldn't leave.

434
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,790
The Mr. Meng I admire

435
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,240
is a man of honor.

436
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,810
There's no way you'd abandon them
in the heat of battle.

437
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,120
Why hasn't Father come to pick me up yet?

438
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,350
Could it be
that the letter hasn't arrived?

439
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,840
That shouldn't be the case.

440
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,790
Forget it, I'll just leave on my own.

441
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,270
It's not what you think.

442
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,640
How long has it been
since you all came back?

443
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,070
I was just tidying up the room.

444
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,330
This place is so dusty.

445
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,920
Hey, what are those looks for?

446
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,590
We've been through so much together.

447
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,310
Even though you three tricked me before,

448
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,640
my feelings for you have always been real.

449
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,310
You should leave.
There's no reason to stay.

450
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,750
We purposely didn't come back right away

451
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,590
to give you time to pack your things.

452
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,320
We thought you'd already gone.

453
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,240
Unexpectedly,
you've been dawdling for so long.

454
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,980
You're right to leave.

455
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,110
You're neither smart nor powerful.

456
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,790
The sect won't gain anything
with you here,

457
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,160
nor lose much without you.

458
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,200
No point sticking around
just to be cannon fodder.

459
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,600
Am I really that useless?

460
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,970
Though my power is weak,

461
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,730
I'm still a member of the sect.

462
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,630
I won't leave.

463
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,240
Just go ahead.
You really don't need to stay.

464
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,750
You've always been timid;
everyone will understand.

465
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,680
Valuing life and fearing death
is not a sin.

466
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,210
The seniors and juniors
will all understand.

467
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,750
Do you really see me as such a coward?

468
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,480
Maybe I was once, but not anymore.

469
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,440
I won't leave.

470
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,920
Well, it's good you're staying.

471
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,000
If you'd left,

472
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,550
the three of us would've had to
guard the mountain gate for you.

473
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,070
Remember to get up early tomorrow.

474
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,330
The mountain gate needs you, Jiang Bian.

475
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,380
Let's go.
There are urgent matters outside.

476
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,920
The great battle is approaching;
we can't afford to slack off.

477
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,720
Elder Xuan Wei has called a meeting
for all high-level disciples

478
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,030
to discuss our strategy against the enemy.
We mustn't be late.

479
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,510
Right.

480
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,260
We'll go first.

481
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,650
I was just impulsive for a moment.

482
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:44,860
[Prosperity]

483
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,000
Hanlin Dagger:

484
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,350
forged from the heart-shielding scale
of an ancient true dragon.

00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:06,350

00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,050
capable of harming anything in this world—
even ancient gods.

487
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,110
Blood Chime:

488
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,110
a mystical chime
imbued with enchantment power.

489
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:18,480
When blood from birds, beasts,
humans, gods, ghosts, or monsters

490
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
is dripped onto it,

491
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,480
they become bound to its will.

492
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,320
Great Wilderness Stele:

493
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,070
a powerful stele that captures souls
and traps primordial spirits.

494
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:35,690
Those who enter the stele are as if
stepping into an illusory barrier.

495
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,880
The illusion is created
by the caster's will—

496
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:43,050
with a single thought,
it can transform into countless forms.

497
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,310
It can place someone in a realm of bliss

498
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,160
or imprison them in an abyss of torment.

499
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,830
[Temple of the Primordial God]

500
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,340
Why do you want to spar with me?

501
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,940
Of course I want to see
how deep your cultivation has grown.

502
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,810
You need to give it your all.

503
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,340
If you're too weak,

504
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,550
your presence in the Jingyun Sect
will only hold me back.

505
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,550
Don't blame me if I have to expel you.

506
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,590
You didn't go all out.

507
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,490
How could I bear to
use my full strength against you?

508
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,920
Even so, it's quite impressive.

509
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,820
You're several times stronger than
before your foundation was damaged.

510
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,880
The one who taught you that technique
was truly kind.

511
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,710
That senior

512
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,320
just couldn't bear to
let his lifelong skills

513
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,450
disappear with him.

514
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,630
Do you still want to drive me away now?

515
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,200
Can I even drive you away?

516
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,430
Someone's already gone down the mountain.

517
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,360
There are definitely people
who have gone down the mountain.

518
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,490
The Jingyun Sect has 3,000 disciples.

519
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,150
Not everyone is like you.

520
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,110
So, am I special to you?

521
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,660
Every disciple who joins my Jingyun Sect

522
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,320
is special to me.

523
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,360
Please punish me, Divine Lord.

524
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,630
My skills in artifact crafting
are still lacking.

525
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,090
I haven't been able to
repair this stele yet.

526
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,200
It's alright.

527
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,600
I just wanted you
to take a casual look at it anyway.

528
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,360
You may rise.

529
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,030
Divine Lord,
though I can't restore the stele itself,

530
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,510
while studying it,

531
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,660
I uncovered a complex formation.

532
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,710
I believe

533
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,030
this formation

534
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,960
is the key to
how the Great Wilderness Stele was made.

535
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,190
Each line on it

536
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,150
traces the flow of spiritual energy.

537
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,550
If we can activate it,

538
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,360
we may not only
repair the Great Wilderness Stele

539
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,630
but also restore

540
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,030
the illusionary barrier it once conjured.

541
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,480
Unfortunately,
I've tried countless methods

542
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,880
and poured in
a great deal of spiritual energy,

543
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,010
but I still haven't been able to
activate the formation.

544
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,000
We won't be needing
the Great Wilderness Stele for now.

545
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,400
Just leave it with me for the time being.

546
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,000
There's no rush to repair it.

547
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,030
I have a more important task for you.

548
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,150
What is it?

549
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,060
I need you to keep an eye on Zhang Suan.

550
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,510
Is there something wrong with him?

551
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,670
Not exactly.

552
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,550
It's just that he once entered

553
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,590
an illusion I created
using the Great Wilderness Stele.

554
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,480
But according to the records,

555
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,790
that illusion shouldn't be accessible

556
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,110
to just anyone.

557
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,480
Even now, I still don't know
how he did it.

558
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,030
So just in case, I want you to watch him.

559
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,880
Yes, Divine Lord.

560
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:05,850
Come out.

561
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,410
My dear disciple, you're still awake?

562
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,470
What did you just call me?

563
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,760
Once a master, always a master.

564
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,280
You can't deny it now.

565
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:25,070
[Prosperity]

566
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,010
These past few days,

567
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,280
the seniors have been
keeping me cooped up.

568
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,320
They're afraid
I'd come out and bother you.

569
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,650
It took me a lot of effort
just to sneak out.

570
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,510
I know why they're afraid of you.

571
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,570
After all, you're the Grandmaster
of the Jingyun Sect.

572
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,530
Of course they're afraid
I'll tattle on them.

573
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,110
I'm busy. Go back to your room and drink.

574
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,920
You think I came just to drink with you?

575
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,190
I'm here to talk to you
about something important.

576
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,880
What is it?

577
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,280
What exactly happened

578
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,200
between you and the Heavenly Lord Dacheng?

579
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,310
Are you just hoping for a juicy story
to go with your drink?

580
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,990
Do you really think
I'm that kind of person?

581
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,440
I'm asking because I truly care about you.

582
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,030
I see.

583
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,000
You're too shy

584
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,030
to open up.

585
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,190
Come on, have a drink.

586
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,880
Once you've had a few,

587
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,030
you'll spill everything.

588
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,560
But don't worry,

589
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,550
your secrets are safe with me.

590
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,440
You have no idea how miserable I was.

591
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,150
When I was young, I liked someone.

592
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,440
I went out of my way to please him.

593
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,760
Every time I got something nice,
I'd give it to him.

594
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
And what did he do?

595
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,400
He used my gifts

596
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,800
to win over other women.

597
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,630
Don't you think that's just pathetic?

598
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,150
Look,

599
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,480
I've just told you something
this embarrassing.

600
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,800
What are you holding back?

601
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,320
Now, Canglei Palace and Jingyun Sect

602
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,660
are throwing the whole realm into chaos.

603
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,510
Honestly,

604
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,000
when it comes to romance,

605
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,320
can't you just sit down
and talk things through?

606
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,880
Why resort to violence?

607
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,420
This is none of your business.

608
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,360
Are you dense?

609
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,690
If I don't bring it up,
who else would dare to ask you about it?

610
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,670
When you married into Canglei Palace,

611
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,230
I already thought it was a mistake.

612
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,560
And I still think so now.

613
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,920
You are my mas—

614
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,710
No. That's not right.

615
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,360
I am your master.

616
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,840
Remember,
don't keep everything bottled up inside.

617
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,150
You

618
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,440
are someone who has a master.

619
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,920
Alright, I'll tell you.

620
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,030
In the beginning, all was chaos.

621
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,770
The Primordial God forged the world.

622
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,660
Bai Jiusi and I were born from
the vital energy within his divine gaze.

623
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,880
When we first gained enlightenment,

624
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,540
he was in the far north,
and I was in the far south.

625
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,510
In this vast world,

626
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,890
he is the only one I can truly sense.

627
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,400
Time flies like an arrow.

628
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,020
Thousands of years passed
in the blink of an eye.

629
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,000
I've met many people—

630
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,400
men and women, old and young,

631
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,160
beautiful and ugly.

632
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,150
But none of them was the one I sensed

633
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,440
in the midst of chaos.

00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,660
Then I finally arrived in the frozen land

637
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,110
and met Bai Jiusi.

I liked him.

644
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,710
I wanted to be with him.
