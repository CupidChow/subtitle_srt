1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh, yes.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,780
PLEASE Siege!

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,780
I'm going to the beach.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,780
I'm going to the beach.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,780
I'm going to the beach.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,780
I'm going to the beach.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,780
I'm going to the beach.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,780
I'm going to the beach.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,780
I'm going to the beach.

10
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,780
I'm going to the beach.

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,780
I'm going to the beach.

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,780
I'm going to the beach.

13
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,780
I'm going to the beach.

14
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,780
I'm going to the beach.

15
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,780
I'm going to the beach.

16
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,780
I'm going to the beach.

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,780
I'm going to the beach.

18
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,780
I'm going to the beach.

19
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,780
I'm going to the beach.

20
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,780
I'm going to the beach.

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,780
I'm going to the beach.

22
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,780
I'm going to the beach.

23
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,780
I'm going to the beach.

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,780
I'm going to the beach.

25
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,780
I'm going to the beach.

26
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,780
I'm going to the beach.

27
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,780
I'm going to the beach.

28
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,780
I'm going to the beach.

29
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,780
I'm going to the beach.

30
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,780
I'm going to the beach.

31
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,780
I'm going to the beach.

32
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,780
I pretend to be heartless

33
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,780
I don't want to see your eyes

34
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,780
But tears have been shed

35
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,780
The essence of the time has gone

36
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,780
I want to learn to be independent

37
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,780
To be the spirit of the devil

38
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,780
Forget about the mistakes

39
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,780
I want to learn to be independent

40
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,780
To be the spirit of the devil

41
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,780
Forget about the mistakes

42
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,780
I want to learn to be independent

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,780
To be the spirit of the devil

44
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,780
Forget about the mistakes

45
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,780
I want to learn to be independent

46
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,780
To be the spirit of the devil

47
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,780
Forget about the mistakes

48
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,780
I want to learn to be independent

49
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,780
To be the spirit of the devil

50
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,780
Forget about the mistakes

51
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,780
I want to learn to be independent

52
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,780
To be the spirit of the devil

53
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,780
Forget about the mistakes

54
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,780
Forget about the mistakes

55
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,780
All right

56
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,780
I planned to pee

57
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,780
But I didn't sleep well

58
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,780
How do you feel?

59
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,780
Are you still feeling unwell?

60
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,780
I feel much better

61
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,780
That's good

62
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,780
I've been sealed with magic.

63
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,400
I've been forced to move.

64
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,180
The two spirits are in the body to protect each other.

65
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,340
You don't know the consequences.

66
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,420
Why are you still doing this?

67
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,280
Today, in the box,

68
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,280
I've seen Xie Sui.

69
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,780
Her body is a group of black qi.

70
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,780
She's still a human being.

71
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,780
I can't believe she's a human being.

72
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,780
I'm afraid she's a human being.

73
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,780
I'm afraid she's a human being.

74
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,280
I'm afraid she's a human being.

75
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
She's a human being.

76
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
In the box,

77
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
she's trying to kill me.

78
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,280
I can't believe she's a human being.

79
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Is Xie Sui really a human being?

80
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,280
What exactly is Xie Sui's origin?

81
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm not sure.

82
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,280
I don't know why she's here.

83
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Since that,

84
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,280
you'd better rest well.

85
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,280
I'll go check it out.

86
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Xie Sui is a cruel and ruthless person.

87
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
I know her name.

88
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
You'd better be careful.

89
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Don't worry. I have a chance.

90
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,280
Then you'd better rest well. I'll go now.

91
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Thank you.

92
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Thank you for taking care of me.

93
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,280
I'm living in the same place as I am now.

94
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,280
I'm living in the same place as I am now.

95
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,280
I'm living in the same place as I am now.

96
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,280
I'm not just for you.

97
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
I'm also for myself.

98
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
I'm not just for you.

99
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
I'm also for myself.

100
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
I'm also for myself.

101
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
I'm also for myself.

102
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
I'm also for myself.

103
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
I'm also for myself.

104
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
I'm also for myself.

105
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
I'm also for myself.

106
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,280
I'm also for myself.

107
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
I'm also for myself.

108
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
I'm also for myself.

109
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
I'm also for myself.

110
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
I'm also for myself.

111
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
I'm also for myself.

112
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
I'm also for myself.

113
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Changsun.

114
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,280
Do you think the Immortal Lord will come to this place?

115
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280
There's even no place to fall.

116
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
You!

117
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,280
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Don't be angry.

134
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
Don't be angry.

135
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
It's dark.

136
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
What can you find?

137
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
I didn't force you to come.

138
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,280
If you don't want to, you can leave.

139
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Again?

140
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,280
I don't know when you will find such a strange personality.

141
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Let me do it.

142
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,280
It's strange here. Be careful.

143
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,280
You're worried about me?

144
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Worried about me?

145
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Stop!

146
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
Stop!

147
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Stop!

148
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
Stop!

149
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Come in.

150
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Time to eat.

151
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Stop!

152
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Thank you.

153
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,280
How is your injury?

154
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
Nothing serious.

155
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
You're drunk.

156
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
The force is moving the tree.

157
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,280
But the spirit of the two bones is in the body.

158
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
The smell of the internal organs...

159
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
It's said that the bone is not damaged.

160
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,280
It's said that there's nothing serious.

161
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,280
You know it very well.

162
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,280
You forgot that I was also sealed by the magic.

163
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Of course I have experience.

164
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,280
I forgot.

165
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,280
We are being calculated.

166
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Come out.

167
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,280
What kind of ability is that?

168
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
No.

169
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Are you okay?

170
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Don't let him run away.

171
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Who?

172
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
That evil spirit.

173
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Keep running.

174
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,280
I want to see if you can run fast or my sword.

175
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
I'll run.

176
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,280
I've been in every corner of Songhe County.

177
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,280
But I didn't find the trace of the evil spirit.

178
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,280
So I was wondering if the evil spirit would not be in the county.

179
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
But it's outside the village.

180
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,280
What did you find out outside the village?

181
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Nothing.

182
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Because I can't go out of Songhe County.

183
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Don't run away.

184
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
Say something.

185
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
I'm not a evil spirit.

186
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
You are so kind.

187
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Say it again.

188
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,280
I'm not a evil spirit.

189
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
Stop it.

190
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
I have something to ask her.

191
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Have you ever seen two immortals fall into this place?

192
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
One man and one woman.

193
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
The one in the white dress.

194
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
No.

195
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
If you don't tell me the truth,

196
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,280
I can only throw you into the prison and become a burden.

197
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
I came here.

198
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
But I've been here for seven days.

199
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
Have you ever seen any immortals?

200
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Say it.

201
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
I think you must have found their spirit energy.

202
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,280
You want to hide them and secretly practice, right?

203
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Anyway, I've been practicing the magic for a thousand years.

204
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,280
I'm a person who is a fairy.

205
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,280
There are indeed many things that are stupid.

206
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,280
But that spirit energy is the evil spirit.

207
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
I can't do it.

208
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
You think you are doing a business that hurts you?

209
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,280
What do you mean?

210
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,280
I've heard from people before.

211
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,280
The reason why Song He County is so panic and corrupt is because of the evil spirit.

212
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
I'm not the evil spirit they said.

213
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,280
In the past, Song He County was haunted by someone.

214
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Then Mo Ming was all over the place and they all ran away.

215
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Really?

216
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Of course it's true.

217
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
You don't believe me? You can check my spirit energy.

218
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
You are also a person who is a person of practice.

219
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
Of course I know.

220
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,280
If the spirit energy is covered by blood,

221
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,280
it will be caused by blood.

222
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Liu Wen tried to take Design section,

223
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,280
but it only exists on principle.

224
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
He wants SummerE Iris course.

225
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,120
Mm-hm.

226
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,700
יה

227
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:52,400
neighboring

228
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,060
is

229
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,060
I've entered the Peach Garden

230
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,060
and went to the place I wanted to go the most

231
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,060
and also the place I wanted to see the most

232
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,060
Then did you find it?

233
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,060
Not yet

234
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,060
But I can find it one day

235
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,060
You believe in such a shameless place

236
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,060
Are you afraid that someone might cheat you?

237
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,060
Of course it's true

238
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,060
Someone really came out and told me

239
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,060
There are beautiful and beautiful things inside

240
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,060
There are gold and silver

241
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,060
Peach Garden?

242
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,060
The barrier is not strong

243
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,060
The power of the fog and the magic are all gone

244
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,060
Even if I try my best

245
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,060
I can't break it

246
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,060
I can even turn around and destroy the spirit body

247
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,060
It seems like the Dragon Ball of Shanggu

248
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,060
is the top of the sect

249
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,060
Only the god can control me

250
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,060
Why is there such a power in the barrier?

251
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,060
The god can't do it

252
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,060
We are all gods

253
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,060
We are also trapped in the world

254
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,060
You have a way to break it

255
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,060
Yes, but it's useless

256
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,060
To break this barrier is only the second way

257
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,060
First, find the power of the eye

258
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,060
Second, kill the unarmed

259
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,060
In this situation

260
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,060
The fastest way to kill Xie Sui

261
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,060
But now we are sealed by the magic

262
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,060
I'm afraid we are not the opponents of Xie Sui

263
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,060
Then we have to let go of one side

264
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,060
Xie Sui has been killing the people

265
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,060
The power of the dead and the power of the fear

266
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,060
will increase

267
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,060
If we drag it down again

268
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,060
I'm afraid it will cause more trouble

269
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,060
But the enemy is so weak

270
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,060
It's too small

271
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,060
The soldiers are sealed

272
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,060
They are not always strong

273
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,060
They are just a few

274
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,060
The ancient magic is divided into three

275
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,060
The three magic is the forest of the river

276
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,060
The mountain is the sun, the water is the sound

277
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,060
The city is the law

278
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,060
The second magic is the light of the star

279
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,060
The sky is the sun, the earth is the sound

280
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,060
The city is the law

281
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,060
The first magic is the forest of life

282
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,060
The human is the forest of everything

283
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,060
The sun is the sound, the mountain is the spring

284
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,060
The city is the law

285
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,060
The world is the law

286
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,060
The world is the law

287
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,060
You are so kind

288
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,060
You didn't just prepare money

289
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,060
before the magic

290
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,060
You also prepared so many spiritual stones

291
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,060
Bai Jiu Si

292
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,060
You are so afraid of death

293
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,060
I always do everything

294
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,060
You always say I don't know how to be a mortal

295
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,060
But look

296
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,060
I am the most mortal

297
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,060
That's just what you think

298
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,060
You will know in ten years

299
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,060
how ridiculous it is

300
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,060
You put away the monkey gold

301
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,060
Where are you going to find it?

302
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,060
I am not going anywhere

303
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,060
I am just here

304
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,060
Here?

305
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,060
Yes

306
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,060
Song He County is so empty

307
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,060
You can hear it in ten miles

308
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,060
How can you hide it?

309
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,060
I can't see it

310
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,060
It doesn't mean it doesn't exist

311
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,060
Maybe there is really a peach garden

312
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,060
It can trap people in another city

313
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,060
You are also a cultivation person

314
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,060
You really believe that there is such a place

315
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,060
where there is so much of a circle

316
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,060
In the past, I read a magic

317
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,060
It's similar to the effect of the peach garden

318
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,060
It's similar

319
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,060
It's similar to death

320
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,060
What magic?

321
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,060
Tell me

322
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,060
It's a magical weapon

323
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,060
It's called the Yellow Cup

324
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,060
It used to be a new practice

325
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,060
Someone broke the soul of this cup

326
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,060
and took the power of the God of the Garden

327
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,060
It's like a mirror in this cup

328
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,060
The difference is

329
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,060
The mirror is created by the person who has the magic

330
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,060
The mind moves and it can be transformed

331
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,060
It can be transformed into a place of joy

332
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,060
It can be transformed into a place of endless resentment

333
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,060
You are saying that

334
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,060
The Yellow Cup is not like a spirit

335
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,060
It's more like a evil thing

336
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,060
The sword has the power of hurting people

337
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,060
It has the ability to protect the body

338
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
A magical weapon is good and evil

339
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,060
It's suitable for people who are using it

340
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,060
It's suitable for people who are using it

341
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,060
Then what kind of magic weapon is suitable for people who are using it

342
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,060
I have lived for hundreds of years and never heard of it

343
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,060
You must have made it

344
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,060
The famous book of the Immortal

345
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,060
In the past, I was in the sect

346
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,060
I have followed the sect for several years

347
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,060
So I was trapped in the library for a long time

348
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,060
I read a book in the wall

349
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,060
That's when I learned about these things

350
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,060
The library of the Immortal

351
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,060
That's possible

352
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,060
If it's really like this

353
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,060
It's not that you can deal with it

354
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,060
You should go back to the sect early

355
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,060
Are you here to find someone for me

356
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,060
I can't believe you are so worried about these sad things

357
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,060
I really can't see how worried you are

358
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,060
Of course, the time I met the Immortal is longer than you

359
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,060
Of course, it's not like you

360
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,060
You only care about the blind

361
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,060
The Immortal

362
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,060
Mrs. Lin

363
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,060
I heard that the Immortal has been in a few days of meeting the evil spirit

364
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,060
Is it true

365
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,060
What evil spirit

366
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,060
There is something that needs to be said

367
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,060
Don't talk nonsense

368
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
I didn't talk nonsense

369
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,060
I really heard about it

370
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,060
The mastermind of the box suddenly talked about it

371
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,060
It's obvious that it's the Immortal

372
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,060
Those masters have been in the room for a long time

373
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,060
It's not very stable

374
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
How is that possible

375
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,060
I saw the pig's skin when I was passing by a few days ago

376
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,060
Someone was using it every day

377
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,060
The old man's hatred

378
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,060
Now suddenly he is bound to be the evil spirit

379
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,060
Mrs. Lin, don't worry

380
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,060
I don't mean anything else

381
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,060
Just want to ask

382
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
Is there any way to escape

383
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,060
No change

384
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,060
I

385
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,060
Uncle Bai

386
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,060
Uncle Bai, please take me as a disciple

387
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Tell me the magic

388
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,060
What did I say

389
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
Get up

390
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,060
The child is not sensible

391
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,060
Mr. Bai is not going to be a monster

392
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,060
Go

393
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Uncle Bai

394
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,060
Uncle Bai

395
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,060
Go

396
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,060
I'm not going to say anything

397
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,060
Uncle Bai

398
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,060
Eat, eat, eat

399
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,060
Uncle Bai

400
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,060
Uncle Bai

401
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,060
Mr. Bai

402
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,060
Mr. Bai

403
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,060
I'm staying here today

404
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,060
Is there anything I want to ask you

405
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,060
Mr. Bai

406
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,060
Are you really a fairy

407
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,060
Mr. Bai

408
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,060
You saved my little Tao yesterday

409
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,060
I'm not as lucky as you are in the future

410
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,060
Then today

411
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,060
I'll thank you here

412
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,060
No need to thank me

413
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,060
Mr. Bai

414
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,060
You have such a deep pain

415
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
That fire disaster six years ago

416
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,060
You are clearly at home

417
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,060
Why are you looking at my husband

418
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,060
Dead and alive

419
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,060
He is your best friend

420
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,060
You actually

421
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,060
You can save Tao

422
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,060
Why can't you save him

423
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,060
I know

424
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,060
To save someone is your thing

425
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,060
I shouldn't ask you

426
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,060
I shouldn't blame you

427
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,060
But

428
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,060
I just think I'm like a husband

429
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,060
I'm so stupid

430
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,060
So stupid

431
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,060
Sorry

432
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,060
Mr. Bai

433
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,060
From now on

434
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,060
Please stay away from my little Tao

435
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,060
You can be my husband

436
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:59,060
I'm not your fault

437
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,060
But as long as I see you

438
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,060
I'll think of you to save his life

439
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,060
We're talking about the world now

440
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,060
I'll thank you

441
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,060
In case he knows about this

442
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,060
I'll feel sad

443
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,060
A-Yue

444
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,060
Do you regret it

445
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,060
You will regret saving Lin Teng

446
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,060
You will regret not saving Lin Fan

447
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,060
A-Yue

448
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Do you regret it

449
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,060
You will regret saving Lin Teng

450
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,060
You will regret not saving Lin Fan

451
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,060
Go

452
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,060
Go

453
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,060
Go

454
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,060
Stop

455
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,060
Get out of my way

456
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,060
What happened

457
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,060
Sir

458
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,060
My brother was caught by the evil

459
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,060
Please save him

460
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,060
Save him

461
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,060
My brother was caught by the evil

462
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,060
Where are you?

463
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,060
My brother

464
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,060
My brother

465
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,060
Get out

466
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,060
My brother

467
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,060
My brother

468
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
My brother

469
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,060
You really don't have any place to find

470
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,060
You come to such a dirty place

471
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,060
Don't come in if you're afraid

472
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,060
I'm afraid

473
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,060
I'm afraid

474
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,060
Afraid

475
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,060
I didn't know how to write

476
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,060
Zhang Sun

477
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,060
Zhang Sun

478
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,060
Zhang Sun

479
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,060
Zhang Sun

480
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,060
Zhang Sun

481
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,060
Zhang Sun

482
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,060
Zhang Sun

483
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,060
Zhang Sun

484
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,060
Zhang Sun

485
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,060
Zhang Sun

486
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,060
Zhang Sun

487
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,060
Zhang Sun

488
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,060
Zhang Sun

489
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,060
Zhang Sun

490
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,060
Zhang Sun

491
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,060
Zhang Sun

492
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,060
Zhang Sun

493
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,060
Zhang Sun

494
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,060
Who is it?

495
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,060
Why are you here?

496
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,060
Why are you here?

497
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,060
Where is Qingyue?

498
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,060
Where is Qingyue?

499
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,060
Where is Qingyue?

500
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,060
Where is Qingyue?

501
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,060
King Yan

502
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,460
You came to your senses instead of dying.

503
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,160
What's wrong?

504
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,400
What's wrong?

505
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,900
N-No surprise.

506
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,720
We're counting on you.

507
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,500
Would you go back now?

508
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,160
No.

509
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,000
NO!

510
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,400
We're counting on you!

511
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
You can't find anyone when you enter the door.

512
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Why are you walking so fast?

513
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

514
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

515
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

516
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

517
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

518
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

519
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

520
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

521
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

522
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

523
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

524
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

525
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

526
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
I'm sorry, I'm not a good person.

527
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,400
I'm sorry...

528
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
My god!

529
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
It was him, he save my brother!

530
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
He's just broken up!

531
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
It's been a long time in� for the last time in the night...

532
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Mr. Bai is probably fine.

533
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,400
If you have any doubts, you should know that Xie Sui has escaped.

534
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,900
escaped? Where did he go?

535
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,900
Didn't Xie Sui just stand in front of me?

536
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,400
Xie Sui, help!

537
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,900
Let's go.

538
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
Where are you going?

539
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
Xie Sui, help!

540
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,900
Let's go.

541
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,900
Let's go.

542
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,900
Let's go.

543
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,900
You have been walking for more than ten times.

544
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,900
What are you looking for?

545
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,900
I saw White Ape.

546
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
He's here.

547
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
He's not here.

548
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
What do you mean?

549
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Maybe I just entered the peach garden that Monkey King mentioned.

550
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
There you are.

551
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,900
You are Gaia Ko observe there.

552
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,900
Didn't you turn spot on?

553
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,900
Hey,

554
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,900
who are you?

555
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Are you still alive?

556
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,900
I'll promise you!

557
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,900
Episode 1

558
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,900
How is Master?

559
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,900
Everything is normal in the capital.

560
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,900
However, he has been unconscious.

561
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,400
Someone must have trapped the Immortal of the Moon.

562
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Moreover, his wounds on the neck can't be recovered with the magic.

563
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,900
He should be hurt by the Immortal of the Moon.

564
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,400
Let's ask Immortal Li Mo to come back to heal him.

565
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
I've already sent him a letter.

566
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,900
Did you just say that the Immortal of the Moon is gone?

567
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,400
Yes. Only if the Immortal returns to its original body,

568
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,900
will his body be recovered gradually.

569
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,900
The woman of the God of the Moon has made a mistake again.

570
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,400
She trapped the Immortal of the Moon.

571
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,900
I'll go to the Jinyun Sect now and bring back that demon girl.

572
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,400
Immortal Li Mo will be back soon.

573
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,900
Do you want to wait for him to come back?

574
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,900
There's no time!

575
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,900
You just need to keep an eye on him.

576
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,900
Hey!

577
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,900
Senior Brother.

578
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,900
Senior Brother.

579
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,900
Senior Brother.

580
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,900
How is Master?

581
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,900
He's fine now.

582
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,900
He's fine.

583
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,900
You two should stay at the Canglei Hall

584
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,900
and take care of Master's body for me.

585
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,900
Where are you going?

586
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,900
Ji Gu.

587
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
The Immortal of the Moon is gone.

588
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Go with me to the Jinyun Sect to heal him.

589
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Let's go.

590
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Master.

591
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
If you have something to do, go ahead.

592
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
I can do it alone.

593
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
No need.

594
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
He's alive now.

595
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
It's none of your business.

596
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,400
Mo Niang.

597
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:25,900
Bai Jiusi.

598
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:40,380
Suppose you wake up why don't you go easy on him?

599
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,380
Yes...

600
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,580
Wake up,

601
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,620
he's still w kicking.

602
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,900
I'm good to go.

603
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,100
The problem is...

604
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,140
Just get up,

605
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,900
I...

606
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,900
That little brat is really capable.

607
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,900
He can even hurt you.

608
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,900
If I wasn't sealed by the law,

609
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,900
I would have killed him.

610
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,900
Even if you were sealed by the law,

611
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,900
it's still a godly system.

612
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,900
The knife is not as sharp as it is.

613
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,900
If it can hurt you,

614
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,900
it would prove his power.

615
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,900
The knife is too sharp.

616
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,900
But the knife is really capable.

617
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,900
He used the magic of the ancient people.

618
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,900
It's so that those who were killed would be killed.

619
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
Since you know the power of the knife,

620
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,900
you should protect yourself first.

621
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,900
The knife will have a heart-to-heart pain.

622
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
If you do it again,

623
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,900
you will be destined to have it.

624
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,900
I saw Zhang Sun in the clothes.

625
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,900
No way.

626
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,900
Why not?

627
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,900
Song He is a evil man.

628
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,900
He can't get in.

629
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,900
You said that he saw Zhang Sun.

630
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,900
Where is he now?

631
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,900
He disappeared in the clothes.

632
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,900
Could it be that he was involved in the collusion?

633
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,900
It's possible.

634
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,900
Don't act alone next time.

635
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,900
Are you hungry?

636
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,900
I'll make you dinner.

637
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,900
You must have had it.

638
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,900
What?

639
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,900
Zhen'er,

640
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,900
the heart-to-heart pain.

641
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,900
Have you ever felt it?

642
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,900
I thought

643
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,900
I would leave you in the world for ten years.

644
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,900
As long as I give you enough money,

645
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,900
people will not be able to help you for ten years.

646
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,900
But I didn't expect

647
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,900
there would be so many surprises in the world.

648
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,900
Did you have ten years

649
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,900
to protect yourself

650
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,900
and use your power?

651
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,900
Did anyone

652
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,900
take care of you at that time?

653
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,900
I'll go to Chuzhou.

654
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,900
Anxin.

655
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,900
Take away for no reason.

656
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,900
Get them away!

657
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,900
No!

658
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,620
스가

659
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:35,800
In our duo, we did hold a phone call

660
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,320
In our group, we existsplus

661
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,280
But we saved all the world

662
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,060
That is the group benefit

663
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:51,980
In starting an drama, every member still has to think

664
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:55,940
Every member can become confessional

665
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,360
The first thing they discuss is

666
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:22,100
The cannon is thrown on his權, lulling and scorch theици

667
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,600
please be dabei

668
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,600
No longer like the past

669
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:37,600
Memories are still in the book

670
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:43,600
Flowers are still in the book

671
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,600
I'm watching you

672
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,600
With a smile

673
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:58,600
The eyes are closed and the wind is blowing

674
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:04,600
Tell me

675
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:11,600
Where are you?

676
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,600
I want to cry

677
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,600
I still want to miss you

678
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:26,600
I want to be drunk in your arms

679
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:33,600
Tell you

680
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:40,600
I love you very much

681
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:59,600
I love you very much
