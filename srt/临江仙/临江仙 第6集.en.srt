3
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,490
All heavenly power concentrates in Yun!

4
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,300
Evil spirits shall be shunned!

5
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:18,960
Stop!

6
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,630
Target the devil!

7
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,280
Kill!

8
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,090
How dare you!

9
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,960
Go check on her.

10
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,470
Her Ladyship's meridians are all broken.

11
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,470
I'm afraid she'll die soon.

12
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,360
Li Mo is a skilled physician.

13
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,530
Ask him to come.

14
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,280
Yes.

15
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,000
What's so urgent that you had to
summon me with the Blood Spell?

16
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,310
Long Yuan nearly halted his meeting

[Li Mo]

18
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,430
to come back with me.

19
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,829
I can't tell you much now.

20
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,070
Soon you'll know.

21
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,600
Let's go.

22
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,829
Watch your tongue when you

23
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,680
treat the patient.

24
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,240
What patient?

25
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,670
Hurry!

26
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,310
You'll know soon.

27
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:25,770
Just go.

28
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,860
She's Divine...

29
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,940
Assess her injury status.

30
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,980
She's only a mortal.

31
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,960
Just do your job. Stop gibbering.

32
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,330
She's beyond cure.

33
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,200
The medicine in Nine Heavens
contains much spiritual energy,

34
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,800
which will definitely crush

35
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,120
a mortal like her.

36
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,580
Now, she is severely injured.

37
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,280
Her foundation is destroyed,
and her energy flow is disrupted.

38
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,580
She is done for.

39
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,380
Her foundation is destroyed...

40
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,070
Exactly.

41
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,600
She must have taken a pill

42
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,060
that could quickly improve
her inner power.

43
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,400
It backfired on her after she was wounded.

44
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,940
Can you wake her up?

45
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,310
Though I can't cure her,

46
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm able to keep her awake

47
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,690
for a brief moment.

48
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,500
Then wake her up.

49
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,700
I need to ask her something.

50
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,750
Chiyang Fruit reconstructs
bones and meridians.

51
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,960
It helps the dead return to life.

52
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,240
In the hands of immortal sects,

53
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,930
it will assist with cultivation.

54
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,159
In the hands of demonic sects,

55
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,970
it will

56
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,640
inevitably trigger a brutal war.

57
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,830
Disciples at the mountain foot reported

58
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,360
that Yinlian Sect had stood ready to act.

59
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,560
Zhang Suan, whether your
qihai will be fixed

60
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,070
depends on this move.

61
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,390
You must be extra cautious on this trip.

62
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,800
-Yes, Sect Leader.

Keep this Elevation Pill.

It's a treasure of Jingyun Sect.

69
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,640
Upon consuming this pill,

70
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,950
your energy will be largely
strengthened in two hours.

71
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,000
There used to be
three such pills in the sect.

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,340
Two were taken away by Qingyue.

73
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,800
This is the last one.

74
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,430
You should keep it

75
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,370
in case of emergency.

76
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,980
Thank you, Master.

77
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,080
You finally woke up.

78
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,720
Heavenly Lord...

79
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,390
A pill from the mortal realm.

80
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,350
You intended to forcibly improve

81
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,590
your inner power with this pill's help,

82
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,730
disregarding the damage
it'd bring to your foundation.

83
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,770
You haven't formed a golden core yet.

84
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,440
Do you want to be forever stuck at

85
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,570
the Foundation Establishment Stage?

86
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Why did you go after the White Snake?

87
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,080
I was seeking revenge.

88
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,480
For what?

89
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,630
Heavenly Lord,

90
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,750
11 years ago,

91
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,320
did the White Snake visit
the mortal realm?

92
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,680
Yes, it did.

93
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,300
Do you remember where it went?

94
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,840
It was Nanyu Village,
at the foot of Yufan Mountain.

95
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,000
With its appearance

96
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,180
came a massive flood,

97
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,930
which caused my mother's death.

98
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,450
What can I do now?

99
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,720
My brother!

Obnoxious white snake!

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,000
I've lost my home!

Come help us!

Mom...

107
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,980
Mom, please wake up!

108
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,180
[Young Li Qingyue]

109
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,130
Don't leave me alone!

110
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,610
Mom!

111
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,800
Say something, Mom!

112
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,360
Wake up, Mom!

113
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,880
Mom!

114
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,360
Here you are.

115
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,750
The flood and

116
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,870
the chaos brought by the White Snake

117
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,150
plunged the entire village
into immense suffering.

118
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,960
Thereafter, I became a drifter.

119
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,640
My master Sage Qingyang
then brought me to Jingyun Sect.

120
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,860
That's how I survived.

121
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,540
Why did you never tell me about it?

122
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,750
Because you never asked.

123
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,910
You don't seem to

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,420
be interested in my past at all.

125
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
I already told you

126
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,840
the White Snake would die after today.

127
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Why did you have to attack it?

128
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,390
It killed my mother.

129
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,790
I had to be the one

130
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,260
to end its life.

131
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,180
The flood was a natural disaster.

132
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,700
It had nothing to do with the White Snake.

133
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,150
A mortal disciple of a tiny sect

134
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,350
and a mere gate guardian though you are,

135
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,930
you sure have a strong desire to kill.

136
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,600
Maybe you don't think much

137
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,600
of Jingyun Sect.

138
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,830
But in the mortal realm,

139
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,050
it is a prestigious cultivation sect.

140
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,400
Humans yearn for immortality,

141
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,150
but the majority don't have access.

142
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,600
I come from a farming family.

143
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,290
I was blessed with the chance
to become a cultivator.

144
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,750
But it took more than luck
to pass so many trials

145
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,840
and to be selected as

146
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,460
an outer-circle disciple.

147
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,950
What else did it take?

148
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
The aspiration to better the world.

149
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,790
The will to become an immortal.

150
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,340
The resolve to eliminate the evil.

151
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,750
Then what feelings

152
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,510
do you have for me?

153
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,580
Heavenly Lord, I'm your wife.

154
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,240
All I have for you

155
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,650
is love.

156
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,630
Does she look like

157
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,060
a certain someone?

158
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,120
Very much so.

159
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,690
But I have faith in my medical skills.

160
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,520
She's only a mortal.

161
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,230
That certain someone

162
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,920
would never try to kill the White Snake.

163
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,020
Is it really dead?

164
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,790
It is.

165
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,550
That sword from Jingyun Sect
is quite good.

166
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,720
It penetrated the snake's

167
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,510
vital spot

168
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,100
and took its life,

169
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,210
leaving no chance of survival.

170
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,330
Is she...

171
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,730
really beyond cure?

172
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,250
I was going to talk about it.

173
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,440
A magical fruit named
Chiyang just appeared

174
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,760
in the mortal realm.

175
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,780
It can reconstruct meridians

176
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,510
and bring the dead back to life.

177
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,270
Only that fruit

178
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,210
can revive her.

179
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,210
Will she really die?

180
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,740
Divine Lord Siling

181
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,060
wouldn't die.

182
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,640
But this girl is a mortal.

183
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,730
So she will die.

184
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,290
It must've sensed your presence,

185
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,070
so it's acting up again.

186
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,900
You've been away for years
for various excuses.

187
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Are you not going to take a look at it?

188
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,440
As you know, I'm avoiding it on purpose.

189
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,750
Why bother to ask?

190
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,720
You haven't progressed
for hundreds of years.

191
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,850
It must be a challenge you have to face.

192
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,750
No pain, no gain.

193
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,880
Why not give it a try?

194
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,930
Master,

195
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,560
I know what I'm doing.

196
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,660
We're up for a big task this time,

197
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,560
aren't we?

198
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,830
Master already told us about...

199
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,830
Let me check that out.

200
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,810
Jiang Bian!

201
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,510
I-It's a disciple from Chunyang Sect.

202
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,910
A stab in the chest.
Rotten bones and flesh.

203
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,130
It must've been done by Yinlian Sect.

204
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,370
Yinlian Sect's people have arrived.

205
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,910
We're one step late.

206
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,590
Watch out, everyone.

207
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,480
These bats must've been
enlightened and demonized

208
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,650
after absorbing

209
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,070
Chiyang Fruit's energy.

210
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,880
Senior, be careful.

211
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,040
Don't be scratched by the bats.

212
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,410
Thank you for your concern.

213
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,110
Disciples of Jingyun Sect,

214
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,410
do you want to die here?

215
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:27,980
You demon!

216
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,270
I'm a demon. Then what are you?

217
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,750
A knucklehead who fails to

218
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,920
defeat a demon

219
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,400
after years of cultivation?

220
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,520
Senior!

221
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,520
Take this.

222
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,480
-Senior!
-Senior!

223
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,540
-Keep up!
-Keep up!

224
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,160
Hurry!

225
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,510
W-Where are you going?

226
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,700
Heavenly Lord, please help Her Ladyship!

227
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,000
She cooked for you even though she hadn't

228
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,880
been healed from falling off the cliff.

229
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,340
Now, she has been maimed
by someone unknown.

230
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,840
I feel so sorry for her.

231
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,880
Do you think she will die?

232
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,070
She must not die!

233
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,340
Despicable!

234
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,440
How offensive.

235
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,790
Where are your manners?

236
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,790
I'm leading the way for you.

237
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,790
Yet instead of feeling grateful,

238
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,160
you hurled an insult at me.

239
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,200
Are all the disciples of Jingyun Sect

240
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,820
as ill-mannered as you are?

241
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,520
You're being unreasonable!

242
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,720
You brought us here only to

243
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,960
make us fight the demonic beasts for you,

244
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,400
so you could get Chiyang Fruit, right?

245
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,540
I know Jingyun Sect wants the fruit.

246
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,440
But I also need it to help Mr. Meng out.

247
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,120
Can't you just let me have it?

248
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,510
Those from demonic sects
are sly and cunning.

249
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,750
I won't believe you.

250
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,110
Activate Yufan Sword Formation

251
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,310
to help Senior Zhang!

252
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,890
Oh, no. This is a trap!

253
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,520
Out of my way!

254
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,810
Stay!

255
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,200
Senior Zhang!

256
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,330
Senior!

257
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,150
-Senior!
-Senior!

258
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,210
-Senior!
-Senior!

259
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,410
Heavenly Lord!

260
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,270
Did you save my life again?

261
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,590
I took the liberty of
killing the White Snake.

262
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,750
Are you still mad at me?

263
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,510
It was doomed anyway.

264
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,940
Might as well be killed by you.

265
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,800
I know I did wrong.

266
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,290
I'm sorry, Heavenly Lord.

267
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,910
Thank you for forgiving me.

268
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,230
Heavenly Lord!

269
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,380
My life is yours from now on.

270
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,330
Heavenly Lord!

271
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,440
Are you alright?

272
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,300
Don't touch me.

273
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,640
This is my room. Get out now.

274
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,090
I...

275
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,310
Out!

276
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,630
Heavenly Lord, if you feel unwell,

277
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,960
please do let me know.

278
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,900
Heavenly Lord, has it reoccurred?

279
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,630
After being hit by the Heavenly Lord,

280
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,780
how was Li Qingyue?

281
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,820
Badly injured, as I heard.

282
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,540
She was hanging on by a thread.

283
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,950
Has the Heavenly Lord done anything?

284
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,850
He descended to
the mortal realm last night

285
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,330
to get her Chiyang Fruit.

286
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,220
Now, she is much better.

287
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,910
What a lucky girl.

288
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,660
Ling'er!

289
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,370
You've heard about what
Master did for his wife, right?

290
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,880
You see, Master cares a lot about her.

291
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,210
You should stop...

292
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,720
Stop fantasizing about him.

293
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,900
Alright. Leave these troubles aside.

294
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,750
After my wedding,

295
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,630
I'll take you out for relaxation.

296
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,070
You're getting married again?

297
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,740
Yeah.

298
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,860
Ling'er, you're a wine expert.

299
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,220
Help me pick out

300
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,430
the suitable wine for my wedding.

301
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,050
Dad, you're in the heavenly realm now.

302
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,180
Can't you shake off your bad habits?

303
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,310
Oh, you... Unruly kid.

304
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,290
Senior Lyu, how much longer will it take?

305
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,250
Just a sec.

306
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Senior, given your injuries,

307
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,840
please stay in bed.

308
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,330
How long was I asleep?

309
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,940
Nearly three days.

310
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,920
Senior Zhang, you're really something.

311
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,200
Heavenly Lord Dacheng's hit only gave you

312
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,470
a three-day coma.

313
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,750
If it were someone else,

314
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,170
they would've died.

315
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,000
Three years ago, Senior Zhang's

316
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,920
qihai was seriously damaged.

317
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,190
Now, the hit

318
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,010
from Heavenly Lord Dacheng

319
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,820
has made the situation worse.

320
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,480
Just now, I used needles to seal

321
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,640
your two acupoints, qihai and laogong.

322
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,300
You need to rest for some days.

323
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,720
If...

324
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,830
Senior Zhang!

325
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,300
You haven't recovered yet.
Where are you going?

326
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,490
What were you going to say?

327
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,340
You wouldn't understand.

328
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,270
Senior, look.

329
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,740
I'm Zhang Suan. May I see the Sect Leader?

330
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,830
Come in.

331
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,150
Master.

332
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,680
Master Dan Yang.

333
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,880
You're injured.

334
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,610
Why did you come here

335
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,850
instead of resting?

336
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,900
Master, you once told me

337
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,240
that Chiyang Fruit could rebuild meridians

338
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,720
and even revive the dead, right?

339
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,320
Right. Chiyang Fruit is a
top-class miraculous medicine.

340
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,830
It can truly resurrect the dead.

341
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,600
What if an immortal takes it?

342
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,920
Immortals are free of

343
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:27,080
all restraints that a mortal would have.

344
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,580
Chiyang Fruit isn't of help

345
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,040
to immortals.

346
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,990
In that case, why did

347
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,280
Heavenly Lord Dacheng
descend to the mortal realm

348
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,820
to fight for it?

349
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,590
Well...

350
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,860
Let me rephrase it.

351
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,390
In the Nine Heavens,

352
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,910
who would need this fruit

353
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,680
to prolong his or her life
after being severely injured?

354
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,110
My Lady, how impressive.

355
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,270
In just a few days,

356
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,530
your spiritual energy has grown so much.

357
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,420
The credit goes to
the lord's Chiyang Fruit.

358
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,440
After eating it,

359
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,480
my qihai seems to be
filled with spiritual energy.

360
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,880
Whenever I channel
my energy to regulate my breath,

361
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,880
I can feel it coursing
through my meridians smoothly.

362
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,330
What an amazing fruit.

363
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,400
If I had found it before,

364
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,040
it would've saved me
much cultivation effort.

365
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,920
The Heavenly Lord let me take
my revenge and saved my life.

366
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,690
I wonder how I could repay him.

367
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,640
That's tricky.

368
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,750
I've been here for a long time,

369
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,080
yet I still don't know
what the lord likes.

370
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,470
He seemed to enjoy

371
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,290
my cooking last time.

372
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,790
Why don't I cook for him again?

373
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,790
That's a great idea!

374
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,190
I happen to be craving it!

375
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,580
So do I! Count me in!

376
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,820
Go make arrangements.

377
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,400
Yes.

378
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,330
My Lady!

379
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,480
Why are you here?

380
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,250
The Heavenly Lord seemed unwell yesterday,

381
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,200
so I brought some food to visit him.

382
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,950
The lord is in seclusion.
It'll last a few days.

383
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,480
When it's over,

384
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,220
please let me know.

385
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,960
Sure.

386
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,310
Primordial Father God,

387
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,240

Why?

418
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,780
Why are you doing this to me?

419
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,320
Because you deserve to die.

420
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,480
Bai Jiusi...

421
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,280
Ruyue!

422
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,630
Stop!

423
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,710
Will the Heavenly Lord
get hungry in seclusion?

424
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,760
Will he miss my cooking?

425
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,110
Don't you remember, My Lady?

426
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,710
Immortals don't get hungry.

427
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,960
Then why do you eat every day?

428
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,990
Because I'm a foodie.

429
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,280
This is not the first time
for the lord to seclude himself.

430
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,410
Lord Cang Tu will take good care of him.

431
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,020
Does the lord often do this?

432
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,400
About once every ten years.

433
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,430
For what?

434
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,670
I don't know.

435
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,050
Perhaps for attending

436
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,520
to his old injuries?

437
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,180
Lady Qingyue.

438
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,810
Today is my father's wedding day.

439
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,570
I heard you hadn't received an invitation,

440
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,400
so I came to give one to you.

441
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,780
We look forward to your presence.

442
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,730
I'm not a close friend of Lord Fan's.

443
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,190
This is his big day.

444
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,120
I don't think I should show up.

445
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,340
You must be joking.

446
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,760
My father is the Heavenly Lord's disciple,

447
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,590
and you are the Heavenly Lord's wife.

448
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,920
A deep bond

449
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,230
between you two does exist.

450
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,230
These ties are not
to be ignored, are they?

451
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,280
I still don't think I should go.

452
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,670
Given the previous misunderstanding,

453
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,530
the guests will probably
feel uneasy if I'm around.

454
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,490
I see. Have it your way then.

455
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,460
There's another purpose of my visit.

456
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,690
What is it?

457
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,960
I'm keeping some of
the Heavenly Lord's belongings.

458
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,790
But now, you're managing Canglei Palace.

459
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,240
This responsibility should be yours.

460
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
What belongings?

461
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,120
His Lordship's personal items.

462
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,610
Okay. I'll take a look then.

463
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,290
We're talking about valuable items here.

464
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,650
Lady Qingyue, it's better if you go alone.

465
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,170
Stay put and wait for me.

466
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,140
Why would you choose such a remote place?

467
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,770
No one dares to approach

468
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,710
the lord's treasured items.

469
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,590
Besides, I'm so busy
practicing sword skills

470
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,190
that I haven't cleaned
this place for a while.

471
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,850
That's why it looks desolate.

472
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,490
We haven't met anyone

473
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,030
on our way here. How come?

474
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,850
Everyone in Canglei Palace

475
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,090
must've gone to my father's wedding.

476
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,170
Then why don't you join them?

477
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,710
Daughters aren't usually happy about

478
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,170
their fathers getting remarried, are they?

479
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,070
The old items here

480
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,200
mean a lot to the Heavenly Lord.

481
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,000
I've been keeping them for some time.

482
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,400
Now, I can finally give them

483
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,060
back to their original owner.

484
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,510
Original owner?
