1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Evenly, Thegers

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,600
Whichцы X

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,600
Another millionaire

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:25,560
So I was blinded by the weather

5
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,560
I'm not sad

6
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,060
I'm just a little bit sad

7
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,560
I'm just a little bit sad

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,560
I don't want to listen to your heart

9
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,060
I don't want to see your eyes

10
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,560
But tears are the essence of my life

11
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,060
I want to learn to be independent

12
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,560
I want to learn to be independent

13
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,060
Forget about the mistakes

14
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:37,060
And just smile and look at the flowers

15
00:01:51,060 --> 00:02:02,060
Why is it that the god of the forest is leaving again?

16
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,060
I'm not sure

17
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,060
But this time there's a light in the body

18
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,060
The god of the forest should be fine

19
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,060
Should be?

20
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,060
How can you be so uncertain about the safety of the god?

21
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,060
I'm just a doctor

22
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,060
Not a soul doctor

23
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,060
That must be the demon girl of the forest

24
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,060
What kind of trick did she use to deprive the god of the forest?

25
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,060
I knew she couldn't keep it

26
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,060
I don't need to know

27
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,060
Not her

28
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,060
Then who else in the 12th week of the Han Dynasty wants to hurt the god?

29
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,060
No matter how much the god of the forest is left

30
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,060
There must be some changes

31
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,060
We need to find the place where the god of the forest is

32
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,060
I'm going to destroy the whole Jinyun clan now

33
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,060
See if the god of the forest can still hurt the god

34
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,060
The god of the forest said we can't hurt him

35
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,060
That's the demon girl's stock

36
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,060
The safety of the god of the forest is the most important thing for us

37
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,060
I should get rid of the danger for him

38
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,060
So, is it the god of the forest?

39
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,060
How can we defeat him with your power?

40
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,060
Yes, I can't defeat him

41
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,060
But this time, who said I was alone?

42
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,060
Hey, you

43
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,060
Look at me, Xuan

44
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,060
Don't make trouble again

45
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,060
What are you doing?

46
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,060
Where are you?

47
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,060
I just saw the god of the forest

48
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,060
I'll go take care of it

49
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,060
Okay

50
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,060
I'll go

51
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,060
I'll go

52
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,060
I'm going to go

53
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,060
I'm going to go

54
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,060
I'm going to go

55
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,060
I'm going to go

56
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,060
I'm going to go

57
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,060
I'm going to go

58
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,060
I'm going to go

59
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,060
I'm a fool

60
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,060
I'm a fool who keeps on singing

61
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,060
I'm a fool who keeps on looking back

62
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,060
I've said this is a shadow

63
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,060
I've said this is a shadow

64
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,060
But I haven't found out

65
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,060
This is a mistake

66
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,060
I've made a mistake

67
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,060
I've made a mistake

68
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,060
I've made a mistake

69
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,060
I can't even compare to the amount of money I've received

70
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,060
I'm so happy

71
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,060
It's you!

72
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,060
It's you who killed him

73
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,060
I'm so happy

74
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,060
I'm so happy

75
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,060
I've made a mistake

76
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,060
I've said this is a shadow

77
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,060
But I haven't found out

78
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,060
This is a mistake

79
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,060
I've made a mistake

80
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,060
I've made a mistake

81
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,060
Are you out of your mind?

82
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,060
I've made a mistake

83
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,060
Even if you're in the formation

84
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,060
You can't speed up time

85
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,060
Who are you?

86
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,060
I'm a ancient god, Xie E

87
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,060
I'm a ancient god, Xie E

88
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,060
I'm not sure if you want to hear this

89
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,060
So you're here to stop me?

90
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,060
You've made me so shocked

91
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,060
You tried to control time

92
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,060
It's a dangerous thing

93
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,060
You dare not try your best

94
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,060
You're one of the most precious things in the world

95
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,060
So I suggest you to take it easy

96
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,060
Don't act rashly

97
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,060
Of course, it's more important than the face

98
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,060
What?

99
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,060
The truth

100
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,060
What's the use of this?

101
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,060
Won't you ask me anything?

102
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,060
The truth I asked for

103
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,060
No matter if it's true or false

104
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,060
It's a sword without a sword

105
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,060
It hurts people and it hurts people

106
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,060
So I have to go and see it myself

107
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,060
I see

108
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,060
You're afraid of the truth you know

109
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,060
And you're afraid of the truth you've got

110
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,060
You don't want to let the person who knows the truth get hurt

111
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,060
So you want to speed up time

112
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,060
and investigate the past?

113
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,060
I don't want to be a fool

114
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,060
I don't want to be a fool

115
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,060
I don't want to be a fool

116
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,060
I don't want to be a fool

117
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,060
I have no time to talk to you

118
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,060
You'd better leave

119
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,060
Look at your temper

120
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,060
You're so annoying

121
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,060
The magic needle of the God of the Plains is too big

122
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,060
I said I was a time-honored god

123
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,060
I can give you the past you want to know

124
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,060
But the truth is not good

125
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,060
Maybe you'll be hurt

126
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,060
if you're sweet like honey

127
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,060
Bai Jiu Si

128
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,060
You have to think about it

129
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,060
I want to see it

130
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,060
Don't regret it

131
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,060
Let's go

132
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,060
Master is being framed

133
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,060
and the Jin people are still not awake

134
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,060
From now on

135
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,060
I'll follow the order from the Hall of Cloth

136
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,060
Yes, sir

137
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,060
Yong Shao

138
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,060
You go to the Danxia Mirror and take the sword

139
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,060
No one can enter

140
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,060
At the same time, take all the weapons and bring them out of the Canglei Hall

141
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,060
and bring them to the Canglei Hall at any time

142
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,060
Yes, sir

143
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,060
Fan Jiao Jiao

144
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,060
You go to inform the Four Realms

145
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,060
Tell them

146
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Canglei Hall is ready to go out

147
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,060
and kill the Immortal Lord of the Four Realms

148
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,060
The Four Realms have been rid of their先-miss

149
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,060
Now they can come to help me

150
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,060
Yes, sir

151
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,060
The Heavenly Mother's War

152
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,060
The Four Realms and the Jin people are all in the same boat

153
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,060
They hurt my Immortal Lord

154
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,060
and I'm the Immortal Lord of the Four Realms

155
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,060
The Four Realms are so bold

156
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,060
and the Jin people are so stubborn

157
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,060
We Li Dang will take back a justice for you

158
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,060
We will take back the Immortal Lord of the Four Realms

159
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
and kill the Four Realms

160
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,060
Long Yue

161
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,060
Now the world is not clear

162
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,060
Do you want to violate the precepts of the Immortal Lord?

163
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,060
I do

164
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,060
I will do it for your safety

165
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,060
If he is guilty

166
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,060
I will take responsibility

167
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,060
You

168
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,060
We will live up to your brother

169
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,060
We will live up to your brother

170
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,060
It's been two days

171
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,060
How is Canglei Hall?

172
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,060
What's the move?

173
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,060
Immortal Lord of the Four Realms

174
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,060
has set up a barrier in Canglei Hall

175
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,060
and blocked the Danxia Mirror

176
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,060
But we are responsible for the disciples' opinions

177
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,060
The four superstars

178
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,060
went out from the Danxia Mirror

179
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,060
to the east, south, and west

180
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,060
Four directions

181
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,060
The reality is...

182
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,060
Are you asking for forgiveness from the Four Realms?

183
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,060
You are not like the one in the White Cure

184
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,060
You have been a good teacher for years

185
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,060
and you even have the guts to raise the child

186
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,060
Master

187
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,060
Canglei Hall has invited the outsiders

188
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,060
Are we ready?

189
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,060
No need

190
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,060
We just need to wait

191
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,060
He will come to us

192
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,060
Yes

193
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,060
What did the Four Realms say?

194
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,060
They have sent a message

195
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,060
to block the Danxia Mirror

196
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,060
They have sent a signal

197
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,060
to attack the Jin Dynasty

198
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,060
with the power of the Five Realms

199
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,060
The two armies have been fighting

200
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,060
We must know their fate first

201
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,060
to show them the power of Canglei Hall

202
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,060
The Four Realms

203
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,060
The Danxia Mirror

204
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,060
Go

205
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,060
Let's go see

206
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,060
If we really do as they say

207
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,060
Jin Yun Sect is not a place for drinking

208
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,060
No way

209
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,060
What did the three of them write?

210
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,060
The junior sister of the three of them

211
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,060
has become the master

212
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,060
The sect leader has been in the Nine Heavens

213
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,060
and has been shouting for a long time

214
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,060
He can even become such a painter

215
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,060
It's just unreasonable

216
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,060
I think this boy

217
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,060
must have caused some trouble

218
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
Or he just doesn't want to rest

219
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,060
and wants to go back home to take a rest

220
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,060
He has been so filial

221
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,060
He doesn't let people be concerned

222
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
He never gives up on his studies

223
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,060
He always says something

224
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,060
and never lets it go

225
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,060
Master, don't get angry

226
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,060
I'm sorry

227
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
I'm sorry

228
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,060
I'm sorry

229
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,060
I'm sorry

230
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,060
You are so filial

231
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,060
You are the one who is used to this

232
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,060
Once you see this boy

233
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,060
you will be fine

234
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,060
Let me tell you

235
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,060
Jin Yun Sect is a great sect

236
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,060
and has a good reputation

237
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,060
It's a good thing to have a good reputation

238
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,060
What can I do for you?

239
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,060
What if something happens?

240
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,060
What's the matter?

241
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,060
You are so filial

242
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,060
Unless you fall down

243
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,060
Master

244
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,060
Please come out and have a look

245
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,060
It's getting late

246
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,060
You are so filial

247
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,060
What did I just say?

248
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,060
It's so warm

249
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,060
What's wrong with you?

250
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Master

251
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,060
Master

252
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,060
Master, what's wrong with you?

253
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,060
What's wrong?

254
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,060
Why is it dark?

255
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,060
Is it the day of the sky?

256
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,060
Did you see the day of the sky?

257
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,060
Feng Zhui, you are right

258
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,060
Something really happened

259
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,060
Feng Zhui

260
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,060
Feng Zhui

261
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,060
Feng Zhui

262
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,060
Feng Zhui

263
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,060
Feng Zhui

264
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,060
Feng Zhui

265
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,060
Feng Zhui

266
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,060
Feng Zhui

267
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,060
Feng Zhui

268
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,060
Master

269
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,060
What's the matter?

270
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,300
embroider it even for a whole dozen hours from now...

271
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,440
Send some girls at the office,

272
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,560
we'll give them a look

273
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,640
at what they have Then all the others come out

274
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,380
these are all suspicious

275
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,380
The Great God of Heaven and Earth

276
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,380
Episode 4

277
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
I, Minghao40,

278
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,380
came to the Heaven and Earth to be the Great God.

279
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,380
Since I was born and raised by the Great God,

280
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,380
I have been born and raised by Heaven and Earth.

281
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,380
I have been with the Great God for thousands of years.

282
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,380
I have been with the Great God of Heaven and Earth for a long time.

283
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,380
I have been with him for a long time.

284
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,380
At that time, I used the Great God of Heaven to seal his spirit.

285
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,380
Then he opened the seal and led the gods to enter the Canglei Hall.

286
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,380
He drove me to the mortal realm.

287
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,380
I have been serving for 300 years.

288
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,380
The first thing I did was to fight against him.

289
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:53,380
Everyone knows that this incident has helped me to fight against him.

290
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,380
And there are people who don't know the truth.

291
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,380
Until now, you have helped me a lot.

292
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,380
I can't let anyone get away with my personal will.

293
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,380
You all should have your own way.

294
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,380
If you want to leave, I will not stop you.

295
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,380
I will give you three days to think about where to go and where to go.

296
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,380
Please think about it.

297
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,380
If you have a chance, please let us know.

298
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,380
The Great God of Heaven and Earth is so beautiful.

299
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,380
He is so beautiful.

300
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,380
His blood is so hot.

301
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,380
The sun and moon are so bright.

302
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,380
It's so beautiful.

303
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,380
I have been a god.

304
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,380
I have been a human too.

305
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,380
The human race is not a dragon.

306
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,380
The god race is not the main race of the world.

307
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,380
I have served for hundreds of years in the mortal realm.

308
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,380
I have been a demon.

309
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,380
I have been a guard.

310
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,380
I have been a good person.

311
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,380
I am not a human.

312
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,380
Remember this.

313
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,380
No matter where you are,

314
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,380
you must not forget the door to the Jinyun Sect.

315
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,380
I am very grateful to you.

316
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,380
I will never leave you.

317
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,380
I will follow you.

318
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,380
You don't have to do that.

319
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,380
No matter where you are,

320
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,380
you must not forget the door to the Jinyun Sect.

321
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,380
I will never leave you.

322
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,380
I will follow you.

323
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,380
You don't have to do that.

324
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,380
You don't have to do that.

325
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,380
You don't have to do that.

326
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,380
You don't have to do that.

327
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,380
You don't have to do that.

328
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,380
I will follow you.

329
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,380
I will follow you.

330
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,380
Why am I sleepy?

331
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,380
Why am I sleepy?

332
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,380
I am sleepy too.

333
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,380
Are you going to see Li Qingyuan?

334
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,380
I am going to do something serious. I don't have time to play with you.

335
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,380
Let go of me.

336
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,380
Don't pull me. Let go of me.

337
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,380
You are playing with yourself.

338
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,380
Can't I bring you food?

339
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,380
I don't want to eat.

340
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,380
I just want to see Li Qingyuan.

341
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,380
Or you don't want to leave.

342
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,380
I can still share food with you.

343
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,380
Fine. I will take you there.

344
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,380
But you must follow me.

345
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,380
And don't let others find out.

346
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,380
Let's go.

347
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,380
Let go of me.

348
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,380
Why are you hitting me?

349
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,380
You...

350
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,380
Are you going to the bathroom?

351
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,380
How could I?

352
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,380
I just feel bored and I am going out to play.

353
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,380
I misunderstood.

354
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,380
I thought if you want to go to the bathroom, I will give you a ride.

355
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,380
I will give you a ride.

356
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,380
Wait, Mr. Fan.

357
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,380
Are you really going to help me?

358
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,380
Longyuan told the others to set up a barrier in Dansha.

359
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,380
With your own power, you can't break the barrier and leave.

360
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
And me?

361
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,380
I can help you leave the old house.

362
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,380
But you have to help me do something.

363
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,380
What is it?

364
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,380
The gate is now open.

365
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,380
We can't let anyone in.

366
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,380
The door is full of people.

367
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,380
We have a lot of brothers.

368
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,380
We have a lot of brothers.

369
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,380
We have a lot of brothers.

370
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,380
It's hard to make sure he doesn't have any other intentions.

371
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,380
I escaped from the prison for my sake.

372
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,380
Of course, there is no doubt.

373
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,380
He said that.

374
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,380
Who knows if he is in a good relationship with his mother

375
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,380
and wants to take advantage of the opportunity to fight with the prison.

376
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,380
I know what kind of person Ah Man is.

377
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,380
Brother, you are confused by that witch.

378
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,380
Sister, you grew up with me since you were a kid.

379
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,380
You don't have to say more about the gate.

380
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,380
I have always treated you as a sister.

381
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,380
So, please don't put your heart on me anymore.

382
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,380
I only have Ah Man in my heart.

383
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,380
In the past, now, and in the future.

384
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,380
Brother, you are right.

385
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,380
Don't come to Brother Meng to face the lie.

386
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,380
Didn't you use your sister as your sister to block the way for yourself?

387
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,380
Why are you so concerned about the gate now?

388
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,380
I am human nature.

389
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,380
I don't want to explain too much.

390
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,380
You are an outsider.

391
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,380
You don't have the right to stand here and say anything.

392
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,380
Brother Meng.

393
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,380
Brother Meng, am I an outsider?

394
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,380
Sister, you go to see Uncle Danyang first.

395
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,380
Ah Man is not familiar with this place.

396
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,380
I need to accompany him.

397
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,380
Actually, what my sister said is not the right thing to do.

398
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,380
Now, the Jinyun Sect is in danger. Aren't you afraid?

399
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,380
I am afraid.

400
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,380
I am more afraid to be separated from you.

401
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,380
Then why don't you ask me to go with you?

402
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,380
I know you will not go.

403
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,380
Brother Meng, who I like, is a man who is always on the top.

404
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,380
How could he escape from the spiritual power?

405
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,380
I am sorry.

406
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,380
I am sorry.

407
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,380
Why is father not here to pick me up?

408
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,380
Is it because my family didn't send me to the street?

409
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,380
It's not the right thing to do.

410
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,380
Don't worry about it. I will go by myself.

411
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,380
Hey!

412
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,380
It's not what you think.

413
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,380
How long have you been here?

414
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,380
I'll clean up the room.

415
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,380
This is all dust.

416
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,380
Hey, what are you looking at?

417
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,380
We've been together for so long.

418
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,380
Although you three cheated me,

419
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,380
I'm really in your shoes.

420
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,380
You can leave.

421
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,380
You don't have to stay.

422
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,380
We didn't come back on purpose.

423
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,380
We wanted to keep you in the room.

424
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,380
I thought you left long ago.

425
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,380
I didn't expect you to be so blind.

426
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,380
You're right.

427
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,380
You're stupid and you can't spell.

428
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,380
You're not good at it.

429
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,380
You're not good at it.

430
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,380
You don't have to stay as a judge.

431
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,380
I'm not good at it!

432
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,380
Although I'm a law-abiding person,

433
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,380
I'm also a member of the sect.

434
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,380
I'm not leaving.

435
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,380
Let's go.

436
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,380
You don't have to stay.

437
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,380
You always fear death.

438
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,380
Everyone will understand.

439
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,380
It's not a sin to be afraid of death.

440
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,380
Brothers can understand.

441
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,380
I'm so scared of you.

442
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,380
From the past,

443
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,380
now it's not.

444
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,380
I'm not leaving.

445
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,380
If you don't leave, it's good.

446
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,380
If you leave,

447
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,380
we three have to go to the door for you.

448
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,380
Remember to go early tomorrow.

449
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,380
I need you at the door.

450
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,380
I'll talk to you later.

451
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,380
Let's go.

452
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,380
There's an urgent matter to attend to.

453
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,380
We can't wait for the big battle.

454
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,380
Elder Xuan Wei is in a meeting with a high-ranking disciple.

455
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,380
We can't be late for the discussion.

456
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,380
Right.

457
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,380
Let's go.

458
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,380
I'm just in a rush.

459
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,280
Han Lin registry,

460
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,340
I will marry the whole news Nate will study

461
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,080
that from Xiao

462
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,480
War

463
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,880
The jail

464
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,440
He related to him

465
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,040
All the power

466
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,920
Choss

467
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,680
He gave

468
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,980
Much

469
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,520
He gave

470
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,180
Knox

471
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:19,940
Whoa

472
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,720
Cor ради

473
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,440
Chuck

474
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,660
a thousand strange whirlpools.

475
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,280
You will know theονlorอง

476
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,240

477
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,100
and it will make all the history of在在 valued

478
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,920
our hearts and souls grow interconnected.

479
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,040
Alright, let's go.

480
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,000
Awesome.

481
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
In this world, the person who is created by the law of the world

482
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
can be transformed into a thousand thousand if he moves his mind.

483
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
He can be put in a place of great joy,

484
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
and he can be put in a place of endless circle.

485
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Why do you want to hurt him?

486
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Of course, I want to try how much you have the power to attack.

487
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You need to do your best.

488
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
If you are too bad, you will drag me down in the forest.

489
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Then I will kill you.

490
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I got you.

491
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,380
You are not the one I want to see.

492
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,280
淫女為 Web Slayer

493
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,520
Rebanded

494
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,960
You really are the one she wants to attack.

495
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
Yes.

496
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
I'll do my best.

497
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,960
You're right.

498
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,960
You're better than the one who hurt your arm.

499
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
You're so good at martial arts.

500
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,960
You're just a little bit better than the one who hurt your arm.

501
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Do you still want to go with me?

502
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Can I drive you away?

503
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
Someone went down the mountain.

504
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
There are people who went down the mountain.

505
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
The disciples of Jinyun Sect are 3,000.

506
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Not everyone is like you.

507
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,960
To you, am I special?

508
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Every disciple who comes to Jinyun Sect

509
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,960
is special to me.

510
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,960
The disciples of Jinyun Sect are special to me.

511
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
Please punish me.

512
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,960
I'm not good at practicing martial arts.

513
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
I can't repair my back.

514
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
It's okay.

515
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,960
I just wanted you to see it.

516
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,960
Get up.

517
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
Master.

518
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,960
I can't repair my back.

519
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,960
But when I was studying it,

520
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,960
I found a wonderful magic.

521
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
I guess this magic

522
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,960
is the principle of the Great Huangbei Lianzhi.

523
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,960
Every line on it is the pulse of the spiritual power.

524
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
As long as you can use this magic,

525
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
you can repair the Great Huangbei Lianzhi.

526
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,960
You can also repeat the knot and illusion that Great Huangbei has made.

527
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,960
But I lost countless ways.

528
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
I lost countless spiritual powers.

529
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
I can't use this magic.

530
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,960
You don't need Great Huangbei at all.

531
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
Just let me go first.

532
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
It's not urgent to repair the Lianzhi.

533
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
I have more important things to do for you.

534
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
What is it?

535
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
You can keep an eye on Zhang Sun for me.

536
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
What's wrong with him?

537
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,960
He has no problem.

538
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,960
He just used the illusion that Great Huangbei has made.

539
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
But in the writing of Great Huangbei,

540
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,960
he didn't mention the illusion that Great Huangbei has made

541
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
and he can be easily included.

542
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,960
I don't understand it today.

543
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,960
So, in case you keep an eye on him.

544
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Yes, Master.

545
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,960
Come out.

546
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
Good girl. You're still awake.

547
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,960
What did you call me?

548
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,960
I'm a man of my word.

549
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
You can't ignore me.

550
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,960
These days,

551
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
the senior brothers are all watching me.

552
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,960
They are afraid that I will disturb you.

553
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,960
I finally managed to get out of here.

554
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,960
I also know why they are afraid of you.

555
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,960
After all, my disciple is a master of Jingyun Sect.

556
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,960
They must be afraid of me.

557
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
I'm so busy.

558
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Go back to your room to drink.

559
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
Do you think I'm here to find you a drink?

560
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,960
I really have something to do with you.

561
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,960
What is it?

562
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,960
What do you and Great Cheng Xuanzun

563
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,960
have in the past that you hate each other?

564
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,960
You want to hear the word of the drinker?

565
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,960
Is your master like this?

566
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,960
I really care about you.

567
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
I know.

568
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Some of the little girls

569
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
are shy to say something.

570
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Come on.

571
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Why don't you drink some too?

572
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
This wine is too much.

573
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
They are willing to say anything.

574
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
But don't worry.

575
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,960
Your master is very strict.

576
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Do you know how miserable I am?

577
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
When I was young,

578
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
I liked someone.

579
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,960
I didn't have to worry about him.

580
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,960
I just gave him whatever I got.

581
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,960
But he took my stuff

582
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
and went to look for other women.

583
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,960
Do you think I'm miserable?

584
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,960
I'm sorry.

585
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Look.

586
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
I told you about such a shameful thing.

587
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,960
Why are you so embarrassed to say it?

588
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,960
Now, the Cang Lei Hall and Jinyun Sect

589
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,960
are all making fun of me.

590
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
I think your master

591
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,960
is going to be in trouble.

592
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,960
Why do you have to fight?

593
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
It's not your business.

594
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,960
What are you doing?

595
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,960
I don't care who dares to ask you this.

596
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
When you married Cang Lei,

597
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
I thought it was inappropriate.

598
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Now, it's the same.

599
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
You are my...

600
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
No, no, no.

601
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
No.

602
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
I'm your master.

603
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,960
Remember.

604
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,960
Don't worry about anything.

605
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,960
You are my master.

606
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,960
Okay. Let me tell you.

607
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
The Holy land and Allah's grace

608
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,960
bring La Russa ofetta and a series of twitching motions.

609
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Worked with what I saw in the world,

610
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,960
the Holy Form.

611
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,960
我和白九思是 argentinosaurus,

612
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:49,500
was my

613
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,900
performance at the time in ancient times.

614
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,960
Wan Sang Tian, all that flashed,

615
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,960
I've seen many people,

616
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
men and women,

617
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
old and young,

618
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
beautiful and ugly.

619
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,960
But they are not the ones I felt

620
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
in the chaos.

621
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,960
The End

622
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,960
I finally arrived at the place of the ice

623
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
and saw the white wine.

624
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,960
The End

625
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,960
I saw his first eyes

626
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
and saw the white wine.

627
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
I want to be with him.

628
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,960
The End

629
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,960
The End

630
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,960
The End

631
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,960
The End

632
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,960
The End

633
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,960
The End
