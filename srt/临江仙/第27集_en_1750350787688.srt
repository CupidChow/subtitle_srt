1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,840
Body and soul

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,520
Fenglong

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,440
The flower blooms in your smile

4
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
You've been fooled by me for hundreds of years

5
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
You're quite stupid

6
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,140
Nothing has changed

7
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,000
Xiao Qingshan

8
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,680
There are no wrong sides between us

9
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,520
Why are you using me like this?

10
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,920
Let's say it and blame auching cinnabar

11
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,600
and aying business ë¨¹

12
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Who can be his opponent?

13
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,600
The only one who can kill him is you, the one who is the same root and same source as him, the Immortal of the Four Spiritualities.

14
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,600
After all, he is not as merciful as you.

15
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
He is weak in every aspect.

16
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,600
You are really shameless to use the people of my tribe.

17
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Use?

18
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
It was the right time when he appeared.

19
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I secretly repaired a magic bow for 500 years.

20
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
The magic bow that was originally useless, I gave it to him.

21
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,600
In terms of it, he became my roof, it's not a big deal.

22
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
He still has to thank me.

23
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,600
After all, I made him from a useless thing to a superior repairer.

24
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
The first tree is a magic bow.

25
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
You can be self-sufficient and have another reason.

26
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,600
When the god of the red alliance opened the heaven and earth,

27
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
A breath of air flowed through the world.

28
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
I don't know what opportunity to come back to you.

29
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
But you don't want to be confused by him.

30
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
It's an opportunity to help me become a gentleman.

31
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
It can be seen that my action is the right way.

32
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
You are being unreasonable.

33
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,600
My master's death was also done by you, right?

34
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Him?

35
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Then today, I must see the Great Sage Xuan.

36
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Then I don't have to show you mercy.

37
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Wait.

38
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I... I was joking with you.

39
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
My disciple and I haven't seen each other for a long time.

40
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
He misses me too.

41
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
I... I should take my first step.

42
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
You are...

43
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
He didn't have to die.

44
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Who told you to be so cruel to the White-Jade Temple?

45
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,600
I have to give you some hatred and hatred.

46
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Let us kill each other

47
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
to take the power of the fish and the dragon

48
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
and destroy the Wu Liang Cup.

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Destroy the Wu Liang Cup?

50
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
What's the connection between you and the Wu Liang Cup?

51
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
There are so many reasons.

52
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Do whatever you want.

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
There really is no need to ask why.

54
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
You are inescapable.

55
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
You deserve to die.

56
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
What are you doing?

57
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Look at it yourself.

58
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
This is...

59
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
The curse of life and death.

60
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
The life and death of the people of the next week

61
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
is tied to the people of the next week.

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Great Sage Xuan is really a wise man.

63
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Immortal of the Four Spiritualities,

64
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,600
this person has walked through the sky ladder for you.

65
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
He has suffered from the pain of being broken.

66
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Will you let him die in order to kill me?

67
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
You won't.

68
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
This is your weakness.

69
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
The past Meng Chang Qin and now Zhang Suan

70
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,600
can all become your weakness.

71
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,600
After I leave, this curse will be released automatically.

72
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
As for the Wu Liang Cup,

73
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
let it stay for a few more days.

74
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
It's just a curse of life and death.

75
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Since I know it, it can be solved naturally.

76
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Bai Jiu Si,

77
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,600
only the people of the next week can solve this curse.

78
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,600
No matter how great your power is, you can't solve it.

79
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
The evil will disappear.

80
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
This...

81
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
This is...

82
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
This is...

83
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Now, kill him.

84
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Is the curse of life and death solved?

85
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
It's solved.

86
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
He's lying to you.

87
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,600
The curse of life and death can't be solved at all.

88
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Unless he moves the curse onto himself.

89
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,600
If you kill me, he'll die too.

90
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Didn't you want to kill me?

91
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Good.

92
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Now you have a good reason.

93
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Xiao Jing Shan is living in a bad situation.

94
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
It's just for the sake of the great cause.

95
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,600
A'Yu, do it.

96
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,600
I'll leave the Wu Liang Cup to you.

97
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,600
You'll do better than me.

98
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Siling, do you know why Bai Jiu Si

99
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,600
sealed your power for ten years?

100
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Don't try to play tricks on me.

101
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,600
He was taking your place.

102
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
What do you mean?

103
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
He's delaying time.

104
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Do it now.

105
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,600
It seems that I have to explain this matter.

106
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,600
You and Siling entered the world together.

107
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Do you know what he's doing now?

108
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,600
He wants to kill the gods.

109
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,600
There are four disasters in the world.

110
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
The cycle of cause and effect is endless.

111
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
It's the nature of the world.

112
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
But now he wants to kill Han Long.

113
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Han Long not only committed the sin of killing the gods,

114
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
but also caused the disaster.

115
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,600
It's also a problem of the world.

116
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
You entered the world with him.

117
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
You can't just let him do whatever he wants.

118
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
You can't just ignore him.

119
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
What does the messenger want me to do?

120
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Stop him.

121
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Take him back to the heaven and punish him severely.

122
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
You don't want to?

123
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,600
I don't agree with his method.

124
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,600
But I won't hurt him.

125
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,600
If so, I'll do it myself.

126
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Hua Ruo Yue, you dare to be a god?

127
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
He's a human. He's still a dead man.

128
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
He's a god.

129
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Even if he's guilty,

130
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
the heaven should punish him.

131
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Not you.

132
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Where's the heaven?

133
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Where's the heaven when the world is dead?

134
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Where's the heaven?

135
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Where's the heaven?

136
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Where's the heaven?

137
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Where's the heaven when the world is dead?

138
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,600
If the heaven is as cruel as you said,

139
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
then I'll just let him die.

140
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
If you don't say you're a mortal,

141
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
then you can't resist the heaven even if you're a god.

142
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Master.

143
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Lin Chang Qin, what are you waiting for?

144
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
You're not going to die?

145
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
No one can hurt him.

146
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
The heaven is cruel.

147
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
You can't do it either.

148
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
If you want to leave here,

149
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
you can only step over my body.

150
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
No.

151
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
The Han Lu is dead.

152
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
It's too late for you now.

153
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,600
He'll pay for it.

154
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
You must go back.

155
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
I'm not going to let you die.

156
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
I'll go with you.

157
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm going with you.

158
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
I'll go with you.

159
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I'll go with you.

160
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm going with you.

161
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
I'm going with you.

162
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
He'll pay for it.

163
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
You too.

164
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,600
When I settle everything,

165
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
I'll go to the Heavenly Order.

166
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Good.

167
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Then I'll wait for you at the Heavenly Punishment Platform.

168
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Take care.

169
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,200
Porn3

170
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,240
Saving yourself?

171
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,080
Where is all the ÐÐ¾ÐºÐ° Spirit?

172
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,680
I sealed her spiritual power.

173
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,880
She will stay in the mortal world and guard the Seven-Finger Fortress

174
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,320
to live the ten years of mortal life.

175
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,320
The mortal world is full of hardships.

176
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,000
She died this morning

177
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,480
and she was punished.

178
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,920
I'll take the rest.

179
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,120
The God of Deity's punishment is extraordinary.

180
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,560
Don't mind me.

181
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,840
But I need a person to bear the punishment.

182
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,400
I'll take it on her behalf.

183
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,160
In the first year of the reign of Ten Shinzho,

184
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,880
Great Cheng decided to case the name of the Heavenly Emperor,

185
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,280
tried to kill the dragon,

186
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,880
committed the sin of defying God,

187
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,240
and went to hell.

188
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,640
and destroy the Heavens.

189
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,040
It's the end of the Heavens.

190
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,200
It's 99 days.

191
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,840
Ten years.

192
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,640
The Heavens are the same as the mortal world.

193
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,760
You've been in the mortal world for ten years.

194
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,880
He's been punished for ten years in the immortal world.

195
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,360
He knows nothing about your suffering.

196
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,840
Take action!

197
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,760
I was the one who did evil

198
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,280
but was punished by the Heavens.

199
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,240
So I run the shrine.

200
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,440
I rush to you a little later.

201
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,960
Yes.

202
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,680
Introduce yourself.

203
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,520
I am Mu Yangpeng.

204
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,720
I've gotta go.

205
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,800
She ruined P deputy of Wu.

206
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:40,240
Even broke the ì¬

207
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,360
That's why I set up a plan for hundreds of years

208
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,000
to lure you to kill him.

209
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,720
He's messing with your mind.

210
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,240
Do it now!

211
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,880
Can you scare me?

212
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,160
Yue.

213
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:22,160
He's MVPT R

214
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,000
I'll do it, then.

215
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,820
We'll meet again.

216
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
I'm sorry.

217
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
It's me again.

218
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Hu Lan Tian.

219
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
Don't talk.

220
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Get a grip.

221
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
I'm sorry.

222
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
I'm sorry.

223
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
I'm sorry.

224
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
I'm sorry.

225
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
Hu Lan Tian.

226
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
Do you know

227
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,160
what I said in the heaven today

228
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
was simple

229
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
but true.

230
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
A thousand cups of wine

231
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
is just a dream

232
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
The flowers are still with people

233
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
The flowers are withered

234
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:55,820
but the stars and the white

235
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Bai Jiusi.

236
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Bai Jiusi.

237
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
You can't sleep.

238
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
In the past half a month,

239
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
the Grand Master was already seriously injured.

240
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,160
He never took care of himself.

241
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Besides,

242
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
the Grand Master's

243
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
body-guarding pearl is missing.

244
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
A few days ago,

245
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
he was seriously injured.

246
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
This time,

247
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
the formation is dangerous.

248
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Then why didn't you warn him?

249
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
I've reminded him many times.

250
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,160
But he has his own ideas.

251
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,160
He has no time to rest.

252
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
You mean

253
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
he will die?

254
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
I'm not sure.

255
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
His injury

256
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
is in a state

257
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
that I can't cure.

258
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
His primordial spirit can't be repaired.

259
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
The most important thing is

260
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
the Grand Master

261
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
has no chance to live.

262
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
But

263
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
he has no will to live.

264
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
I'm helpless.

265
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Let's not talk about the past.

266
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
Since the Grand Master and the Xuan Zun are acting together,

267
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Xiao Jing Shan who escaped

268
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
must be in big trouble.

269
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
We'll stay in the Cang Lei Hall

270
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
to take care of Xuan Zun.

271
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
If the Grand Master needs to catch Xiao Jing Shan,

272
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
just tell him.

273
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Why?

274
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
I think this is also his will.

275
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
I think

276
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
he will be able to live.

277
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
I think

278
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
he will be able to live.

279
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
I think

280
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
he will be able to live.

281
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
I think

282
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
he will be able to live.

283
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
I think

284
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
he will be able to live.

285
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
I think

286
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
he will be able to live.

287
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
I think

288
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
he will be able to live.

289
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
I think

290
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
he will be able to live.

291
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Bai Jiu Si.

292
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
Don't think

293
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
that you can escape when you fall asleep.

294
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
You have been

295
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
suffering from heavenly punishment for me.

296
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
The wounds I suffered

297
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
are only temporary.

298
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,880
I feel removing the tills of marriage,

299
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,780
she must not accept me as J nuclear nuclear ë£ê³  buka!

300
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,720
Deepends the Kick!

301
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,100
My hu,

302
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,240
D mgd spreadsheet

303
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,480
has arrived.

304
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,620
Why it comes first?

305
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,040
It's all theome in ourãChang Logãletters.

306
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,360
I'll die if I don't.

307
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,280
I won't apologize to you.

308
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,520
It's good that you can't wake up.

309
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,880
Then we won't meet again.

310
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,280
We can be at peace.

311
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,800
The Stone was stolen by Head Te decks

312
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,840
Are you repeating with me after being in a state of death?

313
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,160
I just wasted your spiritual power.

314
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,080
You've already become an immortal.

315
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,840
You'll still live forever.

316
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,600
You'd better not think too much.

317
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,040
You're so cruel.

318
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,200
Ling'er,

319
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,440
you can do whatever you want in the future.

320
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,640
With your father and me,

321
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,920
you won't be hurt.

322
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,280
The biggest hurt he's been hurt by is from you.

323
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,000
Xian Ze.

324
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,560
It's all my fault.

325
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,360
I shouldn't have sent you back to save you.

326
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,280
It's okay. I'll take you back.

327
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,320
Wait.

328
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,800
Immortal Ling,

329
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,960
even if you and Xuan Zun have reached a harmonious end,

330
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,280
she's my daughter.

331
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,920
How can you just take her away?

332
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,480
Sometimes,

333
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,040
I really want to slap you to death.

334
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,840
Do you think I'm afraid?

335
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,200
Ling'er,

336
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,880
think about it.

337
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,160
Ling'er's suffering is all because of you.

338
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,200
You've been trying to persuade her to stay away from me, her father.

339
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,120
You've not only made her an enemy of Xuan Zun,

340
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,880
but also made her do something very dangerous.

341
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,160
That's why I had to waste her spiritual power.

342
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Now, she's no longer of any use to you.

343
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,560
What else do you want?

344
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,760
You really don't understand.

345
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,760
Ling'er isn't close to you.

346
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,960
She's never been seduced by anyone.

347
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,960
It's because of yourself.

348
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,160
I did make Ling'er do a lot of things,

349
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,360
but I always tell her my intentions and the dangers of everything.

350
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,360
The most important thing is

351
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,560
that I'll give her the right to choose.

352
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,760
I'm not like you,

353
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,160
who's fighting for her good,

354
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,560
doing things that will hurt her.

355
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,560
You ask yourself,

356
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,960
when you've really given her a chance to choose.

357
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Let's go.

358
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Let's go.

359
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,560
Ling'er,

360
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
are you really trying to force Ling'er to die?

361
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,160
When you've learned to respect your own daughter,

362
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,760
come find her again.

363
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,560
Master is back.

364
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
Su Guan.

365
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,160
How was your stay in the Empyrean Heaven?

366
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,560
It was boring.

367
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,560
It was boring indeed.

368
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,160
We should go back.

369
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
I'll go.

370
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,760
My dear,

371
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,960
you've died too unjustly.

372
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,560
This is for the cow head.

373
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,760
I have to give you some horse noodles.

374
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,960
Put some more in.

375
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,760
You...

376
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,760
Master, stop burning it.

377
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Master,

378
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
I heard a Taoist priest say

379
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,520
that the

380
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,520
Taoist priest is a good person.

381
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,560
You...

382
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,160
What are you saying?

383
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,560
My daughter is dead.

384
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
The money

385
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,560
is for the little kids.

386
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,160
If she is bullied by those evil people,

387
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,360
I'll kill you first.

388
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,560
You...

389
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,960
You just let your master burn it.

390
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,760
Your master is pitiful.

391
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
Yes.

392
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,960
Your master may feel better after burning it.

393
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,960
They say that cultivating a good immortal is good.

394
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
But after cultivating,

395
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,160
they say that cultivating a good immortal is good.

396
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,360
Stop talking.

397
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,560
They just died.

398
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Let's go.

399
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,960
Burn more.

400
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
What's that sound?

401
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,360
Master, listen.

402
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,760
What's that?

403
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Master,

404
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,160
Master, you're back.

405
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
I told you to burn the paper.

406
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
You're back.

407
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Did you see me?

408
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,360
The Taoist priest went to the Empyrean Heaven

409
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,760
just to lure Xiao Jing Shan out?

410
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
That's right.

411
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,360
It's a pity that I missed one.

412
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,760
I only guessed that Zhangsun was used by someone.

413
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,160
But I didn't expect that he was killed.

414
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,160
Did you know about your master's plan?

415
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,560
I didn't know.

416
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,960
But I found that Qingyang's death was not right.

417
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,760
And my master sent the lowest-ranking officer Jiang to call for help.

418
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,160
I knew that my master must have another plan.

419
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,960
Zhangsun has been keeping himself in the capital

420
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,160
since he woke up and knew what he had done.

421
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,360
He's in the capital.

422
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Now he's in the capital.

423
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,560
I can't persuade him.

424
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,960
If you have time, please go and see him.

425
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,160
I will.

426
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,560
The most important thing now is where Xiao Jing Shan is.

427
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,160
In order to set up the assassination of Bai Jiusi and me,

428
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,560
he waited for hundreds of years.

429
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,760
It's clear that he's in the city.

430
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,760
Next, you'll split the disciples of the Immortal Sect into several groups

431
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,360
and search for his whereabouts.

432
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,760
This time, he can't hide in the dark.

433
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,560
Even if we search the 12 states of the Han Empire,

434
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,960
we must find him.

435
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,160
Yes, Grand Master.

436
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,360
The death of the Immortal is a life-long disaster.

437
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,960
If we live in the bad place, it will be a disaster for the Heaven and Earth.

438
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,560
I have a feeling that the world is about to face another disaster.

439
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,760
Maybe he's the reason for this.

440
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,560
I'll go and set up the manpower now.

441
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,160
Do you have anything to say to me?

442
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,960
I just want to ask

443
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,160
how you will handle the situation in Xuan Zun, Cheng?

444
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,160
Someone will keep an eye on the Cang Lei Hall.

445
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,160
Xiao Jing Shan shouldn't be harmed.

446
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,960
I'm not asking about this.

447
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,160
I just want to ask

448
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,960
if you still want to kill him?

449
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,160
I don't know.

450
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,560
He took the blame for me,

451
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,560
but everything I suffered was because of him.

452
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,960
I can't tell what's heavy and what's light.

453
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,160
What should I put down and what should I pick up?

454
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,360
The best result I can think of

455
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,160
is to never see him again.

456
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,960
Master, don't worry.

457
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,360
Just do as you wish.

458
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,160
No matter what you choose,

459
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,160
I will always be with you.

460
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Yes.

461
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,760
Why do you think so much about your worries?

462
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,360
I'll go and check on Zhangsun.

463
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Okay.

464
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
You are getting more and more unruly.

465
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,160
You know I'm here, but you don't get up to welcome me.

466
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Have something.

467
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,960
You haven't practiced to be a drum.

468
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,960
Do I have to feed you?

469
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
Does it hurt?

470
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
No.

471
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,560
It's just a show.

472
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,560
The knife you stabbed is as sharp as a knife.

473
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
I'm sorry.

474
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,360
It's not your fault.

475
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,360
You should have killed him directly.

476
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,560
My life is not important.

477
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,960
Zhangsun, listen up.

478
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,960
Every person in the Cloud Clan

479
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,560
and every life is important.

480
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,360
No matter what happens,

481
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,360
I won't give up the chance to let you live.

482
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,560
If you still have time

483
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,560
to take care of Ling'er for me,

484
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
What's wrong with her?

485
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,160
Her father has exhausted her spiritual power.

486
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,560
You lost your spiritual power before.

487
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,360
So you should go and ask her

488
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,960
to give you a few words.

489
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,360
Okay.

490
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,960
Master, someone from Cang Lei Palace is here.

491
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
Who is it?

492
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Master Xuan of Cheng.

493
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,360
You can go and see him if you don't want to.

494
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,360
You should take care of yourself.

495
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
I'll go and have a look.

496
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,160
Didn't you say you couldn't wake up?

497
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,960
Why are you fine so soon?

498
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
My lady.

499
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,160
My lady.

500
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
Where is my master?

501
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,560
I advise you not to see Master Xuan now.

502
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,160
What are you talking about?

503
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,160
Master has woken up.

504
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
Why can't I see him?

505
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,760
Don't you want to do something behind my back?

506
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,960
If you insist on seeing him,

507
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
then come here.

508
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,760
Master, what's wrong with you?

509
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,760
Why are you all so strong?

510
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,160
You can see for yourself.

511
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
Master.

512
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Who are you?

513
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,360
Did you see my wife?

514
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,360
Wife?

515
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560
Look.

516
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,560
I prepared a lot of things for her.

517
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,760
But I can't see her.

518
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,560
Did you see her?

519
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,160
Is it that witch Siling

520
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,760
who has done something to Master again?

521
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,160
It's really not her this time.

522
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,360
I said before

523
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,960
that Master's primordial spirit was often seriously injured

524
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,560
and his soul was in poor health.

525
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,160
It's already an accident that he can wake up.

526
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,960
This is probably the illness after the primordial spirit was seriously injured.

527
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,560
Now his mind is like a child.

528
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,160
No one remembers him.

529
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,160
He only remembers his wife.

530
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
No.

531
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,560
Our Master

532
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,760
is not the same as the past.

533
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,960
Our Master

534
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,560
is the same as the past.

535
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,560
How could it be?

536
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,960
Master was seriously injured.

537
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,360
The two of us have been dead

538
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,960
several times.

539
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,960
No.

540
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,560
Think of another way.

541
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,760
Master is always very strict.

542
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,360
How can he treat people with such a face?

543
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,560
No, no. You treat him.

544
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,760
You can only rest slowly.

545
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,760
When the primordial spirit has recovered,

546
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,160
it will return naturally.

547
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,760
Brother.

548
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,360
If you see my wife,

549
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,960
can you take me to her?

550
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,360
Master, please forgive me.

551
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,360
No, no, no.

552
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,560
I really want to find my wife.

553
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,360
Grandpa.

554
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,560
Can you take me to my wife?

555
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,360
Please.

556
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,360
How about taking her to her?

557
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,760
No.

558
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,360
The four spirits want to harm Master.

559
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,760
If we send Master there now,

560
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,160
it's like sending sheep into the tiger's mouth.

561
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,360
The four spirits can definitely

562
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
distinguish the right and wrong.

563
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,760
Master Xuan's safety is not important.

564
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,760
He won't harm her.

565
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:05,960
No.

566
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,360
No, no.

567
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,160
Get up.

568
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,160
Get up.

569
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,560
I'm telling you.

570
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,760
I want to find my wife.

571
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,360
My master will never be like this.

572
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,760
Hurry up and send her to the four spirits.

573
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,760
My wife.

574
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,760
This is the jewelry I prepared for you.

575
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,160
Do you like it?

576
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,360
We have no choice

577
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,960
so we sent Master here.

578
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,960
We also asked Master to take her in for a few days.

579
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,560
Why?

580
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,360
You think highly of your master.

581
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,160
Don't follow me.

582
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,160
I won't.

583
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,160
My wife.

584
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,760
I'll go wherever you go.

585
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,760
Bai Jiusi.

586
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,360
Don't play tricks on me.

587
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
Did you hear me say that

588
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,360
we have too many problems?

589
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,760
So you pretend to forget everything

590
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
and come here to play dumb?

591
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,960
Master Xuan is really hurt.

592
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,160
Otherwise, with his character,

593
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,760
how could he do such a thing?

594
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,760
Now, there are many things to do.

595
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Even if we take him back today,

596
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,960
he will still make trouble to see the late master.

597
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,160
No one in Canglei Hall dares to stop him.

598
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,360
If people come and go

599
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,960
and get caught by someone

600
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,160
and it's not good for Master Xuan,

601
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,560
it will be a big deal.

602
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,560
I hope the late master will take our Master in

603
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,360
for a few days,

604
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,960
and we will not bother him

605
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,560
when he is well.

606
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,560
Yes.

607
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,160
We won't bother the late master

608
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,360
to arrange someone to take care of him.

609
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,760
As long as he stays,

610
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
we will take care of his safety.

611
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,560
My wife.

612
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:01,960
My wife.

613
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,560
Don't you like the jewelry?

614
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,960
Take a look.

615
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,160
I've been dancing for a long time.

616
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,760
Look.

617
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,360
Look.

618
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,760
Miss Peiì.

619
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,360
Miss Pei Zeyao,

620
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,360
come here quickly.

621
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:31,760
Hurry up.

622
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,260
This is for you.

623
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,360
Come on in.

624
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,460
Excuse me.

625
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,060
You're here to laugh at me?

626
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,820
I'm not that idle.

627
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,460
Qingyue asked me to visit you.

628
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,500
Master is kind.

629
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,180
But you're not.

630
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,620
My cultivation has been ruined.

631
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,940
Maybe it's worse than yours.

632
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,380
And my foundation has been destroyed.

633
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,420
I've become an ordinary person.

634
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,180
Did you

635
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,060
want to die then?

636
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,500
Yes.

637
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,060
I felt bad

638
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,580
when I fell from the high platform.

639
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,540
I thought

640
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,780
it would be in vain

641
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,500
if I died.

642
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,900
But one day,

643
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,300
I didn't want to die.

644
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,140
Why?

645
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,460
Because a person appeared.

646
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,860
Lord Shang wanted to live for him.

647
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,820
Do you still

648
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,860
like him?

649
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,180
I've never changed.

650
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,260
Letter of sollution

ï¿½ë¥¼uÅ Huh shit

652
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,140
If you feel

653
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,100
that life is not easy,

654
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,180
give yourself a reason to live.

655
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,700
You will find it.

656
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,420
I remember that

657
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,620

Um

661
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:42,460
YoYo English Channel YouTube

662
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:51,260
Looking back at yesterday, the love and hate are no longer as in the past

663
00:43:51,260 --> 00:44:04,860
The only thing left is the flower and the sea

664
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:11,660
I look at you with a smile

665
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:18,860
The corner of my eyes is filled with a line

666
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:32,860
Tell me, where are you?

667
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:39,860
I want to cry and I want to smile at you

668
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:46,860
But I want to be drunk in your arms

669
00:44:46,860 --> 00:45:00,860
Tell you, I love you very much
