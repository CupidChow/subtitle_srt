56
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,430

But I didn't fall for it.

62
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,080
She gave these away for free.

63
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
Try some.

Tell you what, stay quiet.

76
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,870
Or we'll really cripple you.

77
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,920
Tie me up?

78
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,470
Don't do this.

79
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,710
Otherwise, I'll report you to Liang...

Liangzhou Prefecture.

81
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,280
Mr. Qian, what are you talking about?

82
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,120
We just

83
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,430
saw you fall

84
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,470
and helped you up.

85
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,640
Right?

86
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,920
Exactly.

87
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,680
You're injured.

88
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,470
Luckily, we found you at night,

89
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,910
or you'd be truly crippled.

90
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,350

91
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,480
Coming!

92

Scoundrel, if not
for the red bean cakes,

93
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,310
would you still avoid me?

94
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,870
Untie me now!

95
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,760

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,430
You cursed villain!

97
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,510
You told me to sleep early

98
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,000
so that you could meet this widow!

99
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,120
Stop hitting! Stop!

100
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,720
- Stop it!
- Go away!

101
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,010
I have nothing to do with her!

102
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:54,920
What were you doing outside?

103
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,810
- Just passing by!
- Raising a mistress outside?

104
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,920

105
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,120
What did you do in my room?

106
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,480
Have you forgotten?

107
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,310
You promised

108
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,920
to bring me 50 taels of silver.

109
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,800
Not a single coin yet,

110
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,800
and you dare deny your actions!

111

115
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,310

- Little vixen!

122
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,920

123

Nonsense! He crashed into me!

191
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,600
Everyone on the street

192
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,790
witnessed it!

193
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,470
Governor,

194
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,440
this case is simple.

195
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,960
Please summon a physician

196
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,320
to examine his injuries.

197
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,000
Summon a physician.

198
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,620
(Diligent Governance for the People)

199
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,080
Governor,

200
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,270
victim Qian Si has severe fractures

201
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,080
confirmed as

202
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,440
carriage wheel injuries.

203
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,550
Lu Mingshu, any defense?

204
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,800
Governor,

205
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,390
Qian Si's injuries are suspicious.

206
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,670
But you allow the physician
to distort the truth.

207
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,910
If Liangzhou Prefecture can't judge fairly,

208
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,600
I'll beat the Dengwen Drum to appeal

209
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,840
to His Majesty!

210
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,480
Outrageous!

211
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,030
Insolent tongue!

212
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,110
Guards,

213
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,160
cane her 10 strikes!

214
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,000
I protest!

215
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,870
By the Da'an Codex,
women and children receive leniency.

216
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,360
Have you forgotten?

217
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,480
Do you seek

218
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,200
to instruct this court?

219
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,390
My rulings follow the law!

220
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,110
Strike!

221
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,230
Stop!

222
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,870
Governor Jia,

223
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,390
this case has flaws.

224
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,600
When Prince Rui heard of it,

225
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,780
he ordered a physician
from the Supreme Court

226
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,750
to re-examine Qian Si.

227
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,430
Physician Liu.

228
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,390
I'm here.

229
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,870
Wait!

230
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,030
We're handling this case.

231
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,390
But he belongs to the Supreme Court.

232
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,320
This interference

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,360
is improper, isn't it?

234
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,480
If I appeal to the Supreme Court,

235
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,440
they'll definitely

236
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,550
accept this case.

237
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,870
Governor, how about that?

238
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,040
Physician Liu,

239
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,440
please examine him.

240
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,710
Yes.

241
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,000
This person does have broken bones.

242
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,790
Judging from his scars,

243
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,150
he has two leg fractures.

244
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,670
The old break came

245
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,720
from blunt force,

246
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,200
not wheel injuries.

247
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,630
And some minor scrapes

248
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,080
were not serious.

249
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,160
Governor Jia,

250
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,150
you heard that.

251
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,960
Speaking of which,

252
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,080
this case is indeed controversial.

253
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,480
It can't be closed hastily.

254
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,600
According to the Da'an Codex,

255
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,200
a detailed dossier of the case

256
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,920
requires review
by the Ministry of Justice.

257
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,480
It's true that it should

258
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,780
be submitted to the Ministry of Justice.

259
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,510
But Physician Liu's words

260
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,600
prove Lu Chang's innocence

261
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,030
on Qian Si's broken legs.

262
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,550
He should be released immediately.

263
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,870
I guarantee Lu Chang's bail.

264
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,630
Release him?

265
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,800
This...

266
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,000
I can't decide.

267
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,670
We have to wait

268
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,790
for the review of Ministry of Justice.

269
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,440
How long will that take?

270
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
This...

271
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,600
This is unclear.

272
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,630
Guards,

273
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,600
imprison Qian Si.

274
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,750
Lu Chang remains jailed.

275
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,920
Court adjourned.

276
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,840
Buddy.

277
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,200
Buddy!

278
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,480
Qingzhao,
the Metropolitan Exam approaches.

279
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,670
How can he wait?

280
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,510
They're stalling.

281
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,020
Someone powerful

282
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,480
obstructs his release

283
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,080
to ruin his spring exam chance.

284
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,670
(Liangzhou Prefecture)

285
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,150
You've made no enemies in the capital.

286
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,720
It must be Lu Zegang, who blames Mr. Lu

287
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,600
for his son Lu Wencai's death
and wants revenge.

288
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,200
He aims to destroy Buddy.

289
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,150
I can't sit idle.

290
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,240
What if I go to beat the drum

291
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,290
at the Ministry of Justice?

292
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,790
Rash action

293
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,870
won't help.

294
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,080
Don't worry.

295
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,390
I'll find allies

296
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,000
across the capital.

297
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,320
Let's go.

298
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,100
(Liangzhou Prefecture)

299
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,460
(Lu Residence)

300
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,870
If not for Lu Chang,

301
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,550
(Grand Ambitions)
my son wouldn't have lost his privilege

302
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,670
to study at Songling Academy

303
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,670
or died.

304
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,670
(Grand Ambitions)

305
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,510
Minister Lu,

306
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,960
I'm sorry for your loss.

307
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,000
Scholars cherish scholarly honors.

308
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,510
I'll

309
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,790
make Lu Chang

310
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,360
lose exam eligibility

311
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,320
and become a lifelong cripple!

312
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,030
Minister, rest assured.

313
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,870
I have stalled the case

314
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,480
through the review
of Ministry of Justice.

315
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,150
This time, Lu Chang

316
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,840
will miss the Metropolitan Exam.

317
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,870
But his sister

318
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,750
caused chaos in Liangzhou Prefecture.

319
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,870
Now the Supreme Court is also involved.

320
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,000
Convicting him

321
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,670
becomes difficult.

322
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,440
First, block his exam.

323
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,750
We'll deal with him later.

324
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,390
Jia, I'm grateful

325
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,270
for your help.

326
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,510
Here's a small token.

327
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,000
Please accept it.

328
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,480
Minister! Don't!

329
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,960
Absolutely not!

330
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,320
Minister,

331
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,200
I only hope

332
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,600
for your future guidance.

333
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,920
Mingshu.

334
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,160
Come here.

335
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,080
What are we doing here?

336
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,600
You haven't eaten all morning.

337
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,270
Let's drink herbal tea here.

338
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,870
How can I eat while Buddy's case

339
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,710
remains unresolved?

340
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,390
How can you do that?

341
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,080
You must keep strength

342
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,440
for future efforts.

343
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,360
Excuse me, we want two perilla drinks!

344
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,440
Okay!

345
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,120
Have a look.

346
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,960
Selling cakes!

347
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
I'll buy some snacks.

348
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,990
Wait for me here.

349
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,840
Excuse me, do you have any ring cakes?

350
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,200
No.

351
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,630
Then give me some green bean cakes
and walnut cookies.

352
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,710
Okay.

353
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,000
Sir, do you still need?

354
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,320
Excuse me, where's the young lady?

355
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,550
Isn't she here?

356
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,960
She's gone?

357
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,440
Mingshu! Mingshu!

358
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,990
Mingshu!

359
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,960
Mr. Ying, chase him!

360
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,800
Stop!

361
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,200
Mingshu!

362
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,870
Don't scare me, Mingshu.

363
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,990
Mingshu!

364
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,750
Speak! Who's behind this?

365
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,640
You'll never know.

366
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,160
In prison,

367
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,030
I'll make you talk at any cost.

368
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,430
Dream on!

369
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,160
Want death?

370
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,830
Physician,

371
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,790
how is my daughter?

372
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,790
Your daughter suffered head trauma

373
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,680
and heart meridian damage.

374
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,590
I'll prescribe
some heart-nourishing medicine.

375
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,030
If she doesn't wake up in three days,

376
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,240
I'm afraid...

377
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,270
My poor Mingshu.

378
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,880
So ill-fated.

379
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,000
Physician, please.

380
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,960
Please save her.

381
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,750
No matter what it takes,

382
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,640
please be sure to cure her.

383
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,160
I'll try my best,

384
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,480
but no guarantees.

385
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,480
If you find Ningxin Pills,

386
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,070
they might help.

387
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,550
But they're rare

388
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,550
and priceless.

389
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,480
Ningxin Pills can save Mingshu?

390
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,070
My family has some.

391
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll fetch them.

392
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
(Residence of Duke of the State)

393
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,030
Is this the box, Young Master?

394
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,190
Exactly.

395
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,220
I'll explain to Mother

396
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,270
when I come back.

397
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,800
Wait!

398
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,840
Father.

399
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,590
Where are you taking

400
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,030
that medicine?

401
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,790
Father, I...

402
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,350
Here, give me the medicine.

403
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,000
Father, my friend is critically ill.

404
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,230
This box of pills is urgently needed!

405
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,350
Is that the lady named Lu Mingshu?

406
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,000
Would you rush like this
for an ordinary friend?

407
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,960
Tell me the truth.

408
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,320
What's

409
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,110
your relationship?

410
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,350
I didn't want to say this early,

411
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,480
but since you asked,

412
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,110
I'll be straight.

413
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,590
Lady Mingshu is my beloved.

414
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,550
I must save her.

415
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,560
Absurd!

416
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,720
Remember your status!

417
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,070
Fraternizing with commoners

418
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,270
is improper!

419
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,960
With the exam approaching,

420
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,720
focus on bringing glory

421
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,680
to our family.

422
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,880
All you have to do now is prepare

423
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
for the exam.

424
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,960
Avoid those vulgar distractions!

425
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,880
Father, be cautious.

426
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,440
I won't argue

427
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,310
with you.

428
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,640
Saving lives comes first.

429
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,840
Insolence!

430
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,720
Father.

431
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,190
Good.

432
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,680
Take the medicine,

433
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,200
but swear

434
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,240
to cut ties with her.

435
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,070
I refuse.

436
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,550
Are you defying me?

437
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,390
Guards,

438
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,830
discipline him.

439
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,350
Get on your knees.

440
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,400
Kneel!

441
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,840
Father,

442
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,270
I've never disobeyed you

443
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,680
since I was born.

444
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,920
But Lady Mingshu is my love.

445
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,200
I can't abandon her.

446
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,920
Lives are at stake.

447
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,430
Father, rest assured.

448
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,510
After saving her,

449
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,720
I'll accept the punishment.

450
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,070
(Auspicious and Elegant)
Rebellion! All of you rebel!

451
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,640
The Ningxin Pills are ready.

452
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,070
Madam Zeng, let me feed her.

453
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,400
You've done enough

454
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,480
for them.

455
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,440
How can I trouble you further?

456
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,430
Madam Zeng,

457
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,590
Mr. Lu is like my brother.

458
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,920
And Mingshu is...

459
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,270
my dear friend.

460
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,830
I'll do anything.

461
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,590
Please let me help.

462
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,800
Here.

463
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There are a lot
of acupoints in the hand.

464
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,720
We should rub these hand acupoints

465
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,070
every two hours

466
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,830
according to the physician's orders

467
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,240
to stimulate her recovery.

468
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,110
(Did Mingshu and Qingzhao)

469
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,350
(get any news
from the Ministry of Justice?)

470
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,240
Have you heard?

471
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,480
The girl who beat the drum yesterday

472
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,880
was attacked

473
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,000
for no apparent reason

474
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,110
after leaving here.

475
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,590
Really?

476
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,270
Officers,

477
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,880
are you speaking

478
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,550
of yesterday's plaintiff?

479
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,440
Yeah, that's her.

480
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,750
Lu Chang, isn't that your sister?

481
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,510
Do you know her condition?

482
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:09,990
Not sure.

483
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,510
I heard she's badly hurt,

484
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,510
maybe dying.

485
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,840
But...

486
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,350
the attacker poisoned himself.

487
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,680
It's a kind of poetic justice.

488
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,480
Officers,

489
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,900
could you request Governor Jia
to see me?

490
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,260
(Guanlan Pavilion)

491
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,440
He's knelt for four hours.

492
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,110
This is whipping disguised.

493
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,920
At least he won't enter
the imperial examination hall injured,

494
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,400
shaming us!

495
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,480
Do you only care about face?

496
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,480
Qingzhao,

497
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,550
apologize to your father.

498
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,590
A common girl

499
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,000
isn't worth being angry
with your father like this!

500
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,240
What's wrong with commoners?

501
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,950
All I know is

502
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,030
Mingshu is the best girl in the world!

503
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,030
You ignorant boy!

504
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,590
Will you promise

505
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,240
to cut ties with her or not?

506
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,030
How do you know her merits?

507
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,430
For her,

508
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,750
I stopped resisting officialdom.

509
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,270
Isn't that what you want?

510
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,720
I'll marry none

511
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,440
but her!

512
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,720
Marry none but her?

513
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,030
I won't

514
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,640
regret my words.

515
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,150
You haven't

516
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,680
suffered enough!

517
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,920
Taste

518
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,030
disobedience's price!

519
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Where's my whip?

520
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,350
(Guanlan Pavilion)

521
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,750
Master, stop!

522
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,590
I'm begging you...

523
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,590
Don't fight.

524
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,650
You served 10 years in the army.

525
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,200
Ordinary people can't bear your whip.

526
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,880
He has knelt for four hours.

527
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,200
Don't hit him!

528
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,680
He was just confused for a moment.

529
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,590
He'll recover.

530
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,870
Mother!

531
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,830
You still don't understand

532
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,240
for so long.

533
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,200
You've made such a fuss over that woman.

534
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,510
You scoundrel!

535
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,310
Will you yield?

536
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,480
Don't hit.

537
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,880
Don't hit him!

538
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,960
Don't hit him...

539
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,830
If you want to hit him, hit me too.

540
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,630
Guards!

541
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,030
Take the Madam away. Take her away!

542
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,720
Quickly take him away.

543
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,200
Take him away!

544
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,510
- You scoundrel.
- Yes.

545
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,200
Hurry up, Qingzhao, go!

546
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,190
Let me tell you.

547
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,590
If you leave now,

548
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,960
don't ever come back!

549
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,160
What sin have I committed
to deserve this?

550
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,680
Indulgent mothers raise useless sons.

551
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,200
That's exactly you!

552
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,000
(Guanlan Pavilion)
Right. Just beat me to death then.

553
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,510
Young Master, rest for a while.

554
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,720
Your body isn't made of iron.

555
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,920
And your injuries...

556
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,160
But...

557
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,480
It's fine. I'll recover after resting.

558
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,680
Go find a blanket.

559
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,400
Cover Madam Zeng

560
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,750
to prevent cold.

561
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,040
Yes.

562
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,910
Mingshu,

563
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,960
please wake up soon.

564
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,420
(Liangzhou Prefecture)

565
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,500
(Frank and Righteous)

566
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,270
You want

567
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,000
to leave the prison?

568
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,180
(Diligent Governance for the People)

569
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,990
Regarding my case,

570
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,640
you tolerated
the criminal's false accusations.

571
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,200
There's a suspicion of negligence
in the investigation.

572
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,790
Governor Jia,

573
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,240
do you truly think you can rest easy?

574
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,030
How dare you, Lu Chang! You...

575
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,480
How dare you threaten me?

576
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,460
Governor,

577
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,870
Minister Lu wants to prevent Lu Chang

578
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,370
from participating
in the Metropolitan Exam.

579
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,960
Why don't we use his prison release

580
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,110
as an opportunity...?

581
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,110
Lu Chang,

582
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,400
it's not impossible for you to go out.

583
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,000
But you must accept
severe punishment upon return.

584
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,520
Have you considered this clearly?

585
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,590
No regrets?

586
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,160
I accept.

587
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,750
Absolutely no regrets.

588
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,040
Mingshu,

589
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,240
your brother remains imprisoned.

590
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
If anything happens to you,

591
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,400
what would I do?

592
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,760
Mingshu,

593
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,070
you should know,

594
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,790
from the first moment I saw you,

595
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,830
I've loved you.

596
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,440
I originally thought

597
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,440
we had so much time

598
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,000
to let you slowly

599
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,590
come to like me.

600
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,640
I never imagined...

601
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,480
Mingshu!

602
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,640
- Mother.
- Chang.

603
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,590
Mother.

604
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,080
Chang.

605
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,400
How is Mingshu?

606
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,040
The physician says

607
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,910
Mingshu...

608
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,960
Go see her quickly.

609
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,150
Mingshu,

610
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,920
I'm back.

611
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,550
It's Lu Chang.

612
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,720
Your Chang.

613
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,480
Open your eyes and look at me.

614
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,870
I know.

615
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,920
It's always been my fault.

616
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,590
You've been so good to me.

617
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,960
I failed you.

618
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,110
You should know
I've never been so terrified.

619
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,200
I fear never seeing your smile again

620
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,030
and you'll never hear

621
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,070
my true feelings.

622
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,920
Please wake up, okay?

623
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,590
Mingshu.

624
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,590
Father, I'm leaving.

625
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,590
Mingshu!

626
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,920
Slow down.

627
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,590
The weather's so hot.

628
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,680
Take an umbrella.

629
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,440
I promised Lady Lin to buy rouge.

630
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,160
I'll wait for you at dinner.

631
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,960
Look how sweaty you are.

632
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,480
Got it.

633
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,820
The calligraphy I requested
will arrive today.

634
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,240
- Keep it safe for me.
- Okay.

635
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,560
Chang,

636
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,480
try this red bean cake I made myself.

637
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,680
It's soft and sticky. So sweet.

638
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,830
I don't like this.

639
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,590
There's fresh fish soup.

640
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,750
It's still warm.

641
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,670
I'm not hungry.

642
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,070
It was my carelessness.

643
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,520
Don't move.

644
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,520
Be careful with your hands.

645
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,030
Still so clumsy at your age?

646
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,830

00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,550
it's you.

691
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,590
You're finally awake.

692
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,590
So haggard.

693
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,000
You've been here all along?

694
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,800
As long as you're safe.

695
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,120
Qingzhao,

696
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,630
has it been you

697
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,590
caring for me all this time?

698
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,760
Not just me.

699
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,960
There's Shujun, Wen'an

700
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,440

00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,510
Are you thirsty? Have some water.

703
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,720
Here.

704
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,350

709
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,800
Why the noise?

710
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,110
I told you before.

711
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,070
I must quickly compile
these historical records

712
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,320
to present to His Majesty.

713
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,710
All this prepares
Lu Chang's future path.

714
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,710
Yet you still disturb me.

715
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,070
Stop editing!

716
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,280
Lu Chang's been framed and imprisoned.

717
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,710
Governor Jia deliberately delays.

718
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,710
Without action,

719
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,510
he might miss the Metropolitan Exam.

720
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,420

(I can no longer deny)

727
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,480
(these feelings for you.)

00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,920

731

00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,150
Lu Chang, stay strong.

733
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,580

734
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,120
Awake now?

736
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,070

737
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,880

738
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,440
Don't move.

739
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,110
Or the wounds will reopen.

740
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,670
Why are you here?

741
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,480
Since our meeting

742
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,550
at the academy last time,

743
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,320
you left deep impressions.

744
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,880
I intended to meet again

745
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,440
before the Metropolitan Exam.

746
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,150
Who could have imagined this?

747
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,630
Coming here, I learned of your plight.

748
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,440
I see.

749
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,760
Thank you for saving my life.

750
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,510
All right.

751
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,580
The Ministry of Justice
has reviewed the case.

752
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,320
This won't affect your exams.

753
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,630
Regarding your sister,

754
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,960
I sent a court physician.

755
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,510

756
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,960
with no serious issues.

757
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,920
Don't move.

758
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,590
You're injured.

759
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,480
I'll repay you tenfold

760
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,190
in the future for your lifesaving grace.

761
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,590
Alright, that's enough.

762
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,480
Your injuries are severe.

763
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,070
If not

764
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,710
properly treated,

765
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
forget the Metropolitan Exam.

766
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,880
You might

767
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,070
lose your life.

768
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,070
You...

769
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,400
With the Metropolitan Exam

770
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,070
approaching,

771
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,800
had you not left the prison,

772
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,630
you wouldn't have suffered this torture.

773
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,200
Why do you

774
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,510
take such risks?

775
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,760
Many things in this world

776
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,110
must be done despite the impossibility.

777
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,000
Mere flesh wounds,

778
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,880
even risking life,

779
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,110
are worthwhile.

780
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,350
Good.

781
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,670
Good child.

782
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,000
Let me advise you.

783
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,190
Without official rank,

784
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,510
you've already made enemies at court.

785
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,800
Remember,

786
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,100
the capital's situation

787
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,960
is complex.

788
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,760
Dangers lurk everywhere.

789
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,800
Future actions

790
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,840
must exercise utmost caution.

791
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,760
Your guidance is wise.

792
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
I'll act prudently

793
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,190
henceforth.

794
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,800
All right.

795
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,800
Lie down.

796
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,070
I'll take my leave.

797
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
Thank you very much.

798
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,640
Okay...

799
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,770
Let's go.

800
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,030
- Rest well.
- Let's go.

801
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,500
(Frank and Righteous)

802
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,360
This case has been reviewed.

803
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,480
Witnesses and evidence are conclusive.

804
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,630
Testimonies are clear.

805
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,920
Lu Chang is innocent,

806
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,800
and he'll be released immediately.

807
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,470
Mr. Lu,

808
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,630
I knew your innocence

809
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,710
and repeatedly urged
the Ministry of Justice for a swift review.

810
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,510
Now that this case is closed.

811
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,710
Hope you

812
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,960
bear no grudge.

813
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,590
Governor Jia, you're fair in judgment

814
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,440
and upright in governance.

815
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,320
I'm

816
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,160
deeply grateful.
