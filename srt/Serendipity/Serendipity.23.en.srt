28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,480
Mr. Lu,

29
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,490
after knowing each other

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,970
for so long, this is our first outing.

31
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,430
Mingshu.

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,480
Qingzhao,

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,520
Buddy.

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,680
Mingshu,

35
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,790
you even brought
such exquisite tea utensils?

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,350
I know you've always been particular
about tea.

37
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,310
And I had Shujun bring

38
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,170
Pre-Qingming Longjing Tea.

39
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,840
Today, let's congratulate you both
for ascending the golden list.

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,360
Two of the top three scholars
are present.

41
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,710
It's truly commendable.

42
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,800
There's another celebration.

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,120
The Lu Family is moving
into their new residence.

44
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,870
An imperial-bestowed mansion
for the top scholar.

45
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,150
We must celebrate properly today!

46
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,080
Shujun, is Prince Rui still coming?

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,310
He intended to.

48
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,680
He's probably delayed by court affairs.

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,150
Let's not wait.

50
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,000
It's truly fine.

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
Rest assured.

52
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,960
Shuangyan, bring the wine I prepared.

53
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,870
Yes.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,560
You usually substitute wine with tea.

55
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,080
Why are you drinking today?

56
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,470
With so many joyous occasions

57
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,560
and splendid scenery,
how could we lack wine?

58
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,120
- Come on.
- Fill all the cups.

59
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,470
What wine is this?

60
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,190
Mingshu, eat more.

61
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,400
You eat too. Put it in my bowl.

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,680
Let me peel you an orange.

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,750
(It seems)

64
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,560
(he won't come.)

65
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,300
County Princess Wen'an, please.

66
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,800
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

67
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,030
By the way,
there's a training ground nearby.

68
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,560
If anyone's interested,

69
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,310
let's go practice archery.

70
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,470
Mingshu,

71
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,430
do you want to go?

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,750
Great. I've never tried it.

73
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,750
I'll pass. I practice regularly.

74
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,750
Qingzhao, take good care of Mingshu.

75
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,080
Buddy, join us.

76
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,150
With spring at its peak,

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,870
if you have time,

78
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,750
why don't you accompany me?

79
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,750
This would be my honor.

80
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,560
You go ahead.

81
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm somewhat tired
and won't accompany you.

82
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,750
Mingshu, let's go.

83
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,160
Mr. Lu, let's go.

84
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,200
Have fun.

85
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,760
Mr. Lu,

86
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,160
you must have noticed

87
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,750
Shujun intends to match us.

88
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,150
County Princess,

89
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,000
forgive my bluntness.

90
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,320
I...

91
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,160
haven't moved past former matters.

92
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,800
That lady from Jianglin?

93
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,600
Hearing this reassures me.

94
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,310
After all, I'm not interested
in marriage either.

95
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,390
Please don't dwell on it.

96
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,870
I appreciate

97
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,680
your candor.

98
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,920
I once obeyed my parents,

99
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,750
viewing marriage as a woman's destiny.

100
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,310
But after Xie Xi's incident, I realized

101
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,270
this isn't life's purpose.

102
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,750
Watching Mingshu's establishment
of Hualang Pavilion has taught me

103
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,510
women's brilliance isn't confined
to households

104
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,510
or marriages.

105
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,040
I wish to live freely

106
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,800
like Mingshu

107
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,310
and bravely embrace life.

108
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,310
You'll surely achieve this.

109
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,160
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

110
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,600
With your wisdom, you'll succeed.

111
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,160
Eyes. Arrow tip. Bullseye.

112
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,160
Aim

113
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,520
and release.

114
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,670
Hit!

115
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,360
I said you could.

116
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,600
My first try succeeded!

117
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,440
Again, again.

118
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,360
What a perfect pair.

119
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,560
It seems he won't come.

120
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,750
I need solitude.

121
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,750
Buddy, I learned archery.

122
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,830
Mr. Lu.

123
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,790
Mr. Song,

124
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,070
may we speak privately?

125
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,600
You and County Princess return first.

126
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,200
Let's go.

127
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,040
Do you feel

128
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,270
their tension?

129
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,720
It feels like your brother
envies my cousin.

130
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,160
Are you sincere towards Mingshu?

131
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,560
Truthfully,

132
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,390
my heart belongs to Mingshu.

133
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,070
I'm waiting for her affection.

134
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,680
No falsehoods.

135
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,680
If your parents

136
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,360
disagree,

137
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,790
what then?

138
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,750
Laugh if you want,

139
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,430
my parents

140
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,920
did have status prejudices.

141
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,430
But no matter what they do,

142
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,190
my feelings for her won't change.

143
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,310
I'll never let her suffer.

144
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,560
I'll tentatively believe you.

145
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,920
But as a brother,

146
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,270
I'll respect Mingshu's choice.

147
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,720
I have only one warning.

148
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,190
If you harm her in any way,

149
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
you'll regret it.

150
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,550
Consort!

151
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,870
Shujun!

152
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,460
- Consort!
- Consort!

153
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,800
Consort!

154
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,600
Consort, where are you?

155
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,150
Consort!

156
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,270
- Shujun!
- Consort!

157
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,320
Consort, where are you?

158
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,320
He actually came.

159
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,910
Consort...

160
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,750
Consort!

161
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,750
Shuangyan,

162
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
how could you let Shujun wander alone?

163
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,270
Consort!

164
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,320
I'm here!

165
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,470
Consort!

166
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,990
- Consort!
- Don't approach.

167
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,670
Why not?

168
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,550
Let's go.

169
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,240
His Majesty summoned me suddenly.

170
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,790
That's why we're late.

171
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,960
It looks like you're...

172
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,390
Shujun,

173
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,870
didn't we agree you'd stop drinking?

174
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,390
I'm not drunk.

175
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,600
What's wrong with your leg?

176
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,030
I just accidentally wrenched it.

177
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,630
I have something to talk to you.

178
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,350
Buddy,

179
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,390
what did you tell Qingzhao?

180
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,080
It's our private matter.

181
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,750
You...

182
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,030
Do you have an interest in Wen'an?

183
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,270
You're so eager to marry me off?

184
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,240
Shujun is matchmaking.

185
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,550
I think Wen'an is fine.

186
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,000
If you're disinterested,

187
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,270
why are you so angry?

188
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,440
Neither County Princess Wen'an

189
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,870
nor I seek marriage.

190
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,120
Stop meddling in the future!

191
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,990
And

192
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,910
are you so eager to see me wed?

193
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,240
See me take another woman?

194
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,560
In short, just take care of yourself.

195
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,390
Don't interfere with my business.

196
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,750
I'm not in a hurry...

197
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,200
But you can't

198
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,750
dwell on the past.

199
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,910
You have to move on.

200
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,080
Even if past feelings existed,

201
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,510
they were over.

202
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,870
Some chapters

203
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,630
can't be turned over.

204
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,120
(Buddy's feelings
for Su Tangli run so deep.)

205
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360
(It's still unforgettable
after all this time.)

206
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,750
There're many accomplished, well-born

207
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,750
and dignified ladies in the world.

208
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,510
All better than your cherished one!

209
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,670
Incomparable!

210
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,750
Buddy, your romantic path is doomed.

211
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,360
I... I'll wash my hands of this.

212
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,320
Your Highness,

213
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,320
you've been avoiding me lately.

214
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,750
What's your intent?

215
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,870
If seeking divorce,

216
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,910
please speak plainly.

217
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,360
Divorce has never crossed my mind.

218
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,840
All couples

219
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,870
aspire to harmony.

220
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
So do I.

221
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,920
But...

222
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,150
But what?

223
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,870
I know

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,270
you're cautious about love.

225
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,550
So I'm not in a rush.

226
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,320
Since we're married,

227
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,600
we have time

228
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,200
to coexist peacefully.

229
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,870
My head spins.

230
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,350
It seems...

231
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,480
It seems we're quite drunk, isn't it?

232
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,560
Then...

233
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,360
Let's return.

234
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,040
Come.

235
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:16,180
(Top Scholar Residence)

236
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,920
Chang's success

237
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,480
in the top list

238
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,000
brings family glory.

239
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,000
Naturally,

240
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,960
it's all thanks to your teaching.

241
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,510
Family glory?

242
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,080
I'm afraid Chang isn't fit.

243
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,200
Let Chang be himself.

244
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,470
Director,

245
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,590
please have some tea.

246
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,320
Mingshu,

247
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,030
shouldn't you change
how you address me?

248
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,390
Uncle Lu.

249
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,990
Alright.

250
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,390
Chang,

251
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,360
may we speak privately?

252
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,870
You'll enter the court soon.

253
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,000
After a while,

254
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,320
let me introduce you
to some grand scholars.

255
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,670
I appreciate the offer.

256
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,080
But as a newcomer,

257
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,790
it's better to stay low-key.

258
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,960
Moreover, the Supreme Court

259
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,750
values practicality.

260
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,550
No need for connections.

261
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,120
For the first time,

262
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,550
you don't know court intricacies.

263
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,750
Backing there

264
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,120
is crucial.

265
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,550
It's the same with households.

266
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,720
Now that you're prominent.

267
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,320
The house should reflect your status.

268
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,910
In a few days,

269
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,150
I'll send a few stewards.

270
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,200
Director,

271
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,510
with your heavy duties,

272
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,670
there's no need for such trivialities.

273
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,470
Lu Chang,

274
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,670
why are you so stubborn?

275
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,870
Why do you have to insist?

276
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,380
I've never relied on others
since I was a child.

277
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,960
I believe

278
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,000
merit brings success.

279
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,270
But Chang,

280
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,080
however successful,

281
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,320
you must return to your roots.

282
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,000
My roots are

283
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,550
where Mother is.

284
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,510
After all these years,

285
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,510
we've made it.

286
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,990
Lu Chang,

287
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,790
do you remember

288
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,670
your last words?

289
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,160
Enough.

290
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,640
You still have wounds.

291
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,510
Alright...

292
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,960
Director, I'll surely repay

293
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,920
your lifesaving grace.

294
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,920
Of course, I remember.

295
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:17,910
In the future,

296
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,240
I'll even repay you

297
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,030
with my life.

298
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,790
But to force me against my conscience?

299
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,550
It's impossible.

300
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,200
So you refuse

301
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,960
to acknowledge me as Father?

302
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:02,220
(Supreme Court)

303
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,580
(Law as Immovable as Mountains)

304
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,550
May the Supreme Court

305
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,750
bring Mr. Su justice.

306
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,400
While I breathe,

307
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,790
fairness and justice

308
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,190
won't be drowned

309
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
by power schemes.

310
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,110
I pledge my loyalty to Reviewer Lu.

311
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,590
Your assistance

312
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,200
makes my new position

313
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,510
smoother.

314
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,510
Previously, I was powerless,

315
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,000
so aiding your investigations
faced obstacles.

316
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,120
(Supreme Court)
Now with authority

317
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,400
and Prince Rui's backing.

318
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,760
Who dares

319
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,720
disregard me?

320
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,660
(Law as Immovable as Mountains)

321
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,520
Everyone,

322
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,000
with the Jizhou disaster resolved,

323
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,070
I can rest easy.

324
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,750
Do you have

325
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,480
any other matters?

326
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,400
Your Majesty, I have a petition.

327
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,630
Speak.

328
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,750
I, Reviewer Lu Chang
of the Supreme Court,

329
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,070
beg you to reopen Su Changhua's case.

330
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,480
This...

331
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,910
Your Majesty,

332
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,270
this matter was settled

333
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,680
after Prince Rui's report.

334
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,680
Why reopen it?

335
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,000
Your Majesty,

336
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,160
our duty is handling cases

337
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,590
and seeking the truth.

338
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,880
Since Su's case has flaws,

339
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,480
we must investigate.

340
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,240
Your Majesty,

341
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,400
Su's case underwent

342
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,000
three judicial ministries' review

343
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
before the imperial decree.

344
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,920
This matter has already been settled.

345
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,750
It's been years now.

346
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,350
Reopening

347
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,790
and investigation

348
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,160
based on dubious claims

349
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,030
is absurd!

350
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,510
On that day, I approved Su's punishment

351
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,510
by the three judicial ministries.

352
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Reviewer Lu,
if you're trying to retry it,

353
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,160
I need a reasonable explanation.

354
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,270
Your Majesty,

355
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,400
the suspicion in Su Changhua's case

356
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,890
goes beyond Liu Yuanying's testimony.

357
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,880
I have carefully examined the case file.

358
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,640
Although it seems perfect,

359
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,720
there's a suspicion that he was framed.

360
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,070
This case concerns

361
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,680
the court authority and your honor.

362
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,270
Your Majesty, I implore you

363
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,920
to re-investigate Su Changhua's case

364
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,160
to prove our laws don't favor nobles.

365
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,510
Your Majesty,

366
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,350
this...

367
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,400
This is only Reviewer Lu's statement.

368
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,320
It's not trustworthy.

369
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,030
If Reviewer Lu is so skeptical,

370
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,350
he's putting the prestige of the court

371
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,000
and the royal dignity at risk.

372
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,790
His Majesty hasn't spoken.

373
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,070
Vice Premier Yang's outburst

374
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,070
disregards royal dignity!

375
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,960
I merely defended the throne.

376
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,750
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

377
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,590
I think

378
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,590
if Su Changhua isn't corrupt

379
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,480
but was framed,

380
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,400
doesn't that tarnish
Your Majesty's legacy?

381
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,960
Since it's suspicious,

382
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,240
if the court doesn't re-trial,

383
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,350
I'm afraid people think the court

384
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,110
can be used by traitors.

385
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,160
In the long run,
it will shake public opinion.

386
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,830
The ancient wise kings'

387
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,920
special office to investigate cases
of injustice

388
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,400
was praised by all the people.

389
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,750
If Your Majesty can reopen this case,

390
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,850
it will make the people
grateful for your grace

391
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,270
and win public support
for long-term peace and stability.

392
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
Enough.

393
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,590
I understand what you are saying.

394
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,160
Over the years,

395
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,750
I heard Su was upright

396
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,000
and honest.

397
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,680
Since the Supreme Court persists,

398
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,030
there must be

399
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,750
doubts about this case.

400
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,550
Henceforth,

401
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
the Supreme Court

402
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,480
will reinvestigate Su's case.

403
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Evildoers won't escape.

404
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,160
Loyalists won't be wronged.

405
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,880
Brilliant, Your Majesty!

406
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,240
(All these days,)

407
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,510
(writing or transcribing)

408
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,630
(aren't my will.)

409
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
(But even avoiding Hanlin Academy,)

410
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,550
(what should I do?)

411
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,800
Academician Wang!

412
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,400
Academician Wang,

413
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,310
regarding the documents
you entrusted me,

414
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,400
I'm done.

415
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,200
What else can I help with?

416
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,400
Deputy Song, you're too diligent.

417
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,480
You can get some rest.

418
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,480
Deputy Censor Song entrusted you

419
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,960
to us.

420
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,750
No one will trouble you.

421
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,750
I'll do my best.

422
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,310
I can't be idle.

423
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,750
How can you be idle?

424
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Just give me a moment.

425
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,750
I'll deliver lecture records
to Ministry of Rites first.

426
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,350
Then I'll introduce you
to some scholars.

427
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,200
We're not in a rush.

428
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,680
Anyway, nothing happened now.

429
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Let me deliver this

430
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,110
for you.

431
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,390
This...

432
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,550
Deputy Song, please wait for me
to register.

433
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,660
(Song Qingzhao)

434
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,350
I didn't expect to see my name here.

435
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Are these past scholars' registries?

436
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,310
May I browse?

437
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,700
They're not confidential.

438
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,880
Proceed, please.

439
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,900
(Song Qingzhao)

440
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,380
(Lu Chang)

441
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,590
Recently, I've been reviewing
my mentor's case files.

442
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,720
I've learned about the case.

443
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,370
At that time, my mentor
was an Imperial Academy doctor.

444
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,320
Two years before the case,
he was transferred to Jianglin as a prefect.

445
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,110
One year before the case,
Jianglin's floods

446
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,350
destroyed the dam

447
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,590
he had built.

448
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,350
There were countless casualties.

449
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,350
Commander Wei Xian received
a secret report

450
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,270
that there were 200,000 taels
of disaster relief funds

451
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
in Su's ancestral tomb.

452
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,720
Sub-prefect Gao Shicai

453
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,960
also proved

454
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,720
the corruption.

455
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,070
As I recall,

456
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,830
Investigating Censor Lu Zegang
was appointed

457
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,350
to investigate the case.

458
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,000
All the evidence pointed

459
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,960
to Su's guilt.

460
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,790
His aide, Liu Xiankun, also testified.

461
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,310
One of the strongest pieces of evidence

462
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,240
is Su Changhua's suicide confession.

463
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,270
This case seems ironclad.

464
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,510
The case involves Gao Shicai,

465
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,790
Lu Zegang and Wei Xian.

466
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,470
They're all suspected

467
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,200
of slandering my mentor.

468
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,640
Who do you want to start with?

469
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,550
Since Wei Xian

470
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,070
found the evidence initially,

471
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,070
let's start with him.

472
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,180
(Supreme Court)

473
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,920
Mr. Song, what brings you here?

474
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,190
A few days ago,

475
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,270
I heard an interesting story about you.

476
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,350
After becoming
Jianglin's Prefectural Graduate,

477
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,190
a wealthy lady tried
to capture you as groom.

478
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,680
Though it was unrequited,

479
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,830
it ended badly.

480
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,000
I don't know if it's true.

481
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,880
You came specifically

482
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,480
for this?

483
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,240
Recently, I accidentally
saw your registry.

484
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,610
It reminded me of this thing.

485
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,510
I grew curious, so I came
to ask you about it.

486
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,960
You investigated in Jianglin?

487
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,550
It's truly my offense.

488
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,310
But your registry

489
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,640
shows no sister.

490
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,310
I really doubted it

491
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,880
and sent someone to investigate.

492
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,310
Then I discovered

493
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,670
only you and your mother in Jianglin

494
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,000
for over a decade.

495
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,920
There is no third member,

496
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,640
not to mention Sister Mingshu.

497
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,510
That wealthy lady

498
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,440
named Mingshu

499
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,920
was surnamed Jian.

500
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,160
She's the sole survivor

501
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,250
of the Jian Family massacre.

502
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,270
I really don't know

503
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,480
why she now poses

504
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,550
as your sister.

505
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,230
You came here today
to ask me these questions.

506
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,790
Are you trying to tell her the truth?

507
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,550
If I wanted to tell Mingshu,

508
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,310
I wouldn't have come to you.

509
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,880
Since you investigated,

510
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,000
I'll confess.

511
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,640
On my way to the capital,

512
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,270
I unintentionally saved

513
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,160
Mingshu from assassins
aside from the cliff.

514
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,790
She lost her memory when she recovered.

515
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,550
We had to pretend to be siblings.

516
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,160
Mingshu's nature is so.

517
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,960
Knowing her past

518
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,680
would torture her

519
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,270
and endanger her.

520
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,160
That's why I'm hiding it now.

521
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,590
But as far as I know,

522
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,960
the killers of that case
have all been captured.

523
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,200
You haven't told Mingshu the truth yet.

524
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,200
Why still hide the truth?

525
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,480
Mr. Song,

526
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,240
the Jian Family's case

527
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,070
connects inextricably

528
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,070
to my mentor's.

529
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,830
Behind the scenes,

530
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,640
it involves powerful figures.

531
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,880
Only when the culprits fall

532
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,070
and the crisis is resolved

533
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,750
can the truth emerge

534
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,590
and Mingshu be told.

535
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,350
Do you know the murderer?

536
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,350
It's difficult to find him,

537
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,920
but progress exists.

538
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,960
Since you know the truth,

539
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,510
what's your plan?

540
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,440
Like you,

541
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
I wish Mingshu unharmed.

542
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,510
I even hope she never recalls

543
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,830
that tragic memory.

544
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,160
I just hope that she remains

545
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,720
loved by her family,

546
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,680
carefree and happy.

547
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,390
Thank you.

548
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,390
No need.

549
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,110
I didn't do this for you.

550
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,160
And Lu Chang,

551
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,680
your feelings are obvious

552
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,590
after long cohabitation with her.

553
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,030
Do you truly see her as a sister?

554
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,440
How could Mingshu and I
merely share a fleeting time?

555
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,270
We've known each other
for over a decade.

556
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,550
Had I truly harbored feelings for her,

557
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,000
during the groom-snatching last year,

558
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,430
she would have become a member
of the Lu Family.

559
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,880
In Jianglin,

560
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,920
you might have thought so.

561
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,480
But now,

562
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,790
can you swear

563
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,590
that you have no romantic feelings
for her?

564
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,200
So that's the case.

565
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,080
Lu Chang,

566
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,550
since you chose to become siblings
with Mingshu,

567
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,200
by reason and propriety,

568
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,920
you must not overstep even half a step.

569
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,550
Mr. Song, is your righteous lecture

570
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,000
for Mingshu's sake

571
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,750
or for your own?

572
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,350
Naturally, it's for Mingshu.

573
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,750
She has endured enough suffering.

574
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,750
Should she face further harm

575
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,000
because of this,

576
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,110
I would never...

577
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,840
Lu Chang,

578
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,830
I don't want to go that far with you.

579
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,000
She's my family.

580
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,740
I'm even more unwilling than you

581
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,960
to see her harmed.

582
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,160
I would never do anything to hurt her.

583
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,590
Before Mingshu regains her memories,

584
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,400
I'm her elder brother.

585
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,400
After she recovers her memories,

586
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,640
I'll respect her choices.

587
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,640
Buddy worked so late.

588
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,750
She must be starving.

589
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,750
Since Mingshu and Mr. Lu

590
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,880
aren't family

591
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,590
and share no blood relation,

592
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,310
I ask you to consider

593
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,310
Mingshu's reputation as a woman

594
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,750
and maintain a proper distance.

595
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,590
What does Qingzhao mean by this?

596
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,310
Though Mingshu and I

597
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,750
aren't related by blood,

598
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,720
we're still considered siblings
by others.

599
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,590
I naturally understand the boundaries.

600
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,350
Lu Chang,

601
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,720
let me propose
a gentleman's agreement today.

602
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,350
Until all matters are settled,

603
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,550
you must not cross propriety.

604
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,720
Fine.

605
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,110
But you must also promise

606
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,070
not to tell Mingshu

607
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,680
the truth.

608
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,640

we've been like a family.)

(But what exactly
is their relationship to me?)

664
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,270
(Where are my birth parents?)

665
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,120
Mingshu,

666
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,720
come and eat.

688
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,710
I got lost in thought.

689
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,840
What brings you here?

690
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,190
Nothing urgent.
I just wanted to see you.

691
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,920
(Since Mingshu isn't
part of the Lu Family)

692
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,480

693

since we met,

696
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,110
you've always been frank

697
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,120
and sincere.

698
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,440
That's why we've grown

699
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,880
so close.

700
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,550
You'd never hide anything

701
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,480
from me,

702
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,800
right?

703
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,630
(Why does Mingshu ask this?)

704
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,280
(Does she suspect something?)

705
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,120
Of course.

706
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,390
Mingshu,

707
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,590
no matter what happens,

708
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,590
I'll stand by you

709
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,190

710
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,760

into the new residence.

surpass Shengmin Alley's.

Don't worry.

714
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,320
Anyway, whatever arises,

715
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,550
be sure to talk to me.

718
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,150
What becomes of our bond?

719
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,110
What should I do?

720
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
Tell me!

00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,480
I want to confront him.

722
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,960
But I'm afraid if I speak rashly,

723
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,800
how should I face him?

724
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,360
I can't bear this uncertainty.

725
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,710
What should I do?

726
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,150
Since no one tells me,

727
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,280
I'll investigate myself.

728
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,110
Buddy and Mother mentioned

729
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,920
I lost my memory after being injured

730
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,710
outside Jianglin.

731
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,070
Perhaps I'm from Jianglin.

732
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,230

734
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,720
It's you.

735
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,880
You entered that room.

736
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,320
What else do you know

737
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,440
about Concubine Chen?

When she bore Prince Yu,

739
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,590
heaven sent auspicious signs.

740
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,480
His Majesty rejoiced

741
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,880
and favored Prince Yu greatly.

Yet this auspice gradually

746
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,190
became a curse.

for Prince Rui grew.

751
