=Episode 21=

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,480
Your Highness, please forgive me.

29
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,840
Mingshu and I are not siblings in truth.

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,210
Her surname is Jian.

31
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,910
She is the daughter of Jian Jinhai,
a wealthy merchant of Jianglin.

32
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,280
The Jian Family of Jianglin?

33
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,020
(Self-restraint and Integrity)

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,310
Are they the victims

35
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,760
of Jianglin's extermination case
in late autumn last year?

36
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,950
If I recall correctly,

37
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,560
that case was closed as collusion
with bandits.

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,790
Collusion was slander.

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,880
I believe

40
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,990
the Jian Family suffered
this calamity precisely

41
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,280
because they possessed evidence

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,360
that could prove my mentor's innocence.

43
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,360
If your speculation holds,

44
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,150
all officials in Jianglin Prefecture

45
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,560
are likely compromised.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,360
This case bears grave implications.
Do you possess evidence?

47
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,270
Your Highness,

48
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,360
I hold no concrete evidence.

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,710
Hence, I dared not speak recklessly.

50
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,280
But I conjecture

51
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,910
on the day Mingshu fell from the cliff,

52
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,360
she must have overheard
or witnessed something

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,150
that invited assassination.

54
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,750
Regrettably, her amnesia

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,400
erased those memories.

56
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,080
It's reasonable.

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,240
Jian Mingshu

58
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,470
is likely this case's key witness.

59
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,990
Her identity

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,570
must not be prematurely exposed,

61
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,990
lest

62
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,750
danger follow.

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,960
Speak truthfully now,

64
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,150
did you approach me with these words

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,470
only after learning of my appointment

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,200
as Minister of the Supreme Court?

67
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,270
I deceived you

68
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,520
and deserve punishment.

69
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,870
Yet since our acquaintance,

70
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,470
I've observed your unbending integrity

71
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,630
and benevolent character.

72
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,470
It's a rare virtue.

73
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,590
I developed a profound admiration,

74
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,470
long desiring to unburden my heart.

75
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,190
More importantly,

76
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,190
I beg you to grant me
an opportunity to atone.

77
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,080
Let me enter the Supreme Court

78
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,520
to personally investigate this case

79
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,030
and clear my mentor's name.

80
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,560
Lu Chang,

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,470
you're outwardly aloof,

82
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,080
yet inwardly

83
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,030
fox-cunning.

84
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,120
Your Highness

85
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,470
flatters undeservedly.

86
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,560
You owe me this debt today.

87
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,360
After the Palace Exam results
are announced,

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,150
report to me

89
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,030
as the Reviewer of Supreme Court.

90
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,080
Serve me well henceforth.

91
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,750
Thank you, Your Highness.

92
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,280
Ladies,

93
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,870
(Star Mark)
the first treasure

94
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,870
in our Hualang Pavilion charity auction
is Phoenix Greeting Dawn in my hand.

95
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,190
It has an auspicious symbolism.

96
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,360
The phoenix head uses Western rubies,

97
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,480
and its body is embroidered

98
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
with supreme elegance.

99
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,050
- Starting bid: 100 taels.
- It's exquisite.

100
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,930
Indeed.

101
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,680
Bidding commences.

102
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,200
(Star Mark)
The highest offer prevails.

103
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,870
200 taels!

104
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,120
280 taels!

105
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,470
- How did Lu Mingshu
- 300 taels!

106
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,120
ingratiate herself with Consort Rui?

107
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,190
Rumor says she was
Consort Rui's reading lady.

108
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,910
Reading lady?

109
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,630
Greetings, Consort Rui.

110
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,070
So it's Mr. Jiang.

111
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,270
Shujun!

112
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,160
Mr. Jiang, you should mind propriety.

113
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,150
How dare you address
a lady's personal name!

114
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,400
Shujun,

115
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,240
I know you still resent me.

116
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,480
Today I came specifically

117
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,270
to apologize.

118
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,360
My past actions
were swayed by malicious gossip.

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,430
Upon reflection,
I'm consumed by regret.

120
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,880
If I can't obtain
your forgiveness today,

121
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,070
I'll never forgive myself.

122
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,630
Mr. Jiang, you're renowned
for spotless conduct

123
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
and lofty principles.

124
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,600
What faults could

125
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,390
such a paragon possibly have?

126
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,400
Shujun,

127
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,430
don't mock me.

128
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,360
I truly repent.

129
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,680
Your Highness, your personal attendance
at this charity auction

130
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,120
shows support for Consort Rui.

131
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,750
She will surely be delighted.

132
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,790
Shujun,

133
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,950
do you recall our vows?

134
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,880
Silence!

135
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,000
You broke our engagement
through faithless abandonment.

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,750
Do you imagine

137
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,600
I remain

138
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,310
the naive girl swayed

139
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,600
by honeyed words?

140
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,480
I should thank you for rejecting me

141
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,120
and allowing my fortunate union

142
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,560
with Prince Rui.

143
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,710
Yin Shujun.

144
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,350
Yin Shujun!

145
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,680
You let go.

146
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,150
Let go!

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,840
Impudence!

148
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,390
Greetings, Prince Rui.

149
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,560
I merely...

150
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,320
Please don't misunderstand.

151
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,510
I just...

152
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,870
What punishment fits disrespect

153
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,430
toward Consort Rui?

154
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,120
Mild: kneeling or caning.

155
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,150
Severe:

156
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,510
beheading.

157
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,640
Prince Rui!

158
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,630
Prince Rui, I didn't.

159
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,830
I merely conversed with Consort Rui.

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,160
Prince Rui, please forgive me.

161
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,630
Offending my consort

162
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,600
offends me.

163
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,000
Bind and restrain him.

164
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,320
Notify the Jiang Family

165
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,360
to retrieve their trash.

166
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,750
Henceforth, no Jiang

167
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,310
shall enter my home.

168
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,790
Yes.

169
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,840
Shujun.

170
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,960
Shujun!

171
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,400
Your Highness,

172
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,790
I...

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,160
Unexpectedly, our marital fate

174
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,390
would please you so.

175
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,800
I failed to perceive.

176
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,830
Congratulations to Lady Qu
for acquiring the Purple Phoenix Crown!

177
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,360
350 taels charity donation recorded.

178
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,560
Congratulations to Lady Qu.

179
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,750
Congratulations, Lady Qu.

180
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,480
- Congratulations.
- Lady Mingshu,

181
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,310
might we speak privately?

182
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,750
Lady, what's the matter?

183
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,520
This...

184
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,360
This concerns private feminine affairs.

185
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,190
It's improper to discuss publicly.

186
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,510
Lady Mingshu,

187
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,190
among these auctioned accessories,

188
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,160
are there any masculine items?

189
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,350
Certainly.

190
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,680
Jade pendants and ornaments abound.

191
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,580
(Jewelry)

192
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Excellent!

193
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,510
My husband is present.

194
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,040
Might I trouble you

195
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,950
to select on my behalf?

196
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
In that case,

197
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,720
please describe his temperament
and preferences.

198
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,910
What a magnificent landscape painting.

199
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,750
The artist must possess
extraordinary talent.

200
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,960
Lady, you discern well.

201
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,920
Mr. Song ranked second
among the selected candidates.

202
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,840
So your paramour

203
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,550
is Mr. Song?

204
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,320
Wait.

205
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,870
I think this one suits you perfectly.

206
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,600
Its symbolism matches the painting.

207
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,120
However, lacking bidders,
a fixed price applies:

208
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,350
500 taels.

209
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,320
How much?

210
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,480
Are you blackmailing me?

211
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,800
No coercion is involved.

212
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,770
It depends on whether you wish

213
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,260
to contribute
to the Spring Plowing Ceremony.

214
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,080
You...

215
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,990
Mingshu,

216
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,360
Third Lady of Lu.

217
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,840
Well...

218
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,750
Spring Plowing Ceremony
concerns state affairs.

219
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,600
Our Lu Family
will definitely contribute.

220
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't worry.

221
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,240
Don't say 500 taels,

222
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,360
even if it's 1,000 taels,

223
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,390
I'll also donate.

224
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,670
1,000 taels?

225
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,030
Third Lady of Lu, your magnanimity

226
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,000
shines like righteous clouds.

227
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,320
I admire it deeply.

228
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,560
Lady Liu,

229
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,120
record the Lu Family's donation.

230
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,270
It's 1,000 taels!

231
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,670
Might I converse privately

232
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,080
with Mr. Song?

233
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,080
Third Lady of Lu,

234
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,390
given our acquaintance,

235
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,600
a private meeting

236
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,910
risks misunderstanding.

237
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,200
Whatever needs saying,

238
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,870
speak before Lady Mingshu.

239
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,800
Precisely.

240
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,750
How could a noble lady like you

241
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,750
forget gender propriety?

242
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,470
Exactly.

243
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,320
Improper indeed.

244
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,870
No, I merely wished
to discuss painting techniques with him.

245
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,150
Unseal it.

246
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,590
This painting

247
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,790
was indeed created
during my visit to the Lu Family.

248
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,120
Beyond that,

249
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,910
no other connection exists
between her and myself.

250
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,840
Moreover, my heart belongs elsewhere.

251
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,680
I hope you all

252
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,320
refrain from misunderstanding her.

253
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,600
She tries to force herself on Mr. Song,

254
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,360
yet is bluntly rejected.

255
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,560
Third Lady of Lu!

256
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,240
Your jade pendant.

257
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,560
You...

258
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,330
Today's charity auction
succeeded spectacularly.

259
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,440
Much credit goes to Qingzhao.

260
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,030
When Third Lady of Lu saw you,
she splurged 1,000 taels.

261
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,390
Mingshu,

262
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,360
my earlier public declaration

263
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,030
merely aimed to politely refuse others.

264
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,200
Don't burden yourself.

265
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,800
I understand.

266
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Since we agreed to interact normally,

267
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,750
overcaution

268
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,510
breeds estrangement.

269
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,360
Your words reassure me.

270
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,360
Given today's triumph,

271
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
shall we celebrate at a restaurant?

272
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,790
Actually, little remains to pack.

273
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,720
Why don't you go ahead first?

274
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,080
Then...

275
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,790
we'll entrust this to you, Yuanying.

276
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,510
Go.

277
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,630
Let's go.

278
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,200
With my brother punished by Prince Rui

279
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,600
and Jiang Family's declining,

280
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,750
what becomes of my marital prospects?

281
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,240
I recall this gentleman

282
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,360
won top honors at the Wine Tasting.

283
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,360
He's bound for greatness.

284
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,910
So what if he's common-born?

285
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,910
350 taels.

286
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,600
400 taels.

287
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,550
1,000 taels.

288
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,120
Today Third Lady of Lu alone
donated 1,000.

289
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,960
Yeah.

290
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,080
Lady, rest assured.

291
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
All recorded.

292
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,390
Lady Yuanying,

293
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,630
where's Mingshu?

294
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,550
She departed with Mr. Song.

295
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,270
Today he publicly declared

296
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,390
having someone in his heart.

297
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,600
Every observer knows

298
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,080
it's Lady Mingshu.

299
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Your Highness, taste this sweet soup.

300
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,870
Thank you

301
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,750
for defending me

302
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,120
against Jiang today.

303
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,150
We're husband and wife.

304
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,670
It's one entity.

305
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,550
His offense against you

306
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,080
insults me.

307
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,750
No thanks needed.

308
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,600
Yet I wonder,

309
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,200
do you regret ever knowing Jiang Wenrui?

310
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,630
Regret?

311
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,080
Time flows irreversibly.

312
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,870
Better to release

313
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,080
than linger.

314
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,440
Have you released it?

315
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,120
Hypocrites

316
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,980
aren't worth remembrance.

317
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,960
It's just

318
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,030
that fearless Yin Shujun,

319
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,910
who dared to love fiercely,

320
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,270
remains in bygone days.

321
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,990
Right?

322
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,840
Your Highness,

323
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,240
past matters

324
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,870
no longer bind me.

325
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,350
Henceforth,

326
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm your wife.

327
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,600
I'll do my part

328
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,910
and be your dutiful helpmate.

329
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,440
Please rest assured.

330
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,480
Yet I desire more than this.

331
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,910
Since you're tired,

332
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,720
rest early.

333
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:39,100
(Self-restraint and Integrity)

334
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,960
What time is it?

335
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,290
We have a monkey in the house.

336
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,750
How awesome is this?

337
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,120
Buddy, rest assured.

338
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,670
Qingzhao escorted me to the alley.

339
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,630
It won't be a problem.

340
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,360
Do you want to sit here?

341
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,790
How's the view up there?

342
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,670
Different perspectives
entirely from heights.

343
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,040
You...

344
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,150
Do you like Song Qingzhao?

345
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,200
I like him...

346
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,480
but not to a marriage extent.

347
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,320
Do you suggest

348
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,480
I avoid him henceforth?

349
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,910
Lady,

350
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,510
you don't have to avoid anyone.

351
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,400
Your associations are your freedom.

352
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,680
Even I can't interfere.

353
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,590
Buddy,

354
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,920
your gaze

355
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,790
softened earlier.

356
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,790
If you haven't pledged deep affection,

357
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,680
might you delay accepting him?

358
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,960
Perhaps

359
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,830
after I secure an official post

360
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,590
and stabilize standing,

361
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,270
your marital prospects will improve.

362
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,750
Even if I fancied someone,

363
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,070
I'd never exploit your career
as a bargaining chip.

364
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,880
I know your nature.

365
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,190
But

366
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,270
can you promise me first?

367
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,550
I'll consider it.

368
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,960
You'd consider it?

369
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,320
Wait.

370
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,750
Did you forget something up there?

371
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,920
Hurry up and let me down.

372
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,110
Lu Chang, how can you bully me?

373
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,240
Leaving me stranded!

374
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,350
How dare you address me?

375
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,000
Hurry up and let me down,

376
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,750
or I'll tell Mother that you bullied me.

377
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,790
Mother!

378
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,080
Then you have to promise me first.

379
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,070
To tell you the truth,

380
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,590
I've agreed with Qingzhao

381
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,070
to interact normally.

382
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,010
Seriously?

383
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,030
Why would I lie to you?

384
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,160
You said that lady held a charity auction
at Hualang Pavilion?

385
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,200
Isn't it?

386
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,350
She was a merchant girl

387
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,200
and paraded around all day long.

388
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,830
How can she match

389
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,920
our scholarly lineage?

390
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,270
My son,

391
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,350
ever selective,

392
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,000
fancies such a woman?

393
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,750
Incomprehensible!

394
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,830
(Nanny Sun)
He publicly declared affection today.

395
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,590
She must have bewitched him.

396
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,590
After this...

397
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,110
I think he acted rashly.

398
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,590
Now he blocks

399
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,920
future marriage prospects.
How to arrange his matches?

400
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,510
Madam,

401
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
don't worry.

402
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,310
If we can't sway him,

403
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,030
let's target the girl.

404
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,240
Tomorrow I'll personally

405
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,480
admonish her

406
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,270
and teach her

407
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,310
about social strata.

408
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,720
Cease her delusions!

409
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,190
Very well.

410
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,960
I'll entrust this to you.

411
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,750
Don't worry.

412
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,270
Be careful.

413
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,790
Thank you.

414
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,920
My pleasure,

415
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,760
you're welcome.

416
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,190
I still have things to do.

417
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,080
I'll take my leave.

418
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,840
Your hammer.

419
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,800
Thank you.

420
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,190
Farewell.

421
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,110
I'll guide you out.

422
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,550
Mr. Wei, did you forget something?

423
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,350
Yuqing.

424
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,160
Might we converse indoors?

425
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,950
Director Lu,

426
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,480
humble abode lacks fine tea.

427
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,910
Help yourself.

428
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,080
Okay.

429
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,190
Yuqing,

430
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,830
it's nearly 18 years

431
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,110
since we parted.

432
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,520
All these years,

433
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,640
you've suffered.

434
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,680
You come for the children?

435
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,320
No.

436
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,920
Don't get me wrong.

437
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,350
I'm not here to claim them.

438
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,910
It's just

439
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,790
days ago at Songling Academy,

440
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,160
I saw

441
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,670
Lu Chang

442
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,030
and Mingshu.

443
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,830
They're remarkably bright.

444
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,310
You've raised them well.

445
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,630
I'm ashamed

446
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,070
before you.

447
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,510
They are my own blood.

448
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,030
Of course, I should nurture them.

449
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,830
No thanks needed.

450
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,350
No debts exist between us.

451
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,720
I looked after

452
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,400
Lu Chang

453
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,240
for a few years.

454
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,920
But Mingshu...

455
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,350
When we parted,

456
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,000
you were newly pregnant.

457
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,480
I've never seen

458
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,960
this child before.

459
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,480
What's your purpose

460
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,440
today?

461
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,080
Yuqing,

462
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,480
I think these children

463
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,110
remain unaware

464
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,830
of their biological father's news.

465
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,670
Yes.

466
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,160
I told them

467
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
their father

468
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,350
perished.

469
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,460
(Memorial Tablet of the Late Mr. Lu)

470
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,590
Yuqing, you...

471
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,440
Then tell me,

472
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,750
how should I explain?

473
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,510
How do I tell them who you are?

474
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,960
When we got married,

475
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,310
I knew not
you were the Lu Family's youngest son.

476
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,790
After separation,

477
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,830
you remarried.

478
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,960
18 years later,

479
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,000
I discovered you're now

480
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,790
exalted Director
of the Imperial Secretariat.

481
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,770
Yuqing...

482
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,440
Then tell me, how should I explain,

483
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,400
Lu Wenhan?

484
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,720
Lady Lu!

485
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,960
You are?

486
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,100
I'm the stewardess
from the Residence of Duke of the State,

487
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,590
Madam Song's personal attendant.

488
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,240
So you're the nanny of the Song Family.

489
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,430
Now that you're here,

490
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,470
please go inside for tea.

491
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,390
No need.

492
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,350
Brief words suffice.

493
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,350
Lady Lu, your cleverness

494
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,400
surely comprehends

495
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,750
our family's stature.

496
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,830
Mr. Song's marriage prospects
lie with palace nobility

497
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,510
and his grandpa.

498
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
The future bride must be

499
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,590
the capital's elite.

500
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,870
Lady,

501
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,830
please heed

502
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,680
Madam Song's counsel

503
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,790
and distance yourself from Mr. Song.

504
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,350
Or...

505
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,190
Or what?

506
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,900
Your hierarchy obsessions
mean naught here.

507
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,110
But in my eyes,

508
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,000
royals and commoners

509
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,920
share equal dignity.

510
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,550
There is no high or low.

511
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,680
If this is your message,

512
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,270
please leave quickly.

513
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,200
I won't accompany you.

514
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,440
What a sharp-tongued girl.

515
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,720
Lady,

516
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,400
I'll speak plainly today.

517
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,880
Based on your family,

518
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,350
even if your brother
becomes a first-rank official,

519
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,510
your lineage can't match ours.

520
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,590
I hope you know your place.

521
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,270
What if I insist on wedding him?

522
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,640
What will you do?

523
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,310
You...

524
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,160
You shameless!

525
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,070
Who taught you manners?

526
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,030
You were raised by a widow

527
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,350
and have no fathers.

528
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,310
Then let me educate you
for your parents!

529
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,440
Nanny Sun, be careful!

530
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,440
You vile crone.

531
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,880
Go back and tell Song Mingjie.

532
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,720
Lu Wenhan's daughter

533
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,960
could marry royalty!

534
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,440
What's his Song Family?

535
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,790
It doesn't matter!

536
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,670
- Begone!
- Lu Wenhan?

537
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,440
Let's go...

538
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,270
Mingshu, don't be afraid.

539
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,400
I'll resolve all for you.

540
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,480
If you truly desire Song Family's boy,

541
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,270
I'll make him propose

542
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,440
with full rites.

543
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,480
- I...
- No,

544
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,840
she doesn't want to.

545
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,420
Buddy,

546
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,720
this man claims to be Father,

547
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,070
but Father has...

548
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,830
Household affairs demand attention.

549
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,770
Director Lu,
sorry for the inconvenience.

550
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,040
Pardon me.

551
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,430
Lu Chang.

552
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,520
Lu Chang!

553
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,310
(Memorial Tablet of the Late Mr. Lu)

554
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,110
This tragic story began 20 years ago.

555
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,000
At that time,

556
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,480
I was a Xuanzhou embroiderer

557
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,310
fleeing an arranged marriage

558
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,000
and rescued by your father.

559
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,720
Lu Wenhan,

560
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,400
the legitimate son
of the noble Lu Family,

561
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,790
had quarreled with your grandpa

562
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,350
and wandered for years.

563
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,680
You didn't know
his true identity at that time?

564
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,000
He concealed his identity

565
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,200
and married me in Wuhu.

566
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,350
When Lu Chang turned four,

567
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,000
I conceived again.

568
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,960
Soon, Wuhu floods struck.

569
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,110
At that time, he served in Yizhou.

570
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,000
We narrowly

571
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,830
escaped death.

572
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,070
Was the child you carried then me?

573
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,240
(That child was lost.)

574
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,000
(Yet the pretense continued.)

575
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,000
If it wasn't you,

576
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,240
who was it?

577
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,070
Afterward,

578
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,750
I sought Lu Wenhan's traces.

579
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,920
Two years later, I found the Lu Family.

580
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,150
I discovered

581
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,000
his hidden status.

582
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,590
And he already remarried in the capital.

583
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,640
Enraged, I took you to Jianglin

584
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,150
and never

585
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,480
sought him again.

586
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,390
Mother,

587
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,640
since he proved faithless,

588
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,480
let's pretend he never existed.

589
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,070
But that's not entirely fair.

590
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,750
Today I learned from him

591
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:40,200
that he did search for us back then,

592
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,720
but mistakenly believed we had perished.

593
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,240
Then he returned to the Lu Family

594
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,000
upon your grandpa's critical illness

595
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,070
to inherit the estate and fulfill

596
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,160
arranged marriage obligations.

597
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,240
There's neither affection nor resentment

598
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,830
between us anymore.

599
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,790
But you two are different.

600
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,640
Whether to acknowledge him

601
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,440
is your own decision.

602
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,790
I won't interfere.

603
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,200
Starting today,

604
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,830
this memorial tablet

605
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,030
need not remain.

606
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,460
(Memorial Tablet of the Late Mr. Lu)

607
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,350
I was your son before,

608
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,550
and will only be your son hereafter.

609
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,160
Buddy's right.

610
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,200
Why do we live under others' scrutiny?

611
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,590
Let's make our lives flourish.

612
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,110
Look how Buddy has already
achieved prominence,

613
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,000
and I've made Hualang Pavilion thrive.

614
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,510
We'll honor you properly in the future,

615
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,550
never inferior
to any Lu Family matriarch.

616
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,320
Mother's asleep now.

617
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,870
Buddy,

618
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,590
you don't have to be strong

619
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,960
in front of me.

620
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,680
I know you're troubled.

621
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,000
Whatever you need to say,

622
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,590
tell me.

623
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,750
Actually, I always knew

624
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,350
Father wasn't dead.

625
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,590
I just never imagined

626
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,950
he'd become the Director
of the Imperial Secretariat.

627
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,880
So you knew?

628
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,270
When I was four,

629
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,880
though most memories faded,

630
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,590
I clearly recall

631
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,680
Mother taking me

632
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,550
to a grand mansion

633
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,400
seeking Father,

634
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,680
only to be driven out.

635
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,830
Mother tearfully dragged me away,

636
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,590
forbidding me to look back.

637
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,350
All these years,

638
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,790
keeping his tablet

639
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,830
showed Mother's resolve.

640
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,750
I never exposed it,

641
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,920
and she never complained.

642
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,480
But I know her hardships

643
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,070
over the years.

644
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,960
Haven't you suffered too?

645
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,750
Though my memories are gone,

646
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,590
I know you shouldered

647
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,790
family burdens early.

648
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,640
How much hardship

649
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,070
these hands endured,

650
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,920
yet you always

651
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,070
bore it alone.

652
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,350
It pains me too.

653
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,960
So even if he's powerful,

654
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,590
it means nothing to me.

655
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,160
Having you and Mother

656
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,830
suffices.

657
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,280
But you...

658
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,280
What do you think?

659
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,910
I...

660
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,920
Having lost memories,

661
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,920
I can't remember anything from the past.

662
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,750
I feel neither excitement

663
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,510
nor anger

664
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,070
towards him.

665
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,960
I even think

666
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,720
Father shouldn't be like him.

667
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,590
But he...

668
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,350
But then,

669
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,590
what should he be?

670
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,040
Never mind.

671
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,680
You don't have to remember.

672
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,640
So for me,

673
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,000
it's the same.

674
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,030
You and Mother matter most.

675
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,510
Finding Father means nothing.

676
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,830
Today's events came so suddenly.

677
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,240
If...

678
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,550
If more unexpected things occur,

679
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,510
could you bear it?

680
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:17,950
Like what?

681
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,260
(Residence of Duke of the State)

682
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,480
How did I tell you?

683
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,110
This Lu Wenhan

684
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,150
has been domineering
since the capital days.

685
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,030
Decades in office

686
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,280
made him crafty.

687
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,670
Even Father used

688
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,320
to call him "Brother Lu".

689
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,150
Why provoke him?

690
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,550
How was I to know

691
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
the Lu siblings

692
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,400
were his lost children?

693
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,190
Even so,

694
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,400
even if Lu Mingshu

695
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,150
became powerful,

696
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,550
her common origin

697
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,280
remains.

698
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,680
Listen...

699
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,590
Such talk stays

700
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,880
within the household.

701
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,510
Never repeat it outside.

702
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,390
I think

703
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,070
you should take Nanny Sun

704
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,800
to their residence and apologize.

705
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,110
I...

706
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,710
If an apology's needed, it's to Mingshu!

707
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,720
Mother,

708
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,520
you send a servant to humiliate Mingshu

709
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,550
with power.

710
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,440
Is this Duke's matriarch conduct?

711
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,280
You dare scold me

712
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,440
for that wench?

713
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,630
This doesn't concern you!

714
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,110
The wronged is Mingshu,

715
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,510
regardless of being

716
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,450
the Director's daughter.

717
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,920
She's kind and proper,

718
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,360
deserving respect.

719
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,360
If you harm her again,

720
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,320
I'll never forgive.

721
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,920
Stop!

722
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,000
What's so special about Lu Mingshu

723
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,510
that makes you talk to me like that?

724
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,280
Look at him!

725
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,140
What am I looking at?

726
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,110
You spoiled him!

727
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,440
Returning to the matter,

728
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,680
Lu Wenhan's position

729
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,030
stands

730
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,030
right there.

731
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,510
Since Lady Lu is his daughter,

732
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,360
what can we say?

733
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,800
Consider

734
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,320
apologizing properly.

735
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,510
How can you shift your stance?

736
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,800
Director or not,

737
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,840
I'll never accept that wild girl

738
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,670
as my daughter-in-law!

739
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,640
Mark my words,

740
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,280
this house holds either her or me!

741
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,510
Qingmei!

742
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,110
Qingmei...

743
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,550
Hurry up.

744
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,960
Pack my things.

745
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,960
Go and pack my things.

746
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,400
I can't stay here another moment!

747
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,760
Director!

748
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,720
Director,

749
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,070
please wait.

750
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,630
What is it, Deputy Censor Song?

751
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,720
Director Lu,

752
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,190
regarding my servant's offense

753
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,480
against your daughter,

754
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,440
I've been informed.

755
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,110
My wife and I

756
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,590
were truly unaware.

757
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,960
Sorry for the offense.

758
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,230
By the way, the offending servant
has been disciplined.

759
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,280
I beg your forgiveness.

760
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,070
Please don't take

761
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,200
this matter seriously.

762
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Deputy Censor Song,

763
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,510
instead of apologizing,

764
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,920
better discipline your household.

765
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,880
My precious

766
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,840
will be prepared by myself.

767
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,880
Why do I need your interference?

768
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,800
Farewell.

769
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,390
I...

770
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,240
Everyone,

771
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,320
remember decorum

772
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,440
before His Majesty.

773
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,360
Don't be rude.

774
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,030
May Your Majesty
enjoy boundless blessings!

775
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,440
Long live the Emperor!

776
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,920
You represent

777
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,550
our Da'an Dynasty's future pillars.

778
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,160
No formalities are required.

779
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,240
Rise.

780
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

781
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,070
Ancient wisdom says

782
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,480
law is

783
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,360
a public instrument

784
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,710
requiring the utmost care.

785
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,840
Our institutions

786
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,710
value discernment

787
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,670
and justice for the benefit
of the country

788
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,590
and the people.

789
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,360
Therefore, I'd like to ask you all,

790
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,510
should old cases

791
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,440
uphold original verdicts

792
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,000
or be reopened?

793
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,190
Candidates may speak freely.

794
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,630
No law remains immutable.

795
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,950
Judgments

796
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,320
must adapt to circumstances.

797
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,280
Maintaining doubtful verdicts

798
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,760
risks unredressed injustices.

799
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,480
Retrials rectify errors
and warn posterity.

800
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,280
Strict law enforcement

801
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,960
and legal justice

802
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,760
ensure public trust.

803
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,320
Well said.

804
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,160
Not bad.

805
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
That makes sense.

806
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,240
Good.

807
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,800
It's a good word for public trust.

808
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,480
Official negligence

809
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,800
or framed innocents

810
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,590
disrupts social order.

811
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,760
Can society be peaceful?

812
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,640
So

813
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,030
your argument about evolving laws

814
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,920
aligns with governance principles.

815
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,550
Good.

816
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,680
Great!

817
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,030
My pleasure, Your Majesty.

818
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,800
Your Majesty,

819
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,280
during my travels,

820
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,920
I've observed

821
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,400
some wrongful convictions.

822
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,400
Special retrial mechanisms

823
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,400
with thorough considerations

824
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,150
and strict enforcement, coupled
with diligent review,

825
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:57,990
can ensure

826
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,880
lasting stability.

827
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,840
I concur with Candidate Song

828
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,880
and propose

829
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,070
three measures.

830
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,960
First, open petition channels

831
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,880
for grievances.

832
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,470
Second,
severely punish false accusations

833
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,550
according to the Da'an Codex

834
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,960
to avoid imitators.

835
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,910
Third, refine legal codes

836
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,960
and discipline

837
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,360
judicial officers.

838
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,070
Thus injustice diminishes.

839
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:23,950
Since the law is

840
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,550
a public instrument,

841
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,190
righteous judgments

842
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,720
manifest

843
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,760
Your Majesty's benevolence

844
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,050
and strengthen the foundations.

845
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,670
Having heard your arguments,

846
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,280
I'll announce the top three.

847
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,880
The imperial examination's top scholar

848
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,150
is...

849
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,030
What's happening?

850
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,440
Today's

851
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,840
the top three's parade!

852
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,230
Half the city,
whether they're dignitaries

853
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,480
or just ordinary people,

854
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,510
will be out to see the top scholar.

855
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,320
I must prepare Buddy
with powder and flowers.

856
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,280
Let's get dressed.

857
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,600
I...

858
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,960
All gentlemen wear cosmetics these days.

859
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,360
Buddy, you can't lag.

860
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,200
Don't move!

861
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,150
Hold still.

862
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,600
All right.

863
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,840
Forgot the lip rouge.

864
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,360
This won't be necessary.

865
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,510
It smells so fragrant.

866
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,630
Don't move.

867
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,840
You'll smudge it.

868
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,800
Buddy, you really have rosy lips
and white teeth.

869
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,440
You're pretty as a picture.

870
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,510
Buddy!

871
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,320
One last step.

872
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,070
Perfect.
