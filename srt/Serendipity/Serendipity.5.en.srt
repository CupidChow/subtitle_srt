00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,000
Why is this pillow so hard?

29
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,640
Who has such a long neck,

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,350
sleeping on such a high pillow?

31
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,270
The Yin Family...

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,920
Yin Shujun's indeed arrogant and domineering.

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,640
I still think this is strange.

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,790
It seems I have to take the initiative.

35
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,500
(Ya House)

36
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,710
I got it wrong.

37
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,150
Brother,

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,310
you freak me out.

39
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,590
What are you doing here?

40
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,720
You...

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,400
How did you get in here?

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,870
You opened the door without asking

43
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,790
and didn't close the window before sleep.

44
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,960
You're so ignorant of prevention.

45
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,870
How can I and our mother feel at ease?

46
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,520
You came in from the window.

47
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,910
Then who is knocking at the door?

48
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,030
Open the door.

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,280
Didn't you just say

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,800
I can't open the door without asking?

51
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,030
I'm here.

52
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,120
It's me, Lady Mingshu.

53
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,270
Mr. Song.

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,150
It's really you.

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,390
How come you are here?

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,690
I also came to the Yin Residence.

57
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,960
I just wanted to come see you.

58
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,520
She's so happy.

59
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,470
For the next period of time,

60
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,890
I will stay at the Yin Residence.

61
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,680
Did you come here to be a reading lady

62
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,240
because you lack money to open a shop?

63
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,550
That's right.

64
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,710
You have found a shop?

65
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,590
What are the size and location?

66
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,470
Do you need me to look for another one?

67
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,400
It's a coincidence.

68
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,800
That day we ran into Chenxin

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,430
on the street.

70
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,910
I drew a pattern for her.

71
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,960
Just then a shopkeeper saw it.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,290
He had to return to his hometown,

73
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,750
so he transferred the shop to me.

74
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,920
That's very good.

75
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,910
You also know about her opening a shop?

76
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,960
She has mentioned it to me.

77
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,150
She has talent and will surely succeed.

78
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,430
It seems that only I, as her brother,

79
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,280
am unaware of this.

80
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,840
It's just a coincidence.

81
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,270
I wouldn't hide anything from you.

82
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,510
I know you love me.

83
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,430
I really like jewelry.

84
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,390
The more I understand,

85
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,250
the more it helps

86
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:27,174
with the recovery from amnesia.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,920
(Amnesia?)

88
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,070
I don't want to rely only on you.

89
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,920
I also want to have my own career

90
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,510
and do what I love.

91
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,160
Moreover, our mother has already agreed.

92
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,120
You're such a reasonable person.

93
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,630
I don't think you would refuse, right?

94
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,630
Since you say that,

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,120
if I don't agree,

96
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,260
it will make me seem unreasonable.

97
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,510
You are the best.

98
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,870
Business is business.

99
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,680
Being a reading lady is a different matter.

100
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,510
Mr. Lu is right.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,920
Although I'm happy that you can stay here,

102
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,680
that Lady Shujun

103
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,120
seems difficult to get along with.

104
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,650
It's better not to do this job.

105
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,750
I can lend you the money to open the shop.

106
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,000
Stop it!

107
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,040
I have already made up my mind.

108
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,600
The Madam has already said,

109
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,430
if I can find the crux of Lady Shujun's

110
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,800
change in temperament,

111
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,560
there's a extra reward.

112
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,870
How could I miss such a good opportunity?

113
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,190
Besides, aren't you also here?

114
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,360
I have to say this first.

115
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,040
If she bullies you,

116
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,600
I will take you away at any time.

117
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,480
Am I someone who can be bullied?

118
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,430
Moreover, after class tomorrow,

119
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,430
I also want to borrow your name

120
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,480
to show a bit.

121
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,240
Last night I dreamed of my father.

122
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,830
Since he died in battle ten years ago,

123
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,720
I haven't dreamed of him for a long time.

124
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,830
Don't be sad, Liangjun.

125
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,360
The achievements of the second uncle

126
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,800
will be remembered by everyone.

127
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,560
(Liangjun's parents are both deceased.)

128
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,330
(Xianjun's father is addicted to alchemy)

129
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,330
(and ignores everything.)

130
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,440
(Since the option for arranged marriages,)

131
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,480
(Shujun's personality has changed much,)

132
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,630
(frequently causing trouble.)

133
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,800
(Have the other two ladies)

134
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,680
(ever thought about taking her place?)

135
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,070
Your wrists are so slender.

136
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,460
Wearing this bracelet

137
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:46,684
makes it even more exquisite.

138
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,480
This is newly made by Auntie.

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,430
Shujun thinks it's too heavy.

140
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,480
Liangjun thinks gold and silver are vulgar.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,680
So Auntie gave it to me.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,120
I quite like it.

143
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,310
It's very suitable for you.

144
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,960
Lu Mingshu,

145
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,680
whose reading lady are you?

146
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,720
You go back first.

147
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,150
Bro...

148
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,670
Who are you?

149
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,070
How dare you trespass here!

150
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,800
These two are Mr. Lu and Mr. Song.

151
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,720
The Master has given instructions,

152
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,920
from today onwards,

153
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,830
Mr. Lu will temporarily teach literature,

154
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,600
while Mr. Song'll teach you to play the Qin.

155
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,630
Mr. Lu, I'll teach the Qin in the next class.

156
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,870
I have nothing to do,

157
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:08,706
so I will stay here to listen to your class.

158
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,470
Okay.

159
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,450
Isn't that Mr. Song

160
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:13,786
from the Duke of the State?

161
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,360
The cousin of Prince Rui.

162
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,070
He actually came in person to teach us.

163
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,070
Liangjun, don't be too excited.

164
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,120
How to stay calm?

165
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,680
What a rare opportunity!

166
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,680
And that Mr. Lu as well.

167
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,560
He is also elegant and outstanding.

168
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,630
But he looks somewhat aloof.

169
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,420
(Runwen Study)

170
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,600
We gather fern, which springs up here.

171
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:44,440
Why not return, now ends the year?

172
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,270
A restaurant in the east of the city

173
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,490
has delicious flavors.

174
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,240
How about I treat you and Mr. Lu

175
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
to a meal another day?

176
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,150
Now ends the year?

177
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,080
The poem A Homesick Warrior we learned today

178
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,270
not only has the heroism of soldiers,

179
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
but also the gentle sentiment
of homesickness.

180
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,480
Why not ask Mr. Song

181
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,390
to play the Qin for us?

182
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,700
It will definitely add more charm.

183
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,040
Great!

184
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,630
Great!

185
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,240
One is graceful and handsome, warm as spring,

186
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,100
while the other is steady and poised,

187
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,306
like a jade tree in the wind.

188
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,630
I really don't know which one to look at.

189
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,600
A gentleman of integrity,
polished and refined.

190
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,030
It probably refers to someone like Mr. Lu.

191
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,140
(Poetry, Books, Rites, and Music)

192
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,940
(Runwen Study)

193
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,550
Lady Shujun, please wait a moment.

194
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,030
What is your explanation for this?

195
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,120
I don't want to embarrass you.

196
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,790
But I have always been like this.

197
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,870
If I wrote to you,

198
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,240
wouldn't it be unfair to my previous teacher?

199
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,670
I've heard Grand Tutor Yin and Censor Yin

200
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,430
are strict with their children.

201
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,120
I don't know how they will think

202
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,700
of being disrespectful to teachers.

203
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,750
If you don't submit homework,

204
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,200
I'm afraid you can't go out

205
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,200
during monthly breaks.

206
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,600
During my teaching period,

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,790
I will definitely pay more attention to you

208
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,090
and promptly report

209
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:44,376
your whereabouts to Censor Yin,

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,790
to fulfill the duty of guidance.

211
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,510
You are threatening me?

212
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,960
He has always been a man of his word.

213
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,960
I hope you will think carefully.

214
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,080
What do you want?

215
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,650
Hit you with a ferule three times,

216
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,150
as a punishment.

217
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,110
You sauce!

218
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,680
My Lady,

219
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,240
if he reports to the Master every day,

220
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,320
you'll not have peaceful days

221
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,150
in the future.

222
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,990
Okay.

223
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,750
Then go ahead.

224
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,870
Although you are my student,

225
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,550
you're a woman and I'm a man.

226
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,280
Then

227
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,870
let the reading lady take on the task.

228
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,750
The reading lady has a duty to supervise.

229
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,670
It is more suitable for her to do it.

230
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,120
Lady Shujun.

231
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,000
Ready?

232
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,720
I thought of another way to punish.

233
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,840
I wonder if you would agree.

234
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,150
Lady Shujun

235
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,840
is not focused on studies.

236
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,200
She must be affected by other matters.

237
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,550
I want to check her residence

238
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,550
and clear out all those things

239
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,960
that are detrimental to her studies.

240
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,750
The Madam will definitely agree to it.

241
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,510
Lu Mingshu, do you dare?

242
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,350
I agree.

243
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,270
There is one more thing to inform you.

244
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,120
I am Lady Mingshu's brother.

245
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,720
You are siblings?

246
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,870
So you are taking advantage of it

247
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,830
to deliberately fool me.

248
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,680
You are right.

249
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,840
How you treat my sister

250
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,790
is how I will

251
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,320
treat you.

252
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,750
If you do not accept it,

253
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,630
you can report to Censor Yin at any time.

254
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,840
I may lack power,

255
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,750
but I am very protective.

256
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,750
If anyone dares to disrespect my sister,

257
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,990
I

258
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,910
will certainly not let it go easily.

259
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,680
Shuangyan.

260
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,960
You wait outside first.

261
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,480
Lady Shujun, your room is truly

262
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,550
magnificent and splendid.

263
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,270
You really never see the world.

264
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,630
Are you taking advantage of your brother

265
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,360
to broaden your horizons at my place?

266
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,320
You guessed right.

267
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,480
I just want to see

268
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,960
what the boudoir of a young lady is like.

269
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,740
(The Book of Songs)

270
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,600
Who told you to touch it?

271
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,720
So what if I touch it?

272
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,790
If you don't want to, go ask the Madam.

273
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,240
Let's see what she will say.

274
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,350
You...!

275
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,180
(Shujun)

276
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,510
This seal must belong to you, right?

277
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,350
Handwritten by you?

278
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,240
If you break my stuff,

279
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,270
I guarantee that no one can save you.

280
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,560
Greetings, Madam.

281
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,870
What a refined embroidery!

282
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,320
Who is this mandarin duck embroidered for?

283
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,030
Why not let the Madam know?

284
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,080
Give it to me!

285
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,250
Tell me first who it's embroidered for.

286
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,670
Why should I tell you?

287
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,020
If you don't, then let me keep it.

288
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,240
I...

289
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,390
Give it to me!

290
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,360
I won't.

291
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,390
I told you to tell me.

292
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,240
Why are they fighting?

293
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,150
Why should I tell you?

294
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,550
- Give it back.
- Tell me.

295
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,480
Why are you fighting?

296
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,620
You...

297
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,030
- I won't.
- Give it back to me!

298
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,240
- Tell me.
- They're fighting.

299
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,480
- Tell the Madam?
- Don't go too far.

300
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,870
- Not yet.
- Lady Shujun.

301
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,510
- Why are you so angry?
- Lu Mingshu!

302
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,800
Give it to me, Lu Mingshu!

303
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,920
Lady Shujun, please tell me.

304
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,000
Give it back to me!

305
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,550
Alright, alright, alright.

306
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm done with the fuss today.

307
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,080
I'm tired.

308
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,200
Here you are.

309
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,630
Get lost!

310
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,910
Go, hurry up,

311
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,870
Lu Mingshu,

312
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,480
how dare you act like this today.

313
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,610
No one can keep you here.

314
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,240
You always say

315
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,840
the same clichés,

316
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,200
like asking me to get out of here.

317
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,200
I've heard enough.

318
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,440
Can you say something different?

319
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,030
You put in a lot of effort to pretend.

320
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,120
Are you tired?

321
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,870
What did you say?

322
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,240
The details here can't deceive anyone.

323
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,140
Lady Shujun,

324
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:51,164
your calligraphy and painting are impressive

325
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,510
and have quite a study on the Book of Songs.

326
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,510
But you always go against the teacher.

327
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,960
If you don't pretend, what is it?

328
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,000
What's wrong with that?

329
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,550
I am very happy to see the teacher angry.

330
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,440
I want everyone to fear me.

331
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,080
Lu Mingshu,

332
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,880
don't you want a reward?

333
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,110
You wish!

334
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,240
I will definitely drive you out.

335
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,030
Wishful thinking.

336
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,030
You are about to marry the Prince Rui.

337
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,400
Do you think the Madam will let you go?

338
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,960
Without me, there are still others.

339
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,200
You better coexist peacefully with me

340
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,310
and live in harmony until you get engaged.

341
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,110
In your dream.

342
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,350
That's fine.

343
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,070
Let's continue the fight like this.

344
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,240
You keep putting obstacles in my way.

345
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,410
My brother and I

346
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:44,934
will pay you back in kind.

347
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,030
This day will definitely be amazing

348
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,400
and absolutely wonderful.

349
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,350
You!

350
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,590
I'll have the tea.

351
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,430
I'm leaving now.

352
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,310
(Zhongrui House)

353
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,150
Lu Mingshu,

354
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,720
you will pay for what

355
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,680
you've done today.

356
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,430
My Lady.

357
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,880
Nanny, this is specially made for you.

358
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
- You can share the rest.
- So beautiful!

359
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,240
I made all of them by hand.

360
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
- Mingshu, you are so skillful.
- Take a look.

361
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,440
If you have any jewelry that needs repair,

362
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,440
you can come to me.

363
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,240
I guarantee it will look better than before.

364
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,110
Really?

365
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,200
I'll open a jewelry shop

366
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,510
in a while.

367
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,720
If you are free,

368
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,830
you can come and support me.

369
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,200
- Sure.
- Sure.

370
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,830
I would like to ask you

371
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,790
for a favor.

372
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,680
Just say it.

373
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,240
Lady Mingshu, just feel free to tell us.

374
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,240
I have heard some rumors about Lady Shujun.

375
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,160
As her reading lady,

376
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,440
I want to know something,

377
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
so I can get prepared.

378
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,830
Listen to me,

379
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,550
Lady Shujun used to have a cat,

380
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,640
but later I don't know why it died.

381
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,880
Have you seen anything?

382
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,870
Mother.

383
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
For Mingshu?

384
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,520
Right.

385
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,640
The pillow there is a bit high.

386
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,920
I think she isn't used to sleeping on it.

387
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,750
She probably won't be back for a while.

388
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,160
Bring her more clothes.

389
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:08,990
I've already taken them.

390
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,640
When I heard

391
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,400
she wants to open a jewelry shop,

392
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,880
I was also surprised.

393
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,350
Even if she forgot herself,

394
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,960
she never forgot her love for jewelry.

395
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,880
I think she opened a shop

396
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,160
not simply to make some money,

397
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,440
but also to gradually find herself again.

398
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,720
I used to think

399
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,480
she was just a pretty smart delicate lady,

400
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,720
but it seems now

401
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,160
she has her own realm in her heart,

402
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,400
much wider than I thought.

403
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,640
You didn't understand her at all before.

404
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,640
You always avoided her.

405
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,510
She is such a good child

406
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,400
all the time.

407
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,590
I'm leaving, mother.

408
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,580
(Residence of Duke of the State)

409
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,580
(Xu Ruoyi)

410
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,100
(Song Mingjie)

411
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,900
(Auspicious and Elegant)

412
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,270
I had already told you

413
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,920
to come back early.

414
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,250
Mr. Fang specially came here

415
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,610
to give you guidance on discourse.

416
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,030
What a rare opportunity!

417
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,640
Why didn't you come back?

418
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,140
I know my mistake, Father.

419
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,030
I ask you to punish me.

420
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,160
Don't get yourself worked up.

421
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,960
I only have you as my son.

422
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,350
The future glory of our family

423
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,680
relies on you.

424
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,060
The exam is coming soon.

425
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,130
But you have been neglecting your studies.

426
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,980
Are you being true

427
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,440
to your ancestors by doing this?

428
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,880
I remember your teachings.

429
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,720
Yesterday,

430
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,440
I helped the cousin with something.

431
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,040
I hope you can be forgiving.

432
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,590
Prince Rui?

433
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,830
You are working for Prince Rui.

434
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,480
I should be supportive.

435
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,840
But

436
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,930
the spring exam is approaching,

437
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,400
do not neglect your studies.

438
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,960
Father, rest assured.

439
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,200
I do not dare to have any slackness.

440
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,920
Return home before the hour of You.

441
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:24,946
This is a family rule.

442
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,590
You have violated the family rule.

443
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
What should you do?

444
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,180
I will kneel in the ancestral hall

445
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:30,786
for an hour

446
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,720
and repent to the ancestors.

447
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,790
However, the matter of Prince Rui

448
00:21:34,814 --> 00:21:35,926
concerns the Yin Family.

449
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,240
After I finish kneeling,

450
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,590
I may still have to leave.

451
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,640
If necessary, I will stay overnight there.

452
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,160
Please approve it.

453
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,110
No next time.

454
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,830
Thank you, father.

455
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,910
Sir.

456
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,720
Slow down.

457
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,720
Here.

458
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,440
Calm down.

459
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,760
You

460
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,270
are being too harsh on Qingzhao.

461
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,590
No matter how minor his mistake is,

462
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:22,176
you punish him severely without mercy.

463
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,790
If you don't care, I care.

464
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,750
Confucius said,

465
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,000
less is nature,

466
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,160
habit is like nature.

467
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,240
We must never slack off

468
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,510
in educating children.

469
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,310
Besides, you and I only have one son.

470
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,680
Not even a bit...

471
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,030
not even the slightest mistake.

472
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,000
Look at him now.

473
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,450
He is successful in his studies,

474
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,200
dignified and generous.

475
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,830
Isn't this my achievement?

476
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,830
If you could just praise him in person,

477
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,920
I'm not that difficult to deal with.

478
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,320
Sir...

479
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
Sir, are you okay?

480
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,720
It's just kneeling for an hour.

481
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,760
It's okay.

482
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,750
You know the Master is strict,

483
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,240
yet you still came back late

484
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
and get punished.

485
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,830
Is it worth it?

486
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,630
You don't understand.

487
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,880
Who knows

488
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,070
it's for Prince Rui

489
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,030
or for Lady Lu?

490
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,310
Of course I am wholeheartedly

491
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,070
working for my cousin.

492
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,950
It's so dirty.

493
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,950
Take it.

494
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,910
Yes.

495
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,070
Then let's throw it out.

496
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,240
Such a small cat doesn't eat or drink.

497
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,720
It will starve to death.

498
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,480
Keep it.

499
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,270
Don't you dislike cats?

500
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,070
Recently, my grandfather has been bedridden.

501
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,640
I'll consider it as doing good deeds.

502
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,920
Take good care of it.

503
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,310
Don't let it bother me.

504
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,680
What do you want, Mother?

505
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,040
Shujun,

506
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,860
the day after tomorrow, Noble Consort Hua

507
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:38,940
will send someone to arrange

508
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,290
a marriage for you with Prince Rui.

509
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,440
Before this,

510
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,000
don't make any trouble.

511
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,790
A marriage alliance is so important.

512
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,550
Why does it have to fall on me?

513
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,920
What nonsense?

514
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,510
Have you ever asked for my opinion?

515
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,640
How did you know I wanted to marry him?

516
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,550
Marriage is a matter

517
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,830
decided by the parents.

518
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,160
Plus, you're the legitimate eldest daughter,

519
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,550
in any aspect of consideration,

520
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,030
you cannot avoid it.

521
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,830
In the capital,

522
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,640
except the princesses,

523
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,160
which lady can compare to you?

524
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,160
You are meant to be someone extraordinary.

525
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,440
Marrying into the royal family

526
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:17,726
is your best destination.

527
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,590
Alright.

528
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,440
Let the past be the past.

529
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,160
As long as you're willing to change,

530
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,550
it's not too late for everything.

531
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,920
I really don't care about it.

532
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,170
Do you really want to force me like this?

533
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,110
We're not forcing you.

534
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,160
This is for your own good.

535
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,720
You...

536
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,150
My Lady,

537
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,000
the marriage alliance can't be changed.

538
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,000
You have let go of some things.

539
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,720
Who says it cannot be changed?

540
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,960
Things depend on human effort.

541
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,550
You deliver this thing to my third uncle.

542
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,750
Also, bring back some things for me.

543
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,660
(Runwen Study)

544
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,720
Mr. Song,

545
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,790
what a wonderful skill!

546
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,880
In tomorrow's class,

547
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,000
those ladies will surely be captivated again.

548
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,270
Thank you for praising me.

549
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:50,950
Lady Mingshu,

550
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,440
do you want to play?

551
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,310
I should be

552
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,640
unable to play.

553
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,560
I forgot many things

554
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:03,884
due to amnesia.

555
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,880
I remember you mentioning this before.

556
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,440
I dare not ask much.

557
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,640
What is going on?

558
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,960
It's no big deal.

559
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,490
Caused by falling off a cliff.

560
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,840
Life is not affected.

561
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
If you have ever learnt,

562
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,480
the skills you have learned

563
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,000
will naturally be remembered.

564
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Give it a try.

565
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,900
(Runwen Study)

566
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,440
(It's Phoenix Seeking His Mate.)

567
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,960
The fingering is wrong here.

568
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,510
It's the seventh zhi six points, not eight.

569
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,030
Brother,

570
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,680
I always make mistakes when I play the Qin.

571
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,920
I wonder if you could give me some guidance.

572
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,160
I will play it for you.

573
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,860
(Phoenix Seeking His Mate)

574
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,240
It's always wrong right here.

575
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,200
I don't know where the problem lies.

576
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,070
I'm not very familiar with this piece either.

577
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,190
Sorry,

578
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,350
I can't teach you.

579
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,000
(It turns out she was sincerely)

580
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,346
(seeking my advice at that time,)

581
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,440
(but I misunderstood her.)

582
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,420
(Runwen Study)

583
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,990
If you want to learn the Qin,

584
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,510
I can teach you too.

585
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,080
Brother.

586
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,480
Brother.

587
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,980
Mr. Lu, don't be anxious.

588
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,770
Lady Mingshu understands immediately.

589
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,290
Maybe she has already figured it out.

590
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,310
Yeah, brother,

591
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,440
you go about your business.

592
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,750
Mr. Song teaches ME very well.

593
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,160
I can learn from him.

594
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,080
Take a break.

595
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,950
I have something to tell you.

596
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,550
Sorry to disturb you.

597
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,310
Isn't this my pillow?

598
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,200
(Runwen Study)
I brought it specially for you.

599
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,790
You are so considerate, brother.

600
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,720
Brother,

601
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,240
is this a blessing of being your sister?

602
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,030
Which lady will be so fortunate

603
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,960
to marry you

604
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,070
in the future?

605
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,220
Stop. Or give it back to me.

606
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,220
- Pure water produces lotus flowers.
- This is for me.

607
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,510
Natural and unadorned.

608
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,640
Mr. Lu has such a sister,

609
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,920
truly enviable to others.

610
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,660
(Harmony with Light and Dust)

611
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,520
By the way, brother,

612
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,400
what brings you to me today?

613
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,640
Did you find anything

614
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,840
at Lady Shujun's place today?

615
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,350
How to put it?

616
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,850
Lady Shujun is skilled

617
00:31:33,874 --> 00:31:35,156
in literature and painting.

618
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,350
She is also good at embroidery.

619
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,100
She must be carefully raised

620
00:31:39,124 --> 00:31:40,096
by the Yin Family.

621
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,030
I really can't understand

622
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,650
why her temperament would suddenly change.

623
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,240
Embroidery?

624
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,230
I also heard

625
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:50,154
she won't go to the Runwen Study tomorrow,

626
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,330
to meet a distinguished guest.

627
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,320
Brother,

628
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,790
I didn't expect I could play the Qin.

629
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,110
Did you teach me before?

630
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,750
At that time, you really

631
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,880
enjoyed listening to me play the Qin.

632
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,070
If you want to learn again,

633
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,990
I will definitely teach you well.

634
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,160
- Only I can teach you.
- I...

635
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,820
(Baopu House)

636
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,070
What brings you here, Shuangyan?

637
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,790
My lady has just received

638
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,400
this excellent pear incense

639
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,110
and asked me to bring it here.

640
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,030
The master is currently alchemizing.

641
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,000
He doesn't see anyone.

642
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,840
Leave it to me.

643
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,110
(Shuangyan)
This incense is very precious.

644
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,470
Please make sure to keep it safe.

645
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,670
Yes.

646
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,240
My Lady,

647
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,400
are you sure about this?

648
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,800
Once this proposal falls into

649
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,990
the hands of Imperial Astronomer,

650
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,400
then there will be no turning back.

651
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,720
You know I don't want to marry Prince Rui.

652
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,070
What's there to hesitate about?

653
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,240
If this matter is discovered,

654
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,350
will it bring any trouble?

655
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,680
What trouble could there be?

656
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,520
Here.

657
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,480
My mother

658
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,110
likes to put the most valuable things

659
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,350
on the top of the cabinet by the east door.

660
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,350
You remember it?

661
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,200
Yes, My Lady.

662
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,880
I know what to do.

663
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,240
Go ahead.

664
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:33,060
(Zhongrui House)

665
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,640
Greetings, Noble Eunuch,

666
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,000
Mr. Song.

667
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,240
Noble Consort Hua is concerned about you

668
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,590
and asked me to send her regards to you.

669
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,390
Please make sure to visit the palace

670
00:33:47,414 --> 00:33:48,396
when you have the time.

671
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,290
I'm deeply grateful to her kindness.

672
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,400
I feel immensely honored.

673
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,550
It's just that Her Highness is very busy,

674
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,200
I dare not disturb her carelessly.

675
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,920
I only wish for the marriage to be settled.

676
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,110
I shall certainly go pay my respects to her

677
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,480
and get a glimpse of her grace.

678
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,440
Lady Shujun is generous and courteous.

679
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,360
No wonder Her Highness likes you.

680
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,280
Since we've already met,

681
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,960
I should return to the palace to report.

682
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,080
My daughter's name and birthday

683
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,800
(Lady Yin's Marriage Proposal)
are all recorded inside.

684
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:29,640
Here.

685
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,630
Please wait for good news.

686
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,880
Thank you very much.

687
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,670
Help!

688
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,760
Help!

689
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,840
Help!

690
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,960
Help!

691
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,300
(Huaixiu Pavilion)
Help!

692
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,380
Someone fell into the water.

693
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,960
- Someone fell into the water.
- Oh no!

694
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,800
Come on.

695
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,880
Come on! Help!

696
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,720
No way.

697
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,470
Right over there.

698
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,430
Lady Mingshu.

699
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,200
Mr. Lu.

700
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,840
Mr. Lu, take her back to the room first.

701
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,440
Please pay attention

702
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,580
to whether it is an accident

703
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,710
or a man-made incident.

704
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,870
Understood.

705
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,760
Isn't that the reading lady?

706
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,700
Could it be because

707
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,370
she had a fight with Lady Shujun last time,

708
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,000
and Lady Shujun wanted to punish her

709
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,670
out of anger?

710
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,110
What nonsense are you saying?

711
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,280
Liangjun,

712
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,440
aren't you supposed to be in the class?

713
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,760
I've been feeling unwell recently.

714
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,000
I asked for leave with Mr. Lu.

715
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,110
I feel much better now.

716
00:36:34,134 --> 00:36:35,436
I'm about to go back to class.

717
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,600
But...

718
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,440
Hope Shujun's reading lady

719
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,800
will be alright.

720
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,890
What problem could there be?

721
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,070
It's just an accident.

722
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,910
Mr. Yin,

723
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,440
this concerns the safety of Lady Mingshu.

724
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,980
It's better to investigate it clearly.

725
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,440
Listening to what was just said,

726
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,130
the incident

727
00:36:56,154 --> 00:36:57,826
seems to be related to Lady Shujun.

728
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,550
I have come at the command of Noble Consort

729
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,150
for the purpose of the marriage alliance.

730
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,590
If this matter truly involves Lady Shujun,

731
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,550
it is imperative to investigate it clearly,

732
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,480
to avoid affecting important affairs.

733
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,930
I hope you will handle this matter

734
00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:12,166
with caution.

735
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,440
Sure.

736
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,680
Noble Eunuch,

737
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
you take it seriously.

738
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,880
It's just a misunderstanding.

739
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,150
But please rest assured,

740
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,050
I will make sure

741
00:37:21,174 --> 00:37:22,774
to get to the bottom of this matter,

742
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,840
not to put you in a difficult position.

743
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,590
Since that's the case,

744
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,190
I will not disturb you

745
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,800
taking care of household affairs.

746
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,760
Goodbye.

747
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,860
Yue'er,

748
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,880
go invite a doctor for Lady Mingshu.

749
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,760
Take good care of her.

750
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,910
Yes.

751
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,470
You're awake.

752
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,480
Brother, when I fell into the water,

753
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,360
I remembered some things.

754
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,590
Maybe it was something from the past.

755
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,110
The past?

756
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,440
What is it?

757
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,110
It's...

758
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,960
It seems like you saved me.

759
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,030
I can't remember the specifics.

760
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,110
It's okay. Don't think about it for now.

761
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,280
Have some ginger tea to warm your body.

762
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,550
Here.

763
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,510
Thank you.

764
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,730
I originally thought

765
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:15,526
the Yin Family just had a lot of troubles.

766
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,580
If I had known you nearly risked your life,

767
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,600
I would never agree

768
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,890
to keep you in the Yin Residence.

769
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,150
I just got distracted for a moment,

770
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,360
so I slipped into the lake.

771
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,590
I promise this won't happen again.

772
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,960
You still think of it as an accident?

773
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,720
The bridge surface

774
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,550
was splashed with tung oil.

775
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,960
Tung oil is a lubricant.

776
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,870
If someone accidentally spilled it,

777
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,230
it will definitely be reported

778
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:40,406
and a notice will be posted

779
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,760
to eliminate hidden dangers.

780
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,630
You mean

781
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,030
someone deliberately set me up?

782
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,580
Now that it has come to this,

783
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,980
I will no longer hide it from you.

784
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,800
The purpose of my visit here

785
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,440
is to investigate Lady Shujun's character.

786
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,060
She will be questioned by Censor Yin shortly.

787
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,210
If this matter is indeed caused by her,

788
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,480
I must report to Prince Rui

789
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,860
to dissolve the marriage.

790
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,230
But I don't think it's her.

791
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,920
Today is the day she meets Noble Eunuch.

792
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,880
This concerns the reputation of the family.

793
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,880
How could she not understand it?

794
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,240
It's really not me.

795
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,710
That reading lady

796
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,360
fell into water due to tung oil.

797
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,010
Your mother sent someone

798
00:40:24,134 --> 00:40:25,336
to investigate each courtyard.

799
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,260
Only the tung oil in your uncle's house

800
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,300
is missing.

801
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,440
His courtyard is short of tung oil.

802
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,740
What does it have to do with me?

803
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,190
Before the incident, only Shuangyan

804
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,280
has been to his courtyard.

805
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,480
In the entire residence, only you

806
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
regard the reading lady as an eyesore.

807
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,800
Besides you, who else could it be?

808
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,030
You are preconsciously judging me.

809
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,570
You said it's me without checking.

810
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,190
This matter is not my doing.

811
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,550
I will absolutely not admit to it.

812
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,760
You...!

813
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,680
Shujun,

814
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,730
are you unwilling

815
00:40:54,754 --> 00:40:56,066
to marry into the royal family?

816
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,590
So you deliberately caused this trouble.

817
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,510
I already said it's not me.

818
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,960
Why don't you believe me?

819
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,800
How can I trust you?

820
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,710
When the rumors first started,

821
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,960
I specifically investigated

822
00:41:07,984 --> 00:41:08,756
to clear your name.

823
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,110
But the result really disappointed me.

824
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,800
How did you become like this?

825
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,760
Master, Madam,

826
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,320
please allow me

827
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,710
to say a few words.

828
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:25,950
Go ahead.

829
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,360
May I ask

830
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,380
if anyone has seen with their own eyes

831
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,470
Shuangyan took tung oil

832
00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:31,486
from the Third Master?

833
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,360
No one.

834
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,600
I believe,

835
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,440
catch the thief with the stolen goods.

836
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,590
Shuangyan just went there once.

837
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,170
Whether she really took the tung oil,

838
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,710
neither physical evidence nor witness.

839
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,510
If you want to check,

840
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,070
no one can escape from it.

841
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,360
We cannot let bad people go,

842
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,800
nor can we wrong good people.

843
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,440
Master, Madam,

844
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,630
the tung oil barrel has been found.

845
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,190
Where was it found?

846
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,550
It is

847
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,030
found in Lady Shujun's courtyard.

848
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
How could it be?

849
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,160
You troublemaker!

850
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,670
Now the proof is conclusive.

851
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,150
What else do you have to say?

852
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,510
- I...
- Do you still want to deny it?

853
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,480
Those reckless things you did before

854
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,490
have not yet settled down.

855
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,450
You have become even more excessive now

856
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,530
to endanger someone's life.

857
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,880
Fortunately, Lady Mingshu is safe.

858
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,670
Otherwise, the reputation of the Yin Family

859
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,670
would be ruined by you.

860
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,030
You can't even tell right from wrong.

861
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,570
What's the point of talking about reputation?

862
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,990
You...! You...!

863
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,160
- Sir.
- Master,

864
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,590
please spare Lady Shujun.

865
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,330
I went to the Third Master's place...

866
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,280
Shut up! Don't say that.

867
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,100
No matter what you say,

868
00:42:46,124 --> 00:42:47,106
they won't believe you.

869
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,070
I...

870
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,950
Someone!

871
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,760
Take them to the ancestral hall

872
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,710
to get punished.

873
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:56,870
- Yes.
- Yes.

874
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,800
Lord!

875
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,150
(If Lady Shujun indeed did that.)

876
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,630
(She left the barrel in her own room.)

877
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,760
(Don't you think it's so easy
to be found?)

878
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,870
Madam!

879
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,120
Madam!

880
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,400
Be mindful of your words and actions.

881
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:29,910
Speak.

882
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:30,920
What's the matter?

883
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,110
Lady Shujun's attempt to harm a reading lady

884
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,280
has already been spread out.

885
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,650
Moreover, some storytellers

886
00:43:35,674 --> 00:43:37,174
have turned it into a script.

887
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:44,070
Have you heard about Yin Shujun's

888
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,400
harming the reading lady?

889
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,400
I've sent Qingzhao to investigate.

890
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,490
He said,

891
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,880
no conclusion has been reached.

892
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,360
According to Imperial Astronomer,

893
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,110
there were inauspicious signs

894
00:43:55,234 --> 00:43:56,826
when calculating your eight characters.

895
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,360
In my opinion,

896
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,420
(Noble Consort Hua)

897
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,510
just let it go then.

898
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,590
I marry into the Yin Family

899
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,110
to gain the support of Grand Tutor Yin

900
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,920
and to win over the clean officials.

901
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,960
As for who the marriage partner is,

902
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,800
it doesn't matter.

903
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,800
I know you have lofty ambitions.

904
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,880
To achieve great things,

905
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,640
you must first secure your household.

906
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:27,710
Yin Shujun has a tarnished reputation.

907
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,070
I fear those opponents in the court

908
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,410
will take this opportunity

909
00:44:32,434 --> 00:44:33,596
to criticize you harshly.

910
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,550
In my opinion,

911
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,190
this matter is not that difficult.

912
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,550
The Yin Family has more than one daughter.
