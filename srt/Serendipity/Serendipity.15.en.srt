Mingshu.

29
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,280
Let me help you.

30
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,680
Thanks, but no need.

31
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,040
It's almost recovered.

32
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,920
I was looking for you.

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,840
Mr. Lu told me
everything.

34
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,710
Don't be mad.

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,030
He didn't mean to
upset you.

36
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,150
I have your favorite
ring cakes.

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,680
They're fresh,

38
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,750
crispy but not sweet.

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,960
Have a try.

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,680
Mingshu,

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,800
- don't be sad.
- Qingzhao,

42
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,080
buddy has gone
way too far.

43
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,240
I am his sister

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,560
but he deceived me.

45
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,310
I feel like we're
quite apart.

46
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,630
He's close to

47
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,280
none but you

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,680
for you're his sister.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,710
You two are the closest.

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,030
What upsets me

51
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,150
is that

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,430
he went over to

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
the girl who

54
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
addressed him sweetly.

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,280
He didn't'
tell me everything.

56
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sure he did so

57
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,630
with a purpose.

58
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,800
Mingshu,

59
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,150
think about this.

60
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,470
If you were the first

61
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,630
to find
Tang Sheng's identity,

62
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,750
would you tell Wen'an

63
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,400
or conceal it for the girl?

64
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,520
Since I promised County Princess Wen'an,

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,280
I wouldn't lie to her.

66
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,430
But the girl is
Mr. Su's daughter.

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,120
Having suffered
misfortunes,

68
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,430
she's very pathetic.

69
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,030
I certainly need to
think for her.

70
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,360
In that case,

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,590
with Mr. Lu's concealment,

72
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,030
you could avoid
lots of trouble.

73
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,280
He must have
considered you.

74
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,430
Then he should

75
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,120
have told me.

76
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,070
Look at you,

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,190
you got food
over your mouth.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,840
Uh,

79
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,070
I can do it.

80
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,040
Don't just eat.

81
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,800
Have some tea.

82
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,670
Mr. Lu,

83
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,230
I should go.

84
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,790
Thank you.

85
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,740
(Huantao Study)

86
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,830
Do you think

87
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,040
Mr. Lu is vigilant

88
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,920
whenever I'm
with Mingshu?

89
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,120
Worse than that.

90
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,160
He wishes to stand

91
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,560
in the middle
of you two.

92
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,160
What did I do to make him

93
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,310
so wary of me?

94
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,160
You're impeccable.

95
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,000
But Mr. Lu

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,360
is Miss Lu's brother.

97
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,030
Think about it.

98
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,430
If you have a sister,

99
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
will you be wary of

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,310
the men approaching her?

101
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,160
So you're saying

102
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,510
it's abrupt of me

103
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,510
since I get close to

104
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,510
Lady Mingshu.

105
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,120
I should take Mr. Lu

106
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,480
into more consideration.

107
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,710
Right.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,240
If you wanna
chase Lady Lu,

109
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,600
pass her brother's
test first.

110
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,960
Get out.

111
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,360
Go.

112
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,430
- She's my mentor's girl.
- Fine,

113
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,310
I'm done talking to you.

114
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,870
I need time
for solutions.

115
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,680
I apologize to you.

116
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,240
If I report to County Princess Wen'an,

117
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,120
can you promise
you won't be mad?

118
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,910
Tell me.

119
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,310
I knew you'll defend her.

120
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,350
I'm wrong.

121
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,270
Don't be mad, okay?

122
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,400
Mingshu.

123
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,350
Xie Xi,

124
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
you always

125
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,680
say I'm the only girl

126
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,630
you care about.

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,480
If so,

128
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,310
why will you
marry County Princess Wen'an?

129
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,360
If you

130
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,480
break off the engagement,

131
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
then county princess

132
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,720
will let us off.

133
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,310
I wish to do that

134
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,630
and be with you.

135
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,240
But now

136
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,430
I haven't become
the rightful heir.

137
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,800
For the sake
of our future,

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,840
you'll have to wait.

139
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,070
For how long?

140
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,560
It won't be long.

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,510
If I achieve
the first place

142
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,390
and become
the rightful heir,

143
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,480
I'll break off
the engagement.

144
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,070
Even if I can't,

145
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,080
at least,

146
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,360
you can become
my consort.

147
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,480
But she won't
stop investigating.

148
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,240
What are you gonna do?

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,840
Don't worry.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,870
I'll talk to her.

151
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,750
If she doesn't accept,

152
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,440
we can break off
the engagement.

153
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,070
Don't break your word.

154
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,470
Don't worry.

155
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,160
I never lie to you.

156
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,110
Mingshu,

157
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,750
are you still mad?

158
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,670
Go have a rest, Mr. Lu.

159
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,550
Mingshu,

160
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,910
I'm wrong.

161
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,320
Any movement
in the residence?

162
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,720
Her Highness
has constantly

163
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,000
connected with
the clan members.

164
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,390
I'm afraid
they've made plans.

165
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,870
The reason is obvious.

166
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,480
My brother's mother
has done all this

167
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,720
to help her son ascend to

168
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,670
the throne
of crown prince.

169
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,750
Master,

170
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,390
that's not good.

171
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,510
The Master shows favor
to your brother

172
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,390
and intends to
make him the heir.

173
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,680
Now even

174
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,630
Her Highness helps
resolve the conflict.

175
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,320
She stole
my mum's position

176
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,150
and always picks on me.

177
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,120
Now she even helps
her son

178
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,630
to steal the throne.

179
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,390
That's too much of her.

180
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,960
Things are still in flux.

181
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,270
We still have a chance.

182
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,550
When you become
the rightful heir,

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,080
there will be
no room for them.

184
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,390
You're right.

185
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,150
I must inherit the throne
of crown prince.

186
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,240
Or I'll end up dead.

187
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,630
I must rely on County Princess Wen'an

188
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,150
in order to become
the crown prince.

189
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,000
This wedding

190
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,360
must be held.

191
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,140
(Mingli Hall)

192
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,840
(Cultivate virtue and develop talents)

193
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,680
Mr. Lu,

194
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
Mr. Lu.

195
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,350
Mr. Song,

196
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,350
what's the matter?

197
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,560
This pen

198
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,440
is for you.

199
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,440
It's the top-notch pen,

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,880
best choice for
small regular script.

201
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,120
But I prefer
running script.

202
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,510
This pen doesn't match

203
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,630
my writing style.

204
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,240
I appreciate
your kindness.

205
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,790
Please take it back.

206
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,550
Don't waste the pen.

207
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,790
Mr. Lu prefers
running script though,

208
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,360
we write in
small regular script

209
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,910
in the academy.

210
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,790
You'll use the pen
some day.

211
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,510
It's not a waste if you

212
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,480
have a chance to use it.

213
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,790
Don't reject me.

214
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,030
Or you'll miss
a good pen.

215
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,120
I have an errand to run.

216
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,680
I should go.

217
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,440
Mingshu.

218
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,240
Shujun,

219
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,150
why are you here?

220
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,710
County Princess.

221
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,480
Take a seat.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,320
Why do you
suddenly come here?

223
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,230
Mingshu,

224
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,960
it's been a while
since you came here.

225
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,000
Have you got
any clues?

226
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,750
(If I tell her the truth,)

227
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,630
(I'll hurt Su Tangli.)

228
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,670
(If I don't,)

229
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,240
(I'll betray
Wen'an's trust.)

230
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,750
Xie Xi must have
found something.

231
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,720
He's getting
more prudent.

232
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
I haven't...

233
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,560
Never mind.

234
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,390
Since I'm here,

235
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,630
I'll go find Xie Xi.

236
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,810
Let me show you around.

237
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,320
Why isn't he here yet?

238
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,480
Master is really
too busy to come.

239
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,390
In order to
be with you forever,

240
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,030
he has to send you
out of the capital

241
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,160
to lay low for a while.

242
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,510
He said he'd
talk to county princess.

243
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,200
But now he wants
to send me out.

244
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,750
I won't be at his mercy.

245
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,790
You can't go.

246
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,780
County Princess's still there.

247
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,870
Tang Sheng.

248
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,350
Be careful.

249
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,280
Wait.

250
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,870
Your rope is loose.

251
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,630
It's windy.

252
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,000
If you catch a cold,

253
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,510
it'll upset me.

254
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,960
Full of slick words.

255
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,280
What?

256
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,320
Walk me to the carriage.

257
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,470
Okay.

258
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,920
You alright?

259
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,630
- Yeah.
- You're so careless.

260
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
Get down.

261
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,680
Never mind.

262
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,280
Let's go.

263
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,800
What's wrong?

264
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,710
Nothing.

265
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,960
You alright?

266
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,280
Mingshu.

267
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,280
Buddy,

268
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,840
am I interrupting you?

269
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,560
No.

270
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,320
Come in.

271
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,840
Why don't you
say anything?

272
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,440
County princess Wen'an came today.

273
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,750
She asked about
the investigation.

274
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,470
Good.

275
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,510
You don't wanna know
my answer?

276
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,910
I told you.

277
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,910
You only need to act

278
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,360
at your will.

279
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,670
Don't care too much.

280
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,720
I didn't tell Wen'an

281
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,390
because I believe

282
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,320
you protect Su Tangli

283
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
with a reason.

284
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,320
As for county princess Wen'an,

285
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,510
she only needs the truth.

286
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,720
I'm sure there's a way

287
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,150
to let her know
the nature of Xie Xi

288
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,270
without hurting
Su Tangli.

289
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Thank you, Mingshu.

290
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,120
About Wen'an,

291
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,390
I have the same idea
as yours.

292
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Then we're done arguing?

293
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,550
I don't dare to,

294
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,240
my lady.

295
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,960
It was so impulsive
of you

296
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,030
to show up
in front of Wen'an.

297
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,550
Why did you wanna
send me out?

298
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,440
For the sake of you.

299
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,750
You should know this.

300
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,120
If you get exposed,

301
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,910
you'll have to
return Imperial Music Office.

302
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,390
I don't bear to

303
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,200
see you suffer again.

304
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,320
Don't worry.

305
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,240
I'll go pick you up
as soon as

306
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,350
I erase
Wen'an's suspicion.

307
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,400
And I understand now.

308
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,680
We can't be
short-sighted.

309
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,440
If I can't exonerate
your dad,

310
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,000
you can never

311
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,790
be with me openly.

312
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,310
I don't want you

313
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,310
and our baby

314
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,070
to be wronged.

315
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,310
Only if I marry Wen'an

316
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,440
can I become

317
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,440
the rightful heir

318
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,310
and exonerate your dad

319
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,240
and protect you.

320
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,310
The only one

321
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,680
I love in the world

322
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,750
is you.

323
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,480
I do that

324
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,640
for the sake of you.

325
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,830
If you don't believe me,

326
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,030
I can swear.

327
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,750
Fine.

328
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,880
I believe you.

329
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,870
The day after,

330
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,880
Prince Yu and Prince Rui

331
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,510
will come to the academy.

332
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,960
I'll send you out

333
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,550
in case complications
arise again.

334
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,670
Okay.

335
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,860
(New Dawn)

336
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,910
Stop there.

337
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,680
Come any closer,
I'll yell.

338
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,310
You can't always

339
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,920
get away.

340
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,240
I'll get to see the face

341
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
behind the veil

342
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,960
as long as
I stay in the academy.

343
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,200
I'll come again
in 2 days.

344
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,110
Where are you going?

345
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,310
- Help.
- Where are you going?

346
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,560
Lady,

347
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,950
I cherish you.

348
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,000
Come on.

349
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,440
I cherish you.

350
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,800
No!

351
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,480
No way,

352
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,640
I won't go back there.

353
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,480
No way,

354
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,790
no way,

355
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,590
no way.

356
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,830
No way!

357
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,960
Prince Rui, Consort Rui.

358
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,640
Her Highness
has been waiting.

359
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,040
Okay.

360
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,800
Here you are.

361
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,830
I can rest assured
seeing how you

362
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,830
love each other.

363
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,480
His Highness is
kind and considerate.

364
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,920
It's a blessing to
be his wife.

365
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,270
We'll stand together

366
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,480
through thick and thin.

367
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,840
Shujun,

368
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,070
why did you put on
a silver crown

369
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,830
instead of the gold one?

370
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,110
I know Prince Yu

371
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,640
likes to wear
the gold one.

372
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,350
But His Highness prefers
to be low-profile

373
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,440
to rally public support.

374
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,200
So there's no need
to compete in attire.

375
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
You've got a point.

376
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,000
Everything went well.

377
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,160
Thanks for
your cooperation.

378
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,560
Thank you too.

379
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,830
I'll go to
Hualang Pavilion.

380
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,160
Goodbye, Your Highness.

381
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,480
She can actually remain

382
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,440
poised and confident
in the palace.

383
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,280
Your Highness,

384
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,000
Your Highness?

385
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,830
You have
a political meeting.

386
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,400
Please hurry to
Zizheng Hall.

387
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,110
I know.

388
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,240
Let's go.

389
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,620
(Hualang Pavilion)
Ladies, welcome.

390
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,750
Madam Zhang
from Huimin Quarter

391
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,200
divorced her husband

392
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,640
and opened a silk shop

393
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,830
with the help of you.

394
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,400
Her ex-husband
doesn't dare to bully her

395
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,000
since you're her backing.

396
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,720
It's a wish of mine

397
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,400
to help Madam Zhang

398
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,030
to divorce
the heavy drinker.

399
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,080
Miss Yin,

400
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,920
a lady wants to see you.

401
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,350
Let her in.

402
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,000
My greetings to you,
Miss Yin.

403
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Please get up.

404
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,160
All girls here
are like sisters.

405
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,920
What can I

406
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,400
do for you, Lady?

407
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,960
I was born into
a poor family.

408
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,000
My dad died.

409
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,200
Without the help

410
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,790
of Hualang Pavilion,

411
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,680
I'd have to sell myself

412
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,000
to bury my dad.

413
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,440
So I came in person

414
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,590
to thank Hualang Pavilion

415
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,240
for the help.

416
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,760
Please get up.

417
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,440
We established
Hualang Pavilion

418
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,480
with the aim of solving
problems for women.

419
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,030
That is what
we should do.

420
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,960
No need to say thank you.

421
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,920
Your dad is at ease.

422
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,590
I hope you can

423
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,000
cheer up

424
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and lead a good life.

425
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,440
Then your dad can
rest in peace.

426
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,240
I'll bear your kindness

427
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,070
and virtue in my mind.

428
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,070
I possess nothing
of value.

429
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,880
My dad loved planting.

430
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,750
These seeds
were from my dad.

431
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,830
I give you these

432
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,150
as a token
of my gratitude.

433
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,150
Thank you.

434
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,840
Be careful.

435
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,640
- What is she doing?
- Okay.

436
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
We're done,
Consort.

437
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,750
It's said that a customer

438
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,350
gave Consort
some seeds

439
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,550
- to thank her.
- You need help?

440
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:23,880
Here.

441
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,350
Thank her
for the jewelry?

442
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,000
I made inquiries.

443
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,550
The Hualang Pavilion is not only
a jewelry shop.

444
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,640
It's a women's hall.

445
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,070
I've heard about it.

446
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,880
But there's not much news
about it.

447
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
And it's still in its infancy.

448
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,280
Indeed.

449
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,190
By the way,

450
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,920
the eldest princess
of Hengyang died.

451
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,440
Consort has had
people pay respects.

452
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,920
And the servants' salary,

453
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,440
- don't forget to...
- Consort has paid.

454
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,430
And Consort

455
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,070
has prepared the clothes

456
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,310
for you to go
to Songling Academy.

457
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,890
She's committed to

458
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,480
the affairs here.

459
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,550
And never made a mistake.

460
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,350
I only have this hall
left to clean.

461
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,590
No need to help me.

462
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,590
The visit of
Prince Yu and Prince Rui

463
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,480
(Education Without Bias)
is not a small issue.

464
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,550
You must be tired.

465
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,160
It's such a big event.

466
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
So what?

467
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,310
I expect to see

468
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,830
Prince Yu and Prince Rui,

469
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,350
especially Prince Yu.

470
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,350
Auspicious clouds
appeared on his birth.

471
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,750
His Majesty treated it
as an good omen.

472
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,030
Prince Yu must be
very good-looking.

473
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,350
Prince Yu has
deep-rooted influence.

474
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,000
He's more likely
to ascend to the throne.

475
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,070
Prince Rui is mired
in controversy

476
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,480
because of
the reform debate.

477
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,440
But many people think

478
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,920
he has the makings
of a sovereign.

479
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,750
The two princes
oppose each other.

480
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,880
Factional power struggles

481
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,750
in every possible way.

482
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,750
So you must

483
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,750
stay alert while you

484
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,030
observe people.

485
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,550
Buddy, I know it.

486
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,410
I promise

487
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,200
I'll handle this
with kid gloves.

488
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,800
Let's go.

489
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,880
Let virtue stand

490
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,720
where vanity kneels.

491
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,920
What a great poem!

492
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,500
(The Whispering Wind Decree)

493
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,520
You wrote it?

494
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,680
Yes, Master.

495
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,550
It was your order.

496
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,720
I wouldn't dare
to neglect it.

497
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,400
It took me 3 days

498
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,720
to write it.

499
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,270
You've made a wise call.

500
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,030
I'll present it

501
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,030
to Prince Yu
and Prince Rui.

502
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,160
If they admire it,

503
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,550
you'll have your reward.

504
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,720
I dare not
accept it, Master.

505
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,720
Master, don't worry.

506
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,920
They should have started.

507
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,160
No need to worry.

508
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,830
What will happen

509
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,790
is that a woman
falls off a cliff.

510
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,240
That's none
of my business.

511
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,000
I didn't know you could

512
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,350
write such a good poem.

513
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,480
Xie Xi.

514
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,550
We almost didn't get
to meet again.

515
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,310
Why are you here?

516
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,070
The carter

517
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,240
harassed me.

518
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,270
I almost failed
to get away.

519
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,350
I don't wanna go.

520
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,920
I wanna be with you,
Xie Xi.

521
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,630
- You can't go in.
- Get away.

522
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,590
Su Tangli,

523
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,830
you rejected me

524
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,750
because of him?

525
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,670
Uh,

526
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,880
he knew
the truth already.

527
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,040
Xie Xi,

528
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,640
how dare you keep
a government slave!

529
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,550
You'll be discredited.

530
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,520
Su Tangli,

531
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,880
this man looks
like a scholar

532
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,720
but he actually faces
constant disdain.

533
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,000
He relies on the marriage

534
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,200
to turn his life around.

535
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,350
You'd better

536
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,830
choose me over him.

537
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,670
Shut up!

538
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,270
You hit me!

539
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,160
How dare you hit me!

540
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,550
Stop it, Master.

541
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,680
Stop it.

542
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,790
Stop it.

543
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,440
Stop it, Master.

544
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,590
Master.

545
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,240
Now the students

546
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,030
turn the academy into
a den of corruption,

547
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,400
banking on being
sons of the peerage.

548
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,680
Things will go
beyond control

549
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
if we don't
restrain them.

550
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,720
Fine.

551
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,680
You've punished them.

552
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,880
They'll take
warning from it.

553
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,070
Don't be mad.

554
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,310
Don't get yourself
all worked up.

555
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,670
Madam He.

556
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,240
Mingshu.

557
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,550
Who upset you?

558
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,440
Mr. Xie and
Young Master Lu.

559
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,350
Young Master Lu somehow

560
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,550
bullied Tang Sheng.

561
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,350
Mr. Xie couldn't bear
to see that

562
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,480
and gave Young Master Lu

563
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,030
a lesson.

564
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,830
(Xie Xi hit Lu Wencai?)

565
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,110
(Did Lu Wencai find out)

566
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,400
(Su Tangli is a girl)

567

(and harass her?)

568
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,590
What happened to them?

569
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,590
Grounded for 3 days
for self-reflection.

570
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,400
They're not even
allowed to

571
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,880
meet the two princes.

572
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,070
I'll go see Headmaster.

573
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,110
Okay.

575
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,240
Here come
the distinguished guests.

576
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,750
I'm Xu Yan, Headmaster
of Songling Academy.

577
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,350
On behalf of the academy,

578
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,550
our greetings to
you distinguished guests.

579
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:25,160
Our greetings to
you distinguished guests.

580
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,550
As you were.

581
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,790
Headmaster Xu,
you've cultivated

582
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,640
the nation's pillars
for years.

583
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,940
(Prince Yu)

584
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,750
I admire you.

585
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
You flatter me

586
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,750
beyond my merits,
Your Highness.

587
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,750
You entirely deserve

588
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,000
this praise.

589
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,670
Well, Prince Yu,

590
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,720
Prince Rui, and Director
of the Imperial Secretariat,

591
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,280
please.

Each of my students

595
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,680
wrote two literary works.

596
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:07,000
The best ten works

were chosen
by master scholars.

598
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:15,200
I'd like to present them
to you.

599
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,790
Appreciate your feedback.

601
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,000
Mr. Lu is the guiding light

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,240
of the literary world.
Please read it.

603
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,590
With the presence of
Your Highness,

604
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,200
I shouldn't trespass
beyond my rank.

605
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,270

please read them.

00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:17,950

(Mingli Hall)

617
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,960
Song Qingzhao is indeed

618
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,920
the prime genius
of the capital.

619
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,630
Your essay is wonderful.

620
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,710
You flatter me,
Your Highness.

621
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,800
You flatter me.

622
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,960
This is owing to
all my teachers.

623
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,880
Mr. Song is
eloquent in diction

624
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,110
and fluid
in composition.

625
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,710
But you're young
after all.

626
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,550
Your essay is

627
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,400
tinged with
youthful misprision.

628
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,880
It's marginally
below excellence.

629
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,920
You're right.

630
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,350
But

631
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,230
his essay is
elegantly allusive

632
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,670
and brilliantly eloquent.

633
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,920
Obviously, he's deeply
rooted in knowledge.

634
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,280
Prince Rui, what do you

635
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,230
think of Lu Chang?

636
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,510
His essay is simple

637
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,840
in wording

638
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,840
but also accurate

639
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:21,910
in wording,

640
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,190
which proves
his extensive knowledge.

641
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,510
In terms of
policy essay,

642
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,150
Mr. Lu obviously

643
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,920
outdoes Mr. Song.

644
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,000
But in terms of
artistic conception

645
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,400
and lexical ornamentation,

646
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,480
Mr. Song outweighs him.

647
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,280
Was Lu Chang limited

648
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,840
by his upbringing?

649
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,230
Literary criticism should
focus on the work itself.

650
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,590
Why do you discuss
the social origin?

651
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,510
Were all eminent literati

652
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,440
necessarily born

653
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,150
into nobility?

654
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,440
I did focus
on the work itself.

655
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,190
Why are you
defending Mr. Lu?

656
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,430
Those unaware
may think

657
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,400
you prepare the spring
exam in advance

658
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,110
to poach
talents covertly.

659
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,000
Prince Yu, Prince Rui,

660
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,710
don't argue.

661
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,320
We came here today

662
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,440
to inspect the students

663
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,190
of Songling Academy.

664
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,230
Let's get back on track.

665
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,000
We should promote
the talents.

666
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,440
Mr. Lu is right.

667
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,360
Which is Lu Chang?
Come forward.

668
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,550
This is Lu Chang.
My greetings to Mr. Lu.

669
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,160
Mr. Lu?

670
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,240
Lu Chang,

671
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,590
how old are you?

672
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,110
I'm turning 22

673
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,840
this year.

674
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,550
Who are the members

675
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,710
of your family?

676
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,800
My father passed away.

677
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,320
I have a mother

678
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,400
and a younger sister.

679
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,970
You have a sister?

680
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,230
She's 18 this year.

681
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,360
18?

682
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,640
Mr. Lu,

683
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,920
why are you so interested

684
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,070
in his family?

685
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,280
Your Highness,

686
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,880
he has a deep
understanding

687
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,670
of people's livelihood

688
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,550
so I'm interested
in his experiences.

689
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,070
That's the only reason.

690
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,400
You're both pillars
of the nation.

691
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,510
Spring exam is coming.

692
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,920
Looking forward
to your performances.

693
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,590
- Thanks, Your Highness.
- Thanks, Your Highness.

694
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,030
Prince Yu.

695
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,110
Prince Yu, you okay?

696
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,390
I'm fine.

697
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,640
Fetch someone to

698
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,670
send Prince Yu
to changing room.

699
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,510
Yes.

700
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,800
Your Highness, please.

701
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,360
Your Highness,
here are your clothes.

702
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,200
Come in.

703
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,230
Your Highness,

704
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,440
Huantao Study is
in the front.

705
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,230
It's said that
Guo Huinan,

706
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,280
a Confucian scholar,

707
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,800
left many of his works

708
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,000
in this place

709
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,630
30 years ago.

710
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,760
Prince Yu is
indeed erudite.

711
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,880
(Huantao Study)
This place is a must-visit place.

712
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,150
Why are the door
and windows shut?

713
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,590
No way, I had them opened
to ventilate.

714
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,550
Mingshu,
you go take a look.

715
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,320
- Open the door.
- Yes.

716
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,740
(Huantao Study)

717
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,760
Bad news.

718
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,120
What is it?

719
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,150
Someone's dead.

720
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,710
How could this happen
in the academy?

721
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,600
- You alright?
- I'm fine.

722
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,960
I'm not scared
with you around.

723
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,070
Lu Wencai.

724
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,230
He's supposed
to be grounded.

725
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,230
Why is he dead here?

726
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,590
Your Highness, Director
of the Imperial Secretariat,

727
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,650
we have a homicide here.

728
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,510
It's unsafe to stay here.

729
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,360
Please wait
in Mingli Hall.

730
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,840
You're right.

731
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,360
Your Highness, shall we...

732
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,200

is administered by
Liangzhou Prefecture.

734
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,550
A homicide
happened here.

735
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,640
Theoretically speaking,

736
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,400
it should be reported
to the prefecture.

737
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,680
Prince Yu,

738
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,320
Mr. Lu,

739
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,360
what do you think?

740
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,960
- Report it now.
- Okay.

741
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,030
Order the prefecture
to investigate the case.

742
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,030
I'll inspect the case.
