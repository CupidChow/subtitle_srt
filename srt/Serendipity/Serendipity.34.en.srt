00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,980
How could I miss

30
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,100
such an important day?

31
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,980
Indeed.

32
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,780
Your Highness, look.

33
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,660
It's Prince Rui!

34
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,060
No.

35
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,940
The figure isn't right.

36
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,420
It's not him.

37
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,620
Tonight reeks of intrigue.

38
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,060
He'd never entrust

39
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,380
such a grand ceremony to another.

40
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,700
But if this is not him,

41
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,700
where could he be?

42
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,860
Absolute kill.

43
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,300
Want to die?

44
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,180
It's not that easy.

45
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,420
Escort him to the Supreme Court

46
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,370
for thorough interrogation.

47
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,120
- Yes!
- Yes!

48
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,980
Ladies,

49
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,060
you've worked hard all day.

50
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,140
Have some refreshments.

51
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,020
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

52
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,220
Our sales soared today.

53
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,860
(Lu)

54
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,820
(Marshal's signal of catching the assassin.)

55
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,540
(Buddy seems to be safe.)

56
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,460
So many sky lanterns!

57
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,300
Look.

58
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,300
Look at that one.

59
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,540
What beautiful sky lanterns!

60
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,460
The wind blows northwest today.

61
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,060
Northwest.

62
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,380
The sacrificial altar.

63
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,220
(Lu Chang is on the sacrificial altar.)

64
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,180
But compared to absolute kills,

65
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,140
I'm better at feints.

66
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,260
Your Highness remains calm in an emergency,

67
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,380
steady as Mount Tai.

68
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,140
Regarding today's ceremony,

69
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,660
though absent,

70
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,820
you've got

71
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,220
the overall situation under control.

72
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,100
I had expected

73
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,660
Lu Chang's self-sacrifice for his master.

74
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,300
It's time to make move against Prince Rui.

75
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,430
Tonight,

76
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,900
the game concludes.

77
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,370
Everyone, beware!

78
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,060
- The smoke is poisonous!
- Toxic smoke!

79
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,090
Save Prince Rui!

80
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,900
Move!

81
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,060
Guards!

82
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,020
(An)

83
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,520
Run!

84
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,740
Help!

85
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,240
Help!

86
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,420
Save the Prince!

87
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,400
Help us!

88
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,560
Help!

89
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,420
Toxic smoke!

90
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,940
(Yongjing Terrace)

91
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,020
(An)

92
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,180
Lu Chang.

93
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,180
Don't come up!

94
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,940
Lu Chang!

95
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,780
Lu Chang!

96
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,300
Lu Chang.

97
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,740
Why are you here?

98
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,980
What's wrong with you?

99
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,220
What happened?

100
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,010
I've been poisoned.

101
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,320
Something's wrong with the sky lanterns.

102
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:57,970
Let's get out of here.

103
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,940
This way.

104
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,700
His Highness must be inside.

105
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,060
I'm going to get him out!

106
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,060
Your Highness!

107
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,860
- You cannot go!
- Let go of me!

108
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,740
Your Highness!

109
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,740
The flames are too fierce!

110
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,380
- You cannot go in!
- I must help him!

111
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,860
Let go!

112
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,060
Shujun!

113
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,540
Shujun.

114
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,940
You scared me to death.

115
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,540
It's fine.

116
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,540
Everything is fine now.

117
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,300
What on earth is going on?

118
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,060
(To Prince Rui)

119
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,700
Your Highness can withdraw first.

120
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,900
There's a hidden door in the changing room.

121
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,660
But to get back inside will require

122
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,100
the time an incense stick burns.

123
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,860
You'll miss the Blessing Ceremony.

124
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,140
Lu Chang

125
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,100
is going to take the risk in my stead?

126
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,060
Guards!

127
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,660
Guards!

128
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,140
The hidden door.

129
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,140
Lu Chang helped me.

130
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,420
Your Highness, the assassin is secured.

131
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,660
He is Prince Yu's scheming pawn.

132
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,900
Keep him alive as a testament.

133
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,140
Yes!

134
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,580
Take him away!

135
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,980
Move!

136
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,300
Lu Chang is in danger now.

137
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,500
We must help him.

138
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,860
Yes.

139
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,020
Where is Su Tangli?

140
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,580
Guarded as ordered.

141
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,540
She hasn't moved.

142
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,260
Your Highness, bad news!

143
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,700
Something happened

144
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,740
at the Blessing Ceremony.

145
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,820
How is that possible?

146
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,540
(An)

147
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,060
Lu Chang.

148
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,740
Mingshu.

149
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,700
- Lady Mingshu.
- Lu Chang!

150
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,100
Lady Mingshu!

151
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,060
(Liluo Pavilion)

152
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,260
Lady Su,

153
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,740
where are you going at this hour?

154
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,900
I need to see Prince Yu urgently.

155
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,860
By His Highness's decree,

156
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,420
tonight, you're not allowed

157
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,300
to leave the room.

158
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,860
If his urgent matters are delayed,

159
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,060
would you bear the consequences?

160
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,340
Then I'll escort you.

161
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,660
Thanks.

162
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,940
Once this ends,

163
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,540
find a way to leave.

164
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,420
Lady Su,

165
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,860
I'd like to follow you.

166
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,540
Unnecessary.

167
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,100
You've done enough for me.

168
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,300
(Liluo Pavilion)
Prince Yu may be convicted.

169
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,100
While his attention lies elsewhere,

170
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,420
seize the opportunity to flee.

171
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,380
Lu Chang

172
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,980
ascended the altar in Prince Rui's stead.

173
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,340
The sky lanterns ignited the altar.

174
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,260
Lu Chang's fate remains unknown.

175
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,180
But Prince Rui

176
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,900
slipped away from the locked changing room

177
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,340
and captured our man.

178
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,580
Their defenses

179
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,700
were meticulously staged!

180
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,980
What?

181
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,310
(Complete Impartiality)
Outrageous!

182
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,060
By His Majesty's decree,

183
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,140
Lu Zegang, Minister of Works,

184
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,620
has failed in overseeing the construction

185
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,700
of the Blessing Ceremony venue,

186
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,020
disgracing His Majesty's benevolence

187
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,340
and dishonoring his ancestral legacy.

188
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,260
Hereby,

189
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,860
he is stripped of rank and salary,

190
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,100
imprisoned immediately

191
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,700
awaiting further judgment.

192
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,700
All members of his household

193
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,540
are to be detained at their residence,

194
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,220
awaiting His Majesty's final decree.

195
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,900
So decreed.

196
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,260
I

197
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,500
accept the decree

198
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,220
with gratitude.

199
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,560
My confidential documents are kept

200
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,980
in the study's hidden compartment.

201
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,340
Once I depart

202
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,620
and no one takes charge of the household,

203
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,620
all responsibility

204
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,420
falls to you.

205
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,220
I understand, Father.

206
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,540
Take him away.

207
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,700
No.

208
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,580
Father.

209
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,620
Master.

210
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,620
Master.

211
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,140
No!

212
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,340
Master!

213
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,580
(Grand Ambitions)

214
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,100
Lu Zegang, you old fox.

215
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,340
I knew you trusted me less than Feng did.

216
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,620
How could you entrust

217
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,300
such secrets to me before being arrested?

218
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,900
What malicious intentions!

219
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,020
Fortunately,

220
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,100
I'm one step ahead.

221
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,340
Attempt to betray Prince Yu?

222
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,140
Try again in your next life.

223
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,820
Su Tangli?

224
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,860
Su Tangli,

225
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,420
why are you...

226
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,980
Why are you here?

227
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,900
What?

228
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,140
You think since Prince Yu doesn't trust me,

229
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,700
he'll have someone follow me all the way,

230
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,420
so I won't be able to come here,

231
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,740
right?

232
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,740
You thought you were brilliant,

233
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,380
but your schemes

234
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,060
were seen through long before.

235
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,940
When you infiltrated the Lu Residence,

236
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,260
I guessed

237
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,940
you were going to unearth evidence

238
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,660
against Prince Yu.

239
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,140
How could I let you have your way?

240
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,180
You...

241
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,460
You dare

242
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,500
betray Prince Yu.

243
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,180
I've never pledged loyalty to him.

244
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,460
How am I supposed to betray him?

245
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,540
Since you're so loyal,

246
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,660
pave his path

247
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,940
to the underworld.

248
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,740
(Prince Yu's Jianglin Embezzlement)

249
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,940
(Ledger)

250
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,300
Father,

251
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,900
I can finally clear your name.

252
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,660
Your Majesty,

253
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,780
this matter's roots spread too deep.

254
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,340
I dare not make any decision.

255
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,060
I require Your Majesty's instructions.

256
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,620
Are you implying

257
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,620
that Lu Chang replaced Prince Rui

258
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,740
at the altar, suspecting

259
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,420
Prince Yu's orchestrated assassination?

260
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,100
Also, Prince Yu

261
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,660
is the mastermind

262
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,820
of Su Changhua's case?

263
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,460
I dare not make presumptions.

264
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,980
I can only present the evidence

265
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,780
I've gathered.

266
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,300
Issue my decree.

267
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,940
Confine Prince Yu to his mansion

268
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,900
awaiting thorough investigation

269
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,100
by the Court of the Imperial Clan.

270
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,180
Yes.

271
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,900
(Liluo Pavilion)

272
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,340
By His Majesty's decree,

273
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,420
Prince Yu remains confined,

274
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,900
cooperating with a thorough investigation.

275
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,020
No exit

276
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,060
without explicit edict.

277
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,340
I

278
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,220
obey the decree.

279
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,300
My silly consort.

280
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,300
You hid everything from me.

281
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,620
Do you truly see me as your consort?

282
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,100
I was wrong.

283
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,620
I thought

284
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,100
that if I told you the truth,

285
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,060
you'd be worried day and night.

286
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,340
How could I let you suffer so?

287
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,860
I didn't expect

288
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,740
that you still went.

289
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,860
It was so dangerous,

290
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,860
yet you tried to charge into the flames.

291
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,700
Why are you so silly?

292
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,900
Nothing mattered to me at that moment.

293
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,820
I feared you'd abandon me.

294
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,820
I don't want to be a widow so young.

295
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,900
Didn't we

296
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,700
vow to live long

297
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,100
and grow old together?

298
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,900
Then promise me,

299
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,540
you'll tell me everything from now on.

300
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,820
Let's face

301
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,020
all the difficulties ahead together.

302
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,980
Ok.

303
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,140
I'll listen to you.

304
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,900
(Shuyue Pavilion)

305
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,940
So sweet.

306
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,340
Right?

307
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,420
Eat something sweet

308
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,700
so it's not bitter.

309
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,900
Even if Lu Chang hides in heaven or hell,

310
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,420
I'll drag him back for you.

311
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,300
Lady Jian, born with a silver spoon,

312
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,420
you're a merchant of unparalleled wealth.

313
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,900
Whether in the past or at present,

314
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,180
I've never been worthy of you,

315
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,740
and I have no intention of overstepping.

316
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,180
I see.

317
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,140
In that case,

318
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,380
let's stop here.

319
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,740
This nuptial wine

320
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,660
once symbolized

321
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,620
a husband and wife

322
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,180
merging into a whole,

323
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,300
never to be separated.

324
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,580
Now,

325
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,940
let's

326
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,660
shatter tradition.

327
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,860
May it mark

328
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,220
our severance.

329
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,420
You have lofty aspirations.

330
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
I won't hold you back.

331
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,260
After this separation,

332
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,980
should our paths cross again,

333
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,460
we meet as strangers.

334
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,180
May your years

335
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,860
rise like bamboo,

336
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,620
each joint surpassing the last.

337
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,460
Lu Chang is so stubborn.

338
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,620
I offered my family property to him

339
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,020
with both hands,

340
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,620
but he didn't even care.

341
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,660
Who's he to scorn my offer?

342
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,100
I...

343
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,540
So what if I drugged him?

344
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,220
If you want him,

345
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,740

00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,010
by the case of the Jian Family,

389
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,340
believing only by convicting Prince Yu

390
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,660
could he dare propose to you.

391
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,180
Thus,

392
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,860
he offered himself as bait,

393
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,620
not just to safeguard Prince Rui,

394
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,780
but to convict Prince Yu.

395
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,540
How is my son?

396
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,380
Acupuncture

397
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,420
will treat Reviewer Lu's injuries.

398
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,460
After half a month of continuous therapy

399
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,660
to clear the toxin buildup,

400
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,580
his life will no longer be at risk.

401
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,060
However,

402
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,300
given his

403
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,340
past wounds,

404
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,260
he needs meticulous care

405
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,340
to regain

406
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,580
consciousness.

407
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,740
Then when will he wake up?

408
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,820
Well,

409
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,180
it's hard to say.

410
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,780
All right. Thank you, Physician.

411
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,060
Please thank Prince Rui for me.

412
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,620
Of course.

413
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,220
- I'll take my leave.
- Thank you.

414
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,060
Mother,

415
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,620
don't worry.

416
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,580
I will take care of him forever.

417
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,500
If he doesn't wake up for a day,

418
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,540
I'll stay by his side for a day.

419
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,780
If he never wakes up,

420
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,220
I'll stay by him for a lifetime.

421
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,580
Chang,

422
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,220
please wake up.

423
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:59,340
(Top Scholar Residence)

424
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,020
Qingzhao.

425
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,260
Sit down.

426
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,020
With severe injuries,

427
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,100
you can't afford to strain yourself.

428
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,140
If he wakes up,

429
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,020
but you collapse,

430
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,260
what should you do?

431
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,700
I'm fine.

432
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,380
Fine?

433
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,940
Look how pale and drained you are.

434
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,700
I...

435
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,420
Everyone's worried about you.

436
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,020
I won't collapse

437
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,860
before he wakes up.

438
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,100
Go rest.

439
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,260
I'll stay here with him.

440
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,740
Don't forget,

441
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,580
he's my buddy too.

442
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,020
Moreover, if you get sick too,

443
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,380
how hard will it be for Madam Zeng?

444
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,980
Thank you.

445
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,020
Mr. Lu,

446
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,700
you and Mingshu are deeply in love.

447
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,380
Why couldn't you cherish it?

448
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,740
If you don't wake up soon,

449
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,900
how heartbroken she will be?

450
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,940
A little more.

451
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,340
- Here.
- Minister Wu is here!

452
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

453
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,020
Your Majesty,

454
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,780
I have urgent matters to report.

455
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,380
You may leave now.

456
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,460
How's it going?

457
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,220
Your Majesty,

458
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,380
Lu Zegang has confessed

459
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,700
to colluding with Prince Yu

460
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,260
in framing Su Changhua

461
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,540
for embezzling disaster relief funds.

462
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,340
The evidence

463
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,580
corroborates his testimony,

464
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,780
proving Prince Yu's guilt

465
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
in both embezzlement

466
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,780
and the wrongful accusation of Su Changhua.

467
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,300
Your Majesty.

468
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,540
Your Majesty, please calm your anger!

469
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,980
How dare he trample on the law

470
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,460
and persecute a loyal subject!

471
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,860
Your Majesty,

472
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,500
Commander Wei Zhuo of the Palace Guard

473
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,540
captured an assassin

474
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,260
at the ceremony.

475
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,860
He's a deaf-mute suicidal assassin

476
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,260
and cannot be interrogated.

477
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,340
But we've learned

478
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,340
that a woman named Su Tangli,

479
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,060
residing in Prince Yu's estate,

480
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,380
claims Liu Wan'er

481
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,380
isn't Lu Zegang's daughter,

482
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,700
but a spy planted by Prince Yu.

483
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,060
Liu Wan'er is the one

484
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,340
setting the alter on fire via sky lanterns

485
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,860
under Prince Yu's orders.

486
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,700
But I've investigated

487
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,220
Su Tangli's identity.

488
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,260
She is

489
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,820
Su Changhua's only daughter.

490
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,460
If she bears a grudge against Prince Yu,

491
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,140
her testimony

492
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,620
may be biased.

493
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,540
Where is Liu Wan'er?

494
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,060
When we found her,

495
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,660
she was dead in the Lu Residence.

496
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,700
So the key witness is silenced?

497
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,020
Your Majesty!

498
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,900
Your Majesty.

499
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,860
Summon the imperial physician now!

500
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,980
(Daqing Hall)

501
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,580
Assemble the court!

502
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,820
Long live the Emperor!

503
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,620
Rise.

504
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

505
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,820
My dear ministers,

506
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,660
do you have any matters

507
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,860
to address in today's court?

508
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,980
Your Majesty,

509
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,100
I have a memorial to present.

510
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,620
Proceed.

511
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,780
I

512
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,420
denounce Prince Yu for three crimes.

513
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,340
Two years ago,

514
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,580
during the Jianglin floods,

515
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,660
Prince Yu embezzled disaster relief funds,

516
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,860
forcing countless victims

517
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,980
into displacement and death.

518
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,300
This is the first.

519
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,850
Prince Yu framed

520
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,100
Su Changhua, the late Jianglin prefect,

521
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,940
smearing his honor

522
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,900
and destroying his family.

523
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,940
This is the second.

524
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,100
His corruption, bribery,
and factional activities are the third.

525
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,140
The three charges

526
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,380
are irrefutable.

527
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,660
I implore Your Majesty to convict Prince Yu

528
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,180
to uphold justice

529
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,500
and honor the dead.

530
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,070
We implore Your Majesty

531
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,820
to convict Prince Yu

532
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,660
to uphold justice

533
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,620
and honor the dead.

534
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,180
Your Majesty, I

535
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,260
have a memorial to present.

536
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,300
Proceed.

537
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,420
Your Majesty,

538
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,520
I observe

539
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,940
that the recent changes in the realm

540
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,300
result in upheavals in the court

541
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,500
and restlessness among the people

542
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,620
due to the unresolved succession designation.

543
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,060
The Crown Prince's appointment is vital.

544
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,940
Prince Rui is both talented and virtuous.

545
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,420
If he's named Crown Prince,

546
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,180
he'll loyally serve Your Majesty,

547
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,700
safeguarding the realm's peace

548
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,020
and the people's happiness.

549
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,580
This secures the realm's enduring stability.

550
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,060
I beg Your Majesty

551
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,700
to act wisely and decisively.

552
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,940
His Majesty

553
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,140
has been ailing and weakened recently.

554
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,780
What do you think

555
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,980
he fears most now?

556
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,900
Insolent son!

557
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,660
I'm not dead yet!

558
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,940
If Your Highness retains your title,

559
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,820
you can contend with Prince Rui.

560
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,260
This time, I cannot escape punishment.

561
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,260
But so long as my title remains,

562
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,180
I can

563
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,900
make a comeback.

564
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,820
I proclaim this decree

565
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,420
by the grace of Heaven's mandate.

566
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,020
My eldest son, Prince Yu,

567
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,620
of noble lineage,

568
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,180
entrusted with great expectations,

569
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,780
held the reins of governance

570
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,520
(Imperial Edict)
with unparalleled favor.

571
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,700
Yet

572
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,740
I learn of his crimes of embezzlement,

573
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,140
persecuting loyal subjects,

574
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,700
and fabricating charges.

575
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,060
I am dismayed by his betrayal of lineage

576
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,900
and defiance of the laws.

577
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,740
Henceforth, I strip him of power

578
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,890
and order him

579
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,300
to leave the capital

580
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,980
for the imperial mausoleum

581
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,780
to atone for his sins.

582
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,780
(Imperial Edict)
No return without decree.

583
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,420
Should he resist,

584
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,020
he shall be deemed a traitor and punished.

585
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,780
So decreed.

586
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,340
I

587
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,820
have failed Your Majesty's grace.

588
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,620
Death itself could not redeem my sins.

589
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,580
I

590
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,020
obey Your Majesty's will

591
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,020
to demonstrate

592
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,340
my unwavering loyalty.

593
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,740
In that case,

594
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:41,860
Your Highness,

595
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,580
please depart immediately.

596
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,900
Prince Yu deliberately had others

597
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,820
petition His Majesty

598
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,260
to name you Crown Prince,

599
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,260
only to

600
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,380
sow doubt

601
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,620
in His Majesty's mind

602
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,100
and

603
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,460
secure his own title.

604
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,100
What a masterstroke of tactical retreat.

605
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,900
I lack his calculating finesse.

606
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,580
Your Highness's compassionate heart

607
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,140
and relentless pursuit of justice

608
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,500
for Mr. Su

609
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,950
prove your devotion

610
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,580
to the people.

611
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,580
This is a blessing for the dynasty.

612
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,820
I'm flattered, Grand Tutor.

613
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,260
I shall

614
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,580
continue striving

615
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,060
to honor Mr. Su's legacy

616
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,220
and your expectations.

617
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,740
(Imperial Notice)
What does the notice say?

618
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,780
Notice, come look.

619
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,900
By His Majesty's edict,

620
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,700
Su Changhua, former prefect of Jianglin,

621
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,340
served with unwavering loyalty

622
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,820
and compassion for the people.

623
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,500
Wrongfully accused

624
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,900
due to slander,

625
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,300
he had no faults.

626
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,460
Hereby, he is exonerated

627
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,180
to uphold the imperial court's justice.

628
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,860
Officials of Jianglin

629
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,060
shall restore his ancestral shrine,

630
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,940
affirming his integrity.

631
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,020
Su Changhua's daughter

632
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,620
may use this edict

633
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,900
to avenge her father.

634
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,820
His reputation

635
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,180
will be restored

636
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,620
so he will finally enjoy peace.

637
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,680
People are forbidden to spread

638
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,460
defamatory claims against Su Changhua.

639
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,980
Violators will face

640
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,380
severe punishment.

641
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,540
Who'd have thought

642
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,740
Su Changhua was wrongly accused?

643
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,220
Yes, he was.

644
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,130
Prince Yu was removed from his position

645
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,580
and sent to maintain the imperial mausoleum.

646
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,460
Do you think

647
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,300
he is involved in this case?

648
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,540
Prince Yu?

649
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,860
If he were involved

650
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:37,980
in such a grave crime,

651
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,020
wouldn't he have been stripped of his title?

652
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,700
Probably he just angered His Majesty

653
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,020
by botching some duty.

654
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,220
It's just a coincidence.
