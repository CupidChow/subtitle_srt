It's him.

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,500
Mr. Song.

30
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,860
Lady Mingshu.

31
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,800
What are you doing here?

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,730
Does your family need to buy something?

33
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,170
I want to start a small business,

34
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,540
but I don't know what to do.

35
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,540
So I just walk around the street to see.

36
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,380
You can also do business?

37
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,000
We're new here

38
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:00,436
and need to spend money everywhere.

39
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,100
My brother asked me

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,440
not to worry about the livelihood.

41
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,180
But I don't want to sit back and enjoy it.

42
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,020
You are a person of integrity.

43
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,860
I must honestly inform you

44
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,300
the competition in the capital is fierce.

45
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,700
If you rashly barge in,

46
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,800
it might be hard to sustain.

47
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,860
Moreover,

48
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,660
it is already tough for men to do business.

49
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,500
As a woman,

50
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,180
it may be even harder.

51
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,420
What if it's a woman?

52
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,900
Trying it with all my might

53
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,740
is better than wasting time in hesitation.

54
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,860
What do you think?

55
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,980
Since you have such determination,

56
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,560
I will do my utmost to support you.

57
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,620
Thank you, Mr. Song.

58
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,140
It's almost noon.

59
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,900
First of all,

60
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,340
let me treat you to the most exquisite snacks

61
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,180
in the capital.

62
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,820
(Yizhan Liunian)

63
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,380
With delicate hands, she kneads the dough,

64
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,280
frying it in oil to produce a tender yellow.

65
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,480
This refers to the ring cake.

66
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,340
Please have a taste.

67
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,980
This is really delicious.

68
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,900
By the way,

69
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,980
in your opinion,

70
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,460
what makes the most money in the capital?

71
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,700
Making money?

72
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,140
I have little research on business.

73
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,940
However, as for my family,

74
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,680
my mother's money is the easiest to earn.

75
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,420
See, the things worn on the head

76
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,784
and the makeup on the face

77
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,110
all need to be bought in batches.

78
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,090
And that rouge comes in different colors.

79
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,990
In my opinion, there isn't much difference.

80
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,700
In her view, it's totally different.

81
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,580
She never thought

82
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,860
there's too much jewelry.

83
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,660
What she wants to wear

84
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,100
must be the one she doesn't have.

85
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,500
Actually, I think

86
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,720
a woman's nature of loving beauty

87
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:55,756
is truly adorable.

88
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,500
Even though the jewelry

89
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,580
is cheap and unattractive,

90
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,820
many people still buy it.

91
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,860
Your words remind me.

92
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,300
Maybe I can start from this aspect.

93
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,380
There's no rush.

94
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,430
Think about it carefully.

95
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,740
Greasy?

96
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,700
Not at all.

97
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,000
Serve tea.

98
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,860
Coming.

99
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,900
Wow!

100
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,100
Please enjoy your time.

101
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,340
Thank you.

102
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,460
Really impressive!

103
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,620
In the capital,

104
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,780
even drinking tea is so unique.

105
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,220
If one has no skills,

106
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,740
it's indeed hard to settle down in.

107
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,980
Business is business and life is life.

108
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,380
Right now, don't waste her skill

109
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,940
and the essence of heaven and earth.

110
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,620
This jewelry is of such poor quality.

111
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,840
I will go reason with them.

112
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,300
It seems to be Chenxin.

113
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,420
Let's go take a look.

114
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,740
Sir,

115
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,340
I bought accessories from your shop.

116
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,180
Not only are the designs laughable,

117
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,720
but they also broke after two days.

118
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,220
That lady seems to be a maid of Lady Tao.

119
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,020
Do we need to help her?

120
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,020
Wait, let's assess the situation first.

121
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,680
Lady,

122
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,740
this is clearly due to your improper wearing.

123
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,380
It's obviously your poor quality.

124
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,780
You must give me a refund.

125
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,300
This is a bit unreasonable.

126
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,620
I can't return it.

127
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,780
You are being too much.

128
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,460
This is clearly your problem.

129
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,160
You just don't want to give me a refund.

130
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,820
You don't want to work here anymore?

131
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,820
Chenxin.

132
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,660
Lady Lu.

133
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,790
It's been a while since we last met.

134
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,940
How is Lady Tao?

135
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,540
She is very good.

136
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,980
Thank you for your concern.

137
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,380
May I take a look at this hairpin?

138
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,660
Take a look.

139
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,330
How about changing the hairpin to this?

140
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,780
Great!

141
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,080
The craftsmanship is simple.

142
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,500
The style has become more chic.

143
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,800
Originally, there were too many pearls

144
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,880
surrounding the coral stone.

145
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,700
By replacing a few with tassels,

146
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,000
it enhances the brilliance of the coral stone

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,750
while retaining the liveliness of the pearls.

148
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,580
Elegant and unique.

149
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,020
It's indeed unique.

150
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,980
Don't worry, lady.

151
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,030
According to this pattern,

152
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,290
I will definitely improve it.

153
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,220
I think it looks great too.

154
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,580
Then make it first.

155
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,700
No problem.

156
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,540
In a few days, you can come to pick it up.

157
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,260
Thank you very much.

158
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,740
But I have to hurry back.

159
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,730
I'll take my leave first.

160
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,980
I didn't expect you to have

161
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,020
such a remarkable talent for jewelry.

162
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,180
I don't know why.

163
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,340
When I saw it, I felt I could improve it.

164
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,860
I didn't expect it to be decent.

165
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,380
It's more than just decent.

166
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,420
In my opinion,

167
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,090
you're not inferior to a skilled craftsman.

168
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,940
You are flattering me.

169
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,260
With your perspective,

170
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,980
can I open a jewelry shop?

171
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,980
I dare say

172
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,980
it will surely be popular.

173
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,100
See?

174
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,900
The business you long for is right here.

175
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,620
Good fate

176
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,940
always comes unexpectedly.

177
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,060
The river cruise is also a marvel.

178
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,420
Do you want to experience it?

179
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,660
Let's go.

180
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,700
(Mingli Hall)

181
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,700
(Yang Zishu)

182
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,580
Mr. Yang.

183
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,060
Mr. Yang.

184
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,140
Mr. Yang.

185
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,660
I smell the stench of poverty from far away.

186
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,820
Open the door.

187
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,820
Ignore me?

188
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,020
Yang Zishu is bullying a newcomer again.

189
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,220
I heard Mr. Lu has no background.

190
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,140
Looks like he's going to suffer now.

191
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,420
Has Mr. Song arrived?

192
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,340
I think only he can save this guy.

193
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,260
Do you know who my father is?

194
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,540
My father is a sixth-rank official.

195
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,310
He was dragged in.

196
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,740
Ouch!

197
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,780
See?

198
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,940
Lu Chang is probably in great danger.

199
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,940
Yeah, that's right.

200
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,700
Listening to this scream,

201
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,660
it is not optimistic.

202
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,020
How dare he offend Yang Zishu!

203
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,700
- Yeah.
- Who dares to offend him?

204
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,180
What's going on?

205
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,340
You guys, from now on,

206
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,360
- It's Mr. Lu.
- Mr. Lu.

207
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,900
This person

208
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,220
is Mr. Lu, my buddy.

209
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,980
Be more respectful, got that?

210
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,980
Could this guy

211
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,820
cast a spell

212
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,980
on Yang Zishu?

213
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,820
It shouldn't be.

214
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,780
Mr. Lu.

215
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,740
Mr. Song.

216
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,380
Nice to see you.

217
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,340
Turns out you know Mr. Song as well.

218
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,420
I truly apologize.

219
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,960
Yang Zishu has always bullied newcomers.

220
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,620
How did you subdue him?

221
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,360
I said I could teach him to fight crickets.

222
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,240
Thanks to the headmaster's reminder,

223
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,500
I realized he has this hobby.

224
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,060
You actually have such a refined taste.

225
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,140
Mr. Song, don't joke around.

226
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,150
I just played around in the countryside

227
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,340
during childhood.

228
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,880
But it's more than enough

229
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,300
to deal with him.

230
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,900
With you around,

231
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,500
I am finally not bored in this academy.

232
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,140
Why didn't I see you in class before?

233
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,420
I...

234
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,980
I went to purchase some writing materials.

235
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,820
I ran into your sister before.

236
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,180
She said she's very fond of the scenery here.

237
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,540
I'll take you around the city another day

238
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,020
and show me proper hospitality.

239
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,580
(Mingde Pavilion)

240
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,590
Schoolwork is complicated.

241
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,780
How dare I trouble you

242
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,420
to take time out to accompany us?

243
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,880
Mr. Lu, don't be polite with me.

244
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,180
(Baiyu Shop)

245
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,500
(For transfer)
If I want to open a jewelry shop,

246
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,100
I have to ask a broker to look for a shop.

247
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,820
(For transfer)

248
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,180
Sir,

249
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,260
are you transferring this shop?

250
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,980
It's you.

251
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,740
Sir, do you know me?

252
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,180
That day at the jewelry stall,

253
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,460
I saw you drawing designs for a lady.

254
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,900
There is an urgent matter back home.

255
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,660
It can't be solved quickly.

256
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,090
So I want to transfer this shop

257
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,340
as soon as possible.

258
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,500
What a coincidence! I need to rent one.

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,030
Why not transfer it to me?

260
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,180
I wonder what the price is.

261
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,140
I trust your skills.

262
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,620
Then I'll give you a fair price.

263
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,300
150 taels.

264
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,460
How's it?

265
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,700
The price is reasonable.

266
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,700
Then I will be frank with you.

267
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,220
I currently do not have this much money.

268
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,900
Why don't we settle on 90 taels first?

269
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,080
I'll pay the rest

270
00:11:58,104 --> 00:11:59,376
before you leave the capital.

271
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,940
Well...

272
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,820
I can write it down as proof.

273
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,460
Then let's do as you say.

274
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,540
Thank you, sir.

275
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,060
How can I earn the remaining money?

276
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,820
Lady Mingshu.

277
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,020
Lady Tao.

278
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,260
What brings you here?

279
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,980
If you need any help,

280
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,980
please feel free to ask.

281
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,540
Since you've said that,

282
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,740
I won't be polite anymore.

283
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,860
I want to open a jewelry shop,

284
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,500
but I don't have enough money.

285
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,260
I want to find a job.

286
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,920
You've been living here all long.

287
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,700
Could you help me inquire about it?

288
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,990
How much more do you need?

289
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,940
I can lend you some.

290
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,860
This is something I want to do myself.

291
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,660
I want to complete it by myself.

292
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,740
Today I want to apologize to you.

293
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,700
I previously concealed my true name from you.

294
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,700
(Yin Xianjun)
Actually, I'm Yin Xianjun,

295
00:12:57,724 --> 00:12:59,116
a daughter of the Yin Family.

296
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,380
Please don't blame me.

297
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,540
It's inconvenient for women to travel alone.

298
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,980
I definitely understand.

299
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,300
How could I blame you?

300
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,340
Since you say so, I feel relieved.

301
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,060
By the way,

302
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,020
there really is a job at hand.

303
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,500
I just don't know if you're willing.

304
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,580
Your Highness,

305
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,180
Her Highness has instructed repeatedly,

306
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,260
that you will get married,

307
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,580
this garden must, in any case,

308
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,940
be expanded and renovated.

309
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,620
If she brings it up again,

310
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,020
you just agree.

311
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,980
No need to repeat it to me.

312
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,060
But your identity is precious.

313
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,990
(Huai An)
How can the mansion

314
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,540
be overshadowed by other princes?

315
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,300
The officials are indulging in extravagance,

316
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,020
yet still consider themselves

317
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:45,896
as pursuing elegance.

318
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,220
(Prince Rui)
My mansion is perfectly

319
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,060
elegant and refined.

320
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,340
No need to compare.

321
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,260
- Your Highness...
- Rui.

322
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,180
Do you invite me here

323
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,220
to play chess?

324
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,420
There is something.

325
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,550
After thinking it over,

326
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,380
I'd better entrust it to you.

327
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,020
Rui, no need to be so polite with me.

328
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,980
This is the invitation

329
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:15,276
to the Yin Family's tea party.

330
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,540
Please go for me.

331
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,780
(Invitation)

332
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,180
(Your Highness)

333
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,860
You're discussing marriage with Lady Shujun.

334
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,340
Why not go in person?

335
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,500
That's why

336
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,940
I want to avoid suspicion.

337
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,660
Her Highness

338
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,780
heard Lady Shujun has a flaw in her virtue.

339
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,420
If it is true,

340
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,780
I may have to choose someone else.

341
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,980
If it is a rumor,

342
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,700
why does the Yin Family allow this to happen?

343
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,980
You check this matter secretly for me.

344
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,540
Rui, don't worry.

345
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,350
I'll definitely handle it properly.

346
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,700
Your mentor's embezzlement case

347
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:57,176
is a secret from the Supreme Court.

348
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,940
So, for now, I can only investigate

349
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,150
he was previously identified

350
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,280
of embezzling 200,000 taels

351
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,236
of disaster relief funds.

352
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,580
The silver was found in his ancestor's grave.

353
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,260
This could also be a frame-up.

354
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,620
Just relying on these,

355
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,130
it is not enough to convict my mentor.

356
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,100
Before your mentor took his own life,

357
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,380
he left behind a confession letter.

358
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,260
People thought he committed suicide

359
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:17,876
out of guilt.

360
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,300
Someone must have deliberately framed him

361
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,980
and fabricated evidence.

362
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,140
Unfortunately, I am new here

363
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,940
and have no acquaintances in the Court.

364
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,460
These are the only things I can find.

365
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,820
It seems that to find more clues

366
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,360
and to clear my mentor's name,

367
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,150
I still need to start from the Supreme Court.

368
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,060
About the Supreme Court,

369
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,820
I accidentally heard the governor mention

370
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,700
that Prince Rui would serve as the Minister.

371
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,780
It's difficult to meet Prince Rui for now.

372
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,980
But Grand Tutor Yin

373
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,700
is the teacher of my mentor.

374
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,660
He might have some clues and news.

375
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,780
(Invitation)

376
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,620
Mr. Lu,

377
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,940
you came at just the right time.

378
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,920
My master just returned

379
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:05,316
from the Prince Rui Residence.

380
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,780
Mr. Lu, you're here.

381
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,740
Please come in.

382
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,700
Mr. Lu, have a seat.

383
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,330
(Yin Shoudao)
(Invitation from the Yin Family?)

384
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,820
Did you come to see me

385
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,860
for something?

386
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,100
Nothing special.

387
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,220
I just have some academic questions

388
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,580
I'd like to consult you about.

389
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,300
Please go ahead.

390
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,060
Is this

391
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,010
(Yin Shoudao bows)
an invitation from the Yin Family

392
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,340
to attend the family feast?

393
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,780
Exactly.

394
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,540
The Yin Family holds a tea party every year,

395
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,340
inviting distinguished young people.

396
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,940
It is a good time to exchange knowledge.

397
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,040
The Yan Family is a model of integrity.

398
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,980
Grand Tutor Yin is the leader in literature.

399
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,300
I have long admired him.

400
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,340
Just a few days ago,

401
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,160
I have composed several new poems.

402
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,350
I'd like to seek guidance from him.

403
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,540
Could you take me there?

404
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,700
This could not be better.

405
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,540
Then tomorrow, please

406
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,980
go with me there.

407
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,390
With you around,

408
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,420
this tea party will surely be wonderful.

409
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,020
Good.

410
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,580
(Yin Residence)

411
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,420
She's right inside.

412
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,420
Lady Mingshu,

413
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,300
don't worry.

414
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,220
I invite you to be a reading lady.

415
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,740
I shouldn't speak too much about it.

416
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,780
But you are my lifesaver

417
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,420
and I introduced you here,

418
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,420
I still want to remind you.

419
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,620
Please go ahead.

420
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,780
My sister is the legitimate daughter.

421
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,220
She's the most esteemed among the sisters.

422
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,260
She used to be arrogant due to favoritism.

423
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,220
But she still maintained her demeanor.

424
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,740
However, starting a year ago,

425
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,690
her temperament changed drastically.

426
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,940
(For dramatic effect only,
no animals were harmed)

427
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,890
She arbitrarily beat servants,

428
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,260
brutally kill cats and dogs,

429
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,900
and even

430
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,980
pushed the nurturing nanny

431
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,860
into the water.

432
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
Her marriage with Prince Rui is approaching.

433
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,460
Auntie wants to invite a reading lady

434
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,900
to watch over my sister's behavior,

435
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,780
to prevent any mishaps.

436
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,460
But those we invited before

437
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,420
were all driven away by her.

438
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,940
Auntie is worried about not finding someone.

439
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,220
I just thought

440
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,580
you can give it a try.

441
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,820
Do you mean

442
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,620
my job is to discipline her well

443
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,020
just she gets married?

444
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,180
I guess it won't be long.

445
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,340
But this job is indeed not easy.

446
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,620
You're so kind to give me the opportunity.

447
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,580
It is helpful to me.

448
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,940
Whether it succeeds or not depends on me.

449
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,140
Lady Xianjun, do not be upset.

450
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,380
This is the Runwen Study where we study.

451
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,220
I will take you inside now.

452
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,460
(Broad Learning and Dedication)

453
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,900
(Runwen Study)

454
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,300
(Yin Liangjun)

455
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,380
Glad to see you, Lady Mingshu.

456
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,020
This is Lady Liangjun,

457
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,660
the daughter of my second uncle.

458
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,140
Lady Liangjun,

459
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,780
glad to see you.

460
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,900
Please don't stand on ceremony.

461
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,620
I heard from my auntie

462
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,180
that a reading lady is coming today.

463
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,140
I am happy to have another friend.

464
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,420
Moreover,

465
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,660
you are so beautiful and charming.

466
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,020
Lady Liangjun, you flatter me.

467
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,700
If you need anything in the future,

468
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,100
just tell them.

469
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,420
Did you hear that?

470
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,500
- Yes.
- Yes.

471
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,260
How dare she come?

472
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,300
Didn't she inquire first?

473
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,340
Today, my uncle is hosting a banquet.

474
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,340
Other brothers...

475
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,640
You became familiar so quickly.

476
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,900
Shujun.

477
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,420
(Runwen Study)

478
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,900
(Yin Shujun)

479
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,860
Shujun.

480
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,140
This is the reading lady

481
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,780
whom Auntie specifically sought for you.

482
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,740
I'm Lu Mingshu. Nice to meet you.

483
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,900
Lu Mingshu?

484
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,620
I heard you're a fallen noble from Jianglin.

485
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,800
What qualifications do you have to be here?

486
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,500
Shujun,

487
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,220
her brother...

488
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,140
I heard this person

489
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,300
was brought by you.

490
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,260
When did you become so bold?

491
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,620
I did ask Lady Xianjun for help.

492
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,860
It has nothing to do with her.

493
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,780
I come from a humble background,

494
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,000
but my brother is Prefectural Graduate

495
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,390
and my family has a pure tradition.

496
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,900
The Madam asked me here

497
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,940
to accompany you to learn,

498
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,260
not for matchmaking.

499
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,940
Why talk about family background?

500
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,100
You know how to use my mother

501
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,340
to intimidate me.

502
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,980
You're born with a silver tongue.

503
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,580
I want to see

504
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,300
how long you can be so glib.

505
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,380
Today we will study the poem Young Reeds.

506
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,180
(Runwen Study)

507
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,740
The reeds are lush and green;

508
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,900
the white dew becomes frost.

509
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,220
The beauty

510
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,100
is on the other side of the water.

511
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,260
Alright.

512
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,020
Ladies, please transcribe the poem Guests

513
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,940
of Hymns of Zhou.

514
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,380
After I read it, then you can leave.

515
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,620
(Luckily, I memorized this poem)

516
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,860
(when I heard my brother read.)

517
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:35,740
(Runwen Study)

518
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,940
Please.

519
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,900
(Our guests alight, from horses white.)

520
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,500
(Let's see how long you can hold on.)

521
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,140
(Poetry, Books, Rites, and Music)

522
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,100
(Runwen Study)

523
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,660
(Guests by Yin Liangjun)

524
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,180
Lady Liangjun, you do well as usual.

525
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,040
The handwriting is beautiful,

526
00:24:04,064 --> 00:24:05,764
with every word correct.

527
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,020
(Guests by Yin Xianjun)

528
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,100
Lady Xianjun, yours is also quite good.

529
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,660
Lady Shujun,

530
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,860
this blank paper should be yours, right?

531
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,880
Shujun, the Madam instructed me

532
00:24:28,904 --> 00:24:30,004
to teach you well.

533
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,140
Why do you keep submitting

534
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,180
blank answers?

535
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,260
(Guests by Lu Mingshu)

536
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,660
Lady Mingshu not only has each word correct,

537
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,300
but her cursive script is graceful,

538
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,620
reminiscent of Lady Wei

539
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:52,944
from the Eastern Jin Dynasty.

540
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,180
What is this?

541
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,660
A jujube tree standing at the door,

542
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,940
year after year, unaware of aging.

543
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,860
Grandma not marrying her daughter,

544
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,460
where can she get a grandson?

545
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,860
Grand Tutor Yin is recuperating

546
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:16,784
at another residence.

547
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,500
You can only visit again next time.

548
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,740
It's unfortunate to miss a meeting with him.

549
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,980
But if I can meet well-educated talents here,

550
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,460
this trip will not be in vain.

551
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,260
Lu Mingshu, you have quite the boldness!

552
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,780
Lu Mingshu,

553
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,500
you just came on this day.

554
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,780
I originally wanted to give you a chance.

555
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,700
How dare you

556
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,980
openly mock the teacher in class!

557
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,830
This is outrageous!

558
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,250
You know the teacher is over 40

559
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,650
- and still unmarried...
- Mingshu?

560
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,260
But you use this poem as a metaphor

561
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,260
to humiliate her.

562
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,460
With your temperament,

563
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,740
how could you be my reading lady?

564
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,660
Get out of here.

565
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,380
Teacher,

566
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,820
this note is not written by me.

567
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,780
Please investigate it.

568
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,220
The handwriting is the same as yours.

569
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,700
It also comes from your scroll.

570
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,740
How can you not admit it?

571
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,820
(A jujube tree standing at the door...)

572
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,980
Any lady from a prestigious family

573
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,780
has learned the calligraphy of Lady Wei.

574
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,440
The handwriting is not convincing.

575
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,860
Moreover,

576
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,900
I have never thought

577
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,620
a woman keeping her chastity is a disgrace.

578
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,500
In the pre-Qin period, a girl named Ying'er

579
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,180
never married and took care of her parents.

580
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,780
In the Tang Dynasty, there were five sisters,

581
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,460
who were virtuous and unwilling to marry,

582
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,500
instead dedicated to learning.

583
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,180
Such virtue is praised by future generations.

584
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,140
I admire such a woman too much

585
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,060
to mock her.

586
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,380
That's enough.

587
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,900
Just based on Lady Mingshu's words,

588
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,140
then I believe

589
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,140
this matter is not of her doing.

590
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,540
Let's stop here.

591
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,380
No way.

592
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,980
If this gets out,

593
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,060
people may think you're easy to bully.

594
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,460
It will also ruin the fame of my family.

595
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,780
Shuangyan,

596
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,860
drive her out.

597
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,140
Yes.

598
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,580
Lady Mingshu...

599
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,940
Madam.

600
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,140
Alright, stop messing around.

601
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,180
Madam Yin.

602
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,980
(Madam Yin)

603
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,940
Tell me

604
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,100
what's going on.

605
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,620
Lady Shujun,

606
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,100
everyone knows

607
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,300
who wrote this note,

608
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,370
so I don't need to spell it out.

609
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,860
Yes, Shujun,

610
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,100
please let her go.

611
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,740
Shujun,

612
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,500
Mingshu is really not that kind of person.

613
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,720
She is my reading lady.

614
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,140
Stop pretending to be a kind person.

615
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,170
Then I will speak clearly.

616
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,060
On this note,

617
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,890
the character zhi is missing a stroke.

618
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,460
I wouldn't write it like that.

619
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,980
I don't know either

620
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,460
who has such a taboo.

621
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,580
Lady Mingshu, you're truly sharp-eyed.

622
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,460
Writing this way

623
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,130
is precisely to avoid mentioning

624
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,740
the courtesy name of Master Yin.

625
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,420
This is the habit of Lady Shujun.

626
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,260
Everyone present is aware.

627
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,020
Mother...

628
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,300
Let's stop here.

629
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,300
Don't create more disputes.

630
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,740
Xianjun,

631
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,260
after the class,

632
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,780
bring Lady Mingshu to see me.

633
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,260
Yes.

634
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,740
She is a reading lady here.

635
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,660
Such a big deal.

636
00:29:23,684 --> 00:29:25,016
She actually kept it from me.

637
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,740
Maybe Lady Lu was in a hurry

638
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,140
and didn't have time to inform you.

639
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,860
Lady Shujun

640
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,700
looks

641
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,580
arrogant and overbearing.

642
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,340
Being a reading lady is probably not easy.

643
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,540
My cousin, Prince Rui,

644
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,260
is discussing marriage with Lady Shujun.

645
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,820
I have also heard some rumors about her.

646
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,580
It seems now

647
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,420
what has been said is not untrue.

648
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,100
But you need not worry too much.

649
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,940
Lady Mingshu possesses a unique wisdom,

650
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,620
and a chivalrous spirit.

651
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,700
She is also well-versed in jewelry.

652
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,140
Having so many wonderful qualities,

653
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,260
she is truly rare in this world.

654
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,380
How do you know

655
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,380
my sister has a talent for jewelry?

656
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,900
You met her again?

657
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,860
That day, I happened

658
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,460
to see her modifying the jewelry design.

659
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,380
The style is truly unique and ingenious.

660
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,740
Is there anything else?

661
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,660
We just ate some snacks,

662
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,820
and took a boat ride.

663
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,700
There's nothing more.

664
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,300
And it is cloudy.

665
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,340
Good!

666
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,220
- Thank you all.
- Good poem!

667
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,240
The flowers are arranged

668
00:30:41,264 --> 00:30:42,756
resting in the courtyard's shade.

669
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,550
The breeze follows the person,

670
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,540
and the sunlight lingers.

671
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,240
The tea party of the Yin Family

672
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,220
is extraordinarily elegant.

673
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,860
What a good poem!

674
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,380
Sir, you're highly talented.

675
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,540
This is Censor Yin.

676
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,820
Nice to meet you, Mr. Yin.

677
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,660
No need to be so polite.

678
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,820
(Yin Licheng)

679
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,740
This is...?

680
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,020
I am Lu Chang from Jianglin.

681
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,270
Nice to meet you, Censor Yin.

682
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,540
My classmate

683
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,790
has admired you for a long time,

684
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,920
so he came to pay a visit.

685
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,900
Good.

686
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,940
With the arrival of young talents,

687
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,580
the tea party

688
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,740
can continue the literary tradition

689
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,540
and preserve its elegant charm.

690
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,820
Please follow me to take your seats.

691
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:38,420
(Runwen Study)

692
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,420
Lady Mingshu.

693
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,800
Let's go.

694
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,080
I'll take you to meet my auntie.

695
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,500
You go first.

696
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,780
Has anyone discovered you?

697
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,620
Lady Liangjun.

698
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,300
(Flourishing Flowers and Wealth)

699
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,260
What are you doing here?

700
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,620
Just now I saw Shujun walking fast.

701
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,990
I guess something urgent came up,

702
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,020
so I came over to see

703
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,100
if I could help her.

704
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,340
Just now

705
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,780
I heard a man's voice.

706
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,340
I wonder who is here.

707
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,900
What man?

708
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,980
I'm just watering the flowers.

709
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,740
Today, our family is hosting guests.

710
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,860
It is not surprising to have a man here.

711
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,660
Lady Mingshu,

712
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,060
did you just hear it?

713
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,020
I only saw you here,

714
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,340
so I came over to greet you.

715
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,060
You are always watching me

716
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,660
and claim to have seen a man.

717
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,900
What is your real intention?

718
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,420
Could it be that you want to frame me

719
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,540
for secretly meeting a man?

720
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,980
Shujun, you get me wrong.

721
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,460
I absolutely did not mean that.

722
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,460
I thought

723
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,300
I must have misheard.

724
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,620
Lu Mingshu,

725
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,360
I really don't need a reading lady.

726
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,500
If you're smart, then leave by yourself.

727
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,580
Otherwise,

728
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,020
I always have a way to drive you away.

729
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,340
What can I do?

730
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,900
It was the Madam who invited me.

731
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,060
You better tell the Madam

732
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,260
what you're thinking.

733
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,820
If the Madam asked me to leave,

734
00:33:50,844 --> 00:33:51,944
I would leave.

735
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,580
(Flourishing Flowers and Wealth)

736
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,460
Where are you going?

737
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,300
Naturally, I'm going to meet my parents.

738
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,780
You don't even understand the rule,

739
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,580
yet you want to be my reading lady.

740
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,220
I also need to meet the Madam.

741
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,620
I'll go with you.

742
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,220
Master.

743
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,980
Gentlemen,

744
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,860
I'm sorry.

745
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,220
I have some matters to handle.

746
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,180
Please excuse me for my leave.

747
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,220
Please.

748
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,780
Mr. Song.

749
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,060
Mr. Jiang.

750
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,300
Mr. Song,

751
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,950
I have something urgent at home,

752
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,860
so I came specifically to say goodbye.

753
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,420
Censor Yin has left for a matter.

754
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,990
I can convey the message for you.

755
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,300
Thank you.

756
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,340
(Jiang Wenrui)

757
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,980
(Rui)

758
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,740
(Prosperity and Happiness)

759
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,580
Greetings, Mother.

760
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,980
- Greetings, Auntie.
- Auntie.

761
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,380
Today the Master is hosting guests.

762
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,740
You don't have to be here specifically

763
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,580
to pay respects.

764
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,020
Go back to our rooms.

765
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

766
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,340
Wait a minute.

767
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,780
You troublemaker!

768
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,540
Alright, lord,

769
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,900
why are you angry?

770
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,700
It is all thanks to your good daughter.

771
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,500
Before,

772
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,140
she pushed the nanny into the water.

773
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,020
That's not enough yet.

774
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,460
Today she made the teacher angry in class.

775
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,740
Now it's good.

776
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,220
She has resigned.

777
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,100
Master,

778
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,860
come on and sit down.

779
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,620
Lord,

780
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,220
she may have resigned

781
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,020
due to health issues.

782
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,780
Please don't be angry.

783
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,260
You're still protecting her.

784
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,620
You pushing the nanny into the water

785
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,940
has actually reached the ears

786
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,380
of some old officials in the court.

787
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,820
They blame me for not teaching you properly.

788
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,020
As a dignified censor,

789
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,300
I usually impeach others,

790
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,740
but I never expected

791
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,620
to be criticized by others today.

792
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,820
You have embarrassed me so much.

793
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,260
Lord...

794
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,140
(It's not Lady Shujun's first mistake.)

795
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,140
(But why did the teacher resign today?)

796
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,580
If you truly are filial to me,

797
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,780
no need to stand on ceremony.

798
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,700
Taking good care of yourself is enough.

799
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,700
What's wrong?

800
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,420
Am I wrong?

801
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,020
Your actions alone

802
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,820
have ruined the reputation of the Yin Family.

803
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,300
Do you know how serious it is?

804
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,140
I never expected to be so outrageous

805
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,700
in your heart.

806
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,700
Have you ever considered my feelings?

807
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,200
Talking more is useless.

808
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,020
I'm leaving.

809
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,180
You...!

810
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,700
Today I still have to entertain guests.

811
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,940
Keep an eye

812
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,340
on her closely.

813
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,860
No more mistakes are allowed.

814
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,500
Okay.

815
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,860
You go back first.

816
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,100
Lady Lu, please stay.

817
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,940
We pass down our legacy through literature.

818
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,900
Children must study every single day.

819
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,700
It is essential to find another teacher.

820
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,020
Mr. Yin,

821
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,100
you seem to be worried about the teacher.

822
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,020
I happen to be free these days.

823
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,420
If you don't mind,

824
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,380
I can take the place for a while.

825
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,460
You are knowledgeable and talented,

826
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,820
with both virtue and ability.

827
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,300
Since you are willing to do it,

828
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,900
I'm glad of it.

829
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,880
I'm willing to work with Mr. Song

830
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,340
to share the worries for you.

831
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,380
You really struck gold this time.

832
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,580
Mr. Lu is Prefectural Graduate from Jianglin.

833
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,420
I'm glad of it.

834
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,660
Then thank you for your help.

835
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,340
If you do not mind,

836
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,140
you can temporarily stay at my residence

837
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,020
to avoid the troubles of travel.

838
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,420
I will arrange it right away.

839
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

840
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,020
Xianjun has informed me

841
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,360
about the incident at the inn.

842
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,300
I believe

843
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,380
in your character.

844
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,460
Thank you for your affirmation.

845
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,380
You must be aware of Shujun's situation.

846
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,280
The previous reading ladies

847
00:39:51,304 --> 00:39:52,256
were all afraid of her,

848
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,380
and were under her control.

849
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,340
You stand against her,

850
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,300
showing no fear at all.

851
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,740
It is evident you're smart and courageous.

852
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,340
This position is meant for you.

853
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,780
I will definitely fulfill my duties

854
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,140
to alleviate your worries.

855
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,980
Good.

856
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,940
You can rest assured.

857
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,980
I will not treat you poorly.

858
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,420
Aside from the reward,

859
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,960
your monthly allowance in the residence

860
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,140
is the same as the girls'.

861
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,340
If you can find the root cause

862
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,940
of Shujun's drastic change in temperament

863
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,750
and guide her back to the right path,

864
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,380
there will be great rewards.

865
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,820
I will do my best.

866
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,100
However, if you want me to do something,

867
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,420
you need to give me some authority;

868
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,620
I can't always be controlled by Lady Shujun.

869
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,260
This is natural.

870
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,540
As long as things are reasonable,

871
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,260
you can make decisions on your own

872
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,740
when facing issues.

873
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,460
Thank you, Madam.

874
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,820
Shishu.

875
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,060
Mr. Song.

876
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,260
Scholar Fang is coming to the residence.

877
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,940
The Master asked me to call you back.

878
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,860
You go back first and report to them,

879
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,300
saying that I will return later.

880
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,460
This will definitely make the Master angry.

881
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,000
I will explain to him after I return.

882
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,780
Alright.

883
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,580
I just saw Mr. Yin

884
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,020
lecturing Lady Shujun that way.

885
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,860
Is he usually like this?

886
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,940
The Master and the Madam

887
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,860
have always regarded her as a treasure.

888
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,060
He was just angry a moment ago

889
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,940
and was somewhat frustrated.

890
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,660
I see that Lady Liangjun

891
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,180
is quite kind-hearted.

892
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,860
She's very popular, right?

893
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,740
Lady Liangjun has a gentle temperament.

894
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,460
And also because her father

895
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,220
died on the battlefield many years ago,

896
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,340
and her mother also passed away sadly,

897
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,340
so the Master and the Madam

898
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,140
have always regarded her as their own

899
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,780
and raised her themselves.

900
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,380
I see.

901
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,620
Feixue. Feixue.

902
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,500
Lady Liangjun, why are you in a hurry?

903
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,860
Feixue is gone.

904
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,460
- Feixue!
- I'll go help her.

905
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,500
Feixue!

906
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,140
Oh no. Could it be

907
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,100
Lady Shujun will throw Feixue into the water?

908
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,700
Shujun, please show mercy.

909
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,340
It's all right, it's all right.

910
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,700
What?

911
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,180
Can't I touch it?

912
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,700
I did not mean that.

913
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,740
I know you don't like cats.

914
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,820
I was careless.

915
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,300
In the future, I won't let it disturb you.

916
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,580
Then keep this beast under good watch.

917
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,740
Otherwise...

918
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,460
In the past, any cat or rabbit

919
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,660
that Lady Shujun touched would die.

920
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,100
Lady Liangjun is also afraid.
