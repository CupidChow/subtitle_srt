One is your elder brother.

29

The other is someone who fancies you.

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,510
I must say,
today's your most glorious moment.

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,870
Mr. Lu and my cousin

32
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,430
were already handsome.

33
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,000
Today they're even more dazzling.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,920
Judging by this spectacle,
who knows how many young ladies

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,630
in the capital will swoon over them?

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,240
All their bickering back and forth

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
is so exhausting.

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,520
My ears are about to ache.

39
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,430
But Mingshu,

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,630
you'll have your hands full.

41
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,590
What would keep me busy?

42
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,240
- Lady Lu!
- Lady Lu!

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,190
- Lady Lu!
- Lady Lu!

44
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,840
Lady Lu...

45
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,280
Lady Lu, you're exceptionally beautiful.

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,590
The top scholar's family truly produces
outstanding talents.

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,900
I'm the fifth of the Chen Family.

48
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,030
Meeting you here today

49
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,120
is truly my fate.

50
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,680
If you don't mind,

51
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,910
we should visit each other often.

52
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,590
- That's right.
- What do you think?

53
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,800
We should also interact more.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,590
We're all sisters here.

55
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,830
If you ever need anything later,

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,310
just ask directly.

57
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,240
- Yeah.
- Right.

58
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,430
Since you sisters are so sincere,

59
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,960
I won't stand on ceremony.

60
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,190
You must all know

61
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,800
that our Hualang Pavilion

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,180
has just been established
in the capital.

63
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,120
I need your generous support.

64
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,800
I'll give you discounts.

65
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,190
We'll definitely support you.

66
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,190
No problem.

67
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,910
I need monthly purchases anyway.

68
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,190
My gold accessories
will trouble you henceforth.

69
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,750
- Think of this...
- Thank you.

70
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,430
- as a deposit.
- Thank you.

71
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,910
I happen to need headpieces as gifts.

72
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,210
- This is mine.
- I came first.

73
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,240
Thank you.

74
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,750
This is getting increasingly absurd.

75
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,960
The parade ended so quickly?

76
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,590
So soon?

77
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,430
Let's go.

78
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,280
- Lady Lu!
- Lady Lu!

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,840
There.

80
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,870
Let's go.

81
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,590

watching Buddy today?

129
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,510
Those young ladies

130
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,750
threw flowers and sachets at Buddy.

131
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,950
They nearly knocked him dizzy.

132
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,040
What's that called again?

133
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,120

135
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,510
You're happier than he is.

136
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,760
Mother,

137
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,480
which maiden in Jianglin

138
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,240
was Buddy betrothed to?

139
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,390
Why have I never heard you mention this?

140
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,560
Betrothal?

141
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,870
What betrothal?

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,720
Today during groom-snatching,

143
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,870
Buddy said he's engaged.

144
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
Here's the thing.

145
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,800
When Chang was in Jianglin,

146
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,800
he grew up with a maiden.

147
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,630
They were childhood sweethearts.

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I genuinely

149
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,000
liked her too.

150
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,600
But he

151
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,800
had no interest

152
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,390
in romance back then

153
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,270
and cruelly rejected her.

154
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,750
Thus they missed their chance.

155
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,070
Otherwise, he'd be

156
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,800
someone else's son-in-law.

157
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,830
This really happened?

158
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,800
So...

159
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,310
can't it be mended?

160
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,070
It's been a long time.

161
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,480
Although he regrets it,

162
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,070
after so many hardships,

163
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,430
circumstances change.

164
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
It's no longer possible

165
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,950
to renew that bond.

166
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,000
So Buddy has

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,830
such a complicated past.

168
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,830
Not entirely hopeless.

169
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,120
Mingshu,

170
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,680
if you were that maiden,

171
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,920
given a chance to reunite with Chang,

172
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,480
would you forgive the past

173
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,510
and start over with him?

174
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,070
If my sincere heart

175
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,000
was coldly rejected,

176
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,400
I'd...

177
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,040
I'd never linger

178
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,920
or try again.

179
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,600
Even if reunited,

180
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,360
our affection wouldn't be the same.

181
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,510
It's better to part ways.

182
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,840
Mr. Lu!

183
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,160
Mr. Lu.

184
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,510
Tangli?

185
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,670
Madam Zeng,

186
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,560
it's me.

187
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,960
Mr. Lu,

188
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,000
may we speak privately?

189
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,240
Good.

190
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,550
I have some questions too.

191
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,230
Zaozao,

192
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,870
is Su Tangli

193
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,550
the Jianglin maiden

194
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,390
Buddy was engaged to?

195
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,790
You don't know either?

196
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,200
Though they were childhood sweethearts,

197
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,960
from what I know,

198
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,320
Lady Su

199
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,510
isn't the same person anymore.

200
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,440
But

201
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,960
Buddy still cherishes old feelings

202
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,480
and can't forget her.

203
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,390
I went to the academy seeking you.

204
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,030
The headmaster said you had left.

205
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,360
Where did you go?

206
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,510
To clear my father's name,

207
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,550
I can't remain confined at the academy.

208
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,960
I'm now at Prince Yu Residence.

209
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,910
Why Prince Yu?

210
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,270
Prince Rui follows laws strictly.

211
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,550
Does that guarantee justice?

212
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,670
When my father was framed
and the evidence seemed irrefutable,

213
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,720
the law made a conviction inevitable.

214
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,270
Could Prince Rui help then?

215
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,600
Prince Yu's different.

216
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,720
He achieves his goals by any means.

217
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,720
Since both use others,

218
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,670
why don't I choose a sharper blade?

219
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,390
One that can slaughter my foes.

220
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,720
Prince Rui was indeed powerless then.

221
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,790
But now he's pushing for a retrial.

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,390
He appointed the Minister
of Supreme Court

223
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,750
and recruited me

224
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,840
for this purpose.

225
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,480
Besides, he promised

226
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,990
to protect you.

227
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,200
Currently, you're in high demand.

228
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,750
To attract talent,

229
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,360
he must cater to your interests.

230
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,680
For those in power,

231
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,630
such tactics

232
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,480
are mere convenient gestures.

233
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,750
How could you not understand?

234
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,720
Nowadays,
Prince Rui faces court criticism.

235
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,120
He's not the ideal patronage.

236
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,670
Why not join Prince Yu?

237
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,550
If you can use his power and methods,

238
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,670
you can definitely become powerful

239
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,150
and boost your ambitions.

240
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,840
I only know Prince Yu clings to old ways

241
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,270
and protects established powers.

242
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,750
He conflicts with my goals.

243
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,320
Moreover, have you considered

244
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,600
your father's death

245
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,080
was Prince Yu's faction's doing?

246
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,750
Naturally, I suspected it.

247
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,870
If that's the case,

248
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,150
being near Prince Yu

249
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,240
can aid my investigation.

250
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,550
Don't worry.

251
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,080
Those who harmed my father,

252
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
even if it's Prince Yu,

253
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,200
will face my blade.

254
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,800
Tangli,

255
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,390
I vowed to clear your father's name.

256
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,550
Why are you risking yourself?

257
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,320
Can your dangerous path now

258
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,630
truly honor his memory?

259
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,270
You don't have to persuade me.

260
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,120
You have your way.

261
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,080
I have mine.

262
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,870
If you won't join me with Prince Yu,

263
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,200
then henceforth,

264
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,750
let's each take care.

265
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:39,420
(Everlasting Prosperity)

266
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,150
Lady Su approaches Lu Chang.

267
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,150
He seems unconvinced.

268
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,150
As a top scholar,

269
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,550
Lu Chang avoids central posts

270
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,200
and chooses the Supreme Court.

271
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,480
He acts on his own principles.

272
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
Su Tangli has

273
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,960
all revenge but no substance.

274
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,550
How can she sway Lu Chang?

275
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,480
They're fundamentally different.

276
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,550
As Su Changhua's daughter,

277
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,480
Lady Su is devoted to you.

278
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,120
Your Highness,
aren't you wary of her motives?

279
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,360
Life's often dull.

280
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,080
I'll play her game

281
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,790
to make good entertainment.

282
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,990
Isn't that right?

283
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,910
This outcome displeases you.

284
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,960
Your Highness, what to do?

285
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,120
Must you ask?

286
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,550
Follow the old rule.

287
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,870
Let her die once.

288
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,700
(Liluo Pavilion)

289
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,390
If she flees after waking,

290
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,870
don't give her a second chance.

291
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,120
Bury her directly.

292
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,910
(Prince Yu placed me here)

293
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,200
(instead of killing me outright.)

294
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,910
(This is clearly a test.)

295
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:32,540
(Liluo Pavilion)

296
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,360
I thought you were clever,

297
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,360
but it turns out you're useless.

298
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,000
Our house keeps no idlers.

299
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,750
How dare you return?

300
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,150
Did His Highness order my expulsion?

301
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,990
This...

302
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,320
Does that have to be said?

303
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,550
Without his order,

304
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,270
you act presumptuously.

305
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,200
Is this also the rule of your house?

306
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,150
I won't argue with you.

307
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,510
Handle yourself!

308
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,000
Though branches are damaged,

309
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,030
if the roots remain intact,

310
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,750
I believe you'll recover fully.

311
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,560
Lu Chang.

312
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,990
Lu Chang!

313
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,470
What's so urgent?

314
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,470
Where's Mingshu?

315
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,800
In Hualang Pavilion.

316
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,800
See for yourself.

317
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,620
(Jianglin Prefecture:
Lu Chang is going to the capital.)

318
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,060
(Mother: Zeng Yuqing, 40;
Sister: Mingshu, 18.)

319
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,600
This is... my travel permit
with Mother and Mingshu

320
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,150
on the way to the capital.

321
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,800
As a new top scholar,

322
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,020
your permit and household register
need to be moved to the capital.

323
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,030
These documents clearly state

324
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,270
that Mingshu is your sister.

325
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,310
But Mingshu's never entered
Lu's household register.

326
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,750
If they mismatch,

327
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,270
the court will investigate thoroughly.

328
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,480
At that time, hiding Mingshu's identity

329
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,590
would be impossible.

330
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,440
That's right.

331
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,320
But the official transporting
the household register is on the way.

332
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,070
What to do?

333
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,760
There's no time.

334
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,590
I must alter our household register.

335
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,510
Lady, you have excellent taste.

336
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,550
Why didn't my cousin come?

337
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,550
Glad you like it.

338
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,510
He will join

339
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,070
the Hanlin Academy soon.

340
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,110
He's busy studying officialdom.

341
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,750
Since when is he so interested
in his career?

342
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,750
It's all for Lady Mingshu.

343
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,800
When Lady Mingshu lay gravely ill,

344
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,190
she needed Ningxin Pills
to save her life.

345
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,400
Master learned of his affection
for Lady Lu

346
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,680
and used the medicine as leverage

347
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,720
to make him sever ties.

348
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,070
Young Master refused,

349
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,310
so he forcibly took the medicine.

350
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,750
Then he was caned for four hours

351
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,000
and was whipped severely.

352
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,680
Despite his injuries,

353
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,750
he still tended Lady Mingshu
day and night.

354
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,510
My cousin

355
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,550
went all out.

356
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,160
Though Lady Mingshu didn't accept,

357
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,750
he wouldn't give up.

358
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,510
Now he enters officialdom
to seek independence

359
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,680
and properly court his love.

360
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,200
The transporting official

361
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,460
has settled on the capital's outskirts.

362
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,720
Are you sure you'll do this?

363
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,440
This would break the law.

364
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,880
And once the household register changes,

365
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,750
your sibling bond will become a fact.

366
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,830
All your feelings can never surface.

367
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,800
Enough.

368
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,350
Protecting Mingshu matters most.

369
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,190
Shujun,

370
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,310
what makes a good marriage?

371
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,880
You know about me and Jiang Wenrui.

372
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,790
For me,

373
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,880
romance is fleeting.

374
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,960
Instead of passion,

375
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,480
it's better to value character.

376
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,400
At least he can keep his promises.

377
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,350
Indeed.

378
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,440
Although you and Prince Rui
are in a marriage alliance,

379
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,750
you respect

380
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,110
and cherish each other.

381
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,510
It's perfect harmony.

382
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,880
I wonder,

383
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,270
since Qingzhao's so sincere to me,

384
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,680
should I respond?

385
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,590
You seem well-matched.

386
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,160
But the decision is yours.

387
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,070
Actually, Prince Rui and I

388
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,920
are not as perfect as you think.

389
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,550
All was fine

390
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,310
until he learned

391
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,160
of Jiang Wenrui.

392
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,440
These days,

393
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,310
he doesn't seem
as enthusiastic as before.

394
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,960
Our future is uncertain.

395
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,160
Don't worry.

396
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,590
During your scandal earlier,

397
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,200
Prince Rui insisted
on your marriage alliance.

398
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,270
It shows

399
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,880
his broad-mindedness among men.

400
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,720
Yet I still don't know

401
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,000
his true thoughts.

402
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,920
Mingshu, if you were in my place,

403
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,350
what would you do?

404
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,880
You have to ask yourself.

405
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,750
What are your true feelings

406
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,310
for Prince Rui?

407
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Before marriage,

408
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,790
I sought peaceful coexistence.

409
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,790
But after the wedding,

410
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,960
I grew to admire him.

411
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,590
In fact, in my heart,

412
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
I'm content.

413
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,480
If it were me,

414
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,960
I'd clarify with him.

415
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,720
Let him know my heart.

416
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,720
Isn't Wen'an suggesting an outing?

417
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,200
You can invite Prince Rui
to go with you.

418
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,510
At that time, amid spring scenery,

419
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,960
you can have an honest talk.

420
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,000
How do you like that?

421
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,960
Good idea.

422
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,000
Buddy!

423
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,270
When did you get back?

424
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,400
You... I...

425
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,590
What's wrong, Buddy?

426
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,880
Something happened?

427
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,790
Nothing.

428
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,270
I'm just reminiscing.

429
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,680
I'm sorry.

430
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,590
♪As time quietly slips away♪

431
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,670
♪Don't let us miss growing old together♪

432
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,000
It's okay. It's all over.

433
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,750
♪Let greed and wrath fade with the wind♪

434
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,050

♪Through years with sincere love♪

437
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,110
Why do you wait for me here?

438
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,310
It's so cold at night.

439
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,550
You could catch a cold.

440
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,160
I have something to discuss with you.

441
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,550
You delayed,

442
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,750
so I fell asleep.

443
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,160
What matters?

444
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,070
You once said

445
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,030
love is love.

446
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,000
It's not born of gratitude

447
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,750
and it's not bowed to convention.

448
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,320
I...

449
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,160
yearn for this.

450
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,160
But

451
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,350
seeing Wen'an

452
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,790
and Shujun's experiences,

453
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,960
I understand

454
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,790
passion may not bring a good outcome.

455
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,750
Learning of Qingzhao's devotion today,

456
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,110
I'm moved.

457
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,550
Yet I recall your warning.

458
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,960
So I came to ask you.

459
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,790
May I try... with him?

460
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,110
Yes.

461
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,070
Buddy, do you...

462
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,750
agree?

463
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,200
(Buddy permits me and Qingzhao.)

464
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,240
(Yet I'm not as happy as I thought)

465
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,750
(and I feel)

466
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,920
(an unexpected emptiness.)

467
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,100
(Liangzhou Prefecture)

468
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,030
Now your Jianglin household register

469
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,880
has been transferred here.

470
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
Please check it,

471
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,920
sign it and put your fingerprints on it.

472
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,060
(Son: Lu Chang, 22;
Daughter: Lu Mingshu, 18.)

473
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,830
Sign and fingerprint if it's correct.

(Lu Mingshu)

478
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,240
Buddy, it's your turn.

479
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,390
Go.

480
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,180
(Lu)

481
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,900
(Lu Chang)

482
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,420
(Lu Chang)

483
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,700

485
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,540
(Hualang Pavilion)

486
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,670
I know all about it.

487
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,750
You defied your father for me.

488
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,400
And then for a few days,

489
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,680
you took care of me all night.

490
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,510
You still completed
the Metropolitan Exam.

491
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,830
It's too overexerted.

492
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,400
I made you some ginseng chicken soup

493
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,390
for your health.

494
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,520
Mingshu,

495
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,720
thank you for being so nice to me.

496
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,240
You care for me, so I reciprocate.

497
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,350
Drink it while it's warm.

498
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,400
How's the taste?

499
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,280
Ying Xun,

500
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,750
am I being punished?

501
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,830
When she liked me,

502
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,480
I ignored her.

503
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,560
All right.

504
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,960
Now she's with another,

505
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
leaving us drinking here.

506
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,150
You...

507
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,920
I thought

508
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,750
if they

509
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,270
didn't unite,

510
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,750
maybe

511
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,120
I might...

512
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
have a chance later.

513
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,160
But now it's done.

514
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,750
Heaven denies this.

515
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,720
What will you do?

516
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,800
Since I chose

517
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,240
this method,

518
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,000
I must be

519
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,160
a proper brother.

520
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,320
I'll support her

521
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,830
and all her decisions.

522
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,960
Real men

523
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,070
find wives easily.

524
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,800
Look,

525
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,510
the capital brims with beauties

526
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,270
and abundant noble ladies.

527
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,270
Perhaps you'll meet

528
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,920
someone better than Mingshu.

529
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,430
No one can...

530
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,400
surpass Mingshu.

531
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,590
Madam Zeng!

532
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,950
- Coming!
- Mingshu!

533
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,910
Coming!

534
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,280
What's wrong?

535
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,760
What happened?

536
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,200
- Drinking too much?
- Madam Zeng.

537
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,240
Why so intoxicated?

538
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,550
Mr. Ying, you know
Buddy can't hold liquor,

539
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,720
so why let him drink?

540
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,350
He insisted.

541
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,550
Impossible! Buddy's usually restrained.

542
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,000
Did something happen?

543
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,720
He seemed troubled yesterday.

544
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
But he wouldn't explain.

545
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,950
Right foot.

546
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,320
Mingshu,

547
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,790
let's get him inside first.

548
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,820
I can't hold him anymore.

549
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,750
Alright, here.

550
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,120
Open the door!

551
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,080
Here.

552
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,350
Let's go.

553
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,800
There's another step.

554
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,330
Mother, please go back.

555
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,500
You and Mr. Ying should rest first.

556
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,920
I'll take care of him.

557
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,560
Okay, I'm a little dizzy.

558
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,350
Then I'll leave it to you.

559
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,840
Okay.

560
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,000
Mother, go get some rest.

561
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,880
Call me if needed.

562
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,790
You can't drink yet overdoes it.

563
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,550
Mingshu...

564
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,560
Are you awake?

565
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,110
How do you feel?

566
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,110
Let me get you some water.

567
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,200
Why are you sitting up?

568
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,160
Our Mingshu...

569
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,590
Mingshu...

570
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,270
Your safety is all that matters.

571
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,750
I...

572
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,920
I'll always be your brother.

573
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,070
I'll protect you forever

574
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,880
and never let you suffer

575
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,400
even the slightest harm.

576
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,750
Whoever you want to marry,

577
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,640
whoever you love,

578
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,230
I'll always support you.

579
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,760
Always support you.

580
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,110
So this is how Buddy acts

581
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,590
when drunk.

582
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,880
Spouting so many sentimental words

583
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,070
made me tear up completely.

584
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,880
How has Su Tangli been recently?

585
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,190
No different from before.

586
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,110
After waking up that day,
she came straight back here.

587
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,590
And she has never left since.

588
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,550
(Everlasting Prosperity)
She truly proves to be someone composed.

589
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,190
It seems her loyalty
to you has deepened.

590
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,160
What?

591
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,360
You still don't fully trust her?

592
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,840
Your Highness, isn't it the same?

593
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:35,860
(Everlasting Prosperity)

594
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,150
Your Highness,
I came to refill your tea.

595
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,760
Su Tangli,

596
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,760
do you truly hold no resentment

597
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,230
towards me?

598
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,000
Resentment?

599
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,630
You took me from Songling Academy

600
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,760
and gave me my freedom.

601
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,710
(Everlasting Prosperity)
And you promised to help me investigate

602
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,190
my late father's case.
I only feel gratitude.

603
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,590
How could there be resentment?

604
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,440
Previously...

605
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,710
Previously, my failure
to persuade Lu Chang

606
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,360
was entirely my fault.

607
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,070
You merely gave me a slight punishment.

608
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360
This is as it should be.

609
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,630
I accept willingly.

610
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,960
Your Highness, please have tea.

611
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,190
I know I've disappointed you.

612
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,480
But I wish to serve you better.

613
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,710
I don't know what else I can do for you.

614
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,190
May I ask for clearer instructions?

615
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,360
Su Tangli,

616
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,880
you're intelligent

617
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,630
and loyal to me.

618
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,800
Let me speak plainly.

619
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,230
Your Highness, please.

620
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,760
My rivalry with Prince Rui

621
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,440
ultimately concerns personnel.

622
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,110
There are talents and mediocrities.

623
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,840
Since Lu Chang refuses to join me,

624
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,960
we'll set him aside.

625
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,960
But some mediocrities without merit

626
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,630
still occupy court positions.

627
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,590
You refer to those who sway

628
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,360
with the wind at court?

629
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,550
Some people won't repent
until facing death.

630
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,840
I've long wanted to warn them.

631
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,670
I'm ready to serve.

632
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,590
Is this your handkerchief?

633
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,880
Any problem?

634
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,640
No.

635
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,190
Good!

636
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,150
Lady Su

637
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,230
reminds me of someone.

638
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,150
Mr. Zhang, what do you mean?

639
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,960
This face and figure

640
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,510
clearly belong

641
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,670
to Su Tangli
of the Imperial Music Office.

642
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,480
I told you.

643
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,070
Mr. Zhang,
perhaps you should look closer.

644
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,910
Good!

645
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,120
Come here.

646
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,760
Let me examine it properly.

647
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,510
I wasn't wrong.

648
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,760
She is Su Tangli!

649
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:16,910
Lady Su,

650
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,030
weren't you dead?

651
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,000
Why did you appear
at Prince Yu Residence?

652
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,150
Could it be

653
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,480
that you missed me?

654
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,430
Outrageous!

655
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,000
Before the banquet began,
Prince Yu declared

656
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,960
I belonged to his household.

657
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,840
Yet you publicly treat me

658
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,400
as a convict slave to harass.

659
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,470
Mr. Zhang,

660
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,550
do you disregard Prince Yu?

661
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,510
I dare not!

662
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,280
Please forgive me, Lady.

663
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,920
Forgive me, Prince Yu!

664
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,440
Prince Yu!

665
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,600
Prince Yu...

666
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,430
Mr. Zhang,

667
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,550
how dare you speak wildly

668
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,190
in my house?

669
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,760
Spare me, Prince Yu!

670
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:12,880
I'll serve you

671
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,920
faithfully and devotedly

672
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,360
henceforth!

673
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,920
We vow loyalty to Prince Yu!

674
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,000
All present are pillars of the court.

675
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,110
Today's scene touches my heart.

676
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,430
In the future,

677
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,920
I'll reward you properly.

678
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,760
Thank you, Prince Yu!

679
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,680
Mother.

680
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,670
I know your feelings for Mingshu.

681
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,840
But circumstances being so,

682
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,510
you must learn to let go.

683
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,110
Song Qingzhao is upright.

684
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,280
Sincerely he cares for Mingshu,

685
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,000
if he can truly make her happy,

686
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,070
I'll remain as her brother

687
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,280
and silently bless them.

688
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,320
So you've accepted?

689
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,320
I'm afraid

690
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,840
to disappoint your kindness.

691
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,550
Material things mean nothing.

692
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,070
I just want to know
if I'm in your heart.

693
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,510
Have you forgotten everything?

694
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,510
You have grand ambitions.

695
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,960
I have no wish to stay.

696
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,710
After parting,

697
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,480
even if we meet again,

698
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,960
we'll be strangers.

699
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,000
May your future

700
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,190
grow like bamboo

701
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,920
and rise ever higher.

702
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,840
(Forgetting is better.)

703
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,030
I know you prioritize me, Buddy.

704
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,590
But you're equally

705
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,920
my most important person.

706
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,200
(Mingshu,)

707
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,030
(from now on,)

708
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,400
(however hard or unwilling,)

709
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:05,550
(I'll bury these feelings.)

710
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,110
(Watching you find happiness)

711
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,920
