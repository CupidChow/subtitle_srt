What brings you to Ning'an?

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,480
And you? Why are you here?

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,070
Prince Yu caused the unjust death
of my family,

31
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,680
yet he remains unscathed.

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,840
How can I swallow this anger?

33
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,430
I discovered that

34
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,100
he visits Ning'an every year
to celebrate

35
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,350
the birthday of his nurse, Nanny Lin.

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,120
You have regained your civil status.

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,560
You could start afresh.

38
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,870
Are you sure about this way?

39
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,920
What about you?

40
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,800
You have a loving mother and a brother.

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,870
Why are you here?

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,080
Lu Chang

43
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,360
is the top scholar, bathed in virtue.

44
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,120
But I...

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,120
I'm no longer the Jian Mingshu,

46
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,470
who is bright.

47
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,870
When I close my eyes,

48
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,960
all I see is my father's death

49
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,800
and Xiao Qingting's demise.

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,520
It tortures me like a hellish abyss.

51
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,190
There is no escape from this torment.

52
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,870
I can't go back.

53
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,400
There's no other way.

54
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,380
(Tablet of My Late Father Su Changhua)

55
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
Jian Mingshu,

56
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,430
you've become like me now.

57
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,150
If that's the case,

58
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,400
let's finish this together.

59
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,980
(Lin Residence)

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,470
The heart, never satiated,

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,360
craves endlessly

62
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,240
and breeds sin.

63
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,000
But the Bodhisattva

64
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,470
teaches contentment,

65
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,800
cherishing simplicity

66
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,910
and wisdom.

67
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,240
May the Bodhisattva bless us.

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,960
Amitabha.

69
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,190
Nanny Lin now looks after
the Lin Family.

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,800
Devout in her Buddhist faith,
she's known for her charity,

71
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,420
such as building bridges and roads,

72
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,700
distributing rice, donating medicine,

73
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,120
and founding schools.

74
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,560
All of Ning'an

75
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,710
has benefited from her kindness.

76
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,030
Everyone calls her

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,300
the Benevolent Matriarch.

78
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,360
The Benevolent Matriarch?

79
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,280
Originally, I tried to infiltrate
the Lin Residence as a maid.

80
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,270
So I went to find Madam Li,

81
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,120
who recruits servants for them.

82
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,830
But she turned out

83
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,920
to be an impostor.

84
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,070
A wealthy household like the Lin Family

85
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,270
would never hire women
of unknown origin.

86
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,070
Since Nanny Lin
is both worshipped by Prince Yu

87
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,480
and praised for her virtue,

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,160
she's not an easy character.

89
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,480
We must find another way
to approach her.

90
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,000
In a few days,

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,700
she'll visit the Ciyun Temple
to give alms.

92
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,680
Perhaps we can intercept her there.

93
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,000
But

94
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
even though Nanny Lin
is Prince Yu's nurse,

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,100
she has no direct connection
to the case.

96
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,800
How could you
target an innocent old woman?

97
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,960
It's not like you.

98
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,510
The man who chased me,

99
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,040
drove me off a cliff,

100
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,420
and slaughtered 37 members of my family

101
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,330
was Cao Hai, Deputy Commander
of Jianglin Prefecture Garrison.

102
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,430
Tonight,

103
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,390
let's do it neatly.

104
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,950
Leave no Jian Family alive.

105
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,960
Lady...

106
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,400
Who's there?

107
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,000
Guards!

108
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,950
Cao Hai is probably a member
of the Lin Family.

109
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,680
What kind of innocence does she possess

110
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,160
to raise such a demon?

111
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,880
Cao Hai?

112
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,190
His family name
was probably changed by Prince Yu

113
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,680
to hide his identity.

114
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,040
But how did you
discover Cao Hai's background?

115
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,000
I had Consort Rui
investigate discreetly.

116
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,680
Cao Hai returns

117
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,120
to Ning'an on certain dates

118
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,720
every year,

119
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,240
coinciding

120
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,680
with Nanny Lin's place.

121
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,680
And her birthday is around the time

122
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,590
of Cao Hai's return.

123
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,510
I suspect he's her son.

124
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,270
Are you trying to bring both Prince Yu
and Cao Hai to justice?

125
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,870
I have a plan.

126
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,300
My plan is to infiltrate
the Lin Residence.

127
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,630
When they return,

128
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,830
I'll trap them like turtles in a jar.

129
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,980

130

(Tablet of My Late Father Su Changhua)

131
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,560
I, Tangli, swear this:

132
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,630
Not a single villain shall

133
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,040
escape retribution.

134
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,780
(Tablet of My Late Father Su Changhua)

135
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,800
Before the spirit of my father

136
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,070
and the 37 souls of the Jian Family,

137
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,430
I, Jian Mingshu,

138
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,160
vow to make Prince Yu

139
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,190
and Cao Hai pay.

140
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,940
(Great Buddha's Main Hall)

141
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,430
The heart, never satiated,

142
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,240
craves endlessly

143
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,390
and breeds sin.

144
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,070
But the Bodhisattva

145
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,630
teaches contentment,

146
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,240
cherishing simplicity

147
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,680
and wisdom.

148
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,520
Madam,

149
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,000
this vegetarian meal has been

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,700
specially prepared for you
by Ciyun Temple.

151
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,870
Please eat it while it's still warm.

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,430
May Bodhisattva be compassionate.

153
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,580
(Great Buddha's Main Hall)

154
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,750
Madam, what's wrong?

155
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,040
Suddenly, nausea

156
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,950
and dizziness.

157
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,110
Be careful!

158
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,000
Madam, are you okay?

159
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,390
Master, could you fetch some water?

160
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,520
Of course.

161
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,630
What happened to her?

162
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,040
She's dizzy and nauseous.

163
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Please help her!

164
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay, help her sit down.

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,840
Okay.

166
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,710
Slow down.

167
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,910
Madam,

168
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,260
I'm a trained physician in my clan.

169
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,270
Let me examine you.

170
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,000
Open your mouth.

171
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,390
It's nothing serious.
Your stomach is weak,

172
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,960
aggravated by fatigue.

173
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,790
Take this medicine

174
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,790
to relieve the symptoms.

175
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,910
But this medicine is unfamiliar.

176
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,600
What if it harms her?

177
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,680
Rest assured.

178
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,820
Even healthy people benefit
from its tonic properties.

179
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,230
Here comes the water.

180
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,750
Madam.

181
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,680
How are you feeling?

182
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,000
This medicine works wonders.

183
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,390
Lady, my gratitude.

184
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,440
It treats the symptoms, not the root.

185
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,480
It's not a temporary illness.

186
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,670
You'll need prolonged care

187
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,600
to fully heal.

188
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,790
Will you take care of me?

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,080
I'll reward you handsomely.

190
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,240
I'm just passing through Ning'an

191
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,150
to burn memorial incense for my parents

192
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,200
before I leave.

193
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,600
Memorial incense?

194
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,440
Are your parents

195
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,270
all gone?

196
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,240
Lost in a flood in my hometown.

197
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,480
I alone survived

198
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,030
and wandered as a healer

199
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,200
until I came here.

200
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,440
What a poor child.

201
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,270
Would you live in my family
as my physician?

202
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,200
I'll pay you monthly.

203
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,900
Madam,

204
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,360
I'm moved by your compassion.

205
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,240
I, Shu, will serve

206
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,450
at your side.

207
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,360
Are you sure this will work?

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,960
Those who ingest it

209
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,440
will soon feel dizzy and nauseous,

210
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,390
but will suffer no lasting harm.

211
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,550
I've prepared an antidote
for the mushroom poison.

212
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,600
After drinking the remedy

213
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,440
you prescribed last night,

214
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,390
I slept soundly.

215
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,600
I haven't slept like this in these days.

216
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,080
Indeed. Madam didn't wake once

217
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,120
and seems revitalized today.

218
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,840
Yesterday's examination

219
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,870
revealed that your insomnia

220
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,870
is due to anxiety.

221
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,480
The sedative formula

222
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,030
combined with acupressure

223
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,240
produced these results.

224
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,550
Countless physicians can heal me.

225
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,550
Finally, there's hope.

226
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,560
Yu,

227
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,630
show Shu around later.

228
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,960
Yes.

229
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,540
(Lin Ancestral Hall)

230
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,870
This is the Lin Ancestral Hall.

231
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,840
Please avoid it

232
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,360
normally.

233
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,420
(Lin Ancestral Hall)

234
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,440
Why is the ancestral hall locked

235
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,770
if incense should be burned every day?

236
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,670
I'm not sure.

237
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,030
That's the rule when I got here.

238
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,550
They are only opened

239
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,630
when Master returns every year

240
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,870
for Madam's birthday.

241
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,790
It's all locked up on weekdays.

242
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,620
(Lin Ancestral Hall)

243
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,150
(Opened once a year...)

244
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,750
(What secrets)

245
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,790
(lie within?)

246
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,440
Master only visits once a year?

247
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,910
Yes, he serves in the military,

248
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,480
always occupied.

249
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,440
No wonder I haven't seen him in so long.

250
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,910
He's a decorated hero

251
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,200
and a filial son.

252
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,200
He returns for Madam's birthday

253
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,390
every year.

254
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,440
It's time to come back in a few days.

255
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,840
She eagerly awaits his arrival.

256
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,750
(This fits)

257
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,440
(perfectly with)

258
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,600
(Cao Hai's movements.)

259
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,840
Madam has

260
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,030
instructed you

261
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,790
to stay in the west wing.

262
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,600
Lady Shu, what's wrong?

263
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,440
Why have you been

264
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,790
so troubled lately?

265
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,270
A fellow refugee

266
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,960
worries me.

267
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,790
Her parents perished,

268
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,790
and she toiled

269
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,030
day and night,

270
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,270
only to be cast out

271
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,270
when she fell ill.

272
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,390
Now she's homeless.

273
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,510
How pitiful.

274
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,840
Our kitchen

275
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,030
needs help.

276
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,960
You might bring her here

277
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,080
to give it a try.

278
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,480
That would be great.

279
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,240
I'll get her tomorrow.

280
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,960
Thank you for your kindness.

281
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,870
Lady,

282
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,120
why carry such loads alone?

283
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,200
It's okay.

284
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,840
I'm used to working.

285
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,710
Thank you.

286
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,280
Let me help.

287
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,300
We infiltrated successfully.

288
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,900
Why delay action?

289
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,020
I need to confirm whether Nanny Lin

290
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,460
is Cao Hai's mother.

291
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,660
What if she's innocent?

292
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,900
She is also Prince Yu's wet nurse.

293
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,100
Define innocent.

294
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,460
If she merely nursed him

295
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,430
without knowing of his crimes,
that's one thing.

296
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,420
But if she raised Cao Hai,

297
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,460
that's another thing.

298
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,140
How will you

299
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,980
prove

300
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,260
their relationship?

301
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,380
Don't worry. Answers will come soon.

302
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,300
Madam sent me to give you

303
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,220
some extra bedding.

304
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,860
Thanks.

305
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,700
No need.

306
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,340
Does someone live there?

307
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,380
She's one of

308
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,860
Master's concubines.

309
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,140
And she is pregnant now.

310
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,660
I heard that she has a bad temper.

311
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,780
And she seldom goes outdoors.

312
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,540
(If Master is Cao Hai,)

313
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,500
(could this concubine)

314
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,020
(be...?)

315
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,180
(Lin Residence)

316
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,300
If it weren't for that child,

317
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,890
who would look at this useless wretch?

318
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,940
Let her starve. What a trouble.

319
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,220
Who's there?

320
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,700
Concubine Zhou?

321
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,500
Mingshu, is that you?

322
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,700
You blind woman!

323
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,900
How many times do I have to tell you?

324
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,260
Break another bowl,
and you'll go hungry!

325
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,020
Hurry up! Hide!

326
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,540
Don't you want to eat?

327
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,740
I'm sorry.

328
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,060
I'll clean this up right away.

329
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,100
Disturb my sleep again

330
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,140
and see what happens.

331
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,460
Zhou Xiuqing,

332
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,060
you're still alive.

333
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,740
You conspired with bandits
to slaughter my entire family.

334
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,700
37 lives of the Jian Family

335
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,660
have been extinguished overnight.

336
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,300
Your blood-stained hands

337
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,820
deserve numerous cuts.

338
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,260
The fact that
you only lost your eyes and legs

339
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,060
shows the injustice of Heaven.

340
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,380
I was foolish.

341
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,100
I believed Cao Hai's lies.

342
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,700
I failed your father.

343
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,300
How dare you mention my father!

344
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,460
He treated you well.

345
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,900
Why did you betray him?

346
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,260
I know my mistakes.

347
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,700
These days,

348
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,060
I've repented ceaselessly.

349
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,260
I helped tyrants

350
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,460
and caused the death
of your father, the kindest.

351
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,140
I have wronged the Jian Family,

352
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,020
especially your father.

353
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,100
My entire clan perished unjustly.

354
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,460
Your flimsy repentance

355
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,540
means nothing.

356
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,740
I know...

357
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,100
I know my words

358
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,060
are worthless.

359
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,860
I ask for no forgiveness.

360
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,700
But...

361
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,900
I'll atone for everything.

362
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,020
Command me as you will.

363
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,620
What else do you possess

364
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,820
besides this broken body?

365
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,500
Cao Hai did this.

366
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,700
What is his relationship to Nanny Lin?

367
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,420
You've

368
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,060
guessed it.

369
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,820
Nanny Lin is Cao Hai's mother.

370
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,900
After destroying the Jian Family,

371
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,660
he wanted to silence me.

372
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,100
When he found out I was pregnant,

373
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,100
he spared me.

374
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,060
He imprisoned me.

375
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,540
I tried to escape.

376
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,500
But I couldn't.

377
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,900
After I was recaptured,

378
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,300
they blinded me

379
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,700
and crippled my legs.

380
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,460
I can't get away anymore.

381
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
The old crone had me

382
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,140
locked up here.

383
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,620
You chose this way.

384
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,140
You deserve it.

385
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
I know.

386
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,900
This is my karma.

387
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,060
But Cao Hai is the true culprit.

388
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,540
He deserves to die!

389
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,340
Mingshu...

390
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,380
Mingshu, you came to kill Cao Hai.

391
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,240
Is that right?

392
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,660
Yes, only his death

393
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,500
gives me hope of being alive.

394
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,740
What?

395
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,100
You, so steeped in sin,

396
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,060
dare to hope for life?

397
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,300
I know that my death

398
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,860
can't atone.

399
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,500
But my child...

400
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,460
He's innocent.

401
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,020
I won't let him

402
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,220
become another Cao Hai.

403
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,020
Mingshu,

404
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
if possible,

405
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,860
can you help me escape?

406
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,380
Why would I help

407
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,220
Cao Hai's spawn?

408
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,340
Don't you want

409
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,660
the stolen treasures

410
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,900
of the Jian Family?

411
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,500
They were hidden by Cao Hai
in the Lin Ancestral Hall.

412
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,940
Kill him

413
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,100
to get them back.

414
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,340
As expected.

415
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,100
Has she calmed down lately?

416
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,420
Madam,

417
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,940
the shrew seems resigned.

418
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,540
No recent disturbances.

419
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,220
She knows her place.

420
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,500
However,

421
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,220
she can't stay here.

422
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,660
You know what to do

423
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,740
after the birth.

424
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,340
Yes.

425
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Dismissed.

426
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,860
Yu!

427
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,060
(Lin Ancestral Hall)

428
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,300
(Still locked.)

429
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,460
(How can I get in?)

430
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,460
Sister Yu,

431
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,540
why are you carrying so much?

432
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,060
Where are you going?

433
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,260
This is Madam's newly copied sutras

434
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,740
for the chapel.

435
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,180
Since I'm free,

436
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,100
I'll accompany you.

437
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,540
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's go.

438
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,340
(It's Mother's Guanyin statue.)

439
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,620
(Mother...)

440
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,740
Shu,

441
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,540
what's wrong?

442
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,460
May Guanyin be merciful.

443
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,660
I suddenly...

444
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,100
feel something in my heart.

445
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,940
May I ask

446
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,860
who carved this Guanyin?

447
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,300
It's so vivid.

448
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,940
No wonder you're moved.

449
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,020
This white jade Guanyin is kinder

450
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,500
than others.

451
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,660
Master gave it to Madam

452
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,140
at the end of last year.

453
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,540
I don't know where it came from,

454
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,220
but it's very rare.

455
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,020
Indeed.

456
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,220
(Cao Hai,)

457
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,860
(I'll claim not only your life,)

458
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,780
(but also every copper)

459
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,940
(of the Jian Family's wealth.)

460
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,370
Why are you looking for me suddenly?

461
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,260
Is there trouble?

462
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,020
I've confirmed

463
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,900
that Cao Hai is Nanny Lin's son.

464
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,260
Our treasures are

465
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,460
in the Lin Ancestral Hall.

466
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,140
Concubine Zhou, Cao Hai's accomplice
against the Jian Family,

467
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,540
is hiding in the corner courtyard.

468
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,340
How could Nanny Lin be unaware

469
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,900
of Cao Hai's crimes?

470
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,460
Her luxury

471
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,140
is built

472
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,500
on the wealth of the Jian Family.

473
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,860
I'm afraid her nightly fears

474
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,100
are evidence of her guilty conscience.

475
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,340
That's right.

476
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,420
Cao Hai's hands

477
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,660
are dripping with blood
and countless lives.

478
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,740
Such a beast

479
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,180
deserves

480
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,060
eternal damnation.

481
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,100
I'm afraid that's why

482
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,700
Nanny Lin's constant prayers

483
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,060
and kind acts remain.

484
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,630
She's trying to solve Cao Hai's sins.

485
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,460
On the surface,

486
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,220
she's a good person who does good deeds.

487
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,860
But her false virtue

488
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,500
masks

489
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,260
bones of wealth.

490
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,460
Mingshu,

491
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,460
this is our only chance

492
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,620
to eliminate Prince Yu

493
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,940
and avenge

494
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,340
your Jane Family.

495
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,900
Have you decided?

496
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,460
Your explosives

497
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,700
are here.

498
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,700
Is it deadly enough?

499
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,900
As an ex-soldier,

500
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,300
I give you my word.

501
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,900
They may be weaker

502
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,820
than battlefield equipment,

503
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,140
but don't underestimate them.

504
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,820
They can easily

505
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,540
wipe out entire households.

506
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,500
Sister Yu,

507
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,300
I was just passing by the kitchen.

508
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,580
They seemed to be planning

509
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,740
birthday banquet dishes.

510
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,140
There are 88 dishes!

511
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,540
Are you surprised now?

512
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,700
Madam's filial son

513
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,020
is surpassing.

514
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,100
Previous years

515
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,420
with more dishes.

516
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,660
He'll also invite

517
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,300
day-long operas.

518
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,180
So powerful.

519
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,700
This year, Master says

520
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,900
important guests are coming,

521
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,060
so for politeness,

522
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,020
we'll have fewer invitees.

523
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,100
A household party

524
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,540
will suffice.

525
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,700
Where's the birthday banquet?

526
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,980
It can't be indoors.

527
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,100
This is not going to work.

528
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,900
Naturally, it doesn't work
in this house.

529
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,220
The birthday banquet happens

530
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,460
in this courtyard every year.

531
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,690
- Right here?
- Yeah.

532
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,540
All right, it's all here.

533
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,700
Lu Chang...

534
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,660
You...

535
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,820
Drugged me

536
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,860
and left the capital.

537
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,140
Jian Mingshu,

538
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,260
you're clever.

539
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,540
I wanted a clean break.

540
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,930
You're the one who won't let me go.

541
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,660
Clean break?

542
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,220
I'm telling you.

543
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,700
Don't even think about it.

544
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,820
Lu Chang, I warned you

545
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,460
not to interfere.

546
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,500
Why are you here in Ning'an?

547
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,140
Your target is the Lin Family.

548
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,340
How did you know that?

549
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,510
Finding you missing from Jianglin.

550
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,540
So I connected the clues.

551
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,100
You had Consort Rui

552
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,940
follow Cao Hai.

553
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,700
I guessed

554
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,380
you recalled

555
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,900
Cao Hai's affairs.

556
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,180
Following the trail,

557
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,340
I discovered that Cao Hai's mother

558
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,900
is Prince Yu's wet nurse.

559
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,540
So I conclude that

560
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,020
you take revenge

561
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,980
on Cao Hai

562
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,820
and Prince Yu by attending the banquet.

563
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,060
Lu Chang,

564
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,940
since you know,

565
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,300
why did you come after me?

566
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,100
Can't you just let me

567
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,420
stay as Mingshu in your memories?

568
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,460
Wouldn't that be better?

569
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,100
You've always been you.

570
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,860
But I'm not that person anymore.

571
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,580
I never understood

572
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,980
Su Tangli's ways

573
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,500
and Nanny Lyu's

574
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,620
hateful decisions.

575
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,300
I sympathized with them,
but I disapproved.

576
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,780
Now,

577
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,420
whether I admit it or not,

578
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,660
I've already become one of them.

579
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,500
Jian Mingshu,

580
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,380
what do you want to do?

581
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,060
What do I want to do?

582
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,030
My entire Jian Family, 37 lives,

583
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,900
all died at the hands

584
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,540
of Prince Yu and Cao Hai.

585
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,940
What do you think I want to do?

586
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,700
What do I want to do?

587
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,980
I'm going
to make those corrupt officials

588
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,620
taste bitter fruit.

589
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,620
I'm going to make them repent.

590
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,580
Only then will I

591
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,420
find peace!

592
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,580
Lu Chang,

593
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,100
if you are here to dissuade,

594
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,620
then stop.

595
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,300
I've heard your arguments

596
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,900
and told myself many times.

597
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,980
If they were effective,

598
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,820
I would have been convinced.

599
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,380
Mingshu,

600
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,420
I'm not here to stop you.

601
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,180
These days,

602
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,540
I have been in constant fear.

603
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,100
I'm afraid that
highwaymen would harm you,

604
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,380
that you would be caught

605
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,460
by him at rush,

606
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
and you would fail

607
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,580
in the middle of the road.

608
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,900
I have never been so scared.

609
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,980
I thought about it too.

610
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,100
If something happens to you,

611
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,820
what will I do?

612
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,140
I think I'd go mad.

613
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,260
Whether it be Cao Hai

614
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,180
or others,

615
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,740
I'd tear their flesh apart

616
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,140
piece by piece.

617
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,780
Though my hatred

618
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,980
is not a tenth of yours,

619
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,020
I think they have something in common.

620
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,820
So I understand your choice.

621
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,780
I'll stay.

622
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,340
If you want revenge,

623
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,100
I'll help you.

624
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,980
You can do anything you want.

625
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,860
Okay?

626
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,980
No.

627
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,020
Don't!

628
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,660
Lu Chang, please go back, okay?

629
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,060
Go back to the capital.
Madam Zeng is there.

630
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,860
I don't need your help.

631
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,500
I'll stay.

632
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,980
If you want revenge, I'll help you.

633
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,650
If you have to go to hell,
I'll go with you.

634
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,020
Once I'm here, I won't leave.

635
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,420
I don't want your company.

636
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,460
I don't want your help.

637
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,780
I'm begging you.

638
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,780
Please, Lu Chang. Go back.

639
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,860
I don't like you.

640
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,660
Why don't you dodge?

641
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,020
Dodging

642
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,580
would ruin your bite.

643
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,100
Lu Chang...

644
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,060
I'm tired.

645
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,780
I'm so tired.

646
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,220
I'm so tired...

647
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,780
Don't be afraid.

648
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,500
Rest when you are tired.

649
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,900
What's that?

650
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,060
Are you awake?

651
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,380
Making you a lamb stew with carrots.

652
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,940
You've been

653
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,140
eating badly lately.

654
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,500
Lu Chang,

655
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,700
aren't you leaving?

656
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,900
No.

657
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,540
Where you go,

658
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,500
I follow.

659
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,860
You're the top scholar.

660
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,820
Your ambitions and aspirations...

661
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,900
Madam Zeng, Uncle Wei, Uncle Lu...

662
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,660
They're all abandoned by you?

663
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,980
Yes.

664
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,060
Accompanying me brings you death

665
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,860
and bloodied hands.

666
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,180
You'll get eternal turmoil.

667
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,820
You... Why?

668
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,940
No reason.

669
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,060
Don't convince me,

670
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,060
and I won't convince you.

671
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,620
Lu Chang,

672
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,900
I have changed my mind.

673
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,700
What did you say?

674
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,740
I changed my mind.

675
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,660
You can stay,

676
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,100
but I won't drag you to hell.

677
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,060
Mingshu,

678
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,580
I will not stay

679
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,860
to threaten you with sacrifice.

680
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,260
Don't change for me.

681
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,100
I...

682
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,260
I wish you well,

683
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,300
but I refuse to see your life

684
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,300
consumed by pain and guilt.

685
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,580
When Mother died,

686
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,300
only Father and I were left.

687
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,900
He missed her terribly.

688
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:37,460
He neglected business

689
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,940
and food.

690
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,540
At that time,

691
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,900
I didn't know how to persuade him.

692
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,140
He got sick

693
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,500
but refused medicine.

694
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,900
I had to take his hands

695
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,820
and tell him,

696
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,060
"Father, look.

697
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,020
The left hand is Mother,

698
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,740
and the right hand is me.

699
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,420
Mother is gone,

700
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,220
but I remain.

701
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,500
No medicine

702
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,140
means abandoning me."

703
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,940
He cried bitterly.

704
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,140
And then he recovered slowly.

705
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,180
The left hand

706
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,700
is the dead.

707
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,420
The right hand

708
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,220
is the living.

709
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,260
I struggle

710
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,420
to weigh them,

711
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,540
but I know

712
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,660
I can't

713
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,540
let loved ones

714
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,980
fall into

715
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,660
the abyss

716
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,660
and the pain

717
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,780
for my sake.

718
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,220
Lu Chang,

719
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,540
