28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,710
You belong to the Prince Yu.

29
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,080
Why are you still helping me?

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,200
My name is Qi.

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
Born out of abandonment,

32
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,750
I'm abandoned by others

33
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,960
and sold into servitude.

34
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,750
I was like a lifeless object

35
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,150
until I saw you

36
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,430
trapped in the swamp,

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,120
yet defying the mortal realm.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Only then did I realize
that I'm not an object,

39
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,960
but a human being.

40
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,750
Humans make choices.

41
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,590
Helping you

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,190
is my choice.

43
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,360
To survive under Prince Yu's thumb,

44
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,870
I must make him

45
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,750
reluctant to part with me.

46
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,560
This step is crucial.

47
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,550
Thank you.

48
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,380
(Hualang Pavilion)

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,240
Please come in.

50
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,430
Welcome back.

51
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,270
Please, this way.

52
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,270
Please.

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
These are

54
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,680
our latest designs.

55
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,080
Feel free to inquire about anything

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,000
that catches your eye, Lady.

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,340
(Second Lady of Wei)
Consort Rui, I pay my respects to you.

58
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,660
May you enjoy boundless happiness.

59
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,430
County Princess, greetings.

60
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,080
Second Lady of Wei, it's you.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,840
Please sit down.

62
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,080
To what do we owe your visit

63
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,560
to our Hualang Pavilion?

64
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,030
This gold bracelet belongs
to my sister-in-law.

65
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,120
I admired its intricate design

66
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,520
and wished to have a replica made.

67
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,660
I've heard that your craftsmanship

68
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,240
is second to none,

69
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
so I bring it over here.

70
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,800
This bracelet looks familiar.

71
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,520
The designs are indeed intricate,

72
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,840
but replicating them

73
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,000
shouldn't be a challenge

74
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,310
for our craftsmen.

75
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,120
However, we'll need to keep the original

76
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,470
for reference.

77
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,000
We can return it tomorrow.

78
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,030
Are you satisfied with that?

79
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,590
That's good.

80
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,600
I'll take my leave then.

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,870
Second Lady of Wei,

82
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,950
why do you wear

83
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,120
so many wooden pendants and sachets?

84
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,830
Wouldn't jade jewelry be more elegant?

85
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,190
County Princess,

86
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,040
these are

87
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,950
to ward off evil.

88
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,320
Our household has been plagued
by ghosts lately.

89
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,800
If you know

90
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,390
of any competent exorcists,

91
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,830
please recommend them.

92
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,720
- Ghosts?
- Ghosts?

93
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,000
With Chief Commander Wei
guarding your home,

94
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,720
how could evil spirits dare to enter?

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,040
It doesn't work.

96
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,950
Fear has taken hold of our household.

97
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,070
These subjects will

98
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,070
bring some comfort.

99
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,360
I also need to buy some peachwood

100
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,630
and mugwort.

101
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,870
Farewell for now.

102
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,150
This way, please.

103
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,600
Lady, this way, please.

104
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,720
Did that lady just

105
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,120
mention hauntings?

106
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,190
She also asked

107
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,120
for some

108
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,480
exorcist references.

109
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,270
But best not to dwell on such matters.

110
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,870
There are probably

111
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,040
family secrets.

112
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,880
Mingshu, look at this bracelet.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,630
This is from the Second Lady of Wei.

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,390
She said it belonged
to her sister-in-law,

115
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,630
the wife of Chief Commander Wei.

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,070
Look, doesn't it look like yours?

117
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,310
I recognized it at a glance.

118
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,270
I've never seen such intricate gold work

119
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,190
in the capital,

120
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,390
except for yours.

121
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,600
They seem to be done by the same person.

122
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,630
(I've been wearing)

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,830
(this gold bracelet since my awakening.)

124
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,870
(Discovering its origin)

125
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,870
(may reveal my past.)

126
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,270
You once said

127
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,390
that Chief Commander Wei is formidable.

128
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,430
What's his background?

129
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,920
Speaking of which,

130
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,190
he's a true legend.

131
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,160
He enlisted

132
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,630
as a common soldier

133
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,070
and rose relentlessly

134
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,240
to become

135
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,310
the Chief Commander.

136
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,270
Since you know the Wei Family so well,

137
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,750
are you familiar with Madam Wei?

138
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,390
My mother, Madam Wei,

139
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,160
and Qingzhao's mother

140
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,360
were close friends.

141
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,860
(Wei Residence)

142
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,300
(Siyi Pavilion)

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,840
Here.

144
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,070
How did she become so seriously ill?

145
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,870
The ghosts

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,160
frightened her

147
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,430
into this state.

148
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,470
Nonsense!

149
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,040
There are no ghosts.

150
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,190
(Wei Xian)

151
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,630
She just caught a chill.

152
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,120
(Du Wenhui)
The illness got worse.

153
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,350
Here.

154
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,950
(Nanny Lyu)
Yeah, I agree.

155
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,680
There are no ghosts in the world.

156
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,310
In all my decades of life,

157
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,120
I've never seen any ghosts.

158
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,480
Your frailty

159
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,720
must have created

160
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,680
this illness.

161
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,840
Ruoyi,

162
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,480
your visit

163
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
has already revived me.

164
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,000
I thought

165
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,390
you'd all forgotten me.

166
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,390
What are you talking about?

167
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,390
Although we haven't seen each other

168
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,510
in a long time,

169
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,070
Yaoqing and I

170
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,600
still care for you.

171
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,360
When we heard about the hauntings,

172
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,390
we decided

173
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,310
to see you anyway.

174
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,750
Yaoqing had an ancestral rite,

175
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,040
so I came first.

176
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,430
But I never thought

177
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,310
you'd be so sick.

178
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,600
Madam Song, your visit

179
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,680
made her happy.

180
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,430
Maybe this disease

181
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,870
will be over in no time.

182
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,040
That's great.

183
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,360
I'll stay with you more often.

184
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,240
I heard that Chief Commander Wei
and Madam Wei

185
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,190
are deeply affectionate,

186
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,780
and there are many good words
about them.

187
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,310
I also heard my mother mention it.

188
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,600
Madam Wei came from a family of eunuchs,

189
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,270
but after she married Wei Xian,

190
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,440
her family fell into disrepair.

191
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,840
Chief Commander Wei

192
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,510
is still as fond of Madam Wei

193
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,270
as he was in the past.

194
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,270
Since your mother and Madam Wei

195
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,390
are close friends,

196
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,030
does she also know

197
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,320
about the hauntings?

198
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,720
I don't know why.

199
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,390
They lost contact years ago.

200
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,720
She wouldn't know.

201
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,480
(If I enter Wei Residence,)

202
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,440
(perhaps Madam Wei)

203
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,320
(can reveal the origin of the bracelet.)

204
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,920
Wen'an.

205
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
Since Second Lady of Wei

206
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,200
wants an exorcist,

207
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,030
claim you have found one,

208
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,960
okay?

209
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,540
(Wei Residence)

210
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,980
Second Lady of Wei, excuse me.

211
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,080
(Ding Xuan)

212
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,960
She can't go in there.

213
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,910
She is my noble guest.

214
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,270
Why can't she go inside?

215
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,240
Am I not

216
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,360
one of the masters here?

217
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,120
I dare not defy you,

218
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,480
but Master forbids outsiders.

219
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,080
I can't disobey the order.

220
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't hide behind

221
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,360
my brother's authority!

222
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,080
I don't believe it.

223
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,040
Lady, calm down.

224
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,720
Your doubt is natural.

225
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,320
But please let me

226
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,150
observe first.

227
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,840
Did you use an exorcism

228
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,390
feng shui arrangement?

229
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,080
The eastern water stream
is Azure Dragon,

230
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,790
the northern mountain is Black Tortoise

231
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,600
to secure this place,

232
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,910
the southern lotus pond
is Vermilion Bird,

233
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,750
and the western winding path
is White Tiger.

234
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,320
Perfect four-guardians formation.

235
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,550
Am I right?

236
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,000
This...

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,960
Enough? What else do you want?

238
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,390
Fairy, I can let you in.

239
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,600
But we have to search for you first.

240
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,910
I don't know if it's okay.

241
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,630
No problem.

242
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,490
- Search her.
- Yes.

243
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,790
A dagger was found.

244
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,220
(Infinite Heavenly Honor)

245
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,150
This...

246
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,480
This is the ritual tool
I carried with me.

247
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,960
It's essential for ceremonies.

248
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,750
How can a fairy not with a ritual tool?

249
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,590
Ignore him. Let's go.

250
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,150
(Luckily, we investigated first.)

251
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,200
(Otherwise, I won't be able to get in.)

252
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,080
(Hui Bamboo Estate)

253
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,390
County Princess Wen'an's

254
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,390
recommendation stands.

255
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,270
Despite your youth,

256
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,440
you're clearly an adept.

257
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,790
At one glance,
you show your great ability.

258
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,910
Second Lady of Wei, you flatter me.

259
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,910
Please describe the haunting

260
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,630
in detail

261
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,150
for a proper evaluation.

262
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,200
It started

263
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,150
three months ago.

264
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,910
Originally, my sister-in-law

265
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,390
suffered nightmares for days.

266
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,200
Half a month later, she suddenly
had sleepwalking,

267
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,080
which frightened

268
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,360
the servants.

269
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,230
Madam,

270
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,280
I'm sorry.

271
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,240
It sounds like

272
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,360
she was ill.

273
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,590
Yeah.

274
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,840
At first, we thought the same thing.

275
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,390
But later,

276
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,390
she claimed to see ghosts

277
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,240
and was scared to bed.

278
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,390
My brother didn't believe in ghosts.

279
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,320
So he invited an imperial physician
to treat her.

280
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,120
But the physician
couldn't find anything.

281
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,150
He called it delirium,

282
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,790
but daily medicines

283
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,510
proved useless.

284
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,750
Why did the rumors

285
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,510
only surface recently?

286
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,270
My brother suppressed it

287
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,720
to protect

288
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,750
our reputation.

289
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,200
So outsiders didn't know.

290
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,870
Then

291
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,840
strange events began to spread.

292
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,670
It's not just my sister-in-law

293
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,550
who saw a ghost.

294
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,540
(Death)

295
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,120
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

296
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,150
(Plot effect.
No animals harmed.)

297
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,580
(Death)

298
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,390
That bloody character was written here.

299
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,720
(Death)
There are still hidden traces.

300
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
A maid nearly died

301
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,390
of fright.

302
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,630
Her family came to us

303
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,600
and exposed everything.

304
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,510
That's why

305
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,790
we couldn't hold it.

306
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,000
First to frighten Madam Wei,

307
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,630
and then expand the scope.

308
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,960
What does the ghost want?

309
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,790
Ghosts exist to terrorize.

310
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,000
What else can they draw?

311
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,840
Let's leave this terrible place.

312
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,440
It's scary.

313
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,390
Since

314
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,200
it started with Madam Wei,

315
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,790
I have to meet her.

316
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,990
Shujun,

317
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,630
our Hualang Pavilion

318
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,030
is thriving.

319
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,390
But this floor over there

320
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,750
needs repair

321
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,600
tomorrow.

322
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,030
Consort Rui, County Princess Wen'an,

323
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,790
where is Mingshu?

324
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,600
Reviewer Lu,

325
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,790
why are you here?

326
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,750
Mingshu wasn't feeling well
this morning.

327
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,200
She didn't even have breakfast.

328
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,870
I worried about her

329
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,000
and brought her some food.

330
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,230
Where is she?

331
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,000
Your concern is touching.

332
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,630
But she's at Wei Residence

333
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,480
and won't be

334
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,750
back soon.

335
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,560
Wei Residence?

336
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,750
Can we question Wei Xian directly?

337
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,390
Will he cooperate with us?

338
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,600
The Supreme Court

339
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,840
is reopening Su Changhua's case
by imperial decree.

340
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,270
As a person of interest,

341
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,600
he can't ignore us.

342
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,600
But if he makes any mistake
with his movements

343
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,000
or words,

344
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,550
we have traces to follow.

345
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,630
Brilliant.

346
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,390
Even the most cunning

347
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,120
reveal their weaknesses

348
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,630
when they are guilty.

349
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,240
But our first visit

350
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,600
may prove difficult.

351
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,600
Reviewer Lu,

352
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,630
Master remains in military camps.

353
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,920
I'll deliver your message

354
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,120
for the investigation.

355
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,250
Please leave now.

356
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,040
Thank you.

357
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,390
I'll escort you out.

(Siyi Pavilion. Hui Bamboo Estate)

359
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,040
Nanny Lyu,

360
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,240
unlike that charlatan

361
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,000
from Shangqing Temple,

362
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,510
she is

363
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,240
a true adept.

364
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Let us see

365
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,330
my sister-in-law

366
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,500
to dispel the miasma.

367
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,240
Master clearly confesses

368
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,870
that Madam Wei is too frail

369
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,120
to meet visitors.

370
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,000
No exceptions for this exorcist.

371
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,150
Please excuse me, Second Lady.

372
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,000
Could you

373
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,670
at least inform her?

374
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,960
I said

375
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,840
Master specially ordered this.

376
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
No need to inform.

377
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,230
You...

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,980
(Siyi Pavilion. Hui Bamboo Estate)

379
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,000
Who does she think

380
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,510
she is?

381
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,200
Who is she?

382
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,990
My brother has appointed her
to take care

383
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,820
of my sister-in-law.

384
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,790
She answers

385
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,790
only to him.

386
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,600
She doesn't have to listen to others.

387
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,000
See? What does she look like?

388
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,440
Let me take you to settle down first.

389
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,440
Then we'll come to ask again.

390
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,750
This is where you'll be staying.

391
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,830
(Why is Mingshu like this?)

392
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,440
Fairy Xuanqing,

393
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,920
please stay here for now.

394
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,400
Thank you, Second Lady of Wei.

395
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,310
Send more patrols

396
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,720
these days.

397
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,910
Why?

398
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,000
Haven't you heard?

399
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,590
A big character "death" occurred
on the floor.

400
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,240
Is it that strange?

401
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,080
Buddy?

402
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,350
Who knows?

403
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,400
Stay alert on your duty.

404
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,300
Okay.

405
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,240
I'll pay attention at night.

406
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,310
Why are you here?

407
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,240
I have a problem.

408
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,110
How did you end up here?

409
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,400
Sneaking in?

410
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,550
How can you say that?

411
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,640
If Consort Rui hadn't told me,

412
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,160
I wouldn't have known
that you had come here.

413
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,000
Why didn't you tell me?

414
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,400
Aren't you afraid of upsetting

415
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,140
Mother and me
by making such rash decisions?

416
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,720
What about you?

417
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,030
Do you consult me on every decision?

418
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,790
Do you never hide anything from me?

419
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,310
What do you mean?

420
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,640
I'm saying I'm an adult now.

421
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,880
I... I don't need you
to worry about me all the time.

422
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,040
Fine.

423
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,750
From now on, I won't stand in the way

424
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,790
of anything you want to do.

425
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,310
But you have to promise me,

426
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,400
no more secrets.

427
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Like this time,

428
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,790
if you'd told me earlier,

429
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,920
I would have told you

430
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,110
about the dangers.

431
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,430
Dangers?

432
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,200
I've been assigned
to investigate Wei Xian.

433
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,830
He's involved in my mentor's case.

434
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,030
If he's really

435
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,200
framed my mentor,

436
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,680
he won't spare any outsider

437
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,160
who happens to visit his residence.

438
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,960
You're in great danger here.

439
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,750
But I've heard

440
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,880
he spends long periods in military camps
and rarely returns home.

441
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,750
Besides, I have no connection

442
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,920
to Su Changhua's case.

443
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,160
Even if he knew my identity,

444
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,790
why would he

445
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,830
make trouble for me?

446
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,310
Buddy, don't worry.

447
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,590
Even without that,

448
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,750
the supernatural occurrences
in this house

449
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,200
can't be easy.

450
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,350
I know.

451
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,200
I don't believe in ghosts either.

452
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,920
When I came here,

453
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,920
I bought a dagger for protection.

454
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,220
When you are entrusted with a mission,
you must finish it.

455
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,510
I'm going to find out the truth.

456
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,400
Since I can't stop you,

457
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,110
promise to be extremely careful.

458
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,590
Madam!

459
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,000
Madam, Young Master has arrived.

460
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,400
He's waiting in the hall.

461
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,680
Qingzhao is here?

462
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,910
Let's go.

463
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,830
He must have felt

464
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,920
that he was too hard on me

465
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,750
for that commoner girl earlier.

466
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,790
You see? As soon as I left,

467
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,310
he came looking for me.

468
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,600
But it won't be that easy.

469
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,350
This time,
if he doesn't apologize properly,

470
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,160
I won't go back with him.

471
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,240
As expected, Young Master
is most concerned

472
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,080
about you.

473
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,430
Mother, have you been well lately?

474
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,480
I've been

475
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
very well lately.

476
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,070
I'm with good company

477
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,750
and peace of mind.

478
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,590
You may leave.

479
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,960
Seeing you in good health

480
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,200
reassured me.

481
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,370
I have urgent business
to attend to today.

482
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,680
I'll come back another day.

483
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,440
You...

484
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,200
Are you really leaving?

485
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,000
Do you have any other instructions?

486
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,270
I... You...

487
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,880
Aren't you here to take me home?

488
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,400
You and Madam Wei
haven't seen each other for ages.

489
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,680
You need some communication.

490
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,030
Stay here for a few days.

491
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,270
It's okay to come back later.

492
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,830
Don't worry about Father and me.

493
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,280
Fine!

494
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,020
(Death)

495
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
(It seems I have to find clues first.)

496
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,070
(Only then can I meet Madam Wei.)

497
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,640
Mingshu, are you...?

498
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,560
- Qingzhao?
- Get up...

499
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,310
I'm the Fairy Xuanqing now.

500
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,480
Don't call me Mingshu.

501
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,240
Why are you here?

502
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,240
Does my disguise look strange?

503
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,560
Adorable.

504
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,880
If Wen'an hadn't told me you were here,

505
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,080
I wouldn't have recognized you.

506
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,440
How come you're here?

507
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,480
I heard you were coming here.

508
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,030
Since my mother happens to be

509
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,030
Madam Wei's close friend

510
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,240
and she's here now,

511
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,640
I came to see you.

512
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,440
Your mother is here now?

513
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,280
Mingshu,

514
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,440
I know you always act cautiously,

515
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,350
but the situations here

516
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,350
are complicated.

517
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,350
I advise you not to get involved.

518
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,240
Qingzhao,

519
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,550
you know me.

520
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,720
Once I make up my mind,

521
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,110
I never give up halfway.

522
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,790
Didn't you say

523
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,030
your mother was here?

524
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,310
Go and see her

525
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,510
before she sees us.

526
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,000
All right.

527
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,310
Be careful alone.

528
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,780
(Wei Residence)

529
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,750
Qingmei.

530
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,880
Qingmei!

531
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,680
Bring me some tea!

532
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,920
Where's the girl?

533
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,670
Qingmei?

534
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,430
Is anyone here?

535
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,750
Qingmei?

536
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,670
Qingmei!

537
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,800
Qingmei!

538
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,510
Qingmei...

539
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,240
Qingmei!

540
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,790
Help!

541
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,790
Help!

542
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,920
Help!

543
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,150
Help! Help!

544
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,680
Please help me...

545
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,160
Please help me...

546
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,830
Who's there? Come out!

547
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,480
Are you human or a ghost?

548
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,270
Human!

549
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,880
You...

550
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,510
You're the fairy
who exorcised the ghost, aren't you?

551
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,750
Fairy, save me!

552
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,590
Please save me!

553
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,960
There's no ghost here.

554
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,870
There is...

555
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,080
There is...

556
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,310
It's all right, I'll protect you.

557
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,820
- Save me!
- I'll protect you. Don't be afraid.

558
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,070
It's okay. It's gone.

559
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,510
Wait here

560
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,350
while I look outside.

561
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,270
Fairy, don't go!

562
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,350
Don't leave me.

563
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,480
It's all right, it's gone.

564
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:35,920
Madam!

565
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,620
- All right, I'll stay with you.
- Madam!

566
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,510
- Madam!
- Madam!

567
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,840
Madam. Over there!

568
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,620
Don't... Don't come any closer!

569
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,720
Stop!

570
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,370
The house is uninhabited tonight.

571
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,720
Madam is frightened.

572
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,110
You light the way.

573
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,110
I'll support her.

574
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,520
Yes.

575
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,400
Madam has suffered a shock.

576
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,470
The night breeze is cold.

577
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,310
Catching a cold would be bad.

578
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,820
(Hui Bamboo Estate)

579
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,340
Immortal, please be mercy.
Salvation matters.

580
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,720
Madam, I have cast a protective spell.

581
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,110
The evil can't approach.

582
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,270
Please take a bath now.

583
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,440
I'll take my leave.

584
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,680
Fairy Xuanqing,

585
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,790
could you

586
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,030
stay with me

587
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,070
a little longer?

588
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,510
I'm afraid the ghost

589
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,590
will break the moment you leave.

590
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,760
I...

591
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,350
Please,

592
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,590
do me this kindness.

593
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,310
Madam, rest assured.

594
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,630
I'll accompany you.

595
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,030
Fairy Xuanqing,

596
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,440
thank you so much for today.

597
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,960
Without you,

598
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,590
I wouldn't know

599
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,680
what to do today.

600
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,240
Madam, you flatter me.

601
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,790
I've come specifically

602
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,510
to expel the ghost from this house.

603
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,310
Madam, do you know Madam Wei?

604
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,440
How could I not?

605
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,400
Wenhui, Consort Zhanghuai, and I

606
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,030
have been close friends
since we were girls.

607
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,000
Wenhui wasn't

608
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,160
like her now.

609
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,030
She was lively

610
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,680
- and cheerful.
- (Close friends?)

611
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,960
Many noblemen in the capital

612
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,570
- pursued her at that time.
- (Could she be...?)

613
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,400
But she ignored them all

614
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,510
and determined to marry Wei Xian.

615
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,310
They seemed devoted to each other then.

616
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,640
But Wei Xian was of humble birth

617
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,160
and narrow-minded.

618
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,200
Soon after their marriage,

619
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,830
he forbade Wenhui to go out.

620
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,550
Later, when Wenhui
gave birth to a child

621
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,640
who died soon after,

622
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,270
she fell seriously ill

623
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,590
and withdrew

624
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,160
from all contact.

625
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,110
So you didn't see each other for long?

626
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,550
Yaoqing and I

627
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,350
noticed Wenhui's growing melancholy

628
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,310
and confronted Wei Xian.

629
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,350
And the result?

630
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,200
Wenhui blamed us instead.

631
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,240
Out of youthful pride,

632
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,640
we stopped

633
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,680
visiting the Wei Family.

634
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,680
Why do you reconcile now?

635
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,400
How could we abandon

636
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,880
decades of sisterhood?

637
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,070
Moreover, with her haunted residence

638
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,200
and poor health,

639
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,960
I deeply regret

640
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,590
cutting ties

641
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,880
with her.

642
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,590
Your deep bond with Madam Wei

643
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,510
is admirable.

644
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,310
Such long-standing sisters,

645
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,400
especially with her illness,

646
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,830
how could I neglect her?

647
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,310
I practice both Taoist arts

648
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,070
and medicine.

649
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,310
Perhaps later,

650
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,400
you could let me

651
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,510
examine her condition.

652
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,030
If you really wish it,

653
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,510
that would be excellent.

654
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,000
Madam Wei is lucky

655
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,720
to have such a friend like you.

656
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,070
Lucky?

657
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,880
My family complains

658
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,440
that I interfere too much,

659
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,000
especially my son.

660
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,310
Now that he's infatuated

661
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,720
with a girl,

662
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
he's forgetting my care.

663
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,200
You know what?

664
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,830
Recently, he's been in love
with a common girl,

665
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,680
and he accuses me

666
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,830
of snobbery for preventing

667
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,200
his marriage.

668
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,000
I came here to accompany Wenhui

669
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,030
and to make

670
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,680
my unfilial son

671
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,240
think at home.

672
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,750
Fairy Xuanqing,

673
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,270
what's good

674
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,680
about such ordinary girls?

675
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,750
Always appearing in public!

676
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,790
I'll never let them

677
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,920
run the household.

678
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,310
What do they know about social etiquette

679
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,310
among nobles?

680
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,640
Judge fairly,

681
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,000
isn't it right

682
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,350
to seek an equal marriage

683
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,640
for my son?

684
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,640
Your words are reasonable.

685
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,110
Indeed.

686
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,400
Your words please me.

687
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,940
(Wenya Hall)

688
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,510
Madam Wei's condition seems serious,

689
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,070
but it's due to mental anguish.

690
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,790
Peaceful cultivation will suffice.

691
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,880
Mental anguish?

692
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,710
Wenhui,

693
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,830
have you suffered any new hardships?

694
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,350
Has Wei Xian

695
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,830
mistreated you again?

696
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,030
Madam Wei, where did

697
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,030
this bracelet come from?

698
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,440
What's so special about it?

699
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,510
This bracelet carries yin energy,

700
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,270
which seems to be related

701
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,640
to the haunting.

702
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,160
It was a gift

703
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,200
from my husband.

704
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,350
I think

705
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,350
it's not capital-style jewelry.

706
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,240
Do you know its origin?

707
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,510
Finding out

708
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,960
might solve the haunting.

709
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,720
After so many years,

710
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,310
I can't remember.

711
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,310
(Madam seems evasive.)

712
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,740
(If I can remove her from here,)

713
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,620
(she'll get temporary safety)

714
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,970
(and it'll be easier to inquire
about the source.)

715
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,440
With frequent hauntings

716
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,030
and a heavy evil mood here,

717
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,640
it's unfavorable for Madam's recovery.

718
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,350
Leaving temporarily

719
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
would help

720
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,110
her recovery.

721
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,270
Exactly.

722
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,350
With undefeated ghosts here,

723
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,880
how can you cultivate properly?

724
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,280
Leave with me

725
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,240
immediately.

726
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,350
Stay with me for a few days.

727
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,430
Here.

728
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,160
Master has decreed

729
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,310
that Madam must recuperate at home.

730
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,680
No one is allowed to take her away.

731
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,640
Even though you're
from the Residence of Duke of the State,

732
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,640
you can't interfere with the household

733
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,640
or break

734
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,310
Master's rules.

735
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,440
You're so impertinent.

736
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,880
Who are you to speak here?

737
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,150
Withdraw!

738
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,710
Let's go.

739
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,670
Who dares

740
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,750
to take my wife away?

741
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,790
Master, you're just in time.

742
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,000
Despite my protests, Madam Song

743
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,270
insists on taking Madam away.

744
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,240
Silence!

745
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,680
Show Madam Song some respect.

746
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,840
Withdraw!

747
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,560
Darling,

748
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,830
has your health improved recently?

749
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,720
With Ruoyi's company,

750
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,880
I feel somewhat better.

751
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,830
Get some rest.

752
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,400
Madam Song, thank you

753
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,270
for your devoted care.

754
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,720
I should express

755
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
my deepest gratitude.

756
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,920
Although your intentions

757
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,480
are good,

758
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,270
did you consider

759
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,830
my wife's wishes

760
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,510
before making your decision?

761
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,070
Chief Commander Wei,

762
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,510
are you implying

763
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,400
coercion?

764
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,470
Wenhui,

765
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,470
speak for yourself.

766
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,630
Do you wish to leave?

767
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,430
Ruoyi,

768
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,550
I know

769
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,550
you mean well,

770
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,230
but I don't want to go.

771
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,640
Wenhui!

772
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,480
I'm doing this for your own good.

773
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,680
I know.

774
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,150
But this is my home.

775
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,510
Only here can I find peace.

776
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,550
Don't worry about me.

777
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:36,840
But...

778
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,800
My wife's words

779
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,960
are clear.

780
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,510
Since she didn't want to leave,

781
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,670
as her husband,

782
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,320
I can't allow others

783
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,630
to take her away.

784
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,920
In fact, your long absence

785
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,440
might cause your family to worry.

786
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,190
I should escort you home.

787
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,600
But...

788
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,760
But I would like to stay with Wenhui.

789
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,200
Chief Commander Wei!

790
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,320
Chief Commander Wei,

791
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,630
my father does indeed miss Mother,

792
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,030
but knowing her deep bond

793
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,280
with Madam Wei,

794
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,880
he has sent me to tell her

795
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,440
that she may stay

796
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,510
without concern.

797
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,800
Exactly.

798
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,710
Wenhui, rest assured.

799
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,920
I won't leave

800
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,710
until you've recovered.

801
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,030
In that case,

802
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,670
I will respect your will.

803
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,510
This must be the Fairy Xuanqing

804
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,190
invited by my sister.

805
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,220
Greetings, Chief Commander Wei.

806
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
Fairy, greetings.

807
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,710
Our disgraced household

808
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,030
has been plagued by evil spirits.

809
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,550
We implore you

810
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,440
to exorcise them.

811
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,550
Your success

812
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,590
will bring a generous reward.

813
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,230
I'll make every effort.

814
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,480
You've met my mother?

815
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,920
She didn't bother you, did she?

816
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,550
She only knows me

817
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,000
as Fairy Xuanqing.

818
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,480
Mingshu, I'm sorry.

819
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,550
I haven't explained this to Mother yet,

820
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,110
but I'll handle it properly.

821
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,920
Madam Song treats friends loyally

822
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,030
and warmly.

823
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,760
There's no discord between us.

824
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,800
Don't worry.

825
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,600
Mingshu,

826
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,990
you're so good.

827
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,640
Then...

828
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,550
Any leads on the haunting?

829
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,880
Nothing yet.

830
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,800
The Wei Residence is heavily guarded.

831
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,230
I don't know where to start.

832
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,440
Wei Xian rose from nothing

833
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,630
to become

834
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,150
a fourth-rank chief commander.

835
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,760
He's no ordinary man.

836
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,760
Anyway, be extremely careful.

837
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,840
I understand.

838
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,280
I'll visit more often,

839
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,440
but I can't guarantee
constant protection.

840
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
If necessary,

841
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,320
find my mother.

842
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,880
No matter how arrogant Wei Xian is,

843
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,550
he wouldn't dare to hurt her.

844
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,510
Okay.

845
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,480
But remember,

846
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
never reveal

847
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,440
my identity by mistake.

848
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,680
Understood.

849
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,480
Reviewer Lu, this way.

850
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,200
Chief Commander Wei.

851
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,360
Reviewer Lu, to what do we owe the honor

852
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,710
of your visit?

853
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,280
The Supreme Court

854
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,150
has reopened
Su Changhua's corruption case.

855
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,550
Minister has commanded me

856
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,760
to question you.

857
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,360
Please cooperate with us.

858
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,320
Everything was said

859
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,630
during the investigation

860
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,000
two years ago

861
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,840
and documented in the files.

862
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,000
What else do you want to ask?

863
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,760
According to the records,

864
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,150
you first received the tip

865
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,960
about the 200,000 taels
of disaster relief funds

866
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,590
hidden in Su's ancestral tomb.

867
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,320
Did you notice

868
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,440
anything unusual

869
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,190
during the investigation?

870
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,630
After receiving the tip,

871
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,960
I carefully informed

872
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,670
the Jianglin Sub-prefect,

873
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,670
Gao Shicai.

874
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,070
Together,

875
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,590
we found the silver.

876
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,510
There were no other abnormalities.

877
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,070
Witnesses at the scene
can attest to that.

878
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,390
Records show

879
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,360
that 200,000 taels of silver

880
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,480
were needed for a dozen wooden boxes.

881
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,030
Yet Su's half-mu tomb

882
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,280
couldn't hold that much

883
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,070
without massive damage.

884
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,230
The choice of this hiding place

885
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,510
contradicts the purpose

886
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,550
of concealment.

887
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,670
Besides, your informant

888
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,710
disappeared

889
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,960
afterward.

890
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,510
With such doubts,

891
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,630
did you never

892
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,670
find it strange?

893
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,000
My duty was

894
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,070
to find Su's hidden silver

895
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,400
based on the tip.

896
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,510
Other matters are

897
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,230
beyond my jurisdiction.

898
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,710
Reviewer Lu,
you're questioning the wrong person.

899
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,880
As far as I know,

900
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,070
Su's tomb had a caretaker

901
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,190
who disappeared two days

902
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,670
before your tip.

903
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,160
A month later,

904
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,840
his body was found

905
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,360
by a river.

906
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,070
I heard that too.

907
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,480
Probably Su killed him

908
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,630
as a witness

909
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,760
to his hidden silver.

910
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,000
But this caretaker was Su's servant.

911
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,840
If Su wanted secrecy,

912
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,360
there were many ways

913
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,550
without murder.

914
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,720
Well...

915
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,000
I don't know about that.

916
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,360
Are Prince Rui and you

917
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,550
relying on such doubts

918
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,670
to reopen the case?

919
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,670
Our evidence goes

920
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,400
beyond mere doubt.

921
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,840
However, according to me,

922
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,880
all the witnesses have died

923
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,360
and the evidence has been destroyed.

924
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,070
How do you plan

925
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,550
to overturn

926
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,000
the verdict?

927
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,840
In this case,

928
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,000
we suspect that someone

929
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,190
framed Su Changhua

930
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,510
behind the scenes.

931
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,840
If so,

932
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,630
you,

933
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,280
Prefect Gao in Jianglin,

934
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,440
and Lu Zegang

935
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,480
will all become witnesses

936
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,710
in the case, right?

937
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,870
You

938
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,680
and I

939
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,240
know about it.

940
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,630
The conspirator

941
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,960
also knows this.

942
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,230
So, Chief Commander Wei,

943
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,800
you should be extra careful.

944
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,680
You...

945
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,880
I apologize

946
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,710
for any offense.

947
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,360
Since you're busy,

948
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,030
I'll take my leave.

949
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,870
Farewell.

950
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,840
General, do you think

951
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,030
Lu Chang's evidence

952
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,360
is real

953
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,760
or just a test?

954
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,190
Regardless,

955
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,150
since His Majesty has ordered

956
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,150
a new investigation,

957
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,510
we must remain vigilant.

958
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,510
What's your concern?

959
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,230
Lu Chang might plant spies here

960
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,630
during the investigation.

961
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,110
Fairy Xuanqing?

962
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,510
General, rest assured.

963
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,320
Better to eliminate by mistake
than to spare.

964
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,070
Besides,

965
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,550
Lu Chang was right.

966
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,760
Just as I had framed Su Changhua before,

967
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,280
I could now

968
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,360
testify against the mastermind.

969
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,320
The dam collapse

970
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,320
that killed hundreds of people

971
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,280
was a capital offense.

972
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,440
Given his

973
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,360
cautious nature,

974
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,710
would he leave

975
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,480
incriminating evidence behind?

976
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,000
We must prepare early.

977
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,840
Understood.

978
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,800
Madam Song, if you need anything,

979
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,230
please let me know.

980
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,710
Why bother to visit

981
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,920
this humble place?

982
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,030
I have something to ask you.

983
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,510
What are the instructions of you?

984
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,070
I've come to exorcise spirits.

985
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,910
Naturally, I'm here to catch the ghost.

986
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,840
You can go.

987
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,000
Why have you detained me
for your amusement?

988
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,720
Because

989
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,230
you're the one pretending to be a ghost

990
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,150
and causing trouble

991
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,840
