28
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,350
Your Highness,
when you go hunting next time,

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,590
be more careful.

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,150
Don't get scratched by branches again.

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,080
You are Da'an's symbol of good luck.

32
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,590
I don't want your brilliance

33
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,800
to be overshadowed by others.

34
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,030
I understand.

35
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,750
I won't let you down, Mother.

36
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,420
I only ask that
you look after your health

37
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,750
and always stay by my side.

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,910
You belong to me.

39
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,870
Don't ever leave me.

40
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,840
Your Highness, you're injured.

41
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,520
You need proper rest.

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,310
I'll take my leave.

43
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,550
Don't go.

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,190
Stay with me.

45
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,800
Your Highness,
your noble body is wounded.

46
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,560
You should rest properly.

47
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,640
I'll stay

48
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,840
by your side.

49
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,710
I demand you pledge

50
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,520
that you never leave my sight.

51
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,710
Will you accept?

52
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,030
Am I a caged bird?

53
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,000
I dare not promise

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,830
what you wish.

55
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,870
I admire

56
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,880
your blunt honesty.

57
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,560
Rest well, Your Highness.

58
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,900
(Wei Residence)

59
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,910
Madam,

60
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,480
I have a family business to attend to.

61
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,040
I'd like to take a leave

62
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,720
to return home and settle matters.

63
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,880
Nanny Lyu,

64
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,630
thank you for helping me.

65
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,800
You've been working hard these days.

66
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,420
I'll have the accounts office
prepare some silver for you.

67
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,630
Rest well

68
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,270
when you return home.

69
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,510
Thank you, Madam.

70
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,510
I've been investigating
the Wei Family.

71
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,120
Servants revealed

72
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,680
that Wei Xian had several concubines.

73
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,600
All of them died mysteriously.

74
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,680
Their bodies

75
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,680
were buried in this courtyard.

76
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,960
There is a discovery here!

77
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,680
These dead concubines

78
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,480
may be connected to Wei Xian's death.

79
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,990
Find a coroner for them.

80
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,550
In addition,
investigate their backgrounds

81
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,270
for clues.

82
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,430
Another body here!

83
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,580
(Siyi Pavilion)

84
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,310
This is a Wei Family secret.

85
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,680
Truthfully,

86
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,360
years ago, I gave birth to a child

87
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,800
who died soon after.

88
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,870
I always thought it was an illness.

89
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,950
Wasn't it?

90
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,390
After that,
I never had any more children.

91
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,360
Wei Xian took other concubines.

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,870
Not only did their children die,

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,390
but the women themselves
died mysteriously.

94
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,310
(Siyi Pavilion)
Once or twice it could be explained.

95
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,800
But every time?

96
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,000
It's indeed strange.

97
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,670
Half a year ago,

98
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,600
his latest Concubine Huang

99
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,120
gave birth to a baby.

100
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
I was concerned,

101
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,160
so I went to see her,

102
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,760
only to discover

103
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,120
what Concubine Huang bore

104
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,360
was a freak.

105
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,680
The child died

106
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,670
immediately.

107
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,920
Wei Xian went mad.

108
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,950
He killed Concubine Huang by mistake

109
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,600
and almost killed me.

110
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,270
Luckily, he found his sense
at the last moment.

111
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,600
Since then,

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,040
his control over me

113
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
got tighter.

114
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,240
So

115
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,680
those former concubines

116
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,830
all may have died at Wei Xian's hand.

117
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,870
Wei Xian must have had a secret illness.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,040
All his children

119
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,240
were born deformed.

120
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,870
To hide the truth,

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,830
he killed almost everyone who knew.

122
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,870
That's why I couldn't take it anymore

123
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,920
and decided to leave him.

124
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,160
So you orchestrated the haunting

125
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,040
not only to escape abuse,

126
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,000
but also to escape this murderer.

127
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,000
At first,

128
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,160
I didn't know what to do.

129
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,590
Nanny Lyu

130
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,950
took pity on me

131
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,190
and suggested

132
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,070
the haunting plan.

133
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,080
Could Wei Xian's death

134
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,480
be related

135
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,750
to the deaths of those concubines?

136
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,860
(Siyi Pavilion)

137
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,870
(Favourable Climate)
According to Madam Wei,

138
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,750
those concubines

139
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,120
died one by one by Wei Xian's hand.

140
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,190
He would appease their families.

141
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,630
Investigating this angle

142
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,630
might provide clues.

143
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,160
Which concubine's family
are you looking for?

144
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,630
Concubine Huang died half a year ago.

145
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,000
Her father Huang Laosi

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,070
runs a spice drink shop.

147
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,660
(Huang's Spice Drinks Shop)

148
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,170
Why is no one here in broad daylight?

149
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,140
(Huang's Spice Drinks Shop)

150
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,390
Ask across the street.

151
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,910
Take care, customers.

152
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,750
Come back again.

153
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,710
Lady,

154
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,870
your perilla drink is excellent.

155
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,270
Worthy of an old-established shop.

156
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,390
This is my husband's

157
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,400
ancestral business.

158
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,420
This shop has been in operation

159
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,390
for over a decade.

160
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,720
It's really

161
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,720
fresh and tasty,

162
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,000
unlike the shop opposite.

163
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,480
The opposite?

164
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,630
You mean Huang's Spice Drinks?

165
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,030
The owner is dishonest.

166
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,360
My mother bought two jars

167
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,630
the other day.

168
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,630
She opened them at home.

169
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,790
And the liquid stank!

170
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,750
It made her furious.

171
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,720
How old was the stock?

172
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,600
They were still selling it.

173
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,480
How can they compare?

174
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,240
We have ancestral recipes.

175
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,080
This Huang Laosi

176
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,030
is a man
who pawned his wife and daughter.

177
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,180
What skills could he have?

178
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,320
Huang Laosi

179
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,270
is so despicable?

180
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,230
Absolutely.

181
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,960
In his youth,

182
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,840
he was a thorough ruffian

183
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,440
and lived off his parents.

184
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,440
After they died, he fell

185
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,720
into drinking and gambling.

186
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,350
He pawned his wife and daughter.

187
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,200
Completely evil deeds.

188
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
He's in a bestial manner.

189
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,420
I only felt sorry
for the mother and daughter.

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,870
Where is Huang Laosi now?

191
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,440
Right next door.

192
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,280
You can see him
when you go across the alley.

193
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,260
(Liu's Spice Drinks Shop)

194
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,860
(Huang's Spice Drinks Shop)

195
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,670
I've definitely seen

196
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,120
this knot style before.

197
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,790
Nanny Lyu,
are you making handicrafts again?

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,480
This knot is beautiful.

199
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,390
This method is strong and pretty.

200
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,080
I used to tie my daughter's...

201
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,630
What do you need?

202
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
Madam summons you.

203
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,470
Let's go.

204
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,750
Now I remember!

205
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,840
I've seen this style
at the Wei Residence.

206
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,120
It was Nanny Lyu who tied it.

207
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,540
(Huang's Spice Drinks Shop)
As the lady said,

208
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,790
Huang Laosi's former wife

209
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,480
was Huang Xingzhi's biological mother.

210
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,390
(Wei Residence)

211
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,790
Nanny Lyu asking for leave now

212
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,230
is suspicious.

213
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,960
Could she be

214
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
fleeing guilt?

215
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,440
Not necessarily fleeing.

216
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,540
If she is seeking revenge
in the Wei Family

217
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,350
for her daughter,

218
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,750
she has

219
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,600
many enemies.

220
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,870
I've checked.

221
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,790
Concubine Huang who died half a year ago

222
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,440
was pawned by her father.

223
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,670
What's more,

224
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,750
that villain

225
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,960
even pawned his own wife.

226
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,440
If

227
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,600
Nanny Lyu is the mother
of Concubine Huang

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,960
and the wife

229
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,030
Huang Laosi pawned...

230
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,470
Let's go.

231
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
I need your confession now.

232
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,540
(Huang Laosi)

233
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,080
She really stabbed him.

234
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,440
Say it now!

235
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,160
I'll say!

236
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,080
I was wrong!

237
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,960
I shouldn't have drunk

238
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,510
and abused you and Xingzhi.

239
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,790
I shouldn't have

240
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,200
gambled addictively

241
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,510
and pawned you to pay off debts.

242
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,720
I shouldn't be a human.

243
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,910
I'm a beast!

244
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,480
Please forgive me,

245
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,000
Chunlian!

246
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,550
Please consider our marital bonds.

247
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,480
How dare you mention marital bonds?

248
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,270
Ruining me was enough,

249
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,600
why condemn

250
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,510
our daughter to hell?

251
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,870
I didn't.

252
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,840
Say it,

253
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,600
what did you do to Xingzhi?

254
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,080
What have I done?

255
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,670
I never meant to

256
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,910
make her suffer.

257
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,120
Although I was greedy
for the betrothal gifts,

258
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,030
I sent her off as Wei's concubine.

259
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,600
But the Wei Family is very wealthy.

260
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,080
Even as a concubine,

261
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,910
she'd live comfortably!

262
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,270
Comfortable?

263
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,840
Within a year with Wei,

264
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,790
she died.

265
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
I did my research.

266
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,750
You knew

267
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,390
she died there suspiciously.

268
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,670
Yet you took Wei Xian's silver

269
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,630
and covered up

270
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,510
our daughter's death.

271
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,600
She is also your child.

272
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,000
Don't you even question her death?

273
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,030
She was already dead.

274
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,670
What could I do?

275
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,530
Everyone,

276
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,750
Chief Commander Wei Xian was a beast!

277
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,510
He vented his anger

278
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,000
by killing my daughter.

279
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,120
In order to silence people,

280
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,670
he killed multiple concubines.

281
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,960
He also poisoned
and abused his wife for years!

282
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,680
And you!

283
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,440
You traded our daughter's life

284
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,000
for a pittance of silver.

285
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,510
I didn't.

286
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,440
How are you different from Wei Xian?

287
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,080
Don't you deserve to die?

288
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,510
No!

289
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,630
- Mingshu?
- Buddy?

290
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,720
Mr. Ying,

291
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,630
why are you here?

292
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,750
We thought Nanny Lyu

293
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,990
could be Huang Xingzhi's mother.

294
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,030
We suspected she'd come
to Huang Laosi for revenge.

295
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,120
Nanny Lyu! Put down the knife!

(Zhang's Cloth Shop)

297
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,870
Nanny Lyu!

298
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,480
It's not worthy for such a man.

299
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,200
Report to the authorities!

300
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,400
Right! Let the law handle it!

301
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,240
Don't ruin yourself

302
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,080
for a man like that!

303
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,550
Xingzhi,

304
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,510
you can rest now.

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:24,790
(Liangzhou Prefecture)
Mighty...

306
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,920
Governor Jia,

307
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,240
I have two questions

308
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,510
for Lyu Chunlian.

309
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,240
This is a case of dual jurisdiction.

310
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,150
Proceed, Reviewer Lu.

311
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,800
Lyu Chunlian,

312
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,600
did you kill Wei Xian

313
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,480
and frame Lu Mingshu?

314
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,390
I wanted to kill Wei Xian

315
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,870
to avenge my daughter.

316
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,510
But he was cautious.

317
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,240
I found no way to kill him.

318
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,120
Until that day,

319
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,840
I found him unconscious in the backyard.

320
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,750
I knew my chance had come.

321
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,440
I killed Wei Xian.

322
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,440
It has nothing to do with Lady Lu.

323
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,030
Does this concern Du Wenhui?

324
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,320
Madam is good.

325
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,680
It has nothing to do with her either.

326
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,560
Governor Jia,

327
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,150
my questions are finished.

328
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,680
Lyu Chunlian,

329
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,390
how did you kill Wei Xian?

330
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,000
Tell me the details

331
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,320
completely.

332
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,550
Wei Xian killed my daughter.

333
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,510
I longed for revenge.

334
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,150
But he was strong in martial arts

335
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,840
and cautious.

336
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,910
I was running out of opportunities.

337
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,750
Until that day,

338
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,790
he treated an honored guest

339
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,360
and drugged himself.

340
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,240
I got a chance to get revenge.

341
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,790
(Diligent Governance for the People)
Then you framed Lu Mingshu

342
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,150
and stabbed Huang Laosi

343
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,550
to death.

344
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,960
There is a lot of evidence

345
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,270
with both physical evidence
and confessions.

346
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,960
Do you confess?

347
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,000
I confess.

348
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,590
I'll accept the punishment.

349
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,030
As far as I know,

350
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,510
you stabbed Huang Laosi in public

351
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,550
and made no effort to hide.

352
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,240
You were clearly suicidal.

353
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,310
Why did you frame Wei Xian's death

354
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,440
on Lady Lu next to you?

355
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,830
Governor,

356
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,920
I didn't really intend

357
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,720
to frame her with the dagger.

358
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,440
I took

359
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
her dagger deliberately

360
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,830
to buy

361
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,240
a day or two

362
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,000
for yourself.

363
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,400
So I had time to junction Huang Laosi.

364
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,240
Originally, I planned
to surrender myself.

365
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,440
I have wronged you

366
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,030
on this matter.

367
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
I'm not asking for your forgiveness,

368
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,480
only to clear

369
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,110
your name.

370
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,240
In that case,

371
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,550
Lu Mingshu has nothing

372
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,440
to do

373
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,000
with Wei Xian's murder case.

374
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,160
I'll dismiss

375
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,240
the charges.

376
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,830

378
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,160
with conclusive evidence.

379
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,240
By the Da'an Codex,

380
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,480
I sentence her

381
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,030
to death.

382
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,240
Sentencing to death?

383
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,740
(Confession)

384
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,420
(Order)

385
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,300
(Order)

386
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,520
Transfer this
to the Ministry of Justice for review.

387
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,960
It's finally over.

388
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,800
Excuse me,

389
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,200
we'd like to say a few words

390
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
to her.

391
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,870
Please accommodate us.

392
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,800
Make it quick.

393
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,730
Nanny Lyu,

394
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,920
please tell us.

395
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,350
Who told you

396
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,550
to kill Wei Xian?

397
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,680
He ruined my daughter.

398
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,590
I killed him for karmic retribution.

399
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,350
Why would I need instructions?

400
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,280
Wei Xian has controlled
his household for over 20 years

401
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,880
without leaking any

402
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,240
unfavorable information.

403
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,720
How could you uncover the truth

404
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,400
about your daughter's death

405
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,270
in a matter of months?

406
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,750
Who helped you?

407
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,320
Nanny Lyu,

408
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,920
this is very important to us.

409
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,270
Please tell us the truth.

410
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,310
I owe you one.

411
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,160
Let me tell you this

412
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,550
as compensation.

413
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,440
When I heard that my daughter
had died unjustly,

414
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,630
I first thought

415
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,000
that Madam Wei was responsible.

416
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,240
I entered

417
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,960
the Wei Family as a servant

418
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,070
to take revenge.

419
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,200
Having served for a long time,

420
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,920
I knew the rules of the house

421
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,310
and ignored

422
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,880
irrelevant matters.

423
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,200
My only duty was

424
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,480
to watch over Madam Wei

425
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,400
as your eyes.

426
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,110
Remember your words today.

427
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,750
Fail

428
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,680
and forfeit your life.

429
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,110
I won't

430
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,310
disappoint you.

431
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,550
Later, you realize

432
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,590
that Madam Wei was also pitiful,

433
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,830
not the murderer.

434
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,800
That's right.

435
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,750
I struggled to find the truth.

436
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,550
But as you said,

437
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,960
Wei Xian's control was absolute.

438
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,160
I found nothing.

439
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,310
Master is so ruthless.

440
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,480
Who knows

441
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,920
how his former concubines died?

442
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,030
We're all unfortunate women.

443
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,830
Let's not dwell on that.

444
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,480
When I was lost,

445
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,440
a woman came to me.

446
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,680
She said

447
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,150
Xingzhi

448
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,110
had been killed by Wei Xian

449
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,440
and promised to avenge me.

450
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,800
She also said that

451
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,510
she'd find Xingzhi's body

452
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
and vowed to bury me

453
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,870
with Xingzhi

454
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,030
if I failed.

455
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,350
Who was that woman?

456
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,480
I didn't know.

457
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,350
She was dressed luxuriously

458
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,880
with a veil.

459
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,480
She acted decisively

460
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,070
and unusually.

461
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,000
She contacted me first.

462
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,110
I focused on revenge,

463
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,000
so why did I care so much?

464
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,030
It's late.

465
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,080
You can go.

466
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,510
Okay, thanks a lot.

467
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,760
Let's go.

468
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,400
It's you.

469
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,950
Nanny Lyu,

470
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,130
congratulations
on avenging your daughter

471
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,310
by killing the enemy.

472
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,550
I have come

473
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,590
to fulfill

474
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,680
my promise.

475
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,590
Thank you.

476
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,720
No matter who you are,

477
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,510
you've made it possible for me
to avenge my daughter.

478
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,000
Even if I have to become a cattle
in my next life,

479
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,110
I'll repay you.

480
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,590
Nanny Lyu, no need.

481
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,790
Our plights are similar.

482
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,750
Helping you is helping myself.

483
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,000
Now that your wish has been fulfilled,

484
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,790
I must continue to cling to life.

485
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,270
Lady, take care.

486
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,110
Su Tangli!

487
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,030
So it was you after all.

488
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,160
Are you waiting for me here on purpose?

489
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,750
Someone who would go to such lengths

490
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,790
to help Nanny Lyu get her revenge,

491
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,440
either she's shown you great kindness,

492
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,070
or you harbor a deep hatred

493
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,920
for Wei Xian.

494
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,720
You're clearly

495
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,880
the latter.

496
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,880
Nanny Lyu mentioned

497
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,350
that the woman wore a veil

498
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,350
and acted decisively.

499
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,070
Considering Wei Xian's connection

500
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,510
to your father's case,

501
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,920
I naturally thought of you.

502
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,880
So what if it's me?

503
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,840
Lu Mingshu,

504
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,550
I don't care

505
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,720
how you judge me.

506
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Wei Xian killed my father.

507
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,000
With his high status,

508
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,550
conventional methods could never
make him confess.

509
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,440
He owed a life for his crime.

510
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,960
What's wrong with killing him?

511
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,440
Using others as blades isn't new to you.

512
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,160
Do you really feel no remorse?

513
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,400
You have exploited Nanny Lyu

514
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,160
and brought her to irreversible ruin.

515
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,030
She's just

516
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,590
a grieving mother who lost her daughter,

517
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,000
not your murder weapon.

518
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,720
Who else in the world

519
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,270
understands her pain better than I do?

520
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,720
The agony of losing family

521
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,640
clings to you like rotting flesh.

522
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,320
You don't understand.

523
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,640
So don't presume to lecture us.

524
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,440
For people like us,

525
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,400
we'll gladly be crushed into dust

526
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,880
if it brings justice.

527
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,590
Lady Lu,

528
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,000
I don't blame her.

529
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,800
Please

530
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,030
stop harassing her.

531
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,400
If everyone took revenge in private,

532
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,880
everyone would be
playing judge and jury.

533
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,070
Where would fairness be then?

534
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,240
Lu Mingshu,

535
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,790
you've lost your memory,

536
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,750
so you can say these empty words.

537
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,640
If you had suffered like us,

538
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,790
I doubt

539
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,310
you'd be so calm.

540
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,910
Wait!

541
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,400
There's really nothing left
to discuss between us.

542
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,920
Unless you want to arrest me here?

543
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,430
I have no authority to arrest you.

544
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,470
I came to ask you something else.

545
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,100
Do you recognize this bracelet?

546
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,870
This...

547
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,960
Didn't your brother
or your mother tell you?

548
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,830
I'm just asking if you recognize it.

549
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,160
If you were harmed

550
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,310
and your family destroyed,

551
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,270
would you care about methods of revenge?

552
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,550
What do you mean by that?

553
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Do you know...?

554
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,150
Su Tangli!

555
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,910
No,

556
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,240
I told you before,
we don't know each other.

557
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,400
You didn't even look closely.

558
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,280
How can you be sure?

559
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,400
Women's gold bracelets

560
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,550
all look the same.

561
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,880
Why should I recognize each one?

562
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,200
You've finally become one of us.

563
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,800
No...

564
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,910
I'm not...

565
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
I'm not!

566
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,280
Why...?

567
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,790
Why would I be like them?

568
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,580
(Supreme Court)

569
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,300
(Gao Shicai in Jianglin)

570
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,620
(Crystalline Integrity)

571
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,910
Mr. Lu.

572
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,790
I know you're the one

573
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,080
behind Nanny Lyu.

574
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,800
Su Tangli,

575
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,000
I've warned you before,

576
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,160
but you still insist.

577
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,510
Your sister, Mingshu, has already
delivered righteous lectures.

578
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,750
My purpose here is simple.

579
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,510
I want to know

580
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,030
if others besides Wei Xian

581
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,720
were involved in my father's death.

582
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,240
There are none.

583
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,270
You've completed your revenge.

584
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,310
Better think about

585
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,720
your future.

586
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,180
(Crystalline Integrity)
You're lying.

587
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,240
I just want the truth.

588
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,240
That's the truth.

589
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,480
Good.

590
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,480
Since you're hiding the truth from me,

591
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,440
don't blame my methods.

592
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,300
(Crystalline Integrity)

593
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,900
(Top Scholar Residence)

594
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,820
(Prudent in Thought, Diligent in Action)

595
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,670
Buddy!

596
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,270
I heard that Nanny Lyu's case
has caused public outrage.

597
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,680
Lyu Chunlian killed
Huang Laosi in public

598
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,160
and exposed the Wei Family's secrets.

599
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,690
The news has spread throughout the city.

600
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,960
Public sympathy is growing.

601
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,030
They feel angry about this.

602
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,070
It has even reached His Majesty.

603
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,350
Nanny Lyu is pitiful,

604
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,290
but under the present circumstances,

605
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,830
can the case be retried?

606
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,840
Check this.

607
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,350
(Mass Petition)
It's the Mass Petition.

608
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,160
Buddy, this was

609
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,480
personally written by you.

610
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,680
I've already sent Ying Xun

611
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,220
to gather more people's signatures

612
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,320
and submit them

613
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,550
to Liangzhou Prefecture.

614
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
Buddy, did you write this

615
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,310
out of sympathy for Lyu Chunlian?

616
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,070
It's not only for her sake,

617
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,320
but also for yours.

618
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,960
I'm tired of seeing you sigh about this

619
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,030
every day.

620
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,480
Writing this petition

621
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,110
made me so tired.

622
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,480
How is it?

623
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:22,950
Buddy,

624
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,480
thank you.

625
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,590
Still,

626
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,680
this may not change

627
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,790
Nanny Lyu's fate.

628
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,270
The world treats women unfairly.

629
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,680
How many

630
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,790
like Nanny Lyu

631
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,960
and Madam Wei

632
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,240
are there?

633
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,880
Law is unreachable.

634
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,750
How many can

635
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,400
get help

636
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,240
before tragedy strikes?

637
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,550
My action

638
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,240
is to push

639
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,440
for a revision of the Marriage Laws.

640
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,350
We still use outdated codes

641
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,510
of the former dynasty.

642
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,310
They're full of loopholes.

643
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,240
Apart from the repudiation

644
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,680
and consensual divorce,

645
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,710
there's mandatory dissolution,

646
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,310
which deals with spousal violence.

647
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,670
There have been

648
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,110
countless such cases across the country

649
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,110
in recent years.

650
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,760
If the court succeeds

651
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,310
in revising the Marriage Laws,

652
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,830
it'll be the greatest help to them.

653
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,750
(With such a mother and brother,)

654
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,070
(what does my true origin matter?)

655
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,550
(However,)

656
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,160
(if I don't reveal my origins,)

657
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,750
(my feelings for you...)

658
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,590
What's wrong?

659
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,380
(Prudent in Thought, Diligent in Action)

660
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,320
Buddy,

661
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,480
thank you.

662
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,310
It's so good to have you.

663
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,200
You're back.

664
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,800
By the way,

665
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,590
His Majesty

666
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,510
has examined the accounts
of the Hualang Pavilion.

667
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,000
Since you took over,

668
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,400
you've used the profits

669
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,700
for charity

670
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,800
instead of extorting wealth.

671
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,470
His Majesty

672
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,700
speaks highly of you to Mother.

673
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,120
This has also earned me

674
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,550
more of His Majesty's trust.

675
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,200
Thanks to you.

676
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,430
That's good.

677
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,000
It's also a blessing in disguise.

678
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,640
Yeah.

679
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,040
When I returned to my room,

680
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,030
I found my belongings gone.

681
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,200
The servants said

682
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,150
you had ordered them moved back here.

683
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,870
But why?

684
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,880
Your Highness,

685
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,320
the east wing is leaking rainwater.

686
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,620
Repairs have been delayed.

687
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,990
I'll order immediate repairs

688
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,280
tomorrow.

689
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,770
This is the pouch

690
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,160
I embroidered for you.

691
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,360
Do you like it?

692
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,720
A gift from you,

693
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,550
how could I not appreciate it?

694
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,160
Then...

695
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,710
Since the east wing

696
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,880
is uninhabitable tonight,

697
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,920
I'll return to my study.

698
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,000
Shujun, rest early.

699
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,070
Aren't you even going

700
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,150
to look at the embroidery on my pouch?

701
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,710
Didn't you say

702
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,760
that if I had any intentions,

703
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,440
I should speak directly to you,

704
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,070
without beating around the bush

705
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,630
or using intermediaries?

706
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,430
Did I ever

707
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,230
say that?

708
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,840
A promise is a promise,

709
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,880
how could you forget?

710
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,150
But it doesn't matter,

711
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,030
as long as I remember clearly.

00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,760
I mean...

766
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,190
if you want,

767
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,880
I can make you my wife.

768
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,920
I can let you change your name,

769
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,480
start over,

770
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,120
and even

771
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,630
rebuild your entire identity.

772
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,550
I...

773
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,360
Rebuild my identity?

774
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,710
How can I forget everything

775
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,280
if my father is not vindicated?

776
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,910
Tangli,

777
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,190
Wei Xian is dead.

778
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,840
Your revenge is complete.

779
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,760
What more do you want?

780
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,600
Was there really no one else

781
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,960
